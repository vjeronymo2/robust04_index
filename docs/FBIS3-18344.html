			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sean O'Neill and George Jones report: "Ministers Clash on </F> Gagging Order"]    [Text] The future of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the Attorney  General, was called into question last night by damaging  evidence to the Scott inquiry by Mr Michael Heseltine the  president of the Board of Trade.    Mr Heseltine told the hearings into the arms-to-lraq affair  he feared attempts to withhold Whitehall papers from the Matrix  Churchill trial would create the impression of a Government  cover-up.    Mr Heseltine said he had refused to sign a public interest  immunity PII certificate -- a so-called gagging order -- until  ordered to by Sir Nicholas, the Government's senior law officer.    Mr Heseltine complained of receiving "incredible" advice  from  Government lawyers, including Sir Nicholas, on keeping documents  from the courts. And despite assurances from the Attorney  General his reservations about withholding the papers were not  made known to the trial judge. Faced with the PII certificate,  Mr Heseltine insisted on significant amendments to the text and  signed following instructions from Sir Nicholas that it was his  ministerial "duty."    But three months later Sir Nicholas appeared to contradict  that advice when he told Mr Heseltine that he had no obligation  to sign another PII certificate in a different case.    There is considerable concern among ministers and MPs over  the position of Sir Nicholas. He is seen as a pivotal figure,  who advised members of the Cabinet and other ministers over  their duties concerning the PII certificates. Even before Mr  Heseltine gave his evidence, ministers were questioning whether  Sir Nicholas could survive the inquiry's scrutiny.    Sir Nicholas, who will give evidence to the inquiry later  this month, last night issued a statement defending his actions  and saying his advice to ministers on PII had "remained  consistent." He said: "The fact that it is for the court to  determine the balance of the overall public interest was pointed  up in Mr Heseltine's Pll certificate.    "The certificate which went before the trial judge was  expressly amended after consultation with the Attorney General  and leading counsel for the prosecution."    Mr Heseltine's evidence is the most damning account yet from  a minister of the events leading up to the collapse of the  Matrix Churchill trial.    His disclosure that he eventually signed a "watered down"  Pll  certificate served as an unwelcome reminder to Conservative MPs  that the report of the Scott inquiry -- expected in the summer  -- remains a political timebomb. His evidence appears to  undermine the position of other ministers who signed Pll  certificates, including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, Mr  Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the  Social Security Secretary.    Opposition MPs seized on Mr Heseltine's remarks as an  indication that the Scott inquiry could force the resignation of  Sir Nicholas. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry  spokesman, said Mr Heseltine was the first Cabinet minister to  admit there was a cover-up. "It is hard to see how the Attorney  General can now survive. His role appears to have been to  protect the Government rather than the course of justice," he  said.    Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman,  said  Mr Heseltine's evidence had undermined all of his ministerial  colleagues, particularly the Attorney General.    "Michael Heseltine and Sir Nicholas Lyell can no longer  remain ministers in the same government. Their accounts of the  circumstances leading up to the signing of the public interest  immunity certificates are flatly contradictory of each other,"  he said.    Downing Street last night refused to comment on Mr  Heseltine's evidence, particularly the suggestion that he wanted  to avoid a "cover-up".    Officials said the Government would await the outcome of the  inquiry and then give its views. However, Mr Heseltine's  remarks are a severe embarrassment for the Government which has  always denied that there was any deliberate attempt to conceal  the truth.    Mr Heseltine, the last of the senior ministers who signed  Pll  orders in the Matrix Churchill case to give evidence to Lord  Justice Scott said he had initially refused to sign the  certificate because he did not want to deny the defendants  information relevant to their case.    The certificate, requiring urgent attention, was among a  foot-high pile of papers on his desk when Mr Heseltine returned  from a trip. Heseltine had "no discretion to waive PII...it  must be claimed."    There was also a note on the history of the case which he  read "with growing concern." The paper was marked with Mr  Heseltine's notations, underlining and heavy scoring.    The first note of alarm was a reference to decisions not to  revoke Matrix Churchill export licences and to grant new ones,  despite fears that the company's machines were going to Baghdad  arms factories.    Mr Heseltine put a question mark in the margin beside the  paragraph.    Then he read that the firm's executives were being  prosecuted, not because their exports had gone to make weapons,  but because they had lied to the Government.    Mr Heseltine wrote "Why not?" in the margin. "If the real  crime was the export of military equipment why weren't they  being prosecuted for that as opposed to the fact that they had  just filled out a form inaccurately?"    The next paragraph stated that the security services had had  links with the firm and agents had visited Mr Paul Henderson,  the managing director, posing as Trade Department officials. "I  began to be preoccupied that we knew more than the  superficialities of the submission indicated," said Mr Heseltine.    He then read that a Matrix Churchill employee had written to  Lord Howe, then Foreign Secretary, warning that the firm was  making machines to manufacture artillery shell casings for Iraq.  The letter had been copied to the Ministry of Defence, Trade  Department and intelligence agencies, but no actlon had been  taken. Mr Heseltine underlined the passage heavily: "You've got  two lots of three lines because it is telling me that everyboy  knew."    The following paragraph, highlighted with furious lines in  the margin, suggested the employee might write again, but this  time he could address his letter to the Press.    "This attracted five lines. It became apparent to me that if  this series of events unfolded I would have to go and indulge in  the process of incommunicative answers which I was not prepared  to do," said Mr Heseltine.    When he finished reading the note he decided to reject the  legal advice that he must sign. His attitude was: "Up with this  I will not put."    He summoned an immediate meeting of senior officials. "The  upshot of it was that I said I would not sign the PII  certificate before me," he said.    A minute of the discussion noted that Mr Heseltine believed  his position would be indefensible if the judge overturned the  PII order: "It would look as though he had been engaged in an  attempted cover-up and had been overruled by the judge."    Mr Heseltine explained: "I believed that if we had this  evidence it could not be right to suggest it was not relevant to  the defence. I did not know all the details of the defence case  but I did not believe It was not relevant." His position was  explained to the Attorney General and to other ministers who had  been asked to sign certificates in the case.    Sir Nicholas wrote telling Mr Heseltine that if the papers  fell into "recognised classes normally immune from discovery" it  was "the duty of a minister" to certify them, despite personal  views. After amendments to the certificate, Mr Heseltine signed.    An official note of a meeting in November 1992 has Mr  Heseltine telling Sir Nicholas that "no rational person could  say the documents should not be disclosed" and "it would have  been terrible if the defendants had gone to jail as a result of  nondisclosure."    Weeks after the judge had overturned the PII certificates  and  the Matrix Churchill trial had collapsed, Mr Heseltine was  handed a request for another certificate to bar documents from a  civil case. This time he was advised that he was not duty bound  to sign. "I was indignant," said Mr Heseltine.    Sir Nicholas was told that Mr Heseltine wanted to know how  the new advice was to be reconciled with the advice in Matrix  Churchill that he had a duty to sign.    At a meeting on Nov 27 1992, the Attorney General was  minuted  as telling Mr Heseltine that "there was not a duty in every case  to claim PII."    The inquiry was adjourned until tomorrow.</p>

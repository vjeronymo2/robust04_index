			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Leading Article: UK calling US BRITISH Telecommunications' application this week for a licence to operate an international service out of the US provides a golden opportunity to sweep away restrictive practices which keep the cost of transatlantic calls artificially high. The price of calls between the US and the UK - now 56p a minute - could fall by more than half if there were a competitive market, analysts say. Since there are about 1.5bn minutes of telephone traffic between the two countries each year, the prize of cheaper calls is well worth having. To win this prize, the US and UK will need to take bold action to open up their markets. It will not be easy, given that two years of talks aimed at achieving precisely this have made little progress. The snag is that, though both governments want a reciprocal opening of markets, their phone companies have provided them with multiple excuses for keeping their markets shut. Whenever the UK's Department of Trade and Industry has suggested opening the UK end of the transatlantic route to more competition, BT and other British phone companies have complained about discrimination against them in the US. Whenever the US Federal Communications Commission has suggested relaxing restrictions on UK companies in the US, American Telephone and Telegraph and other US carriers have pointed out that they are not allowed international licences in the UK. The result has been a logjam. So successful have the established carriers been in keeping markets closed that one wonders whether their aim has been to gain access to each others' markets or simply to protect their home turf. BT's licence application offers a chance to break the logjam. This will not be achieved, however, if the authorities in both countries continue to listen to producer lobbies instead of focusing on the wider economic benefits of competitive markets. Politicians also need to take an active interest, rather than leaving the matter in the hands of middle-ranking officials. Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK's secretary of state for trade and industry, should reopen talks as soon as a new head of the FCC is appointed.</p>

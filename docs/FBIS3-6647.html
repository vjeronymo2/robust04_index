We regard this visit as a good omen for the friendly  relations between the peoples of Laos and Cambodia, especially  between our two legislative institutions. At the same time, we  are confident that the success of the talks between the two  sides this afternoon in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual  understanding will become an important milestone and process for  bolstering and strengthening the time-honored fine traditional  relations between Laos and Cambodia.    Respected Samdech, ladies and gentlemen, and beloved honored  guests, Laos and Cambodia are adjacent countries, maintaining a  close relationship of intimacy and neighborliness. We have  rendered assistance and maintained a sense of profound  affection, intimacy, and understanding toward each other. Our  two peoples have shared similar traditions, customs, and  characteristics as well as the same fate of having been  colonized by the imperialists and neocolonialists in the past.  We stood shoulder to shoulder together to fight for a common  victory, as well as for national independence and freedom for  each country. The histories of our two countries have been  recorded with the ties of everlasting relations of glorious  friendship between our two peoples forever.    The National Assembly and multiethnic people of Laos are  sincerely overwhelmed with and have hailed the success of the  elections held by the Cambodian National Assembly. We  wholeheartedly congratulate Samdech Chea Sim for having been  elected chairman of the National Assembly and appointed acting  head of state of the Kingdom of Cambodia. To cement the  relations between our two legislative organizations and all  agreements signed by the two governments, let us mobilize the  peoples of both countries to translate these feats into reality.  As good neighbors, the National Assembly and multiethnic people  of Laos always want to see Cambodia enjoy lasting independence,  peace, stability, and prosperity and become a friend of all  countries.    On this auspicious occasion, on behalf of the National  Assembly and multiethnic people of Laos, I wish that the  Cambodian people attain greater achievements in carrying out the  tasks of national reconstruction and making their beloved  country prosperous forever.    I would like to invite Samdech Chea Sim and all  distinguished  personalities to join me in toasting the health of His Majesty  King Norodom Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia and Queen  Monique; to the health of His Excellency Nouhak Phoumsavan,  president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and his wife;  to the success, health, and happiness of Samdech Chea Sim and  the delegation; to the health of all ladies and gentlemen and  distinguished guests at this reception; and to the friendship,  solidarity, and cooperation between the two states and peoples  of Laos and Cambodia.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar drifts upwards The dollar was slightly firmer against the yen yesterday as markets, stretched to the limit of anticipation, eyed the eleventh-hour trade talks between the US and Japan, writes Motoko Rich. In the absence of any real news from negotiators, the markets gave the dollar the benefit of the doubt and bounced the US currency around at the upper end of its ranges against both the yen and the D-Mark. Against the yen the dollar closed in London at Y98.720, up from Y98.135. Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.5467, down slightly from DM1.5470. It ended in New York firmer at Y99.00 and DM1.5527. In Europe, the lira remained the focus of attention as Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet approved the government's budget proposals for 1995 and Italy's trade unions called a general strike for October 14 in protest against the pension reforms included in the budget. The lira finished at L1007 per D-Mark, down from Tuesday's close of L1006. Sterling showed some potential to test its upside against the dollar, but fell short of a real breach of important technical levels. It closed in London at Dollars 1.5784, up from Dollars 1.5770, and at DM2.4412, up from DM2.4396. The dollar maintained a firm bias against the yen throughout the day, although neither US nor Japanese officials were forthcoming with any substantial details on the shape of their trade talks, which look set to continue right up until the deadline tomorrow. Mr Steve Barrow, economist at Chemical Bank, said: 'Unfortunately for the market it has always looked like it would come down to the wire, and that is the way it has proved.' He said the market was assuming that the two sides would arrive at some compromise on most industrial sectors, and avoid sanctions. In the event of such an outcome, Mr Barrow said the markets would 'just give a big yawn'. The markets were slightly unsettled by comments from US Treasury Secretary LLoyd Bentsen, who said any trade sanctions that were imposed against Japan would be specific, rather than broad-based. Earlier, the dollar took a dip as a stronger than expected August durable goods orders figure - which rose by 6.0 per cent from July's figure - emerged from the US. It was the biggest gain since December 1992. The lira was bounced around in choppy trading as the markets continued their vigilant watch over Mr Berlusconi's progress with a budget for 1995. The cabinet's approval of the budget helped the lira to rise to L1001.5 in the morning, and although the trade unions called a general strike for October 16, they were largely discounted by the markets. The revelation by the Northern League, one of Mr Berlusconi's coalition partners, that it would oppose certain measures in the budget aimed at reforming the country's pension system gave the lira a fright. But in late trading the lira took strength from Mr Berlusconi's announcement of further budget details, which included a promise to cut the deficit by L50 trillion. Mr George Magnus, currency economist at SG Warburg, said the lira is still undervalued. 'But there is a long way to go before the lira can turn around to what most people regard as a reasonable value, around L950 to L980 against the D-Mark,' he added. Sterling attempted a push upwards against the dollar on the back of the strong US August durable goods orders. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, said traders were waiting for the pound to breach the important technical level of Dollars 1.59. 'Once the pound breaks through Dollars 1.59 or Dollars 1.60, technical traders will be asking why it does not go up to Dollars 1.70,' he said. 'While it is hard to see an independent rise of the pound, it might tally with a general weakening of the dollar.' The short sterling futures contract for December rose by 8 basis points, as recent UK economic data fed through into the markets and traders began to revise interest rates slightly downwards. Since Chancellor Kenneth Clarke raised base rates earlier this month, the futures markets have been pricing in rate increases to 7 per cent in the December contract. Analysts have said such forecasts are highly exaggerated. The December contract settled at 93.27, up from 93.19, discounting a short-term interest rate of 6.73 per cent. Mr Norfield said the rate currently priced in by the markets is still 'implausible', but that investors are slowly curtailing their expectations of rate rises because recent UK economic data have shown more balanced growth without signs of a consumer boom. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 400m and provided liquidity of Pounds 400m at established rates. Overnight rates traded between 3 3/4 and 5 1/4 per cent. German call money firmed to 4.75/85 per cent from 4.30/40 per cent.</p>

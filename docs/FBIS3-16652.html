			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS news analyst Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Members of many  parliamentary factions and parties represented in the State Duma  are ready to work on a memorandum on civic peace and accord  suggested by the Russian president. However, they have  different notions of a document and different views on its  importance. This is shown by in interview given to ITAR-TASS by  representatives of parties in the lobbies of the lower chamber  of parliament.    Gennadiy Burbulis, member of the parliamentary faction of  Russia's Choice party described the president's proposal as  absolutely neccessary and very promising. "Whatever interests  are pursued by those who are ready to participate in this  process, the idea of civic peace and national accord is highly  relevant to Russia," Burbulis said. He added that he will be  assisting the president so that this idea be implemented  convincingly.    Valentin Kuptsov, a leader of the Communist Party of Russia,  said the party is ready to take part in drafting the document.  He said it should be based on a memorandum on civic peace and  accord adopted by the State Duma in a package with documents on  amnesty. "The memorandum should be carefully drawn up and the  method of its implementation should be considered," he added.    Leader of the Agrarian Party Mikhail Lapshin said the party  will be involved in drafting the document, but it will raise  many questions, including those regarding the revival of the  Russian village, and will be watching closely that accord should  not lead to the suppression of part of society.    Anatoliy Sliva, representative of the Party of Russian Unity  and Accord, expressed extreme perplexity over the fact that the  party which, according to him, suggested the memorandum on  accord to the Duma has not been invited to participate in the  work on the document proposed by the president. But then, it is  inessential who has come up with the idea. The point of the  matter is that there is much speculation on this idea. He  believes the idea of civic peace should be down-to-earth and  should by implemented in specific deads.    Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia,  believes that civic accord in society is indispensible, but he  sees the road to it not in any one document, no matter how  exhaustive and with how many parties, its signatories, but in  achieving accord between the two branches of power -- executive  and legislative.    The opposition takes a radical stand on the matter. This was  the spirit of statements of Aleksandr Nevzorov and Sergey  Baburin, representatives of the "Russian Path" national  patriotic group, that has not yet been registered. The former  dismissed the memorandum's idea as "hypocricy." The latter said  that for the president "this is not a memorandum of accord but a  memorandum of humility."</p>

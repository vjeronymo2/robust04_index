			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol  Network in Spanish between 1403 GMT and 1630 GMT on 15 June  broadcasts approximately 42 minutes of brief recorded interviews  with leaders attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads  of State and Government in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. All  the leaders interviewed -- Spanish Head of State Felipe  Gonzalez, Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria, and Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran-Ballen -- react to comments by their Cuban counterpart  Fidel Castro Ruz.    Answering a question regarding Cuba's possible reinstatement  into the OAS, Felipe Gonzalez says: "I believe Cuba can and  should be reinstated to every institution on the continent.  However, it would be a two-way process; not only would there be  movement by the institutions toward Cuba but also by Cuba toward  the institutions. I believe I have been clear on that."    Meanwhile, Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol argues  that Castro brings up the blockade issue every time there is a  call for political openness in Cuba. Calderon Sol says: "We  want democracy and freedom in Cuba, and he has very cleverly  resorted, as usual, to a discussion of the blockade that began  during the sixties. In other words, the blockade is Mr.  Castro's excuse when it comes to the issue of freedom."    Reporters also question Colombian President Cesar Gaviria  about Fidel Castro's speech. Gaviria says it was quite similar  to past speeches. Regarding Castro's remarks concerning  democracy, Gaviria says: "Castro defends his understanding, his  concept of democracy. The rest of us, obviously, do not share  that concept."    Meanwhile, the situation in Cuba will be discussed by the  presidents today. Upon his arrival at the convention center,  Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen is asked whether or not  this discussion will hinder the normal development of the  summit. He replies: "This summit is not a simple courtesy  meeting, but a meeting to discuss hemispheric issues." In  response to a question on Castro's assertion that Ibero-America  is divided, Duran-Ballen says: "no, on the contrary, it is not."</p>

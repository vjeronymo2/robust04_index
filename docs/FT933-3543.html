			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Handshake seals Mideast deal: Jordan and Israel will today agree on framework for peace and land negotiations MR Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yassir Arafat yesterday sealed with a symbolic handshake on the lawns of the White House the greatest breakthrough in the Middle East conflict for 14 years, and pledged a new era of peace. Yesterday's momentous occasion will be followed today with a declaration by Jordan and Israel on the framework for peace talks. The agenda provides for the first Israeli recognition of Jordanian claims to land held by Israel. Similar agreements between Israel, Lebanon and Syria are also under negotiation but are some way from conclusion, although all parties at yesterday's signing are united in an effort to sustain the momentum towards a comprehensive settlement. The Israeli prime minister and the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, decades-long adversaries who met yesterday for the first time, had watched in the brilliant morning sunshine as Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, and Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO executive committee member, signed a short text outlining an agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule. Both men signed two sets of documents, laid open on the 124-year-old table on which Israel completed its first peace deal with a neighbour, Egypt, in 1979. The presidential author of that deal, the Camp David agreement, Mr Jimmy Carter, looked on smiling from the front row of dignitaries seated on the lawns. 'We who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you in a loud and clear voice - enough of blood and tears. Enough]' Mr Rabin declared to applause after the signing, in a sombre speech that evoked the suffering of Israelis throughout the Holocaust and over the decades of conflict with the Palestinians. 'The time for peace has come.' Mr Arafat, wearing a khaki military uniform and keffiyeh headdress, speaking in Arabic, replied: 'My people are hoping that this agreement which we are signing today marks the beginning of the end of a chapter of pain and suffering which has lasted throughout this century.' He said he hoped the outline agreement would 'usher in an age of peace, co-existence and human rights'. After the signings, President Bill Clinton shook the hands of both leaders, flanking him on the small pavilion built for the signing. A smiling Mr Arafat then offered his hand to Mr Rabin, who accepted it, grave-faced, to a cheer from the previously hushed audience of 3,000 guests. The Israeli prime minister had said before yesterday's signing that he would shake hands with his former foe only 'if necessary'. The rows of seated guests, some of whom had queued to enter the White House from 7am for the 11am ceremony, included the entire US Congress, former US presidents Mr Carter and Mr George Bush and scores of diplomats, lobbyists and former foreign ministers who, in the words of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, 'had toiled for decades in the search for peace in the Middle East'. Hundreds of yards away, beyond the White House garden railings, big crowds of Jewish protesters, almost all wearing wide-brimmed black hats, demonstrated throughout the ceremony, bearing posters saying 'Israel is in danger' and 'Rabin resign'. A tiny clutch of Arab opponents to the peace deal gathered a block away. But there was little to trouble the low-key but intensive security ring around the ceremony - the biggest open gathering of notables in Washington since President Clinton's inauguration. Mr Peres and Mr Abbas also emphasised the potentially historic nature of the accord signed yesterday which, although only a declaration of understanding to guide further negotiations, represents for the first time direct negotiations between Israel and the main representatives of the Palestinian people. Mr Clinton, in a speech borrowing from both history and the scriptures, thanked the many of those in the audience who had worked for decades for just such a breakthrough as yesterday's. He said: 'A peace of the brave is within our reach. Throughout the Middle East there is a great yearning for the quiet miracle of a normal life.' Mr Christopher added: 'This Israeli-Palestinian agreement cannot be permitted to fail.' He pledged that the US 'will spare no effort to enable the parties to turn agreements at the table to agreements on the ground'. Mr Clinton offered specific thanks to the government of Norway, through whose secret good offices the deal was hammered out. After the euphoria of the ceremony, Mr Peres and Mr Rabin underlined the difficulty of the task facing both sides. 'We are happy with the success, we are not drunken with the estimation of what lies ahead of us,' Mr Peres told reporters. He said both he and Mr Rabin were 'determined to continue and go ahead' with the negotiations, but added: 'For the prime minister of Israel today it was a most unusual challenge to penetrate the thickest psychological wall in the Middle East. You must understand it. It wasn't easy for him; it wasn't easy for me.' Later, Mr Clinton held an unexpected private meeting with Mr Arafat during which officials said he impressed on the PLO chairman the need to implement the new agreement as swiftly as possible. According to an aide, Mr Clinton made the point 'with some emphasis' that the Palestinians needed to 'seize the moment'. Mr Rabin and Mr Peres were expected to fly directly back to Jerusalem for the start of the Jewish New Year festival. Mr Arafat stayed on to 'work' Washington and was expected to attend more meetings today. Israel and the PLO: special reports, Page 6</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Comments by Gennadiy Shcherbakov, main administration chief </F> of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations, recorded by DELOVOY MIR commentator Yuriy Yershov,  under the rubric "Cooperation": "Russia-India: There Are  Problems. But They Are Solvable"]    [Text] We have to admit with regret that trade  between Russia and India had been steadily declining lately, and  in 1992 fell off by more than half. Last year, however, the  decline in mutual trade was halted. Having given up on clearing,  we have developed a new legal base that allows us to move to a  flexible system of reciprocal payments. The trading partners now  have a choice of the form most acceptable for them, in  particular, payments in convertible hard currency, or clearing  through barter and exchange of goods.    The main factor that determines the prospects for the  development of Russian-Indian trade and economic relations and  promises an increase in bilateral trade is the expansion of  direct ties between commercial structures of both countries. I  hope that this year the trade turnover between our countries  will increase to approximately $2 billion.    We are happy to see that more than 500 Indian companies  currently work rather actively in the Russian market. Also, in  my opinion, the companies that compete most successfully are  those that take the risk of using trade forms that are most  progressive in the existing conditions: selling goods from  warehouses, deliveries with extended payment terms, and  combining export with import.    To our chagrin, we also have to mention a number of negative  points, which lately are becoming an increasingly frequent  phenomenon. I mean shipments to Russia from India of goods of  low, and sometimes unacceptable, quality--tea not fit for  drinking, tobacco that does not meet the standards stipulated in  the contracts, footwear that does not meet the norm, and so on.  All of this, alas, causes a prejudice against all Indian goods  among Russian consumers. This is a very dangerous trend, capable  of seriously damaging our trade and economic relations. Some  measures have been taken to stop such incidents. When I was a  trade representative in Delhi, we made official representations  to India's Ministry of Trade. So far, unfortunately, there is no  change for the better.    Because of the complexity of the issue, work is dragging on  forming a system of utilizing the means coming from India as  payments on credits provided in the past by the Soviet Union.  This year we will be able to utilize more than 30 billion  rupees, or about $1 billion, to purchase goods in India and  complete payments on goods shipped to Russia earlier but not yet  paid for, as well as give Russian organizations the ability to  use the money previously frozen in the Foreign Economic Bank's  accounts.    We gave to the Indian side tentative lists of goods we are  planning to buy in India as centralized purchases. In the near  future, we expect to complete the selection of trade  organizations that will handle such purchases. A serious  obstacle in this respect is the shortage of means on the part of  Russian customers to cover in rubles the rupees received from  the state. The most realistic way of overcoming these  difficulties, in my opinion, is for Indian partners to arrange  for installment payments--naturally, on mutually profitable  terms agreed upon in each particular deal.    And one more, completely new, point in the matter of  utilizing the Indian debt. This year, for the first time, there  is a plan to sell a certain amount of state money through an  experimental auction in Indian rupees to Russian organizations  and firms for subsequent purchases of goods in India. The  mechanism for such an auction is being worked out now, but this  will take some time--as I said, this is a completely new  undertaking.    I think, however, that it is not advisable to link the  development of trade relations just to the utilization of debt.  Our aim should be to expand direct contacts between commercial  structures of both countries. There is also a rich potential in  working with Russian regions, as well as in deliveries of  machinery and technical equipment from Russia to India. In  addition, we do not want Indian businessmen to limit themselves  to trade alone, but rather to invest capital more actively in  Russia's production sphere, despite existing difficulties.    We, in turn, are ready to buy in India for rupees not just  traditional goods but also machinery and technical products, as  well as, for instance, semifinished footwear or woolen knitwear.  At this point, however, we cannot do it in needed quantities,  because the Indian Ministry of Finance has set a 100-percent  value-added tax on imported components, as compared to the 33  percent for exporting analogous goods for hard currency.  Essentially, with respect to such goods, the Russian market  found itself in a discriminatory position. I hope that this  problem also will be resolved soon.    We have to somehow untie another knot as well. Russian  exporters have two types of accounts in Indian banks--the  so-called escrow account and the special-rupee account. For some  reason, unlike the former, the latter does not allow Russian  importers to re-export Indian goods.    Of course, development of ties between us is being  constrained by unresolved transportation issues. As is known, in  the past the main flow of freight in the Russian-Indian trade  went through Odessa and Ilyichevsk. Now it is difficult for  Russia to work with these ports. Therefore, the department of  maritime transport decided to allocate two piers in Novorossiysk  specifically to support mutual shipping. True, these piers need  reconstruction in order to handle containers there.  Nevertheless, representatives in the Indian Embassy who have  visited Novorossiysk believe that, thanks to these two piers,  the transportation problem can be resolved.    As you can see, there are quite a few issues to deal with.  But all of them can be overcome--all we need is enough will on  both sides. Which, I am sure, both sides have.    This material has been prepared on the basis of the report  at  the recent seminar "Trade and Business Relations Between India  and Russia," organized by the Indian Embassy in the Russian  Federation, the Russian Foreign Policy Foundation, and the  Association of Indian Business in Moscow.</p>

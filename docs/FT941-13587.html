			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Test of time for a talking shop: As the annual economic forum at Davos gets under way, Ian Rodger asks whether the reality lives up to the billing Police units from all over eastern Switzerland rolled into the Prattigau valley in the northern Grisons last weekend. They are now tramping over virtually every Alp within 20 miles of Davos, securing the entire area as if in preparation for war. No battles are expected, but these policemen are preparing for an invasion. Starting on Thursday, a broad cross-section of the world's political, business, academic, media and arts leaders will descend again on the ugly concrete town for five days of public lectures and panel sessions, private seminars, private deal making and plain old schmoozing. The tradition of the Davos jamboree  - the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum  - started in January 1971 as a modest, one-off gathering of 444 businessmen and academics organised by the then young Swiss business school professor, Klaus Schwab. In recent years, it has mushroomed into something much grander. Presidents and prime ministers, business tycoons and media barons all flock there. This weekend, more than 100 private jets will be parked at Zurich airport and others will have to be diverted to St Moritz. What do all these people come for? Important things can happen at Davos. It was there in January 1990 that German chancellor Helmut Kohl met east German leader Hans Modrow, opening the door for German reunification. In January 1992 Nelson Mandela appeared there on the same public platform with F. W. de Klerk and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Zulu organisation, and renounced the African National Congress's nationalisation policy. The WEF also claims credit for initiating the process that led to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations which ended in December, having set up an informal meeting in 1982 of leading country trade ministers. This weekend, the Middle East will take centre stage, with PLO leader Yassir Arafat and Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres topping an impressive list of visitors from that region. There will be a pride of prime ministers: Narasimha Rao from India, Benazir Bhutto from Pakistan and Viktor Chernomyrdin from Russia. Also attending will be Chancellor Kohl and UK chancellor of the exchequer Kenneth Clarke. But despite such a glittering cast, the quality of the public seminars and panel sessions is usually mediocre, with professors and politicians merely repeating the positions set out in their latest books or legislative campaigns. Business leaders come mainly to see each other privately in a relaxed atmosphere free from lawyers, spin doctors and other hangers-on. One prominent international banker says: 'It's a great place to meet our clients but we don't pay any attention to the spectacle.' Who knows how many commercial disputes have been settled or how many prices have been fixed over the years behind the closed doors of Davos's snow-covered chalets? The great appeal of the gathering to the world's top people is the security. Thanks to the geography and the meticulous Swiss police, this is a place where even the most nervous politician or plutocrat can take off his bullet-proof vest and mingle freely. Participants also appreciate the emphasis put on networking. WEF organisers work hard to ensure that those who come are able to see whoever they need or want to see, and that everyone who has something to say has an opportunity to say it. Aside from a few formal plenary sessions, the event consists mainly of dozens of small seminars, many behind closed doors, where informality and argument are vigorously promoted. WEF officials recoil from hearing Davos called a mere conference. 'Davos is not a conference; everyone there is an actor,' snaps Maria Livanos Cattaui, the organisation's formidable managing director. Schwab, the WEF's president and driving force, says he got the idea in the late 1960s from reading Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber's bestseller, The American Challenge. The book posited that US business skills were so far ahead of those elsewhere that Europe would soon be dominated by American multinational companies. The shy but ambitious Schwab had just completed studies at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and knew an opportunity when he saw it. 'I thought, why not get European entrepreneurs together and introduce them to the best American management methods?' At the first conference, economist John Kenneth Galbraith and futurist Herman Kahn, members of Schwab's network from his Harvard days, were the drawing cards. The next two conferences flopped. Schwab muses that, having heard and accepted the new management religion at the first one, people saw no need to come again. Then came the first oil crisis of 1973. 'We thought we would change Davos into a place where the business community could meet its constituents, particularly from the political side, but also trade unionists and environmentalists,' Schwab recalls. Casting the net a little wider did the trick and the WEF has never looked back. Its membership, consisting of companies willing to pay Dollars 13,000 a year (Dollars 16,000 for financial institutions), has grown steadily  - even during the current recession  - and now stands at more than 900. On top of the annual fee, members pay Dollars 6,500 to send one person, usually their chief executive, to Davos for the conference. The annual meeting regularly packs in close to 2,000 people, comprising most member companies, 600 invited academics, politicians and senior civil servants, and 300 media representatives. Schwab has dreamed up several other events and services to keep his 80 staff busy for the rest of the year. The WEF arranges several mini-Davos-type gatherings, some about a specific country, others on regional issues, and most of them successful. Ventures into magazine publishing and an electronic mail system for members have been less so. All of this activity is organised from a crowded converted villa overlooking Geneva. Schwab, something of an intellectual snob, cultivates a campus atmosphere, with himself in the role of chancellor, coming up with ideas and acting as a self-appointed ambassador at large to the world's most influential people. He is backed by a six-strong executive board, all selected in large part for their academic qualifications. Mrs Cattaui, a 20-year veteran, is the undisputed field general, shrieking orders and shouting down dissent from a large office at the epicentre of the building. Two other middle-aged women, Macha Levinson and Colette Mathur, help keep things on an even keel. Immediately below them, three intense young men complete the executive board. Turnover at this level and below is high, because most of the work is drudgery and there is little prospect of advancement. Still, the academic environment of the WEF headquarters is one that appeals to the young multilingual postgraduates who seem to hover around Geneva. They hope that in return for putting in long hours on WEF projects they can achieve something that might have an impact on the big picture. And there is fair chance that they will. The WEF team is always scanning the globe for an opportunity to play a role on the diplomatic stage, using its independence and Swiss neutrality as calling cards. The Davos meeting of de Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi, for example, was the public conclusion of a lengthy, secret process in which the WEF, at the request of its South African corporate members, successfully mediated in the building of bridges between the business community and the ANC. But even to WEF insiders, it is something of a mystery how Schwab, a colourless and socially awkward man, manages to woo the world's great and good, and to attract year after year such a wide spectrum of people. Prestige has a lot to do with it. As one long-time observer says: 'When Schwab rings chief executives of even the world's largest companies, they tend to pick up the 'phone.' However, in the past couple of years, many of those same fee-paying corporate members have begun to complain that the WEF's political interests have become too dominant. To them, the once casual and clublike atmosphere of Davos has been destroyed by the invasion of large numbers of third-world and eastern European leaders, hoping to impress both members and the press with their pleas for aid. Schwab and his colleagues say they have heard the grumbling. The Davos agenda this weekend is as elevated as ever, with the theme: 'Redefining the basic assumptions of the world economy.' But the programme has been more deliberately focused on economic and corporate governance issues than in the past three years  - topics of concern to members. In addition, WEF staff have been ordered to concentrate on customer care, preparing personal agendas for most of the 800 or so corporate chiefs who will attend. The number of media invitations has been cut by half, and politicians have been told they are no longer welcome unless they leave their retinues at home. A similar shake-out is under way with the academic and bureaucratic star guests. In recent years, some members have felt that Schwab has gone soft on old friends, allowing people such as Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state, and Karl Otto Pohl, former Bundesbank president, to continue playing prominent roles beyond their sell-by dates. This year, for the first time, the three co-chairmen of the annual meeting  -John Bryan, chairman of Sara Lee Corporation, Lee Kuan Yew, senior minister of Singapore, and Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German Bundesbank  - are all still in office. These changes are only the visible tip of a change in WEF policy  - to go for quality rather than quantity. Belatedly, the organisation seems to have realised that it has a sound base and no longer needs to chase frantically after new members and publicity for itself. Its corporate members are a sufficient magnet to attract senior government officials and academics. Some members feel that the club is already too large, and a decision has recently been made to limit the membership when it reaches 1,000 and to become more selective. Schwab says gravely that future corporate applicants will be assessed on the basis of their global presence, their impact on the sector in which they operate, and the intellectual contribution the chief executive can make. A renewed emphasis on quality is a luxury the WEF can now afford after years of expansion. Its finances seem to be on a sound footing, although the organisation displays a typical Swiss reserve on the subject of money. Last year's report from the president records in a single paragraph that income for 1992-93 was SFr23.8m (Pounds 10.9m), expenditure SFr23.7m, with the SFr100,000 surplus raising the foundation's capital reserves to SFr3.5m. Membership and conference fees make up virtually all the foundation's income. On the expense side, WEF officials indicate vaguely that the annual Davos gathering alone eats up SFr6m. Much of this is for renting premises and hiring temporary staff, for security and for the transportation of members and guests. They claim they pay only modest fees to guests, and never to politicians in office. 'In the past 12 years, we have never paid an honorarium over SFr5,000,' Schwab says. The WEF does pay guests' travel and living costs, and occasionally even charters aircraft to fetch them, notably 100 from Russia last year. For all the complaints, the Davos gathering, much like the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations or the International Monetary Fund annual meeting, has become an institution. Top people keep coming to it because other top people keep coming to it. Schwab himself calls Davos a brand, with the implication that competitor conference organisers would be unable to undermine it unless the WEF managed it very badly over a long period. And some of the complaints about the political circus are probably a bit disingenuous. It seems that company chiefs like to be able to go home and announce casually to their colleagues: 'As Chancellor Kohl was saying the other day in Davos . . .' Many of them also like to ski.</p>

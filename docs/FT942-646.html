			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Monarch strong as La Camorra gold is poured Mr Michael Beckett, chairman of Monarch Resources, told the annual meeting that the company was in a strong financial position to fulfil its five-year strategy following the start-up of the La Camorra mine and the raising of Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.4m). The company has gold mining and exploration operations in Venezuela but is listed in London. Following the cash raising it is also traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Mr Beckett reported that the first gold was poured at the La Camorra mine in Venezuela on Friday following a two year Dollars 25m development programme. The mine, which has 400,400 troy ounces of gold reserves, is budgeted to produce an annual 81,000 ounces at an average cash cost of less than Dollars 125 an ounce. The troublesome Revemin plant reported record production and profits in the first half. Its ability to continue this depended on being able to identify new sources of high-grade hard-rock or sands.</p>

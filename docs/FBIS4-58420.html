			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 26 April  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Muslim Brotherhood Figure Reflects on Police-Islamists  War    2. Chief Editor Vows To Keep Up War Against Corruption    3. Al-Ghazali on Israel's Economic Supremacy    4. Islamist on Human Rights Violations in Jails    5. Editorial Calls For Driving Out Foreign Forces From  Sinai    6. Opinion Poll Shows Shari'ah Can Cure Armed Violence    7. War Against Corruption  <H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD FIGURE REFLECTS ON POLICE-ISLAMISTS WAR </H5>   In a 3,000-word article on page 5, Muslim Brotherhood figure  Dr. Ahmad al-Malat reflects on the "quagmire of bloodletting on  the good Egyptian soil," between policemen who carry out  officials' orders and young people who went astray. He remarks  that: "The greatest disaster ever is that the bloodletting  persists in the form of mutual vendetta, continuing executions,  indiscriminate killing that makes no distinction between the  innocent and the guilty, and the insistence on violence as the  only approach against both policemen and young Islamists."    Although we are pleased to see the policemen doing their  noble duty of safeguarding the homeland's and the citizen's  peace, we certainly disagree with them on the way they perform  this duty because man is entitled to certain rights that should  be preserved, he says. To explain this, he states that "mass  arrests that make no distinction between the innocent and the  guilty are prohibited and torturing and humiliating them is  prohibited." He adds that mere suspicion does not provide  enough justification for the police to do whatever they want  unless they rely on that "repulsive emergency law, for which  there is no equal in terms of cruelty, severity, and longevity  elsewhere, except in this afflicted country."    Referring sarcastically to the 23 July 1952 revolution and  its leader, Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, he says: "Dead and buried, the  so-called blessed revolution has left the Egyptian people a  heritage of humiliation and denigration, forcing them to walk in  the shadow of the sole, inspired ruler and to worship in his  temple rather than in the mosque of Islam."    Al-Malat contends that "certain police groups" have  committed  themselves to fighting anything Islamic in nature. He notes  that Muslim Brotherhood founder Imam Hasan al-Banna was  assassinated by the guards of King Faruq of Egypt.    He cites an interview with a former interior minister's  assistant, which the magazine LIWA' AL-ISLAMI published in its  April edition, in which he talks about police violence during  interrogations.    Moving to another point, al-Malat states that a "fierce war  was launched against preachers" for fear that they might refute  secularist claims. Some of the victims of that war, he says,  were Shaykh Kishk, Shaykh Ahmad al-Mahallawi, and Shaykh 'Umar  'abd-al-Kafi. He says that the police silenced hundreds of  those preachers and replaced them with men who do not even read  the Koran properly.    Promising the "second part" of his article on Tuesday, 3  May,  al-Malat concludes with the Koranic verse 2-114: "And who is  more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship  of God, God's name should be celebrated? Whose zeal is to ruin  them? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them  except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in this  world, and in the world to come an exceeding torment."  <H5>  CHIEF EDITOR VOWS TO KEEP UP WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION </H5>   The newspaper's chief editor, Majdi Ahmad Husayn, writes in  his 2,000-word article on page 5 that "official complaints  against AL-SHA'B continue in an obvious attempt to dissuade it  from keeping up its determined line to fight corruption." He  vows that the paper will not shift an inch from its position in  spite of the scores of interrogations and the four cases filed  against it. "It has become clear to all that it is not a matter  of slander or defamation on the paper's part, but an attempt to  silence every free and candid voice," he says.    Noting the complaint the chairman of the Suez Canal  Authority  filed against the paper, he says that the authority chairman  does not care about the billions of pounds the authority loses  every year through human error, mismanagement, and fraud and  only wants to defend himself and silence AL-SHA'B.    Citing the Japanese and U.S. experience, Husayn stresses  that  issues involving public funds should be discussed in public.    In conclusion, he writes: "There is no time for playing  games. If this nation is to be rescued from its ordeal, the  heads of corruption must be amputated and society must be  cleansed. To do that, we have to pay the price and make  sacrifices."   <H5>    AL-GHAZALI ON ISRAEL'S ECONOMIC SUPREMACY </H5>   In his 400-word column on page 12, Muhammad al-Ghazali  quotes  Israel's founder, Ben-Gurion, as vowing that Israel would  conquer Arab states with military supremacy, and if that was not  possible it would conquer them with economic supremacy. He  states that "Solomon's jinns" work around the clock to perfect  the peace and war industry and that their products have invaded  world markets. He admits that the Israeli skill in civilian and  military production is not surprising because the plan to set up  greater Israel is based on "a hardworking people who sweat in  the field while neighboring, smooth-handed people indulge in  luxury and their young men are deprived of firm religious  guidance."    Al-Ghazali notes that the Jewish experience in highly  productive farming is being offered to Egypt, a country that has  farmed the land for 50 centuries and to which the Jews fled tens  of centuries ago to escape poverty and famine. He wonders what  has happened to Arabs and Egypt to make them fail to exploit  their lands and double their wealth. He affirms that the  Egyptian youth are idle wealth and paralyzed talent who could  surpass Jews if they were given the chance. He notes that  deserting Islam has led to all this.    Noting the killing of 16 "fundamentalists" near an Arab  capital, he says: "We are only strong when we fight among  ourselves as we compete for worldly luxury. But the distance is  long between us and God's book and his prophet's tradition."  <H5>  ISLAMIST ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN JAILS </H5>   Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus' 500-word column on page 12 states  that the "violation of human rights is the major defect in Husni  Mubarak's regime," which commits the most despicable acts  against inmates in the al-'Aqrab, the scorpion, jail south of  Cairo.    He affirms that inmates in that prison are held in cells  resembling cemetries and that they never see the sun. He adds  that visits by family members, newspapers, letters, sports,  bathing, airing of blankets, and going out of the cells are  prohibited in that place. On top of all that, inmates are  regularly insulted and humiliated, he adds, noting that this  prison is a mark of disgrace on the regime. He finally calls on  the authorities to wake up before it is too late.  <H5>  EDITORIAL CALLS FOR DRIVING OUT FOREIGN FORCES FROM SINAI </H5>   A 400-word editorial on page 1 commemorates the 12th  anniversary of Sinai's liberation and notes that U.S. forces,  "better known as the multinational forces," are still present in  Sinai. The editorial asks when these forces will leave and  calls on all national powers to drive these forces out of Sinai.  It calls on the government to use the Armed Forces to exploit  the area.  <H5>  OPINION POLL SHOWS SHARI'AH CAN CURE ARMED VIOLENCE </H5>   A 200-word report by Ahmad al-Siyufi on page 1 says that an  opinion poll on armed violence conducted by the National  Dialogue Committee at Asyut University has shown that 62.27  percent of university professors attribute violence to economic  and social causes, widespread corruption, the conduct of the  security forces, and insufficient religious education. The  report says that 37.8 percent of professors attribute violence  to foreign elements.    The poll showed that 73.4 percent believe that the  application of shari'ah is the right cure for violence.    Asked about the causes of sectarian strife, 31.9 percent  said  the cause was foreign elements, 35 percent said it was the  incorrect understanding of religion, 8.4 percent said it was the  feeling of being persecuted, and 24.7 said it was the failure to  apply shari'ah.    The poll showed that 88 percent of professors believe that  the existing parliamentary institutions do not represent the  people properly, while 5.7 percent believe they do.  <H5>  WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION </H5>   A 2,000-word report by 'Imad Mahjub on page 2 cites a report  by the Central Accounting Organization on the abuse of public  funds in Aswan Governorate, where a total of 635,249 pounds of  the governorate's budget and the local development fund were  spent on "guests" between January 1992 and May 1993.    The report claims that Aswan Governor Salah Misbah used the  development fund to buy gifts and entertain and accommodate  guests at five-star hotels. The prime minister's private  secretary was among these guests. Her birthday party at the  Cataract Hotel in February and her golden birthday gift were  financed by public funds. Other "guests" are mentioned in the  report.    A 3,000-word report by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman on page 2  gives  an account of the "crimes" AL-SHA'B reporters have been accused  of committing against the Suez Canal Authority and its chairman.  Of these, he cites reports published earlier about violations  in the Suez Canal expansion project, the electric control  project, and the shipyard project. He promises to submit  documents proving these violations to the attorney general.    A 1,500-word report by 'Ali al-Qammash on page 3 writes  about  Nabil Mishriqi, better known in the press as Madinat al-Nasr  Shark, who is getting special treatment in jail. He wears  civilian clothes, strolls freely around the court, and even runs  his business from his "five-star" prison cell.    A 2,000-word report by 'Amir 'Id on page 3 writes about  corruption in the North Alexandria Mills Company.    A 1,500-word report by Mahmud Bakri on page 3 deals with  "big  sharks" who seized 45,000 feddans [1.038 acres] of the most  fertile arable land with the help of officials.</p>

The hotel complex is part  of Huntington Beach's multimillion-dollar plans to redevelop its decayed  downtown. A new commercial complex, called Pierside Pavilion, at Main Street  and Pacific Coast Highway, is scheduled to officially open in September.  Pierside Pavilion will have an assortment of movie theaters and restaurants to  complement the new hotels four blocks away.  </P> <P> Bone said all 300 rooms in the Hilton have ocean views. Room prices range from  $165 to $275 a night, but suites on the upper floors will rent for as much as  $1,200 a night.  </P></p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Eurosport to try again THE Eurosport consortium said yesterday it hoped to have the satellite sports channel back on the air before the end of this month, writes Raymond Snoddy. Eurosport and TF1, the French channel, decided yesterday to try to create a new financial structure. The channel went off the air on Tuesday after refinancing was not completed in time. The decision to try again was influenced by a supportive statement by the European Commission. Earlier, Brussels ruled that the original structure of the consortium - a 50-50 joint venture by 17 of Europe's public service broadcasters and News International - was anti-competitive.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (6): Banks breathe a sigh of relief / Profile of Loukas Papademos The battle lines were already drawn when Loukas Papademos took over last month as Greece's central bank governor. Mr Papademos, 46, found himself unexpectedly promoted from deputy governor to replace Yannis Boutos, a political appointee who ran the Bank of Greece for less than a year. Mr Boutos, a former economy minister, was sacked by the governing socialists in a dispute over privatising the Bank of Crete, controlled by the central bank since a Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal was uncovered there in 1988. Greece's banking community breathed a collective sigh of relief when Mr Papademos's appointment was announced. A former Columbia University economics professor who joined the central bank a decade ago as a macro-economic adviser, he has remained aloof from the quarrels souring relations between the bank and government policy-makers in recent years. Mr Papademos agrees with the economy ministry on expediting the Bank of Crete disposal, by splitting off its non-performing assets and offering the remainder, including an extensive branch network, for sale. The bank moved into the red last year, posting losses of Dr1.2bn, and concern is growing over a rising percentage of bad loans. More difficult is the task of persuading the finance ministry, burdened with funding a rising public debt, that it cannot afford more than a marginal decline in interest rates on government paper if the drachma is to remain stable. As recession continues, some socialist officials are pressing for substantial interest rate cuts in the next few months. Mr Papademos says firmly that the course of interest rates 'must depend on inflation developments, conditions in foreign exchange markets and progress in meeting monetary targets'. As the architect of the central bank's successful defence of the drachma following the removal of capital controls last May, Mr Papademos's views should carry considerable weight. To deter speculative attacks on the currency, short-term interest rates were raised to high levels, while the Bank of Greece controlled liquidity by auctioning drachmas to commercial banks in return for foreign exchange. Mr Papademos is well aware that a smooth relationship between the central bank and the finance ministry, which sets interest rates on treasury bills and recently assumed overall responsibility for debt management, is crucial to maintaining confidence in the drachma. He points out that the cost of financing Greece's public debt could be reduced by developing the market in government securities 'introducing auctions of treasury bills and promoting a secondary market in government paper'.</p>

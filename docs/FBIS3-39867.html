			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara--Turkey's countdown to the March 27 local  elections has recently been overshadowed in the Southeast by a  massive crackdown by security forces on one of the strongest  local candidate targets.    Party sources said on Tuesday [15 February] that more than  100 members of the Kurdish-based Democracy Party (DEP) had been  detained in the troubled region and that those arrested included  some of DEP's possible mayoral candidates.    DEP deputy Sedat Yurttas said that although Turkey could  claim that the elections were legal, it could no longer defend  the legitimacy of the elections due to recent developments. The  campaign on the DEP was launched late last week with  possible--or rumored--mayoral candidates from the party being  arrested by security forces. DEP spokesman Remzi Kartal told  journalists on Monday that he suspected this was a systematic,  organized campaign to prevent the DEP from entering the  elections. Kartal explained that all three of the potential  mayoral candidates of the DEP in Diyarbakir had already been  detained.    The same day, security forces cracked down on groups of DEP  members in Urfa's township of Viransehir, Malazgirt, Malatya,  Diyarbakir and Istanbul.    Party officials said at least 30 people were detained in  Diyarbakir while 60 more were taken into custody in Viransehir.  Among those detained were four provincial party officials.  Statements issued by DEP headquarters in these cities also  claimed that a campaign was underway to prevent them from  entering the elections. Several houses owned or rented by DEP  executives were raided in Istanbul and their occupants were  placed under arrest.    Kartal claimed that "they are trying to put us in a  situation  where we cannot enter the elections."    Meanwhile, attacks on the DEP, which a majority of Turks  accuse of supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)  have also increased. In the past months, several DEP buildings  have been bombed. Monday night, the party's Ankara headquarters  was also bombed. Last week, its general-secretary, Murat Bozlak  was shot in Ankara. At least 50 DEP-affiliated activists,  including a parliamentarian from Mardin, have been killed since  1991.    The DEP believes the reason behind the recent campaign is to  block its candidates and terrorize the people of the Southeast  to prevent them from voting for this party. It also argues that  raids on houses of its members in western parts of the country  are due to Turkey's own concern that the party is strengthening.  But security officials argue there is evidence to prove that,  on many occasions, the DEP cadres under investigation have  active links with the PKK and the party not only supports this  organization but at times facilitates its activities.    Many of the raids in Istanbul, for instance, are in areas in  which the DEP claims to be strengthening its public support, but  where armed activities of the PKK have been concentrated.    On Tuesday, the mass circulation Turkish daily HURRIYET  reported on its front page that security forces had monitored  orders given by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to the DEP whereby he  demanded that the party withdrew from the elections. There are  currently claims that the DEP is preparing, under instruction  from the PKK, to boycott the elections altogether and boost its  propaganda drive in Europe to cast doubts on the legitimacy of  the results.    The DEP is seen as the most likely winner of local elections  in the Southeast, not only due to popular support but to threats  issued against the local population by PKK militants. Its major  opponents appear to be the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) of  Necmettin Erbakan and the paramilitary guards. Village guards  are proposing their own tribal chiefs as candidates against the  DEP--and the PKK.    If the DEP boycotts the elections, the recent round of  persecution of its members and executives is to be used for  propaganda purposes. The party's deputies are currently  campaigning in Europe to bring 200 foreign observers to Turkey  in March.    There are also unconfirmed reports that the pro-Kurdish  OZGUR  GUNDEM newspaper, a supporter of the DEP, plans to close down at  about the same time in order to give the image that Kurdish  rights and activities are being systematically banned in Turkey.    OZGUR GUNDEM, which had closed due to financial reasons in  the past, is reportedly suffering financial problems again and  has found it difficult to pay personnel salaries for the past  three months.</p>

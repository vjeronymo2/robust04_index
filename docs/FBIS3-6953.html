The message said that the  fugitive terrorists had not left the country but were still  hiding in Thailand. It has also been found that the group has  shifted their objective from the targeted embassy to  assasination attempts against high-level officials of that same  embassy. "Major targets are high-level officials of the U.S.  and Israeli Embassies, as well as those at the Pakistani and  some other embassies," the source said.    The source also revealed that U.S. and Thai intelligence  authorities found that, on the day the terrorist abandoned the  truck, he left a black James Bond briefcase on the truck. It is  believed the briefcase contained some important documents. But  the case disappeared during the time the truck was parked near  the Lumphini police station. The Police Department and the  Metropolitan Police Division have already set up a committee to  investigate how the briefcase disappeared.    However, police officials at the Metropolitan Police Office  declined to discuss this with reporters. They said they were  not authorized to give information to newsmen, and that  reporters should ask the police director or the metropolitan  police commissioner if they want information.    Meanwhile, Police Colonel Suraphon Thongprasoet of the  Special Branch Police called an urgent meeting of Special Branch  police officials in charge of security for important persons,  especially those from diplomatic missions. The non-stop meeting  on 21 March began at 0900 and ended at 1430. A police inspector  reported that there was an instruction at the meeting that  security be stepped up for 24-hour protection of officials and  important persons at foreign embassies. There will be an  increase in the number of security officials guarding residences  of ambassadors as well as embassies, especially the Israeli and  U.S. Embassies. The Thai police will maintain around-the-clock  coordination with the U.S. intelligence service.    An officer of the Metropolitan Police in charge of security  protection for important persons told newsmen that police  officials had been assigned to guard important premises and  residences of important persons, particularly foreign embassies.  The Metropolitan Police will guard the outside areas of the  compound whereas the Special Branch Police will provide security  at the residences of ambassadors and foreign embassies.</p>

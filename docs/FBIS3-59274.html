At the top is the Ministry of Finance; at the  second level, the finance departments of provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities directly under the central  government; at the third level, the finance offices of counties,  municipalities, autonomous counties, and districts directly  administered by municipalities; and at the fourth level, the  finance departments of townships and towns. Of these four  levels, the last three make up local public finance, the  foundation of the national financial system. If we compare  public finance at the national level with local public finance,  we readily see that the latter is a pillar of national public  finance. Through their operations, local financial management  regulates and controls the workings of the economy at the local  level and provide financial backing for both central and local  governments in the discharge of their responsibilities. Now that  the 14th CPC National Congress has called for the creation of a  socialist market economy, local public management plays an even  more important role. Thus correctly understanding the principles  of local finance is enormously significant for straightening out  the financial relations between the center and the localities  and promoting national economic development.    These are the basic characteristics of local financial  management:    Characteristic one: Local financial management is the main  force in national financial management.    Statistics show that not only do revenue and expenditure at  the local level account for the lion's share of all revenue and  expenditures in the nation numerically (exceeding 60 percent in  most cases) but they also make up a steadily rising portion of  all national revenue and expenditures. In China, total  government revenue consists of three components: revenue  collected by the central government, revenue collected by local  governments, and national debt income. After adjusting for the  factor of national debt income, we see that revenue collected by  local governments has consistently exceeded 66 percent of total  government revenue, often by as much as 6 percentage points.  (See Table 1, Row III.) This highlights the remarkably  outstanding role played by local revenue in revenue collection.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

For a long time in the past, local governments collected  more  in revenue than what they spent, as Table 2 indicates.    In Table 2, the period 1963 to 1965 is not comparable with  other periods because of the dissimilar duration. In these three  years, revenue exceeded expenditures 39.32 billion yuan, or  13.11 billion yuan per year on the average. For a five-year  period, the combined surplus would have been 65.53 billion yuan.  So we can conclude that from the First Five-Year Plan through  the fourth, the broad trend was for local revenue to exceed  expenditures by a steadily widening margin. However, beginning  with the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the surplus in local finance  started to shrink so much so that by the Seventh Five-Year Plan,  it was replaced by a 26.95 billion yuan shortfall.     Table 2. Local Revenue and Expenditures: A Comparison (Units: billion yuan)   Period          First        Second       1963-1965    Third        Fourth       Fifth        Sixth        Seventh                  Five-Year    Five-Year                 Five-Year    Five-Year    Five-Year    Five-Year    Five-Year                  Plan         Plan                      Plan         Plan         Plan         Plan         Plan   Revenue minus   39.13        44.91        39.32        75.84        159.4        152.89       118.63       -26.95  expenditures      One important reason for the deterioration in the local  budgetary situation is national financial reform that replaced  "eating from one stove" with "eating from separate stoves." The  central government has delegated to the local authorities a  measure of financial power but also entrusted them with  additional responsibilities. In other words, even as local  authorities collected more in revenue, their spending also went  up. When spending increased faster than revenue, the excess of  revenue over spending began to diminish, perhaps even to the  extent of turning a surplus into a deficit. As a matter of fact,  the size of the surplus began shrinking in the latter part of  the Fifth Five-Year, that is, after 1979, exactly the point at  which China embarked on full-fledged economic management reform  following the 3d Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee and  localities began experimenting with the  "eating-from-separate-stove" system. In this sense, therefore,  that revenue at the local level did not outgrow expenditures as  much as it used to is justifiable.    However, we must see that local revenue plunged relative to  expenditure after the Seventh Five-Year Plan, even falling into  negative territory. After 1988, in particular, the local budget  deficit really took off (see Table 3), approaching or overtaking  the budget deficit at the national level in some years, a  situation that is clearly unjustifiable. There are four reasons  for this state of affairs. 1) The contract system between the  state and enterprises has put a tight lid on local government  revenue. 2) Local general financial contracting, which began in  1988, not only prevented central government revenue from rising  at the same pace as local revenue, but also encouraged the local  finance departments to calculate income based on institutions.  When its share of the income derived from organizations, or  institutional income is insufficient to meet local needs (but is  high enough to affect the issue of subsidies by the finance  department at the higher level), a local government may cut  taxes or defer tax payment in order to keep local wealth local.  3) The practice of fixing base figures virtually encourages the  localities to minimize revenue collection while maximizing  expenditures to avoid a situation in the future in which they  would be stuck with a high income base figure and a low spending  base figure in the event of a change in system, which would work  to their disadvantage. 4) The economy has not been performing  too well lately and has yet to emerge completely from the  doldrums. And then there is inflation, which causes a shortfall  in local government revenue, on the one hand, and sharply rising  outlays, on the other.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

For years the national government has been running a  deficit in its budget, which keeps going up relentlessly: 12.12  billion yuan in the Sixth Five-Year Plan; 46.07 billion yuan in  the Seventh Five-Year Plan; 20.27 billion yuan in 1991, which  fell within the Eighth Five-Year Plan; and 23.75 billion yuan in  1992. For 1993, the budget deficit is projected to top 20  billion yuan as well. It should be said that the current  budgetary situation is still not ideal. After the drive in 1990  to improve the economic environment and rectify the economic  order, in particular, the national economy entered a phase of  growth, yet the budget deficit has stubbornly refused to budge.  The objective demand is that the local authorities help the  central government balance its budget. In recent years, however,  local financial units have not been collecting enough revenue to  cover their own expenses. Among county-level financial units,  especially, operating in the red is most common. (Units running  a deficit account for about half of all budgetary units at the  county level.) Local financial units are not currently  authorized to change tax rates, levy new taxes, or issue bonds,  not to mention overdrawing from the bank. Hence the budget  deficit, which effectively means tapping into special funds and  overdrawing from one's account, thereby disrupting the normal  functioning of the economy. Working through their local people's  congresses, many localities have even legalized their deficits,  to the detriment of the effort to balance the budget at the  national level. We should take note of these problems.    Characteristic three: Emphasis in local public finance on  institutional income.    We can distinguish between institutional income and  noninstitutional income. Noninstitutional income refers to the  income derived by finance departments at all levels as a result  of their participation in social product and labor distribution  by virtue of their state power. Such income is created before  the budgetary appropriation and distribution process and is at  the disposal of the Ministry of Finance. Institutional income  refers to the income at the direct disposal of finance  departments at all levels after the budgetary appropriation and  distribution process. Noninstitutional income is an important  prerequisite for institutional income while institutional income  is in inevitable extension of noninstitutional income in the  budgetary appropriation and allocation process. The reason is  that without institutional income, there would be no  distribution basis for the budgetary allocation of incomes and  expenditures. On the other hand, what a local finance agency  collects in revenue often is not the same thing as revenue that  it is free to keep for its own use. Some units collect a good  deal of revenue but retain only a small portion for their own  use, while just the opposite happens in other units. The  budgetary process requires that a unit which collects more in  revenue than what it spends turn over an appropriate share of  its revenue to the higher authorities, forming revenue turned  over to the higher authorities for the latter's disposal. A unit  that spends more than what it collects in revenue will be given  a certain amount of subsidy by the higher authorities, forming a  subsidy income. In this way noninstitutional income is converted  into institutional income through distribution within the  financial system.    Against the backdrop of "eating from separate stoves," it is  clear that as far as local finance agencies are concerned, only  institutional incomes are real incomes. While they attach  importance to noninstitutional incomes, therefore, most of them  take institutional incomes even more seriously. One of the key  missions of national financial management is to ensure an  adequate income (essential to the discharge of duties and  responsibilities by the central government) for the state  coffers, that is, noninstitutional income, through the pursuit  of institutional incomes by local governments. Only by clearly  understanding the laws governing the amount of institutional  incomes at the local level and its growth can we develop a sound  distribution relationship between the finance agency at the top  and its local counterparts. Since reform has been under way,  China adjusted the local financial system rather extensively in  1980, 1985, 1988, and 1992. Every round of adjustment was well  suited to the circumstances at the time and has enriched our  experience with the financial management system of "eating from  separating stoves." Nevertheless, we must also realize that  establishing a sound local financial management system is a  highly complex piece of systems engineering. It requires an  appropriate degree of stability, yet the local financial system  is open to influence by a host of internal variables (the scale  and structure of economic development, the scale of government  spending and the mix of expenses, and changes in the fiscal  policy) and external variables (price changes, changes in other  management systems). If we are just a tad careless, some  localities may end up with too much financial power while others  may have too little, putting national financial management in a  passive position.    Characteristic four: To a certain extent deficit budgeting  is  forced upon the localities.    On the one hand, deficit budgeting is forced upon the  localities by institutional shortcomings. In a basic sense, a  locality cannot balance its budget if the local economy is not  developed enough. But we also must see that the financial system  has a major impact on revenue and expenditures. To begin with,  errors in the revenue management system may turn a surplus in  many a local budget into a deficit. In some areas, for instance,  revenue used to exceed expenditures. Then came a system of  turning over revenue to the higher level at sharply escalating  rates, which slowed revenue growth relative to the increase in  expenditures until the surplus finally was replaced by a  deficit. At the spending end, moreover, there may be loopholes  in the management system which also could turn a surplus into a  budget deficit. Take, for instance, the practice of using a base  number to establish a spending base level. A locality with  relatively modest expenses in the base year would end up with a  contact spending base number that is quite low, while another  locality with substantial expenses in the base year would end up  with a contract spending base number that is higher. Suppose  these two localities are similar in every other aspect, but just  because they differ in the contract spending base number, their  spending burden in years to come would also be different. The  burden on the former will be a little heavier; on the latter, a  little lighter. Those which are overburdened may run a deficit.  Furthermore, the fact that financial power and responsibilities  are not clearly divided among the various levels has also forced  some localities into the red. For one thing, there is irregular  enterprise transfer. Many localities are only too keen to take  care of profitable enterprises while dumping unprofitable ones  on the lower level. As a result, many local governments at the  lower levels had their "plums" taken away from them but found  themselves saddled with new baggage. Although enterprise  transfer did include some adjustment of financial power by the  higher levels, in most cases adjustment only took care of the  immediate, not the long run, making a budget deficit inevitable.  In some cases, the "higher level comes up with the policy and  the lower level writes the check." Some areas were already  shouldering a heavy burden to begin with. After the higher level  unveiled the policy of increasing subsidies to reward growth,  they either dragged their feet (which is hard to do) or went  along reluctantly, which inevitably led to deficit budgeting.  Moreover, tax levying was overly influenced by the tax  collection plan, instead of following the tax code fully. As  presently constituted, the tax collection plan does not take  into consideration all the factors in a comprehensive way, but  mainly uses the revenue level a year ago or for the past several  years as the bench-mark. The natural outcome is a substantial  gap between the amount of planned revenue and the amount of  revenue that would be collected if the tax law is followed. When  the former is smaller than the latter, tax departments would cut  taxes or defer tax payment in an unprincipled way, which may  push a local budget into the red unnecessarily.    On the other hand, the budget deficit is forced upon the  locality by the lack of variety in revenue-raising methods. On  the national level, the state can try to balance its budget in a  host of ways. On the revenue side, it can enhance its regular  income by making laws and policies and boost its irregular  revenue by borrowing against the national debt, making  overdrafts at banks, and borrowing from localities. Local  governments, in contrast, basically must fall back on  institutional income to balance their budgets; there is  relatively little room for them to maneuver. As with the central  government, local governments also resort to borrowing when they  have no other choice. Yet thus far we have not formulated any  clear and sound regulations governing how much borrowing there  can be, the mix of loans, their periods of maturation, or  interest rates.    Accordingly we must work mighty hard to eliminate the  institutional causes of the deficits in local budgets as we  further our reform. We must waste no time in adopting a  factor-based method for fixing spending base numbers. We must do  a better job relating the tax collection plan to local economic  realities. We must also regularize the debt relations between  the Ministry of Finance and local finance offices and the debt  relations between local finance offices and other areas by  writing them into law.</p>

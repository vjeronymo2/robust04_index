			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives met this morning under  brother Muhammad [second name indistinct] al-Majid, member of  the House of Representatives speakership.    The house heard and approved the minutes of its previous  session. The house then discussed the latest military  developments and repercussions of the crisis, including recent  events in Dhamar. In light of this, the house delegated the  Security and Defense Council and some of the brother members of  the council to make field visits to acquaint themselves with the  military deterioration in Abyan, Shabwah, [placename  indistinct], and Dhamar. The committee can request any  information from the Defense and Interior Ministries or any  other concerned body. The committee must present its report to  the house as soon as it expeditiously accomplishes this field  mission.    As for the House of Representative's (?stand) toward the  crisis and its repercussions, the house issued the following  decision:    As it follows crisis developments, the House of  Representatives is looking with hope and optimism toward all the  positive aspects and serious steps to reunite institutions. The  house views with much pain and regret those negative aspects and  acts that harm Yemen and our unity.    Proceeding from the house's concern about performing its  duty  with full responsibility, the house has decided the following:    First, to reaffirm the House of Representative's statement  on  the crisis issued on 5 November 1993, in terms of adhering to  national constants, foremost of which is Yemeni unity. The  house rejects every formula that would go back or encroach on  this unity. Whoever relinquishes any part of this unity will be  accused of high treason.    The house delegates its permanent committees to follow up  the  implementation of the accord document based on its decision  issued on 27 March 1994, especially the following committees:    A. The Defense and Security Committee will follow the  security and military issue, especially in terms of withdrawing  military units from the outskirts, deploying them in areas with  vital targets and the strategic defense requirements of the  Republic of Yemen, as well as to prevent other forces'  deployment or movement, except within the framework of the  process of redeployment and merger according to the accord  document. The committee will start work today.    B. The Financial Affairs Committee will follow up the budget  and will make sure sovereign revenues reach the Yemeni Central  Bank.    C. The Public Liberties and Human Rights Committee will  follow up what was delegated to it previously.    D. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee will  implement the law on procedures to try senior state officials  based on Articles 101 and 111 of the Constitution.    E. The Media Committee will follow up media deterioration.    Second, the house delegates the speakership and bloc leaders  to follow up crisis political developments and to brief the  house on these developments.    Fourth [as heard], the House of Representatives hopes that  27  April 1994 will be a day of national salvation in which the  entire situation becomes stable, all crises and their  repercussions end, and all government institutions reunite in  Sanaa, the capital of the country of unity.    Fifth, all the state's executive bodies and their leadership  at all levels should shoulder their responsibilities. The  crisis cannot be allowed to obstruct work or prevent the  government from executing its programs and running the state's  affairs.    Sixth, the House of Representatives appreciates the brothers  and friends who are exerting efforts to mend the rift and  maintain Yemeni unity.    The house will resume its meetings on Saturday [9 April]  morning, God willing.</p>

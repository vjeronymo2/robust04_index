			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Trizec in fresh move to prop up Bramalea TRIZEC, North America's biggest publicly-traded real estate developer, has again moved to prop up its 67 per cent-owned subsidiary, Bramalea, in a protracted bid to avert another spectacular collapse in the Canadian property industry. Bramalea, which has debts of CDollars 4.8bn (USDollars 4bn), will gain a little extra breathing room by selling a shopping mall in Alberta to another Trizec-controlled company, and a 50 per cent stake in a mall in Ottawa to Ontario's municipal pension fund. Bramalea over-extended itself in the housing market in California and Ontario during the boom of the mid-1980s. Besides 28m sq ft in office and shopping centre space, it rents out more than 3,000 apartments and townhouses, and owns 5,000 acres of undeveloped land, about one-third of it in California. Bramalea is burdened with financial problems which are at least as severe as those of Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York. O&amp;Y's troubles have further clouded Bramalea's prospects. Mr Marvin Marshall, Bramalea's president, said yesterday institutional investors had become more hesitant about investing in real estate since O&amp;Y's liquidity crisis surfaced earlier this year. This reluctance is likely to force Bramalea to revise its target of selling CDollars 1bn in assets within the next 30 months. The company is in the throes of drawing up a new strategic plan to take account of the recent deterioration in the business climate. Nonetheless, Bramalea's eagerness to dispose of assets appears so far to have assuaged its main lenders. 'I don't see how a receiver could do a better job,' one Toronto real estate financier said, noting that property brokers both in the US and Canada are actively seeking buyers for numerous Bramalea properties. Mr Marshall expressed confidence that the company faced no threat from its banks. With debt and equity markets unreceptive to providing more funds, Trizec's continued support is seen as crucial to Bramalea's prospects. Both companies are part of the vast resources, financial services and consumer products empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family. Two months ago, Trizec invested CDollars 76m in a Bramalea rights issue which was shunned by outside investors. The rights were offered at CDollars 4 apiece. Bramalea's shares were trading at CDollars 1.85 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. Trizec has also agreed to take dividends from Bramalea in the form of stock, rather than cash. Trizec itself has debts of CDollars 9bn. Although it has a more secure cash-flow than Bramalea, Trizec's share price has tumbled to its lowest level in more than two decades. Bramalea said that the sales of the Alberta and Ottawa shopping malls would reduce its debt by CDollars 48m and provide additional working capital of CDollars 10.5m. The company last week also reached an agreement to sell 50 per cent of two central Toronto office buildings, including its own head office, to the Ontario teachers' pension fund.</p>

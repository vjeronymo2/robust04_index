			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Safer European reactors sought EUROPEAN Community governments must take urgent joint action to improve the safety of eastern Europe's ailing nuclear reactors, the head of France's atomic energy commission warned yesterday. It will cost around FFr64bn (Pounds 6.6bn) to bring reactors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to an acceptable level of safety and to close those beyond redemption, said Mr Philippe Rouvillois, chairman of the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique. 'We do not have the right to leave these countries alone to face these problems which they cannot resolve themselves,' Mr Rouvillois told the Kangaroo Group, an organisation of European MPs devoted to promoting the European single market. The community and other international bodies must provide financial help and technical advice fast, he urged. His remarks reflect growing European concern at the risk of a repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, following last month's radiation leak at a reactor near St Petersburg. Germany wants to discuss nuclear safety in the east at the July summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries, and France has sent technology advisers to the region. Apart from the environmental risk, western governments would have political difficulties in maintaining their own nuclear programmes if there were another serious accident in the east, Mr Rouvillois added. This is especially important to France as the world's most nuclear-dependent country: it draws three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear power.</p>

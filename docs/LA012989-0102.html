			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A Marine accused of killing his wife and faking her suicide by hanging was  freed after a military prosecutor recommended that charges be dropped because  the woman probably had killed herself. Gunnery Sgt. Murray Payne, arrested Dec.  1, was released from the brig at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station after a  two-week hearing into the May 10, 1988, death of Ella Mae Payne at the couple's  Corona home. Maj. R.W.J. Grove, who presided over the hearing, said he would  evaluate the case for a week before recommending to the commanding general  whether Payne should or should not face charges.  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: K mart reports 11% increase in third quarter K MART, the large US discount retailer, yesterday reported an 11.1 per cent increase in after-tax profits in the 13 weeks to October 30, to Dollars 122m. Sales were up from Dollars 7.97bn to Dollars 8.84bn, with the advance in 'same-store' sales for the quarter running at 2.9 per cent. Because of an equity-related stock offering in August 1991, however, earnings per share advanced by a more modest 8 per cent, to 27 cents. Within the group overall, K mart said core general merchandise outlets recorded sales of Dollars 6.07bn, up from Dollars 5.8bn in the same period of 1991, with same-store sales rising by 2.1 per cent. On the specialty retail side, sales rose from Dollars 2.16bn to Dollars 2.77bn, with same-store results up by 5 per cent. Operating profits from the general merchandise division totalled Dollars 260m (Dollars 216m), while the specialty chains produced Dollars 32m (Dollars 41m) - a drop partially explained by a Dollars 4m loss at the Pace warehouse club chain, compared with a Dollars 7m profit last time. Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, said yesterday that 'the tone of the business improved materially in the third quarter', and noted there had been less disruption to business due to the store renewal programme. He said the company was pleased with the 'progress made by the specialty retail group, especially considering the large store opening programme'. He suggested that the Pace results had been affected by a rapid expansion programme. The group has made after-tax profits of Dollars 406m in the first nine months, compared with Dollars 380m in the same period of 1991, with sales reaching Dollars 26.2bn (Dollars 24bn).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tehran, 8 May (KUNA) -- It has been mentioned  here today that joint forces belonging to different factions of  the Iraqi opposition captured the headquarters of the third  border brigade of the 18th division and the headquarters of the  first and third companies of the aforementioned brigade during a  surprise attack launched from different directions last Friday  [6 May].    A statement sent to KUNA today by the "holy warriors of the  Islamic revolution" in Iraq, an organization based in al-Ahwar  in southern Iraq, said forces belonging to Badr corps, which is  the military wing of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic  Revolution in Iraq, supported by forces of the "holy warriors"  and men of the people's resistance, "launched the surprise  attack from many directions on Friday evening" on the  abovementioned headquarters and succeeded in controlling them  after penetrating them.    The statement pointed out that the attacking forces managed  in the early hours of their campaign to "completely attack" the  regime's forces, killing and wounding tens of them. They also  destroyed a number of tires [as received], apparatus, large  quantities of weapons, and stacks of equipment.    The statement also pointed out that large quantities of  weapons and equipment have been seized at the headquarters of  the third border brigade and the headquarters of the first and  third companies.    A subsequent statement announced that the opposition forces  have repulsed a counterattack carried out by a company  [indistinct word] on the forces, which captured the headquarters  of the third brigade and its ancillary companies and burned  three of their carriers, including their occupants, and killed  whoever attempted to advance, while the rest escaped.    This is considered the largest joint attack launched by the  opposition factions for a long time. Observers believe the  participation of the forces of Badr corps, which belongs to the  Supreme Assembly, in the attack offers an indication that Iran  has given the green light for the launching of the attack  against the forces of the Iraqi regime, where the aforementioned  corps possesses tanks, missile launchers, armored vehicles, and  artillery.

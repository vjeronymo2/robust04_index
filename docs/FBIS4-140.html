			<p>BFN     [Text] Addis Ababa, 3 April (SUNA) -- Ethiopian President  Meles Zenawi has confirmed the strength of Sudanese-Ethiopian  relations and reiterated his country's interest in making every  effort to successfully bring about peace in Sudan. He stated  this yesterday when meeting with 'Uthman al-Sa'id, Sudan's  ambassador to Ethiopia, who gave him a message from the  president of the Republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir,  on relations between the two countries. He said the security  and stability of Sudan concerned all neighboring states, above  all Ethiopia, with which Sudan shares its longest border.    In a statement to SUNA in Addis Ababa, the ambassador said  that the message came within the framework of continuous  consultations and exchange of ideas between the two countries.  The message also covered the recent Intergovernmental Authority  on Drought and Development [IGADD] meeting in Nairobi relating  to the establishment of peace in Sudan as well as the  preparations under way for the second round of talks, set for 16  May. The message also dealt with the situation in the region  and progress in the implementation of joint agreements which  were recently concluded in Khartoum.    The Sudanese ambassador to Ethiopia said Ethiopian President  Meles Zenawi described the Nairobi peace talks as positive and  commended the Sudanese Government's stand and its interest in  attaining a peaceful solution.    His excellency the ambassador also denied a BBC report that  relations between Sudan and Ethiopia had cooled down to some  extent. He said this was not the first time its correspondent  had worked to undermine the two countries' close relations. The  correspondent had always attacked the Ethiopian Government too,  and had covered Ethiopian news in a negative and non-objective  manner. The ambassador stressed that relations between the two  countries were too strong to be affected by such media campaigns.</p>

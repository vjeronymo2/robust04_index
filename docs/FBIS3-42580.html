			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Seyilbek Shawkhamanov, governor of Qyzylorda </F> Oblast, Kazakhstan peoples deputy: We Have Planted Seeds in the  Garden of Sovereignty.    [Text] The Kazakhs have said: it is easy to get married,  difficult to establish a household. We have obtained our  sovereignty. Now we must think about becoming a nation and  forming a large country which, on a basis of equality and on the  same level with all the civilized nations, will be able to  express itself politically and produce economically. That is no  easy task. To achieve it we must renew our thinking, renew way  we organize, and renew the way we carry out our tasks. It is a  wonderful thing that all the internal and external policies of  the head of the state and of the government are being directed  at such objectives, and that ways are being sought for getting  out of the crisis through economic reform. It is a good thing  that an effort is being made at the presently ongoing session of  the Supreme Kenges to look in detail at drafts of laws suggested  for the agenda of parliament members, to discuss them carefully,  and to look at problems from the point of view of the people.  All of this is the result of the freedom and liberation which we  have attained. It is a great achievement and a great spiritual  victory that the people have gained the right to think about  their own affairs, to collect themselves, and to look at the  present and the future.    The special quality of sovereignty is that our nation has  been awakened, that we have returned to our language and our  religion, and that we have obtained freedom in regulating our  lives and in going about our businesses. It was no secret that,  during the time we were under the rule of the former Soviet  Union, we had to keep our peace in the face of the disorders of  a planned economy, that we were hesitant to oppose it, and that,  when we gave a blessing at the head of the table, we were unable  to console ourselves and we carried a burden in our hearts. The  demands of independence broke those chains once and for all.  Now, as is completely obvious, we have taken the economic reins  into our own hands, and have acquired power as a result of laws  on local self-government. We are revitalizing the important  customs and traditions of our nation. This means that no one can  slap our hands. What else do we need? We must know how to  organize. We must think about efficient ways to achieve this,  and we must seek practical means for raising living standards.  In any case we cannot say that we have solved all the critical  and difficult economic questions, and that we have eliminated  all the difficulties plaguing the people during two years. That  was not possible. However, it is true that we have accomplished  noteworthy things in strengthening the nation and in laying the  foundations for tomorrow.    Le us take my oblast as an example. When Qyzylorda was once  mentioned, the image of rice flashed before peoples' eyes. It is  true that the foundation of our economy is rice growing. This is  because this was the way it was before. It was decided from  above what a given region was to be involved in. Instructions  came down from above as to what crops were to be planted and  what products produced. This is the value of independence: now  we ourselves decide what we need, and how to produce it. This  year we obtained an increase of 105 from every hundred adult  animals in the oblast and have become one of the leaders. We  have harvested 47 centners from every hectare of rice. Likewise,  we are undertaking measures to supply the inhabitants of the  oblast with local vegetables, fruit, and berry products. At the  end of the harvest we had threshed 60,000 tons of golden grain.  By way of comparison, this was 100 kilo each for every  inhabitant of Qyzylorda, from the crawling baby to the bent old  man. All of this, in a word, we understand as the fruit of  freedom provided by sovereignty.    Everything, in addition to its positive side, has its down  side too. We still do not understand the meaning of democratic  processes. We are not managing economic reform exactly right,  and we have made erroneous decisions restraining energetic  development. Difficult days have now begun to be experienced in  agriculture. Products are being produced, economic indicators  are high, but this is having a limited effect on maintaining  living standards. There is disorganization in the pricing  system. Wages are becoming worthless, and there is looseness in  finances and in banking. There are deficiencies in the policy of  social protection. All of this makes any fundamental change in  agriculture impossible. We are independent. Whatever the  decision, we have the right to take it into our own hands as we  see fit and according to circumstances. While this is the case,  up to the present we have been unable to liberate ourselves from  the lasso of higher powers. Nonetheless, the view has been  expressed by those managing the state that we are free to use  agricultural surplus for state needs at the rayon and oblast  level. In fact this is not so. The reason is that there are  licenses and quotas set by the state. We cannot avoid them. Is  that freedom? Rather than benefiting by such limitations, which  free us on the one hand and tie us up on the other, we are, in  my view, being harmed. We have truly gone over to market place  relationships. Is it not proper then that we should now be  totally free in all ways? To tell the bitter truth, things like  trying to solve the agrarian cadre question from a central  authority is obstruction of the old type. If we cannot free  ourselves from such a stereotyped psychology, it is doubtful  that we will be able to strengthen our sovereignty, mobilize  local people, and gain their understanding. I think that, while  there should be supervision from afar, there is too much direct  intervention in [local] administration. No one must have any  doubts that managers of a region and local people know best the  situation in local areas.    There are 32 sovkhozes in our oblast concerned with sheep  raising. As I mentioned above, they are among the leaders in  raising livestock. Compared to last year, there was little loss  and livestock increased. Nonetheless, we must increase the  profits of sheep herders and the income of enterprises. However,  more specifically, the problem is not this at all. The  sheepherders and enterprises achieved such high rates of  increase, but ended up at the end of the year with a debt to the  state of 2 billion rubles. Likewise, there was no way to repay  on time a loan of 20 billion rubles obtained by the government.  Why? The reason the loan was late was because of problems  arising from failure to take agricultural production costs into  account and because of price instability. What must we do now?  The 32 sheepraising sovkhozes makeup about half of the state  enterprises in our oblast. Should we rely on privatization to  break them up? These days there is little to be gained by  privatization. For that reason special attention to agriculture  must be shown by the government. Nonetheless, it would be no  surprise if, under present circumstances, we should choose to  deprive ourselves of things which we now have in hand in the  blink of an eye. It is no secret, tomorrow some sheepherders  (and they are almost all Kazakhs) will be at the limit of their  endurance. If we throw away their prop, what will we do then? On  the contrary, while we express our thanks to them for looking  after themselves and for their work of mercy on behalf of  others, are we not forced to consider well-thought-out plans for  restoring them morally, materially, and linking their  enterprises?    Time is both judge and jury. Our present labor at the very  beginning of independence will, as time passes, receive  appropriate evaluation and be judged. One thing is already  clear, the Declaration of Sovereignty, ratified three years ago,  opened a new path for Kazakhstan. We have begun to exonerate our  history which was for a long time dragged in the dust. We have  renewed vanished spiritual riches. We have made a place in the  hearts of the masses for the names of our khans, heroes, who  guarded our nation in a time of difficulty, and who long ago  knew the entire people. One thing should be mentioned in this  regard: there have been pronouncements from the mouth of some to  the effect that these [anniversary] celebrations are getting out  of hand. At a time that is already difficult enough why are we  wasting money here and there? In my view this is a sign of  limited understanding. In fact, through our celebration of the  festival of some hero are we not honoring the spirits of all the  people who lived at that time and bowing our heads to all the  people who suffered the vissitudes of a time? If our people take  examples from the past, what fault is there in that? Whatever  nationality a person is, they have a duty to defend their native  land. It is fact that the heroism of our ancestors, who did not  give in to hostile enemies, who faced them on all sides, is a  lesson and a model for us.    In short, we have planted seeds in the garden of  sovereignty.  The roots are now striking deep, and we must struggle for an  abundant harvest. The path we have to tread is, in any case, a  long one. However, if we travel a distant road, will we not draw  close [to our goal]? For that reason we will achieve something  by pressing forward without considering the difficulty.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> PLAN WOULD BENEFIT STAFF ON ACTIVE DUTY  </P> <P> City employees who are called to active military duty during the Persian Gulf  crisis could continue to receive a paycheck and health benefits if the City  Council passes a proposed resolution today.  </P> <P> The resolution calls for the city to compensate employees for any difference in  pay as a result of being called to duty.  </P> <P> The city would also continue to pay health and dental benefits for employees'  families until next June 30.  </P> <P> So far, only two city employees have been called to active duty, but up to 25  could eventually be called, according to Swadesh Chopra, deputy director of  personnel services.  </P> <P> Current city rules state that employees called to active duty are granted a  leave of absence with full pay and benefits for up to 30 days each calendar  year. This has been sufficient in the past, since the active duty of reservists  has typically lasted only two weeks.  </P> <P> Last week, both the Anaheim and Costa Mesa city councils passed resolutions  extending benefits or pay to employees called to active duty.  </P></p>

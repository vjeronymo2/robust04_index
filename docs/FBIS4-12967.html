			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The president, Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has  said Pakistan is fully conscious of its geographical and  geostrategic sensitivities and the role it has to play in the  newly emerging world order. Addressing PMA [Pakistan Military  Academy] long course passing-out parade in Kakul today, the  president said we strongly believe in the principle of peaceful  coexistence and noninterference in the affairs of others. He  said we have no aggressive designs against anyone and wish to  live in peace and harmony with all, especially our neighbors.  The president said, however, we have to maintain high level of  preparedness to thwart any evil designs that imperil or  jeopardize Pakistan's integrity. The parade was held in open in  spite of continuing rain. [passage omitted]    Addressing the parade, the president lauded the professional  capabilities of Pakistan armed forces.    [Begin Leghari recording] Let me assure you that the  Government of Pakistan is fully conscious of our security needs  and is doing its best to keep the armed forces of the country  fully prepared to effectively defend the motherland and thwart  any foreign aggression. Despite the many constraints,  particularly economic, we shall equip our armed forces with the  latest technologically advanced weapon systems and knowledge of  related fields to qualitatively improve their condition so that  the adverse effect of numerical inferiority can be offset. I am  confident that our forces will be in a position to face the  consequences of fast-changing geopolitical and geostrategic  situation that Pakistan finds itself in. In fact our armed  forces have already proved their effectiveness, both inside as  well as outside the country, as part of different UN missions.  We rightly feel proud of them. [end recording]    Cadets from some friendly countries, such as Bahrain,  Jordan,  Sri Lanka, and Maldives also got training in the current long  course.</p>

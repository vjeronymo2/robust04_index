			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Glebov report under the "Details" rubric: </F> "Ammunition Explosion Undermined Admiral's Career"]    [Text] The blowing up of ammunition dumps of the Pacific  Fleet's Air Force has evidently irreversibly undermined the  official career of Admiral Georgiy Gurinov, commander of the  Pacific Fleet. But his removal from his post and the  appointment of Vice Adm. Igor Khmelnov to act as commander have  certainly not sent the Pacific Fleet's officers into great  raptures. Moreover, many of the fleet's cadre officers are  openly voicing their categorical protest at such a substitution.    One Pacific Fleet officer, who asked not to be named,  declared that the fleet's officers are displeased because Vice  Adm. Khmelnov (until recently Adm. Gurinov's deputy) does not,  unfortunately, command significant authority in the Pacific  Fleet. Moreover, some Pacific Fleet officers directly name Vice  Adm. Khmelnov among those probably responsible for the recent  disaster (the blowing up of the Pacific Fleet Air Force's combat  supplies)!    The point is that directly after a similar explosion in the  Pacific Fleet last year it was Vice Adm. Khmelnov who was  entrusted with investigating the causes of what happened and  taking measures to prevent the possibility of a repetition of  such disasters in the future. The vice admiral reported back on  the work done. Now a year has passed, there has been a new and  far more terrible disaster...and Pacific Fleet officers are  amazed that Vice Adm. Khmelnov is at once being appointed to  command the fleet, and is being appointed at a time when we can  still see the smoking ruins of the weapons dumps for whose  safety Vice Adm. Khmelnov personally was responsible....    Flagrant sloppiness and negligence in guarding the arsenal  caused the Pacific Fleet's aviation dumps to blow up.    The Pacific Fleet's counterintelligence staffers have  established that one of the sentries, during his rest period  after being relieved from his post, found an electrical assembly  of a missile's solid-propellant booster in the dump's grounds  and started taking it apart with a knife. Another sentry of the  same shift was nearby. A blow from the knife caused the  propellant charge to ignite, and the sentry could think of  nothing better to do than to throw the burning electrical  assembly into a thicket of last year's grass, which at once  caught fire. A stack of rockets was nearby! The fire embraced  it, and a few minutes later an explosion thundered forth.    The sentries fled the scene without taking measures to  extinguish the fire or notifying the unit's command.    The garrison's military prosecutor's office has instituted  criminal proceedings in this regard, and the investigation is  continuing.</p>

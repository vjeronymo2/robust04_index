			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / International Company News: Teleglobe net profit triples to CDollars 12m TELEGLOBE, the sole Canad-ian overseas telecommunications company, tripled net profit in the final quarter of 1991 on a 20 per cent gain in revenues. Management control of Teleglobe passed to BCE earlier this month in a boardroom fight. The strength came from the overseas telecommunications business. Teleglobe also operates subsidiaries in data communications equipment and systems. Fourth-quarter net was CDollars 12m (USDollars 10.2m), or 26 cents a share, up from CDollars 3.1m, or 8 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues were CDollars 129m, against CDollars 107m. For the full year, Teleglobe earned CDollars 25.7m, or 54 cents a share, up from CDollars 8m, or 20 cents, in 1990. Peoples Credit Jewellers of Toronto, which controls the troubled US Zale retailing group, posted a loss of CDollars 132.9m, or CDollars 10.92 a share, in the nine months ended 28 December, 1991. The result included a special charge of CDollars 137m on its Zale investment. Zale has filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>

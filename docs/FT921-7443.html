			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Templeton Emerging plans to raise Pounds 35m TEMPLETON Emerging Mark-ets Investment Trust is attempting to raise Pounds 35m via a combination of a placing, open offer and an offer via intermediaries. It joined the stock market in 1990, with shareholders funds of almost Pounds 29m and raised a further Pounds 18m via a rights issue in 1990. Its shares have traded close to, or above, asset value. The directors said that the share issue would expand the shareholder base and enable the trust to build a diversified portfolio. At October 31 its net asset value was up 53 per cent on a year before. Up to 22.5m new C shares are available via a placing at 100p. In addition, 7.5m shares are available to intermediaries and 5m to existing holders.</p>

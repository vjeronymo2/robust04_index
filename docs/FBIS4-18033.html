			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by lawyer Gennadiy Krasyukov: "May Day Coming: Be </F> Vigilant!"]    [Text] Only recently the Russian and Moscow City Hall  leadership took part in May Day celebrations with pleasure but  later for some reason they lost interest in this holiday.  Perhaps because their convictions changed or perhaps because  they introduced their "own" holidays.    But as they say, if they do not want to take part in  organized events themselves, they should not prevent others from  doing so. Especially as by their inept activity they have  brought millions of workers, employees, peasants, and  intellectuals to an impoverished existence, deprived many of  them of work, and now also want to deprive them of the  opportunity at least to communicate occasionally. And this is  being done in violation of the present very far from perfect  Russian Federation Constitution, which they themselves signed  and which they frenziedly urged working people to adopt and  which they swore to observe. Article 31 of the Russian  Federation Constitution clearly says: "Citizens o the Russian  Federation have the right to assemble peacefully, without  weapons, to hold gatherings, meetings, demonstrations,  processions, and pickets." The same thing is said in article 20  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved and  proclaimed by the UN General Assembly 10 December 1948.    Our executive power leadership does not tire of repeating  that it respects international law and that it is a component of  the Russian legal system. But words are often at odds with  specific actions. It has become a rule for far-fetched pretexts  to be used to forbid applicants to hold processions at all or to  determine a route which can only be called an insult to citizens  and their rights.    After the end of the notification and conciliation stage and  immediately before the relevant date through the mass media and  radio and television representatives of the city hall and other  state services put various forms of psychological pressure on  the organizers of and future participants in particular events  staged by the opposition. And in addition to everything else  even before the start of the meeting and procession large  detachments supplied with bulletproof waistcoats, helmets,  shields, rubber truncheons, and often weapons as well and  detachments of the special militia and other militia subunits  are brought in to the venues. Then various types of vehicles  close nearly all adjacent streets and avenues. In general terms  the meeting's participants are "surrounded" on all sides.    After the proclaimed "peace initiatives" allegedly aimed at  civil accord in society, a hope appeared that there would be an  improvement in the attitude toward the above-mentioned topic.  But unfortunately everything is continuing according to the  usual scenario. Again the city hall representatives have  started haggling with representatives of the parties and  movements over assigning a venue and the means for holding  events to mark May Day. Again psychological pressure is  beginning on those who are intending to take part in them. In  particular on 14 April VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA published in a small  note information to the effect that joint exercises by militia  and special militia subunits involving a total of 1,500 men had  been held on the territory of the "Luzhniki" sports complex  under conditions as close as possible to combat conditions.  They were rehearsing operations in the event of the outbreak of  mass riots and all this was linked directly with the approaching  May Day.    An even more alarming report was heard on that day on radio  to the effect that it is intended to bring large special militia  detachments from various regions into the capital in the next  few days, allegedly to fight crime.    This report cannot fail to perturb Muscovites because many  of  them still have fresh in their memory the illegal actions of the  out of town special militia members when, armed "to the teeth,"  they subjected unarmed and defenseless citizens to fierce  beatings during the September-October events in Moscow.    If the question of sending the regional special militia to  Moscow has already been resolved then a number of questions  arise. From where will the special militia subunits come, how  many will there be, how long will they stay, and where and  against whom will they act? If it is to render aid to the  Moscow militia in the struggle against crime then why are they  being transferred on the threshold of the May Day holidays?  Does that mean that previously the crime situation in the city  was better than it is now, or is it that things are going well  in the struggle against crime in the regions from which it is  intended to send them to Moscow?    I suggest that the State Duma on the basis of the committees  for security and legislation create a special commission which  would monitor the political events in Moscow, the activity of  the special militia, and other militia subunits. First of all  it is essential to prevent their use by the authorities against  the people's masses. Unfortunately we have grown accustomed to  creating commissions after the event, that is when blood has  already been shed, the public has already been aroused, and no  culprits can be found.    The actual participants in the May Day events must display  heightened vigilance and through their efforts ensure proper  order and discipline during a possible procession. If  provocateurs do appear it is essential to establish their  identity and hand them over to the militia, finding out  afterward what steps have been taken with regard to them. It  would be useful if those who have them were to take cameras and  video cameras with them so that they can film everything that  happens and if necessary make use of what they have filmed.    Peace to May Day and a good mood for all Russia's citizens!</p>

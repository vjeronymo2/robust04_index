			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Channel shares suspended SHARES IN Bristol Channel Ship Repairers were suspended yesterday at 8p at the company's request pending shareholders' approval of its reorganisation proposals. Mr Christopher Bailey, chairman, said the company had started talks with Mr Andreas O Ugland and other members of his family regarding the proposed acquisition of a fleet of vessels and a ship management business. Should the transaction proceed, he said the company expected to fund the purchase price, expected to be between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m, by means of a rights issue. The enlarged group would be better positioned to take advantage of further shipping-related opportunities, he said. At the same time the ship repairer and engineer announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 591,150 for the year to March 26, compared with profits of Pounds 168,604. Turnover fell to Pounds 48,974 (Pounds 1.27m). Mr Bailey said the result had been hit by the recession, coupled with the upgrading work which had effectively closed the dry docks for some months. The losses were also after a non-recurring charge of Pounds 180,000 for cancelling management and administration agreements with CH Bailey, a Pounds 124,000 rise in repair and maintenance costs and other non-recurring charges. Losses per share were 0.74p, against earnings of 0.21p. Mr Bailey said that at about the time of the annual meeting he would step down in favour of Mr Ugland. Other directors would also be resigning. Mr Ugland is chairman of Ugland Brothers, a ship management company, which is Bristol's largest shareholder with a 24.19 per cent stake.</p>

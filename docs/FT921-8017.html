			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson finds US buyers CONGLOMERATE Hanson saw the biggest percentage rise among the FT-SE 100 stocks as it received enthusiastic support from US investment house Goldman Sachs. The shares moved ahead 7 1/2 p, or 3.7 per cent, to 210 1/2 p on very heavy turnover of 17m. There was also exceptionally heavy volume in the options market. Mr Jack L. Kelly, Goldman's conglomerates analyst in New York, shifted his stance from 'attractive' to a strong buy. He said the stock was at a significant discount to the London market and yet offered an above average yield. On both a five-year and a one-year basis, Hanson is at a discount to the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index, while BTR, to which it is often compared, is at a premium. Mr Kelly added that some of the factors which have been holding the Hanson shares back, particularly worries over the successors to Lords Hanson and White, were reduced following Friday's presentation by the company. More than 50 per cent of Hanson's turnover is now derived from US or US overseas subsidiaries. This was reflected in the rise of the shares from the strength of the dollar yesterday. Finally, they were firm ahead of a hefty and positive note from County NatWest due to be published very shortly. L &amp; G reviewed Dealers said UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker, was instrumental in pushing Legal &amp; General sharply higher. The stock closed 9 ahead at 360p on turnover of almost 1m shares. Mr Youssef Ziai, an insurance specialist at UBS, now expects L&amp;G to announce a small profit for the year when it reports preliminary figures on March 19. Previously he had been looking for the group to announce a sizeable deficit after bad general insurance losses and heavy provisioning for mortgage indemnity losses. He also forecast a 5 per cent increase in the final dividend. He shifted his expectation because L &amp; G had sold two unit-linked life and pensions subsidiaries to its main life fund and would treat the proceeds as an exceptional item and not as an extraordinary item. He said the sale proceeds, taken above the line, would offset the big losses on insurance and mortgage indemnity. Heavy switching between Barclays and NatWest and between Lloyds and Midland triggered an upsurge in turnovers ahead of the preliminary reporting season, which starts on Friday. The heaviest activity, 9.7m shares, was in Barclays, which settled 3 up at 380p. NatWest ended 4 higher at 289p on 4.6m, Midland 5 firmer at 232p on 3.7m and Lloyds 2 better at 393p on 3.6m. Details of the Royal Insurance link with Aachener &amp; Munchener, of Germany, and Fondiaria, of Italy, were much as the market had expected and Royal closed 2 better at 232p. A BZW buy note stimulated support for Sedgwick, which settled 3 up at 218p. BP holdings The slide in BP, triggered mostly by last week's dreadful results but also by worries about the latest Opec agreement, was halted yesterday after official confirmation that US investors have sharply increased their holdings in the UK's premier oil group over the past three months. BP ended 2 firmer at 265p after turnover of 21m shares. Guaranty Nominees, which holds BP stock on behalf of US investors, said it held 8.46 per cent of BP's equity. Specialists said US holdings had roughly doubled in size over the past three months and heavy buying from the US last week had helped to prevent an even greater slide in the share price. It was not clear whether the Guaranty Nominees holding disclosed yesterday took in any of last week's purchases of BP shares. Second-line oils were mauled again as the market picked up hints that one of the UK's big integrated houses was about to chop its earnings forecasts for many of the stocks. Clyde Petroleum bore the brunt of some heavy selling, closing 5 lower at 62p. However, suggestions of possible delays to the development of Clyde's Gryphon field were rejected by sector analysts. Hardy Oil &amp; Gas was down 8 at 119p, after 117p, while Lasmo lost the same amount to 206p and Enterprise 6 to 405p. British Gas, given a sharp push by Strauss Turnbull, the broker, rose a further 4 to 252p. Dealers spoke of more exceptionally heavy activity in the utilities. Water stocks, heavily supported on Monday after a welter of broker buy notes, encountered a flurry of profit-taking. The regional electricity issues managed minor gains in spite of hints that some institutions had been selling the Electricity Package into the market ahead of the expected cessation of trading in the Package later this year. Up to Pounds 2,835 at one stage, it closed Pounds 22 ahead at Pounds 2,815. Stores continued to advance on expectations of a cut in interest rates before the general election and a possible reduction in income tax in next month's Budget. Speculation that today's January retail sales figures will show some recovery from the 0.9 per cent fall in December also provided support. The sector is now at its best level since the summer of 1988, but analysts pointed out that on a historical basis stores are not highly rated. Improved sentiment pushed Great Universal Stores 'A' up 27 to 1508p, while Sears rose 1 1/2 to 106p on turnover of 12m, responding to the recent appointment of Mr Liam Strong as chief executive. Argos, depressed of late by adverse comments from brokers, bounced 10 to 283p and Kingfisher rose 16 to 523p. Allied-Lyons added 7 at 632p, gaining support from news that the deal to lease 734 of its public houses to Brent Walker had been completed. The Office of Fair Trading has threatened legal action against Allied, on the basis that these pubs still form part of the tied estate, which it has been ordered to reduce by government legislation. There is growing optimism, however, that Allied will win the argument. HP Bulmer, recently volatile on the European Commission's questioning of cider's favourable tax position, fell 7 to 267p. The slump in Alexandra Workwear continued, with the stock, which stood at 153p in September, falling 6 to 38p on unusually heavy turnover of 800,000. Persistent worries about the company's financial situation have deterred investors from picking up any available stock, but Alexandra's broker was bidding for and offering shares, suggesting a level may have been reached. Ladbroke gained 4 to 231p as investors looked forward to an expected increase in the leisure group's dividend next month. Hotel group Forte, which suffered from some switching into Ladbroke, continued to edge up, adding 2 at 227p - a penny above the level that warrants attached to a maturing bond may be exercised. Rank Organisation continued its post-results surge, climbing 8 to 713p. However, some analysts believe the stock may come off when it goes ex the dividend on Monday. A squeeze sent GKN climbing to 336p, although as stock appeared at the higher levels the shares slipped back to 334p, up 9 on balance. Sporadic buying ahead of today's full-year results helped British Aerospace to harden 3 to 273p. The market expects the results to reveal a loss of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 85m. Favourable weekend press comment continued to lift Inchcape, which gained another 9 at 451p as volume rose to 1.8m. Securities house BZW was reported to have been the seller of Tiphook. The shares dropped 27 to 316p. Specialist chemicals and industrial group BTP fell 6 in both the old shares and the nil-paid to 229p and 25p respectively. Kleinwort Benson has been telling clients that the shares do not have much 'upside potential' in the short term following a good run ahead of the recent rights issue.

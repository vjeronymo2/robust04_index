			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Two in court over Ashdown papers: Man charged with burglary is a paid-up member of the Conservative party THE MAN charged with the break-in at the office of the solicitors of Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, was a paid-up member of his local Conservative association, it emerged yesterday. Mr Simon Leo Berkowitz, 45, a painter from Hove, East Sussex, appeared at City of London magistrates court charged with burglary and handling stolen documents. His former wife, Ms Maria Watson, 41, unemployed from Brighton, also appeared charged with handling stolen documents. They were released on conditional bail and will appear in court again on March 6. Hove and Portslade Conservative Association said Mr Berkowitz had been a fully paid-up member for several years. But Councillor Edward Cruickshank-Robb, chairman of the association, said Mr Berkowitz had a low profile and was not known to the officers. 'He has not played any active role in the association either at ward, branch or constituency level, and, to the best of our knowledge, no part in local government or general elections,' Mr Cruickshank-Robb said. Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman, said he did not regard the disclosure of Mr Berkowitz's membership as 'any great embarrassment' for the party. However, Mr Don Turner, Labour's candidate for Hove, said: 'I am surprised at the denial that he was politically active in the area. This contradicts what we know of his activities in Hove and Brighton.' Speaking outside the court yesterday, Mr Martin Lowe, Mr Berkowitz's solicitor said his client would plead not guilty to both charges, although he admitted having had a document referring to Mr Ashdown. 'He has explained to the police in answer to their questions the circumstances in which he had it and what he did with it,' Mr Lowe said. Mr Berkowitz said in an interview on Independent Television News last night that he was 'totally innocent'. On Wednesday, Mr Ashdown publicly admitted to a brief affair with a former secretary five years ago, after a document detailing the relationship was stolen from the solicitors' offices and offered for sale to a national newspaper. Fears of a possible 'dirty tricks' campaign aimed at politicians were fuelled by a second burglary at the London offices of Mr Ashdown's solicitors, Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite, yesterday morning. City of London police said they were investigating the incident but did not know what had been stolen. Since Mr Ashdown confessed his affair, it has become known that his solicitors' offices also house confidential papers relating to other MPs. The latest theft increased tensions at Westminster, where constant revelations about burglaries at MPs' offices so close to the general election have provoked accusations of 'dirty tricks'. Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery, reacted angrily to a report that Conservative Central Office sought information last May from a credit agency on a Welsh Liberal Democrat activist, Mr Mike German. Conservative Central Office denied the report, but said an application for a pass to a Conservative conference from Miss Laura German of the same address had been vetted. It was standard practice to use agencies to verify credentials. Mr Ashdown was given a standing ovation as he arrived at the annual general meeting of his constituency party in Yeovil, Somerset, last night.</p>

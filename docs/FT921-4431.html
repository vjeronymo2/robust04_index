			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Candover lifted to Pounds 3.9m despite buy-out decline CANDOVER INVESTMENTS, an investment trust specialising in management buy-outs, increased both pre-tax profits and net assets per share in 1991 despite an overall decline in the level of activity in buy-out markets. Candover yesterday reported a 7 per cent increase in pre tax profits to Pounds 3.95m in 1991 while earnings per share rose by 24 per cent to 12.22p. Net assets per share rose by 12.4 per cent to 244p. This was less than the 14.4 per cent rise in the FT Actuaries All Share Index over the same period but the company said it was 'a fair result' given its conservative approach to valuing unlisted investments. Over the past five years Candover has outperformed the index by a wide margin. It proposes paying a final dividend of 6p making a total of 9.5p for the year, an increase of 12 per cent. Candover invested in seven new companies in the UK and four overseas last year. It also made six follow-on investments in companies already in its portfolio. It realised five of its investments for a substantial capital gain. It floated two of its companies, Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings in the UK for a total profit of Pounds 5.6m and ARI Network Services on NASDAQ in the US. It also sold its investments in three other companies, Radyne, Allied Filmmakers and Equity Leisure, to trade buyers. Candover is presently establishing a 1991 Fund and expects to raise Pounds 35m for investment in medium-sized buyouts. Large investments have included buy-outs of Blue Arrow Personnel Services and the Midland Newspaper Group.</p>

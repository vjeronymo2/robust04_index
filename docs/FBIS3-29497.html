Customs-cleared import prices for 30 selected items in  December fell a weighted average of 4.7 percent from a year  earlier, with 27 items declining and 17 posting double-digit  declines, the Finance Ministry reported.    The fall reflected the dollar's average 12.7 percent decline  to 108.35 yen for the month, and declines of more than 30  percent were seen for French wine, Italian shirts and many other  items denominated in other currencies that dropped more than the  dollar against the yen, a ministry official said.    He noted that higher prices in three items and relatively  low  declines for 13 items came chiefly on supply shortage and yen-  denominated contracts.    Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency reported that retail  prices for imported goods fell for only 14 products in January  while 18 of 20 surveyed items posted declines in customs-cleared  prices in December.    Retail prices for 12 items, including wine and shirts,  posted  lower declines than customs-cleared prices, and two items  remained unchanged despite lower customs prices, the agency said.    Moreover, it said consumers saw price increases in  grapefruit  and subcompact passengers cars although customs officers saw  lower prices in the two items.</p>

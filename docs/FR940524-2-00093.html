			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, the Commission believes that the DEA may experience difficulty in meeting its responsibilities when extensions are granted by another SRO. <FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>  Consistent and current information about firm requests for extensions of time for payment or delivery of securities will help the NYSE to measure the financial viability of the firm. As the DEA, the NYSE is solely responsible for examining its members for compliance with industry financial responsibility rules. Therefore, the Exchange is best-suited to monitor and effectively impose restrictions on the extension of credit by its members. If the NYSE obtains all extension information, credit related financial restrictions placed upon a member firm will be made based upon complete information, comprising all extensions requested. Therefore, any potential burden on competition stemming from the NYSE proposal is justified by the overriding regulatory benefit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See FRB Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 9. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, the Commission does not believe that the proposal reduces competition in an inappropriate manner. The SRO's monitoring of margin requirements, as with their other regulatory responsibilities, was not and is not intended to act as a profit making arm of the market activities of SROs. Provision of necessary regulatory services by the DEA is an essential component of its statutory requirements, and should not be impaired by price competition from other SROs who do not carry DEA responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, as with any regulatory fee, the Commission has the authority under the Act to review and abrogate excessive fees. Even if approval of the rule proposal eliminates fee competition, the Commission will continue to exercise its statutory authority to ensure that only reasonable fees for extension requests are imposed by the NYSE on member firms. <FOOTCITE>69</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 69 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6(b)(4) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) (1988), requires that the rules of an exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, for all of the above reasons, the Commission believes that to the extent that the proposal does impose a burden on competition, such burden is justified as necessary and appropriate under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to approve the NYSE's proposal notwithstanding the fact that both Regulation T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3 provide that a broker-dealer may go to any SRO for credit extension requests, irrespective of whether the SRO is the broker-dealer's DEA. In this regard, the NYSE proposal does not prevent other SROs from granting extension requests, but simply narrows the choice for firms for which the NYSE is the DEA. Firms for which the NYSE is not the DEA can still use other SROs for their extension requests. In addition, the FRB has stated that it supports the NYSE's proposal and that it generally believes that only SROs with examination responsibilities of some kind should grant extensions. The FRB noted that the changes to Regulation T which were adopted in 1980 were intended to accommodate firms who found it more convenient to send extension requests to a nearby SRO and that this same need may not still exist in the computer age. Finally, because the terms of the proposal are not inconsistent with Regulation T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3, and the proposal furthers the NYSE's responsibility under the Act, the Commission believes that it is an appropriate exercise of the NYSE's ability to adopt rules consistent with the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CSE also argues that the NYSE proposal should be disapproved because there has been not showing that the current extension approval systems have not been working. <FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>  The Commission does not believe that in order to approve a proposal there must be a showing that the current system is not working, only a showing that the new rule would create better procedures or a better system and that the proposal is consistent with the Act. As discussed above, the NYSE's proposal will improve the regulation of extension requests. In addition, however, the Commission's review of extension request programs has indicated certain inadequacies in the extension process at various SROs. These inadequacies could be reduced if the NYSE proposal is approved. Moreover, the current structure lacks uniform standards and as a result can encourage forum shopping. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the proposal will address these concerns and help to create a more effective review of credit extensions. The Commission disagrees with the assertions of some commenters that approval of the proposal would be inconsistent with section 11A of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1)(C) provides that it is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors to assure fair competition among exchange markets and between exchange markets. The NYSE proposal will not prevent competition among SROs in their role as markets, and it is intended to make the extension request process consistent with the DEA structure that the other SROs have already agreed to. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 70 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See July 1989 CSE Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 9 and 1993 CSE Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also disagrees with some commenters' argument that approval of NYSE Rule 434 would greatly enhance the NYSE's power in the marketplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 434 will merely make such that in instances in which the NYSE is the DEA, the NYSE will obtain all pertinent regulatory information about firm activities. The commenters have made no showing that the rule would affect other markets' ability to compete for order flow. Moreover, the DEA program, to which all the SROs have joined, is intended to concentrate the provision of regulatory services into the major SROs for efficiency and effectiveness. Proposed Rule 434 is a logical adjunct to the DEA program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters argue that broker-dealers should be able to submit extension requests to any SRO which is convenient for them. The Commission, however, believes that proximity is not a significant factor because in today's electronic environment it would generally be just as convenient to submit extension requests to the NYSE as it would be to submit them to any other SRO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T. Nikolayeva: "A Russian Holding Lithuanian </F> Passport Is a Foreigner in Russia"]    [Text]  <H5>  Yesterday Moscow introduced a new visa system for citizens </H5> of the Lithuanian Republic entering the Russian Federation    Thus, at the present time ethnic Russians who acquired  Lithuanian citizenship will feel themselves real foreigners in  Russia, inasmuch as visas, even for those who were born and  lived half of their lives in Moscow or in the Russian  countryside, and have close relatives there, will be issued in  accordance with the order established for citizens of foreign  countries. In order to obtain a visa for a trip to Russia at the  Russian Embassy it will henceforth be necessary to submit either  an invitation from an organization, or an original of a private  invitation registered with organs of the OVIR [Department of  Visas and Registration] or the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] of Russia, or a confirmation from a tourist firm  engaged in the organization of tourist trips to Russia.  Applications for a visa, standard questionnaires, and the three  photographs must be submitted not later than 10 working days  before the trip, and only in exceptional cases (funerals,  illness, need for emergency medical treatment, etc) will this  procedure, costing five U.S. dollars, be accelerated. All these  expenditures--of time, nerves, and finances--are connected with  the acquisition of a visa good for only a single visit.  Multiple-visit visas are issued only upon coordination with the  Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on the  basis of sufficient grounds.    The winners were those who, being permanent residents of  Lithuania, nevertheless obtained Russian citizenship, and,  temporarily until 6 February 1995, those who are stateless. They  retained the right to enter Russia without a visa.    The Russian consulate in Lithuania, of course, prepared  itself but, as indicated by the sad experience of the Belarus  Embassy, it will be impossible to avoid very long lines with  overnight vigils at the entrance and tattered nerves. Even  understanding very well that the introduction by Russia of the  visa regime for Lithuanian citizens is merely a reciprocal step  to "the European courtesy of Lithuania," Lithuanian ethnic  Russians cannot comprehend why it was impossible to provide for  certain measures for them ahead of time in order to ease the  visa regime. Is it really that difficult to resolve the issue  concerning mutual easing of the visa regime for citizens of  Lithuania with the right to Russian citizenship, for instance,  because of birth, and, correspondingly, for Lithuanians who are  citizens of Russia with the right to obtain Lithuanian  citizenship? Perhaps it would have been worth isolating that  issue from other more complex problems of Russian - Lithuanian  mutual relations? At present it is necessary to ascertain that  Russia along with the Baltic states is "performing at the  pinnacle of civilized behavior" in facilitating the maintenance  of contacts with relatives for people.</p>

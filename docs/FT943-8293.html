			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Cut in credit card protection attacked Credit card holders could lose out under the reforms of consumer credit proposed by the Office of Fair Trading, the Consumers' Association warns in a report published today. The association attacked the new limits recommended by the OFT within which card issuers should be liable for goods or services misrepresented or not delivered. In June the OFT concluded that the protection should remain, but in slightly narrower limits. It said the minimum transaction for which it would apply should be raised from Pounds 100 to Pounds 150, while the upper limit should be set at Pounds 25,000 rather than Pounds 30,000. Ms Jean Eaglesham, the association's head of money policy, said it was 'iniquitous to raise the lower limit while lowering the upper limit', particularly as the average credit card purchase was just Pounds 40. The OFT said the rise in the lower limit, the first since 1985, would be in line with keeping the liability to relatively high-priced goods and services.</p>

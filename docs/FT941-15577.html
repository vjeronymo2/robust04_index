			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Legal challenge to Thorp granted Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, yesterday won permission from the High Court to bring a legal challenge to the government's licensing of the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. Lancashire county council, whose region is about 30 miles from the source of the proposed radioactive emissions, has joined Greenpeace in the challenge. Its scientific advisers have warned that the plant's emissions could exceed the government's recommended safety levels. The council said: 'A public inquiry is necessary to test our scientists' findings against those of (the government's) scientists.' The date of the judicial review has been set for the week beginning February 7. The plant's licence comes into effect on Monday, when British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, will begin moving used nuclear fuel rods stored in ponds at the plant's entrance to ponds further inside. Greenpeace and the county council have decided not to ask the court for a formal order which would halt operations until after the judicial review because BNF has indicated that preliminary tests will continue for another month. Greenpeace expects the judicial review will take place before the 500m-long plant becomes fully contaminated with radioactivity. Ms Bridget Woodman, Greenpeace's Thorp campaigner, said that yesterday's ruling, which was reached in less than an hour, was 'a small victory'. She added that Greenpeace would argue in the judicial review that 'the government made an illegal decision to allow Thorp to operate before holding a full public inquiry'. BNF has opposed a public inquiry, which could delay operation of the plant for months. It originally expected approval to proceed a year ago. Mr David Bonser, director of Thorp, said yesterday: 'Leave (to bring a judicial review) is only the preliminary stage of the legal action. The real battle will come next month.'</p>

At the SPD headquarters in Bonn, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping  called on the about 10,000 SPD officials in 27 German towns not  to rest in view of the current lead that the SPD enjoys over the  Christian Democratic Union in opinion polls. "We won numerous  opinion polls in the past few years," he stressed. "Now we  want to win the Bundestag elections for a change."    SPD treasurer Inge Wettig-Danielmeier reported that the SPD  wants to spend about 70-75 million German marks for the  Bundestag and European elections this year. SPD manager  Verheugen called on the party members to wage a fair election  campaign without "mud slinging." The SPD campaign will focus on  the safeguarding of jobs and social security. Lower Saxony  Minister President Gerhard Schroeder, who participated in the  satellite conference from Hanover, recommended that his friends  communicate directly with the citizens in the coming election  campaign, and not through "screens."</p>

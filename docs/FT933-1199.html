			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (25): Signals continue to be ambiguous - Italy / The recession has coincided with a significant restructuring of the economy and unprecedented budget austerity PRESENTING the 1994 budget before the summer break, Mr Piero Barucci, the Italian treasury minister, claimed the recession was 'coming to an end'. Yet the economic signals continue to be ambiguous and only on the most optimistic of scenarios will the signs of recovery be detectable in early 1994. The bottoming out process could well be long and painful. This is largely because, unlike other G7 countries, the recession has coincided with a significant restructuring of the economy and unprecedented budget austerity. When the recovery begins it is likely to be export-led. Italian companies have really taken advantage of last September's devaluation of the lira and its 'temporary' exit from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). They have offset a sharp drop in domestic demand by switching to exports. As a result in the first half of 1993 sales to the EC, Italy's main market, rose 11 per cent in value; while overall trade swung from deficit to surplus by a staggering L22,000bn compared to the same period in 1992. Without the oxygen of the export boom, the effects of recession would undoubtedly have been more keenly felt. Italy has not experienced such a sharp switch to negative growth since the early seventies. The downturn began in mid-1991; but it was not felt until nearly a year later and this year negative growth is projected of around 0.3 - 0.5 per cent. Demand during the first half of this year, especially for investment goods and consumer durables, dropped 10 per cent. Industrial production for the six months was down 4.2 per cent with an even more pronounced dip in June bringing the index to the levels of mid-1987. As yet, there is no evidence of stock-building. Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, hopes production levels have come close to touching bottom but is reluctant to say anything definitive until more data is available. The key to the coming months will be the ability of Italian goods to sustain their competitiveness in export markets. The cost of the recession has been reflected in squeezed profits and a steep rise in unemployment. In 1992, more than 200,000 jobs were lost in industry and the service sector, and unofficial estimates suggest the figure will be greater this year. Officially, 2.4m people are unemployed, 1m of whom are seeking jobs for the first time. Although the unemployed represent 10.5 per cent of the workforce, this distorts the picture since in the north the jobless rate is down to 6.5 per cent while in certain parts of the south it is more than 23 per cent. The picture is further distorted by the Italian practice of temporary lay-offs, funded jointly by the government and employers, which can extend for up two years. In the first six months the number of hours covered by lay-off payments increased 26 per cent. The increase in unemployment has obliged the unions to opt for wage moderation in return for job security. Aided by tight curbs on public sector pay, the level of wage increases has fallen, averaging 4.7 per cent last year and likely to be about 4.4 per cent this year. The trend was formalised in an historic four-year tripartite pact between the government, unions and industrialists on July 3. The essence of this deal was an agreement that wages cannot match inflation unless increases in pay are directly linked to productivity. This eliminates one of the most damaging aspects of traditional Italian wage bargaining - the automatic linkage of wages to inflation. The next step will be to hold down overall production costs by removing rigidities in the labour market and introducing temporary employment contracts, and ending national pay structures. This promises to be much harder to achieve. If wage-fed inflation now looks like being a phenomenon of the past, Italy still has one of the highest inflation rates in the EC. Recession has helped curb price increases and largely offset the negative impact of devaluation through most costly imports, (notably energy products paid in dollars). But this year the inflation rate will not come down much below 4.5 per cent with a projection of 3.7 per cent for 1994. This rate of inflation reflects high service costs and inefficiencies in the country's infrastructure. The fight against inflation will be helped by the Ciampi government's 1994 austerity budget. This plans to hold down the public sector deficit to L144,000bn (L155,000bn in 1993) mainly through cuts in spending rather than new taxes as in the current year. The cuts, raising L28,000bn, will come from cuts in the generous state pension scheme, streamlining the civil service, reductions in health benefits and a virtual block on public sector pay rises. The budget aims to provide a small primary surplus, underlining that the deficit is essentially the product of the heavy burden of debt service. The mountain of Italy's debt, one third of all the EC debt, remains the weakest point of the economy. The debt stock is due to increase from 110 per cent of GDP to nearly 120 per cent before stabilising in 1996. The cost of debt service has been helped by the fall in interest rates, each one percentage point saving some L15,000bn in a year. However, the authorities remain caught in a vicious circle. The business community is clamouring for a further cut in interest rates and a narrowing of the spread between Italian real rates and those among its main trading partners. At present real interest rates in Italy are nearly 5 per cent. Until the difference is narrowed and rates fall further the cost of borrowing remains prohibitive. But equally, Italy needs to maintain attractive rates on government paper to fund the public sector borrowing requirements. This emphasis on retaining the attractiveness of government paper prejudices the development of the stock market at a time when the bourse needs to expand to cope with at least part of the ambitious plans for privatising state-controlled banks and industries. The privatisation programme has been far too hastily conceived, with a series of bold announcements to be followed by slow implementation and frequent changes. At last the treasury appears firmly in control of the process and there should be progress. However, Italy is likely to hold general elections next spring, under a new and predominantly first-past-the-post system. While the government will do all to lock its successor into a continuing policy of austerity and liberalisation, this may not prove so simple.</p>

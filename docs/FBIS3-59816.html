			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sinan 'Abd-al-Jabbar Abu-Kalal] </F>   [Text] Iraq and the Arab nation are experiencing, in these  very days, a unique state of nationalist awakening and national  awareness, and a feeling of historical steadfastness in a nearly  unique way. It is different from other such instances in our  contemporary history. This awareness, sincerely and  enthusiastically eager to know past patriots and to learn from  their heritage, values, and influence, is the inevitable result  of scientific understanding and a total grasp of the movement of  history and its philosophy.    One of the most dangerous pests to which our combatant  nation  has been exposed is the attempt of enemies, in their different  languages and varieties, of their diverse sects and beliefs, to  create a state of anarchy and confusion among the people of a  single community, and to feed the spirit of dissension and  hostility among its individuals. It has tried to perpetuate  dissension and religious strife among their ranks and distort  the historical realities of Arab Islamic culture. All this was  in order to halt the renaissance and reawakening that had  reached its peak in this decisive juncture in the history of our  nation, and there must be a response.    Among them are the orientalists who devoted themselves to  studying the Crusades, with many points of view, both praising  and blaming, among them both men fair and those who avoid the  truth. Researchers studying orientalism and the Crusades are  unable to find the many sources of this movement, so it is not  easy for them except the trivial part of it which might conceal  these two subjects. This presents researchers with real  difficulties, so they add their own touches to make a clear  picture of orientalists and the Crusades.    To demonstrate this, the fair-minded German orientalist  Sigrid Hunke [?] gave an example of what we are saying when she  said, "I have found nothing in the articles but trivialization,  which does not satisfy a researcher's thirst."    We will make an effort to point up the truth of what these  fair-minded ones believed, to show the refinement and role of  the Arabs in human civilization. We will also touch on  orientalism and make its concept and aims clear. We will examine  the orientalists' ideas and learn their views on thhe Crusades,  and make an effort to respond to the orientalists with the  meager sources available to us.    We will, of course, focus on sources containing the points  of  the orientalists who treated the Arabs and their culture fairly  first of all. Then we will turn to the unfair orientalists who  were prejudiced against the Arabs and Islam, under the influence  of many motives and factors, lacking the spirit of objectivity  and fairness.    Research depends upon the book of German orientalist, Dr.  Sigrid Hunke [?] in her valuable book The Arab Sun Shines  on the West and the book of orientalist Anthony West  The Crusades, in addition to the books of Gustave  Lebon, of researcher Subhi 'Abd-al-Hamid (The Arabs'  Decisive Battles) and Montgomery Watt (The Influence  of Islam on Europe), and Dr. Salih Muhammad al-'Abid's  article "The Crusades: Causes and Motives" in AL-MAWRID magazine.  <H5>  The Concept of Orientalism and Its Goals </H5>   Orientalism, as a term, is a science devoted to studying the  languages, heritage, culture, past, and present of the Orient.  Linguistically, orientalism is the east, the place where the sun  rises.    The studies that involve the oriental world have been  labeled  "orientalism," and the Westerners who undertake these studies  are termed "orientalists."    Orientalism grew and thrived side by side with the  imperialism that Europe experienced in the era of industrial,  military, and cultural development; every country sought to  compete with its neighbors for the greatest possible number of  colonies, to exploit them for political and economic ends. Among  these was the Vatican, in which orientalism grew and developed,  making the Vatican a small-scale religious state with an army of  priests. It led Europe politically, militarily, and religously,  from the Crusades down to the present day. One example of its  interest in orientalism was the founding of the Maronite College  in 1754, which was dedicated to graduating orientalists, and  still graduates students interested in orientalism in the  present day.    And the orientalists, they are those who are involved in the  affairs of the Islamic east, who have eagerly devoted themselves  to studying it and following its cultural, historical,  religious, and social topics.    One might remark that it has no specific beginning point.  Some researchers pinpoint its having begin in the first century  AD; others say it began with the Crusades, while we find that  the Christian west dates the beginning of official orientalism  with the publication of the clerical decision of the Vienna  Conclave, in 1312, to endow numerous professorial chairs in the  Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac languages at European universities  such as Paris and Oxford.    It is likeliest, however, that the real establishment of  orientalism was in the 18th century, when the west colonized the  Muslim world and gained control over its properties, usurping  manuscripts and taking them for their own libraries.    In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the first  orientalist conference was held in Paris in 1873. And  orientalist conferences have continued to be held.  <H5>  Motives and Goals of Orientalism </H5>   The principal motive of orientalism is rooted in the  struggle  between the Islamic and Christian worlds in Muslim Spain and  Sicily. The Crusades, in particular, got the Europeans  interested in learning about Islam and its practices.    Orientalism has many aims, perhaps most of all the  prevention  of the spread of Islam in Europe, and the attempt to estrange  Muslims from their faith and spread dissension in their ranks.  The orientalist establishment also seeks to appropriate  religious ideas from Islam in order to base the principles of  the church on rational religious ideas, since Europeans shunned  clerical logic that flew in the face of science.    The orientalist movement turned its attention to serving  colonialism by revealing the mentalities, moods, and weak points  of the orientals preparatory to missionary and imperialist  campaigns.    Among the aims of orientalism is the destruction of the  intellectual unity of the Islamic community by spreading  doctrinal disputes to divide and sectarianize, for a  fragmentation throughout the community. It also fragmented the  linguistic unity of the Islamic community and weakened the  Islamic personality, creating a spirit of disunion and feelings  of inferiority in the souls of the orientals. It spread doubt  about the values, principles, and ideals they cherished. The  orientalists also sought to make orientalist studies a source  for educating Muslims about Islam.  <H5>  Phases of Orientalism </H5>   A. The first phase began when the clergy moved the theology  and philosophy of Greece from the Arabs to Rome, as the church  in the west was backward and intellectually wanting.    B. The second phase was when orientalism became manifest in  the 17th century, forming a distorted idea of Islam in Europe.  It was largely based on the writings of the orientalists of the  first phase, after the Crusades. This phase was notable for  obscuring the eastern Arab world of Muslim Arabs with a motive  of hidden hatred, contrary to what it tried to claim about being  impartial and scientifically objective.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT OF BULGARIA QUITS UNDER PRESSURE  </P> <P> Bowing to mounting pressure, Bulgarian President Petar Mladenov submitted his  resignation Friday amid swirling controversy over remarks caught on videotape  last December in which he talked about using tanks to disperse an  anti-government protest.  </P> <P> Mladenov's letter of resignation was read on national television at 8 p.m.,  meeting a deadline set by striking students in an ultimatum issued earlier in  the day.  </P> <P> His decision to step down sent thousands of Bulgarians into the streets to  rejoice.  </P> <P> "Never again a Communist president in Bulgaria!" an activist of the opposition  Union of Democratic Forces told about 5,000 people gathered outside Mladenov's  office after he quit.  </P> <P> "Never! Never!" they shouted back. Many chanted "Victory!" and danced and  hugged each other. Some carried banners that called Mladenov a liar. Others  pulled model tanks up and down the pavement, mocking the former president.  </P> <P> Mladenov, a Communist reformer who oversaw Bulgaria's transition to a  multi-party democracy, submitted his resignation to the newly elected  Parliament "in order not to be a reason to increase political tension,"  Bulgarian television reported.  </P> <P> Political opposition parties and hundreds of student protesters had joined in  calls for his resignation. Even the newspaper of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  -- the former Communist Party -- joined calls for his resignation.  </P> <P> "Politics is a man's game," the newspaper Douma said in a front-page editorial.  "Someone who is not good enough has to leave the stage."  </P> <P> The Union of Democratic Forces issued a statement also urging Mladenov to  resign. Trade unions, other opposition groups and the mainstream Agrarian Party  also backed the students' demands, the official BTA news agency reported.  </P> <P> The attacks on Mladenov were sparked by an amateur videotape in which he is  heard to say "Let the tanks come" to quash a stormy protest last Dec. 14. About  50,000 demonstrators had converged on Parliament to demand that the Communist  Party give up its monopoly on power. But they later dispersed peacefully and  tanks were not called in.  </P> <P> The words -- seemingly addressed to no one in particular -- have also been  translated as "It is better for the tanks to come."  </P> <P> The videotape was broadcast on TV on an election program by the Union of  Democratic Forces, three days before the June 17 parliamentary runoff  elections.  </P> <P> After weeks of silence, Mladenov, in a nationwide television address on  Wednesday, implicitly admitted having called for the use of tanks during the  protests but said that his words had been taken out of context. He also said  that he opposes violence and never intended that tanks be deployed against  anti-government demonstrators.  </P> <P> "I am deeply convinced the Bulgarian people . . . would not believe the word,  but the deed," Mladenov said, seeking to put the controversy to rest.  </P> <P> But his comments came only after experts said the videotape was authentic. He  had earlier said the video had been doctored.  </P> <P> Political observers said many Bulgarians were angered not so much by the words  themselves as by Mladenov's initial refusal to acknowledge that he made the  remark, despite the clear evidence of the videotape, which was examined by  specialists and determined to be authentic.  </P> <P> Mladenov, 53, was initially regarded as a reformer after ousting veteran  Communist leader Todor Zhivkov in a party purge last November.  </P> <P> After replacing Zhivkov as Communist Party leader and president, Mladenov  immediately began taking cautious steps toward reform and opened a dialogue  with opposition groups that quickly organized.  </P> <P> He became president in April and led the country to its first free elections in  four decades last month.  </P> <P> Also in April, the Communists changed their name to the Socialist Party and  ended up winning 211 of the 400 seats in Parliament in the June elections. The  Union of Democratic Forces won 144 seats.  </P> <P> Mladenov was to have served until the Parliament drew up a new democratic  constitution, in about 18 months.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov appeared on national TV shortly after Mladenov's  resignation was announced and appealed for order so the Parliament could meet  Tuesday for its first session in a calm atmosphere.  </P> <P> About 1,000 of the student strikers had gathered in front of the presidential  building since Wednesday to press their demands for Mladenov's resignation.  </P> <P> They had called for a 30-minute warning strike if Mladenov did not step down by  8 p.m. Friday and a general strike on Monday if he had not resigned by then.  </P> <P> Most of the original demands of the students, on strike since June 11, have  been fulfilled, including the resignation of the TV director and publication of  alleged election irregularities.  </P> <P> But according to BTA, the students drew up a new list of demands Friday. They  have demanded that a date be set for a public trial of Zhivkov, 78, who is in  detention. He has been charged with misappropriation of state property,  inciting ethnic hostility and grave abuse of power.  </P> <P> They also demand the removal of parliamentary deputies associated with the  former Communist regime's decisions, such as setting up harsh prison camps and  agreeing to take part in the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.  </P></p>

In a concerted public opinion campaign, the Maltese  government is trying to persuade the EU to give the green light  at its Corfu summit in June for the talks to begin. That  message will be given loud and clear to members of the European  Parliament when they visit Malta next week. It follows a  vigorous diplomatic offensive by the prime minister, Dr Edward  Fenech Adami, on a visit to Brussels on 2 February.    The Maltese government believes public opinion in the EU is  moving its way. But they are likely to find that while there is  appreciation of the economic reforms now under way to prepare  the country for membership, the EU does not want to be pushed  into negotiations.    "It is still too early. There is no question of us putting  together a negotiating mandate this year. I think we would  rather look at this early next year," said one senior EU source,  confirming the opinion of the commissioner in charge of  enlargement talks, Hans van den Broek, that reforms must be  carried out before formal negotiations can begin.    It is hardly surprising that the Maltese government is  pushing for entry. The policy has been the main thrust of  Fenech Adami's ruling Nationalist Party since it was elected to  office in 1987, and it is politically important that it be seen  to be delivering before the next elections, possibly in 1996.  Last week Fenech Adami stressed Malta's European affiliations.    "If Malta had been an independent state immediately after  the  Second World War, we would have been, no doubt, among the  founding members of the European Community," he suggested. Many  question whether the Union can accommodate Malta slightly larger  than Luxembourg and with a population of 380,000 -- without a  significant institutional upheaval.    To such sceptics, Fenech Adami replies: "My view is that  Europe has institutional problems. But this should not be an  obstacle to starting negotiations, especially with Malta. We  should be treated on our own merits."    Malta is at pains to stress the pace of economic reform it  has set in train. By Easter it will have tabled at least 16  bills in areas ranging from financial services to consumer  protection. From next January its fiscal system will be fully  in line with that of the Union.    But the government may well find itself under pressure to  liberalise a number of state-controlled companies which enjoy  monopolistic powers over the production of fresh milk (Malta  Dairy Products), importation of cereals (Medigrain Ltd), the  country's only casino (Casma Ltd) and ferry services (Gozo  Channel).    Demands are coming from consumers who believe they will  benefit from greater competition and from a number of companies  who are confident they can operate more efficiently and  profitably in these areas. The Gozo Channel's monopoly on  ferrying passengers and cargo between Malta and Gozo has sparked  off a fierce debate in the country's media. The company has  successfully objected to a licence being given to any competitor.</p>

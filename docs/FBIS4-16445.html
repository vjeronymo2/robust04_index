			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reprint of undated letter from A.A. Kotenev, chairman of </F> the Russian Afghanistan Veterans Council Board: "Calling Afghan  War Veterans"]    [Text] This document, bearing an Afghanistan Veterans'  Union [AVU] letterhead and marked "For Official Use Only," was  distributed to the heads of the organization's regional  branches. There is barely any need for comment. It is easy to  see what is going on: They are trying to involve Aghanistan war  veterans in dangerous games on the side of political forces  yearning for power at any price.    [Letter begins] In connection with the rapidly changing  sociopolitical situation as a result of the process of the  redistribution of material wealth among the major financial and  industrial groups, which have already found it necessary to  express their own interests in the political sphere and have  joined in the active power struggle in the country, the AVU  Board is proposing that all regional branches carry out the  following measures:    1. At the end of each month, beginning this April, republic,  kray, and oblast leaders will report in writing to the AVU Board  on the sociopolitical situation in their particular region, the  presence of political and public organizations, and their  orientation, plans, influence on the masses, and contacts with  our movement.    2. In the first report, which we expect by 30 April, we ask  you to indicate:    -- the precise addresses and telephone numbers of AVU  branches, beginning with rayon and settlement components, and  also the full names of leaders;    -- if any administration leaders in your region are  Afghanistan war veterans, whether you have contacts with them  (if there are no contacts and mutual understanding, find out the  reasons and try to get these people on your side);    -- whether there are members of the "Russia's Choice"  movement in the region, what posts they occupy, and whether you  are seeking a mutual understanding with them;    -- the general mood of the population, its political  orientation, and the attitude toward local and central authority  and our movement;    -- whether you have contacts with the local media and at  what level. If such contacts do not exist, they should be  established immediately and a campaign must begin to  propagandize the AVU and its ideas. What newspapers are  published in your area, their orientation, addresses, and  telephone nunmbers and the full names of the chief editors;    -- what work is being done in your area on local  self-government elections, if any AVU member has been elected  deputy, and whether or not he has severed links with the  organization;    -- report on the presence of youth and military-patriotic  clubs and other associations in your region and what influence  you have on them. Resume work immediately in that sphere if you  have neglected to do so;    -- tell us your proposals on the possibility of a united  effort at the future presidential elections.    We ask you to treat this letter as seriously and responsibly  as possible. Remember that you have saved the homeland from  civil war chaos on two occasions already. You have supported  the course of reforms and the institution of president, as  guarantor of stability, and the form of political organization  in Russia and who will head it will soon depend on us.    We can also report that we are currently making joint  preparations with "Russia's Choice" for a founding congress of a  new political party.    [signed] A.A. Kotenev, chairman of the Russian Afghanistan  Veterans Council Board.</p>

State Councillor Li Guixian  attended the meeting and heard the deputies' views. Sun Qimeng,  vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee, and members of the  NPC Standing Committee Yang Jike and Yang Zhenhuai took part in  the discussion. Deputies Wang Hanhua, Wang Yang, Wang Shengbao,  Fang Yiben, and Wang Shixin expressed their views on such issues  as [words indistinct] the reform of the banking, fiscal and  taxation systems, commodity prices, and how to strengthen the  role of agriculture as the foundation of national economy.    Zhou Zhengqing, NPC deputy and vice governor of the People's  Bank of China, spoke on an issue about which people are  concerned about -- the reform of the banking system. State  Councillor Li Guixian spoke after hearing the deputies' views.  He said: We will take your problems and suggestions back to  our office for serious discussion and study.    On the government work report, Li Guixian said: The report  is very clear. Its emphasis is to handle well the relationship  among reform, development, and stability. Now, it won't do  without reform and development, and reform and development  cannot be accomplished without a stable environment. In light  of the current situation, the party Central Committee has put  forward the 20-character principle -- the principle of seizing  the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability. This is the stress of  the work of the whole party and the whole country. The whole  party and the people of all nationalities across the country  should uphold the principle. At present, we are having a good  opportunity of deepening reform and accelerating development.  In order to achieve development, we must carry out reform and  open up. We must reform the old structure and establish a new  structure of socialist market economy. Only in this way can we  accelerate development. All the reform measures promulgated  this year are designed to lay a foundation for establishing  socialist market economic structure. If these measures are not  implemented well, we will be unable to establish the socialist  market economic structure. For this reason, we must not fail in  their implementation. We must promptly deal with new  circumstances and problems which might crop up during the course  of reform and development. [passage indistinct]    Li Guixian said: After the prices are decontrolled, we must  not treat the price increase problem lightly. Effective  measures must be adopted to curb price increases and stabilize  the market. At the same time, we must solve well the problem  concerning the livelihood of the workers and staff members of  enterprises which suffer operating losses. We must also solve  the problem of teachers' back pay. We must oppose waste and  extravagance, reduce unnecessary spendings, and guarantee [words  indistinct].    The person in charge of the Ministry of Electronics Industry  attended the meeting and heard the deputies' views.</p>

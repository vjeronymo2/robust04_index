			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Riyadh survives its post war boom and mini-bust - A vigorous Saudi equity market There are few more lively social spots in a Riyadh evening than the crowded and often sumptuous share trading salons of some of the city's bigger banks. A highly upmarket betting shop might come to mind were such notions not so unIslamic. Directly after the Gulf war the association with gambling was not, however, entirely inappropriate to Saudi Arabia's stock market. Having languished illiquidly throughout most of the 1980s, the market suddenly burst to life on a surge of speculative buying, more than doubling the official index within a year, prompting a flush of new issues and recapitalisations and recording some huge oversubscriptions in the process. That speculative bubble has since deflated. The index has long since flipped from its record high of 233 in April 1992 and has, for the past few months, settled at a steady and modest level of around 180. And, oddly, it is this which gives bankers and economists in the kingdom such cheer: in a region notorious for investors' propensity for speculative excess, Saudi Arabia's stock market has survived a boom and mini-bust and is still going relatively strong. Although down from its post-war peaks, the market has developed beyond measure from its pre-war doldrums to become considerably the biggest and most vigorous equity market in the Middle East. At current prices, the market is capitalised at around Dollars 50bn - dwarfing the region's second biggest market in Jordan, where the total value of issued shares is just above Dollars 3bn. In sharp contrast to the sleepy bourses in Kuwait or Bahrain, trade is also fast and furious: the 35m shares traded in 1992 were worth more than Dollars 3.4bn. The rush of speculative funds which revived the market is mainly over. This was largely the effect of a huge repatriation of wealth by Saudi investors after the Gulf War, partly out of disappointment at the rewards available in international markets and partly out of renewed confidence at the returns and security of investments available at home. Some economists estimate that SR30bn (Dollars 8.1bn) of private wealth made its way back and, because of the religious opprobrium attaching to interest-bearing instruments, found its home in stocks or property. On this tidal wave of money (the value of annual transactions rose to SR13.6bn in 1992 from SR4.4bn two years earlier), numerous companies, in particular nine of the joint stock banks, took the opportunity to recapitalise. The subsequent rise in liquidity has given the market a lift and, in general, the number of transactions is now seven times what it was before the war. But many analysts wonder if the market has reached its natural limit. They point out that while the market is far busier and bigger than any in the region, only about 7 to 10 per cent of issued stocks are actually traded; the remainder tend to rest in the hands of the few wealthy Saudi individuals who dominate the market and effectively serve as market-makers. While they are more content to hold than to trade the bulk of their holdings, the market's growth will be constrained. New scrip would help, but there are few immediate signs of this. Only three of the kingdom's 2,000 manufacturing companies have so far come to market, and only three companies plan to do so in the near future. This reflects the predominant ownership structure of most enterprises in the kingdom, which tend to be closely held family concerns, with a tendency to resist both the reporting requirements and dilution of ownership entailed in a listing. Without new paper, trades will also continue to concentrate in just a few leading shares. At present, trade in the eleven listed banks makes up 70 per cent of the daily average trades in all 58 quoted companies - largely due to the flood of shares made available during the past two years' banking recapitalisation. Banks make up six of the market's top ten capitalised companies. But in the absence of new listings, some market users believe that the exchange could give itself a further fillip by altering its trading structure. At present all trades must be done through the banks, who are allowed exclusive use of the floorless electronic trading system. A substantial grey market also exists but all informal brokers must deal finally through banking share rooms. Many believe that the absence of a trading floor is depriving the market of a central arena of information and worsens what they say is already a high propensity to trade on privileged information. It has been suggested that this is an obstacle to opening the market to overseas investors. But while a number of bankers are beginning to investigate possible vehicles for attracting foreigners, the central bank has shown no signs so far of changing the rules.</p>

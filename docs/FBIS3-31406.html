			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The basic difference  between the government and deputies' bills on early elections  lies in the date of the elections. While the government  proposes to hold early elections in June, the deputies' bill  envisages them on November 11-12. Both proposals will be  discussed today.    The government bill proposes that parliament electoral term  and the mandates of deputies elected to the now-defunct  Czechoslovak Federal Parliament two years ago terminate by June  30. It justifies shortening the electoral term and calling  early elections by the fact that the current distribution of  forces in parliament does not allow laws to be passed, as both  the government coalition and the opposition have about 75  mandates in the 150-member parliament.    According to the bill, early elections would cost about 150  million crowns ($5 million). If parliamentary elections are  held simultaneously with local elections the total expenditure  would amount to 180 million crowns (some $6 million). About 100  million crowns would be saved if parliamentary and local  elections were prepared together, according to the government  bill.    If the two strongest parliamentary parties -- the governing  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and Democratic Left  Party (SDL) -- failed to agree on the date for early elections  and if the deputies' proposal was supported by the opposition  and the government bill by representatives of the coalition  (HZDS and part of the Slovak National Party, SNS) then nine  votes of the "fresh dissidents" from the ranks of the HZDS could  prove decisive.    Speculation has also appeared that deputies from the  Hungarian minority parties -- the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement (MKDH) and the Egyutteles (Coexistence) movement --  could support the government proposal since they are sure of  support from their voters irrespective of the current political  situation in the country.</p>

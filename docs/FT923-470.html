			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / (CORRECTED) The FT Review of Business Books (21): The Confucian way to excellence Correction (published 30th September 1992) appended to this article. THE COMPLETE BOOK OF BUSINESS ETIQUETTE THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO GETTING AHEAD IN BUSINESS by Lynne Brennan and David Block Piatkus Books Pounds 8.99, 185 pages IMAGINE TRYING to run a factory with 60,000 employees, required to produce enough nails for one billion people. You cannot fire anyone, you cannot raise wages, you cannot even quit (though you can be tossed back to peasant-servitude for failing to meet the annual nail quota). Information is scarce, spare parts are unavailable, and half the foremen cannot read. How on earth do Chinese managers manage? Malcolm Warner sheds some light on this mystery in his fascinating study, How Chinese Managers Learn, the first book to examine management and industrial training in China. A Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge, Professor Warner traces the development of management training in China since 1984, when the Central Committee set the goal of creating 'a mighty contingent of managerial and technical cadres'. The book examines the characteristics of Chinese management and reviews the programmes put in place to train managers: courses, curriculi, examinations, faculty, funding and links to industrial enterprises and government institutions. As Professor Warner points out, trying to teach one billion people to produce things in huge enterprises is no easy task, not least in a country where the Cultural Revolution wiped out a generation of managers and trainers. Nevertheless, the 1980s economic reforms forced China to accept that a successful, productive economy requires a trained workforce. Since only 1 per cent of the Chinese population is admitted to higher education (the figure is 9 per cent in India and 30 per cent in Japan), the task is enormous. Moreover, the whole idea of training managers sits uncomfortably with ancient Chinese traditions, such as absolute respect for one's elders. So China embarked upon a quest to teach modern technological skills with a Confucian twist. Professor Warner describes (in painstaking detail) the various schemes that have been instituted. There are senior executive training centres (for managers of large factories) in six large cities: Beijing, Chengdu, Fuzhhou, Shanghai, Tianjin and Wuhan. Universities conduct programmes ranging from operations effectiveness and managerial economics to management of pharmaceutical enterprises. The World Bank, western universities and other western institutions participate in many of these programmes. There is even a China-European Community Joint MBA programme, which the book examines in depth. The important question is whether all this training has made a difference. The book suggests that results are mixed. Efforts to create a truly dynamic managerial caste have been hindered by the Confucian element, which reveres the instructor and expects passive subordination from the student. Professor Warner writes that 95 per cent of senior managers pass the main examination because it would be too embarrassing for the state to send them back home if they flunked. On the other hand, management training has become immensely popular in China, attracting top-calibre students and professors. Every bright Chinese youth wants an MBA these days. And with Guangdong Province growing at 15 per cent per annum, perhaps we should send a few more Westerners to study over there. CORRECTION In Tuesday's Business Books Review, an incorrect book title appeared in the review headlined 'The Confucian way to excellence' on page 10. The book reviewed is How Chinese Managers Learn, by Malcolm Warner (Macmillan, Pounds 40, 211 pages).</p>

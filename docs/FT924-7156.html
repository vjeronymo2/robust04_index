			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Long-term jobless at 4 1/2-year peak THE number of people out of work for more than a year rose by 50,000 in the three months to October to a 4 1/2 -year high of 956,000, the Department of Employment reported yesterday. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said the increase was the smallest for a year and that the total was still 30 per cent below the peak in April 1986. But the latest total is the highest since April 1988 and is almost double the level when the upward trend began in October 1990. More than a third of those on the dole have been jobless for more than 12 months. The number of people out of work for more than six months stands at 1,521,000. Long-term unemployment in the last quarter rose in every region, with the biggest increases in London, the south-east, the south-west and East Anglia. Mrs Shephard said that additional help was being given to the long-term unemployed through the expansion of Jobclubs and the job interview guarantee scheme. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said government spending on training was only Pounds 803 per unemployed person compared with Pounds 1,708 in 1989-90. He alleged that more training cuts were on the way. The Labour party also calculated that long-term unemployment was costing the taxpayer Pounds 8.15bn a year.</p>

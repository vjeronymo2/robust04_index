Kumkumian, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;102), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;594&hyph;6758. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the ICH: Janet Showalter, Office of Health Affairs (HFY&hyph;50), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;443&hyph;1382. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations to promote Harmonisation of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed to enhance Harmonisation and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of Harmonisation is to identify and then reduce differences in technical requirements for drug development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite Harmonisation initiatives to be developed with input from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others. ICH is concerned with Harmonisation of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products among three regions: the European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, FDA, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and IFPMA, as well as observers from the World Health Organization, the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 15, 1994, the ICH Steering Committee agreed that a consensus draft guideline entitled ``Impurities In New Drug Substances,'' which was developed by the Quality Expert Working Group of the ICH, should be made available for public comment. The draft guideline will be made available for comment by the European Commission and Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, as well as by FDA, in accordance with their respective consultation procedures. Comments about this draft will be considered by FDA and the Expert Working Group. Ultimately, FDA intends to adopt the ICH Steering Committee's final guideline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft guideline is intended to provide guidance to applicants for drug marketing registration on the content and qualification of impurities in new drug substances produced by chemical syntheses and not previously registered in a country, region, or member State. The draft guideline is not intended to apply to new drug substances used during the clinical research stage of development or clinical trials. The draft guideline also does not apply to biological/biotechnological substances, peptides, radiopharmaceuticals, fermentation and semisynthetic products derived from that process, herbal products, and crude products of animal or plant origin. Impurities in new drug substances are addressed in the draft guideline from two perspectives: (1) Chemistry aspects_classification and identification of impurities, report generation, setting specifications, and a brief discussion of analytical procedures; and (2) safety aspects_guidance for qualifying impurities that were not present in batches of the new drug substance used in safety and clinical studies and/or impurity levels substantially higher than in those batches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, guidelines have generally been issued under &sect;10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the use of guidelines to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that are acceptable to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising &sect;10.90(b). Therefore, if the agency issues this guideline in final form, the guideline would not be issued under the authority of current &sect;10.90(b), and would not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person, nor would it operate to bind FDA in any way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may, on or before December 6, 1994, to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) submit written comments on the draft guideline . Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The draft guideline and received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the draft guideline follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Impurities in New Drug Substances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Preamble <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This document is intended to provide guidance for registration applications on the content and qualification of impurities in new drug substances produced by chemical syntheses and not previously registered in a region or member State. It is not intended to apply to the regulation of new drug substances used during the clinical research stage of development, e.g., investigational new drugs or clinical trials exemptions. Biological/biotechnological, peptide, radiopharmaceutical, fermentation, and semisynthetic products derived therefrom, herbal products, and crude products of animal or plant origin are not covered. Impurities in new drug substances are addressed from two perspectives:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemistry aspects include classification and identification of impurities, report generation, setting specifications, and a brief discussion of analytical procedures; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety aspects include specific guidance for qualifying impurities which were not present in batches of new drug substance used in safety and clinical studies and/or impurity levels substantially higher than in those batches. Threshold limits are described below which qualification should not be necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Classification of Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Impurities may be classified into the following categories: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic Impurities (Process and Drug Related) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inorganic Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Residual Solvents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic impurities may arise during the manufacturing process and/or storage of the new drug substance. They may be identified or unidentified, volatile or nonvolatile, and include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Starting Materials <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By-Products <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intermediates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Degradation Products <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reagents, Ligands, and Catalysts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inorganic impurities may derive from the manufacturing process. They are normally known and identified and include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reagents, Ligands, and Catalysts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Heavy Metals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inorganic Salts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other Materials (e.g., Filter Aids, Charcoal, etc.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Solvents are organic or inorganic liquids used during the manufacturing process. Since these are generally of known toxicity, the selection of appropriate controls is easily accomplished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Excluded from this document are: Extraneous contaminants which should not occur in new drug substances and are more appropriately addressed as good manufacturing practice issues; polymorphic form, a solid state property of the new drug substance; and enantiomeric impurities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Rationale for the Reporting and Control of Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 3.1 Organic Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant should summarize those actual and potential impurities most likely to arise during the synthesis, purification, and storage of the new drug substance. This summary should be based on sound scientific appraisal of the chemical reactions involved in the synthesis, impurities associated with raw materials which could contribute to the impurity profile of the new drug substance, and possible degradation products. This discussion need only include those impurities that may reasonably be expected based on knowledge of the chemical reactions and conditions involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the applicant should summarize the laboratory studies conducted to detect impurities in the new drug substance. This summary should include test results of batches manufactured during the development process and batches from the proposed commercial process, as well as results of intentional degradation studies used to identify potential impurities arising during storage. Assessment of the proposed commercial process may be deferred until the first batch is produced for marketing. The impurity profile of the drug substance lots intended for marketing should be compared with those used in development and any differences discussed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The studies conducted to characterize the structure of actual impurities present in the new drug substance at or above an apparent level of 0.1 percent (e.g., calculated using the response factor of the drug substance) should be described. Note that, identification of all recurring impurities at or above the 0.1 percent level is expected in batches manufactured by the proposed commercial process. Degradation products observed in stability studies at labelled storage temperatures should be similarly identified. When identification of an impurity is not feasible, a summary of the laboratory studies demonstrating the unsuccessful effort should be included in the application. Where attempts have been made to identify impurities below the 0.1 percent level, it is useful also to report the results of these studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Identification of impurities below apparent levels of 0.1 percent is generally not considered necessary. However, identification should be attempted for those potential impurities that are expected to be unusually potent, producing toxic or pharmacologic effects at a level lower than 0.1 percent. In all cases, impurities should be qualified as described later in this guideline. Although it is common practice to round analytical results of between 0.05 and 0.09 percent to the nearest number (i.e., 0.1 percent), for the purpose of these guidelines, such values would not be rounded to 0.1 percent and these impurities would not require identification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 3.2 Inorganic Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Inorganic impurities are normally detected and quantitated using pharmacopeial or other appropriate procedures. Carry over of catalysts to the new drug substance should be evaluated during development. The need for inclusion or exclusion of inorganic impurities in the new drug substance specifications should be discussed. Limits are based on pharmacopeial standards of known safety data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 3.3 Solvents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The control of residues of the solvents used in the manufacturing process for the new drug substance should be discussed. Any solvents which may appear in the drug substance should be quantified using analytical procedures with an appropriate level of sensitivity. Pharmacopeial or other appropriate procedures should be utilized. Limits are based on pharmacopeial standards or known safety data taking into consideration dose, duration of treatment, and route of administration. Particular attention should be given to quantitation of toxic solvents used in the manufacturing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Analytical Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The registration application should include documented evidence that the analytical procedures are validated and suitable for the detection and quantitation of impurities. Differences in the analytical procedures used during development and proposed for the commercial product should be discussed in the registration application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic impurity levels can be measured by a variety of techniques, including those which compare an analytical response for an impurity to that of an appropriate reference standard or to the response of the new drug substance itself. Reference standards used in the analytical procedures for control of impurities should be evaluated and characterized according to their intended use. It is considered acceptable to use the drug substance to estimate the levels of impurities. In cases where the response factors are not close, this practice may still be acceptable, provided a correction factor is applied or the impurities are, in fact, being overestimated. Specifications and analytical procedures used to estimate identified or unidentified impurities are often based on analytical assumptions (e.g., equivalent detector response, etc.). The assumptions should be discussed in the registration application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Reporting Impurity Content of Batches <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Analytical results should be provided for all batches of the new drug substance used for clinical, safety, and stability testing, as well as batches representative of the proposed commercial process. The content of individual identified and unidentified and total impurities, observed in these batches of the new drug substance, should be reported with the analytical procedures indicated. A tabulation (e.g., spreadsheet) of the data is recommended. Impurities should be designated by code number or by an appropriate descriptor, e.g., retention time. Levels of impurities which are present but below the validated limit of quantitation need not be reported. When analytical procedures change during development, reported results should be linked with the procedure used, with appropriate validation information provided. Representative chromatograms should be provided. Chromatograms of such representative batches, from methods validation studies showing separation and detectability of impurities (e.g., on spiked samples), along with any other impurity tests routinely performed, can serve as the representative impurity profiles. The applicant should ensure that complete impurity profiles (i.e., chromatograms) of individual batches are available if requested. A tabulation should be provided which links the specific new drug substance batch to each safety study and each clinical study in which it has been used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For each batch of the new drug substance, the report should include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Batch Identity and Size <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date of Manufacture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Site of Manufacture <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturing Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impurity Content, Individual and Total <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use of Batches <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reference to Analytical Procedure Used <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Specification Limits for Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The specifications for a new drug substance should include limits for impurities. Stability studies, chemical development studies, and routine batch analyses can be used to predict those impurities likely to occur in the commercial product. The selection of impurities to include in the new drug substance specifications should be based on the impurities found in batches manufactured by the proposed commercial process. Those impurities selected for inclusion in the specifications for the new drug substance are referred to as ``specified impurities'' in these guidelines. Specified impurities may be identified or unidentified and are individually listed in the new drug substance specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A rationale for the inclusion or exclusion of impurities in the specifications should be presented. This rationale should include a discussion of the impurity profiles observed in the safety and clinical development batches together with a consideration of the impurity profile of material manufactured by the proposed commercial process. Specific identified impurities should be included along with recurring unidentified impurities estimated to be at or above 0.1 percent. For impurities known to be unusually potent or to produce toxic or unexpected pharmacological effects, the sensitivity of the analytical methods should be commensurate with the level at which the impurities are to be controlled. For unidentified impurities, the procedure used and assumptions made in establishing the level of the impurity should be clearly stated. Unidentified impurities included in the specifications should be referred to by some appropriate qualitative analytical descriptive label (e.g., ``unidentified A,'' ``unidentified with relative retention of 0.9,'' etc.). Finally, a general specification limit of not more than 0.1 percent for any unspecified impurity should be included. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limits should be set no higher than the level which can be justified by safety data, and, unless safety data indicate otherwise, no lower than the level achievable by the manufacturing process and the analytical capability. In other words, where there is no safety concern, impurity specifications are based on data generated on actual batches of the new drug substance allowing sufficient latitude to deal with normal manufacturing and analytical variation, and the stability characteristics of the new drug substance. Although normal manufacturing variations are expected, significant variation in batch-to-batch impurity levels may indicate that the manufacturing process of the new drug substance is not adequately controlled and validated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the new drug substance specifications should include, where applicable, limits for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each Specified Identified Impurity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each Specified Unidentified Impurity at or above 0.1 percent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any Unspecified Impurity, with a limit of not more than 0.1 percent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Residual Solvents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inorganic Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A summation of assay value and impurity levels can be used to obtain mass balance for the test sample. The mass balance need not add to exactly 100 percent because of the analytical error associated with each analytical procedure. The summation of impurity levels plus the assay value may be misleading, e.g., when the assay procedure is nonspecific (e.g., potentiometric titrimetry) and the impurity level is relatively high. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Qualification of Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Qualification is the process of acquiring and evaluating data which establishes the biological safety of an individual impurity or a given impurity profile at the level(s) specified. The applicant should provide a rationale for selecting impurity limits based on safety considerations. The level of any impurity present in a new drug substance which has been adequately tested in safety and/or clinical studies is considered qualified. Impurities which are also significant metabolites present in animal and/or human studies do not need further qualification. A level of a qualified impurity higher than that present in a new drug substance can also be justified based on an analysis of the actual amount of impurity administered in previous safety studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If data are not available to qualify the proposed specification level of an impurity, studies to obtain such data may be needed when the usual qualification threshold limits given below are exceeded: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,nj,s100,r100 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Maximum daily dose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Qualification threshold <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> &lt; 2 g/day <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.1 percent or 1 milligram <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  per day intake (whichever is <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  lower). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> > 2 g/day <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.05 percent. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Higher or lower threshold limits for qualification of impurities may be appropriate for some individual drugs based on scientific rationale and level of concern, including drug class effects and clinical experience. For example, qualification may be especially important when there is evidence that such impurities in certain drugs or therapeutic classes have previously been associated with adverse reactions in patients. In these instances, a lower qualification threshold limit may be appropriate. Conversely, a higher qualification threshold limit may be appropriate for individual drugs when the level of concern for safety is less than usual based on similar considerations (patient population, drug class effects, clinical considerations, etc.). Technical factors (manufacturing capability and control methodology) may be considered as part of the justification for selection of alternative threshold limits. Proposals for alternative threshold limits are considered on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``Decision Tree for Safety Studies'' (Attachment I) describes considerations for the qualification of impurities when thresholds are exceeded. In some cases, decreasing the level of impurity below the threshold may be simpler than providing safety data. Alternatively, adequate data may be available in the scientific literature to qualify an impurity. If neither is the case, additional safety testing should be considered. The studies desired to qualify an impurity will depend on a number of factors, including the patient population, daily dose, route, and duration of drug administration. Such studies are normally conducted on the new drug substance containing the impurities to be controlled, although studies using isolated impurities are acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </SUPPLEM> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d639 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEN22SE94.000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 10 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->  a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  If considered desirable, a minimum screen for genotoxic potential should be conducted.

New Impurities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> During the course of a drug development program, the qualitative impurity profile of the new drug substance may change, or a new impurity may appear as a result of synthetic route changes, process optimization, scale-up, etc. New impurities may be identified or unidentified. Such changes call for consideration of the need for qualification of the level of the impurity unless it is below the threshold values as noted above. When a new impurity exceeds the threshold, the ``Decision Tree for Safety Studies'' should be consulted. Safety studies should compare the new drug substance containing a representative level of the new impurity with previously qualified material, although studies using the isolated impurity are also acceptable (these studies may not always have clinical relevance). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> Glossary <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical Development Studies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : Studies conducted to scale-up, optimize, and validate the manufacturing process for a new drug substance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Enantiomers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : Compounds with the same molecular formula as the drug substance, which differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms within the molecule and are nonsuperimposable mirror images. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Extraneous Substance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : An impurity arising from any source extraneous to the manufacturing process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Herbal Products <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : Medicinal products containing, exclusively, plant material and/or vegetable drug preparations as active ingredients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Identified Impurity <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : An impurity for which a structural characterization has been achieved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Impurity <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : Any component of the new drug substance which is not the chemical entity defined as the new drug substance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Impurity Profile <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : A description of the identified and unidentified impurities present in a new drug substance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Intermediate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : A material produced during steps of the synthesis of a new drug substance which must undergo further molecular change before it becomes a new drug substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Ligand <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : An agent with a strong affinity to a metal ion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Manufacture <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : All operations related to the new drug substance, including purchase of materials, production, quality control, release, storage, and distribution of the new drug substance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> New Drug Substance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : The designated therapeutic moiety which has not been previously registered in a region or member state (also referred to as a new molecular entity or new chemical entity).

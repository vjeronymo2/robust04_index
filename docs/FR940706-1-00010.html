			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) When the employer has reason to believe that any affected employee who has already been trained does not have the understanding and skill required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the employer shall retrain each such employee. Circumstances where retraining is required include, but are not limited to, situations were: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained the requisite understanding or skill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that these more specific training requirements would also be appropriate with regard to training provided under &sect;1915.152(e). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, as to the need for such requirements and the anticipated impact of those requirements on the shipyard industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Body belts and harnesses in fall arrest systems. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposed &sect;1910.129(b) provided the system performance criteria for personal fall arrest systems. In particular, the proposed paragraph limited maximum arresting force on an employee to 900 pounds (4 kN) when using a body belt and 1,800 pounds (8 kN) when using a body harness. The corresponding provision for shipyard employment, proposed &sect;1915.159(a)(4)(iii), limited maximum arresting force for either belts or harnesses to the lesser of 10 times the employee's weight, or 1,800 pounds (8 kN). The more protective criteria in proposed &sect;1910.129(b) are based on information obtained after the Shipyard PPE proposal was issued (53 FR 48150, Nov. 29, 1988). This information is discussed in the General Industry PPE proposal (55 FR 13423, April 10, 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments and testimony received on proposed &sect;1910.129(b) (Exs. 3:22, 3:31; Tr. 240&hyph;241 and 1374) indicate that the Agency needs to reconsider allowing the use of body belts in fall arrest systems. OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information regarding whether or not body belts should be permitted for use in fall arrest systems, and the anticipated impact on the shipyard industry of any requirement which might limit or prohibit their use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Locking and non-locking snap hooks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposed &sect;1915.159 (a)(15), (a)(16), and (a)(17) prohibited certain snap hook connections (such as, connecting snap hooks to each other) where snap hooks have been known to accidentally disengage, allowing an employee to fall. Proposed &sect;1910.129(c)(1) required that snap hooks, unless of the locking type, and designed for certain connections (such as to each other, to horizontal lifelines, or to incompatibly shaped objects), not be used for these connections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments and testimony received on the general industry provisions (Exs. 3:9, 3:12, 3:19; Tr. 210) has led the Agency to consider a prohibition on the use of non-locking snap hooks in personal fall protection systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, regarding whether or not non-locking snap hooks should be permitted for use in personal fall protection systems or in positioning device systems, and the anticipated impact on the shipyard industry of any requirement which might further limit or prohibit their use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III.

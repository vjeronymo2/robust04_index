			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Booker: where characters have survival in common WE BRITS are proud of our Booker Prize. The Prix Goncourt is latterly being described as the French Booker. But lest we should become too self-congratulatory, too insular about it, this year's panel, led by Lord Gowrie, has ranged well beyond these shores in its choice of the six novels on the short list. The power to award the prize to any writer in English belonging to a country in the Commonwealth or the Republic of Ireland has been taken very much to heart. Every book on the list has a resonance hundreds, if not thousands of miles, from the sound of Bow Bells. One of them also has the distinction of being a first novel, Tibor Fischer's Under the Frog (Polygon). Fischer was born in Stockport in 1959 to Hungarian parents. It is the Hungarian expression 'under a frog's arse down a coalmine' (meaning absolute hell) from which his black comedy gets its title. What is remarkable about it is not so much the heavy masculine humour  -it reminded me somewhat of the Czech, Schweik - as the extraordinary authenticity with which it reconstructs the way of life of two randy members of a travelling basket-ball team in post-war Hungary, their recipes for survival in the period leading up to the revolution of 1956. Most of the leading characters in these novels are survivors of one kind or another. Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (Secker &amp; Warburg) is about a boy of 10 in an imaginary suburb of Dublin where previous novels by this writer have been set. The time is 1968; the likeable lad survives the perils of reaching double figures at a time when his parents are splitting up. Doyle has a wonderful ear for child-speak. He has reached this point in the Booker stakes before but in the past has faded a couple of furlongs from home. Maybe this time in a very funny book he does have the staying-power to reach the post ahead of the rest. If so he will be hotly pursued by two contenders from Canada. Michael Ignatief's Scar Tissue (Chatto) is the most questioning of these books as it takes us deep into that heart-rending condition, dementia. He shows us a philosopher son who has to observe his mother slipping further and further away into the land of non-sequitor and repetitious incomprehension. The people involved happen to be Canadian, but the situation and the sense of survival is universal. Carol Shields is a novelist whose novels only began to appear in the UK three years ago. She was born and brought up in Chicago but has lived in Canada since 1957. Her novel The Stone Diaries (Fourth Estate) has, unlike the rest of the list, a strong domestic flavour, a Mrs Beeton-ish quality as she recalls the life of her heroine born in 1905. She goes through the complete cycle of childhood, marriage, widowhood, remarriage, motherhood and old age. Even if it does not win the Prize this one should sell very well. The Australian, David Malouf, is the big international name here. His earlier book The Great World in 1991 took both the Commonwealth Writers' Prize and the Prix Femina Etranger. With Remembering Babylon (Chatto) his Booker chance starts rather like Golding's Darkness Visible with the emergence into respectable society, that of Queensland, of a barely human creature who 16 years earlier had been brought up by aborigines. His new life among the white Scottish immigrants and impact on them is described in fascinating detail. Caryl Phillips's Crossing the River (Polygon and Penguin) returns to the theme of slavery which he has dealt with in earlier work. Here it concerns the fate of two children. His insight into this condition - the subject of one of last year's winning novels - is equal to that of Toni Morrison. Lord Gowrie said on Kaleidoscope that he wanted the reader of these six novels to feel 'passion' coming through them, to 'have an experience analogous to falling in love'. Passion combines with narrative art in a most interesting, well-chosen list that steers well clear of the expected names: it is on October 26 when we shall know which of these writers has become Pounds 20,000 richer.</p>

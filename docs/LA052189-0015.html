			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Two of the world's richest men, William R. Hewlett and David Packard, were  present when the one-car garage where Hewlett-Packard Co. was founded in 1939  was dedicated in Palo Alto as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. A plaque was  set in the front yard to identify the garage as a historical landmark, where  Hewlett and Packard started a high-tech products company. It now employs 93,000  workers and generated $9.8 billion in sales in the 1988 fiscal year. The  partners' first product 50 years ago was an audio oscillator, a test instrument  purchased by Walt Disney Studios, their first major customer.  </P></p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Inquiry into NatWest data urged LABOUR yesterday called for a full public inquiry into National Westminster Bank's policy of holding information about the political affiliation and religious beliefs of some of its 6.5m personal customers. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said that NatWest's actions were 'a monstrous invasion of people's privacy' and called for legislation to limit the collection and prevent the sale of sensitive personal data by banks. NatWest is believed to be the only one of the four big banks to record this type of information about its customers. The bank said yesterday that it did not solicit the information but if it had data which it judged to be helpful in building up a profile of its customers, it would record it in order to service them more efficiently. NatWest added: 'Banks are about building up a relationship with their customers. You build up the relationship by knowing about them.' It was not able to give any examples of the circumstances in which information such as political affiliation, religious beliefs or dietary habits might be used but denied that it would affect the granting of loans to some customers. Last week Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, raised concerns about the confidentiality of bank customers' personal details. He called for new laws to stamp out the growing black market in confidential personal information. The black market has grown because unauthorised individuals have been able to gain access to personal details by deceiving bank staff into supplying data or because some staff may be knowingly providing it. Mr John Lamidey, the assistant data protection registrar, yesterday said that he was surprised at the type of information recorded by NatWest but noted that it did not contravene the Data Protection Act. This obliges organisations storing personal data on computer to register the type of data recorded. 'Providing the purpose is lawful, the act does not lay down what information you should hold,' he said. Lloyds Bank yesterday said that its centralised computer system held personal details such as religious beliefs only indirectly. For example the file for a devout Moslem, for whom the taking of interest payments is prohibited under Sharia law, would not state his religion but would carry the instruction not to offer the customer details of interest-bearing accounts. Midland Bank said it did not store this type of information and found it strange that NatWest did. Barclays Bank said it did not hold information about customers' political affiliations.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Salinas plays down Nafta deal - Mexicans lower expectations in case US Congress rejects trade pact PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas yesterday played down the importance to Mexico of the North American Free Trade Agreement, in apparent response to concerns that the treaty might be rejected by the US Congress. In a speech which appeared to have been written before US President Bill Clinton's strong endorsement of Nafta yesterday, Mr Salinas said neither the treaty nor the side accords were a panacea. They would not resolve Mexico's problems, and were just one element of the country's opening to the world economy. The Mexican president was speaking as he signed the supplemental accords to the treaty. 'No one will do for Mexico what Mexico does not do for itself,' he said. 'This is the truth, independently of the treaty and the accords.' The president now appears to be lowering the expectations of future wealth generated by Nafta, which he helped build up, and preparing Mexico and foreign investors for the possibility that the US Congress might reject Nafta. The speech was considerably less upbeat than one he gave after the side accords were concluded last month. Mr Andres Rozental, deputy minister of foreign affairs, said: 'It is evident that there is still a question of whether the US constitutional process will be finalised and that obviously has a bearing on the way the treaty is looked at.' Congress is expected to vote on the trade pact later this year. The president chose the signing to stress advances that Mexico had made that did not depend on Nafta. He said Mexico would probably join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development before the end of next year, and would shortly sign a trade treaty with Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia and a separate one with Central America. 'Mexicans', the president said, 'are not waiting for the day that the treaty comes into force to redouble our efforts. We have already been working so that Mexico integrates more intensely with the world economy.'</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (12): A game of wait and see - Germany GERMAN businessmen are well aware of the potential of the South African market - but they are also acutely conscious of the risks. The attractions lie in the country's well developed industrial infrastructure, a cheap labour force and the market of 125m consumers in southern Africa. The downside is equally obvious and can be summed up in one word: instability. 'German companies will invest,' commented a German diplomat in South Africa earlier this year at a trade fair to promote trade between the two countries, 'but only when the framework is in place: that means stability, a market economy and the removal of the danger of nationalisation.' As the BDI, the Federal Association of German Industry, put it in a memorandum last month, the next government in South Africa will face massive challenges in restoring the country's economy. That government may indeed find itself on a collision course with the expectations of the black majority. For the moment German companies have less risky, highly attractive markets on their own doorsteps, in the countries of the former eastern block. China and other markets in the far east are growing so quickly that they form a central part of many Germany companies' medium-term expansion plans. That said, German investment in South Africa should not be underestimated: there are about 350 German businesses or subsidiaries of large German companies in the country, employing 50,000 people. German investors and trade-partners are well-liked in South Africa - not least because German companies adopted a pragmatic approach to sanctions. But that liking is unlikely to be reciprocated further until South Africa offers a degree of stability to investors.</p>

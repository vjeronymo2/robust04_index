			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE  </P> <P> Elizabeth Watson's statement that "maybe Bush deserves congratulations for  choosing Quayle in spite of how foolish a move it seemed about a year ago," in  response to Vice President Dan Quayle's public assessment of "Star Wars,"  deserves comment (letter, Sept. 21).  </P> <P> The job President Bush gave Quayle -- to pop President Reagan's "Star War"  bubble -- could have just as easily been given to any vice president at hand,  or to the secretary of state, for that matter. Quayle remains a disastrously  ignorant next-in-command in case President Bush dies in office.  </P> <P> Seeing how responsibly Bush behaves in his job as President, I hope that at the  end of his first term he will quietly replace Quayle with a fully competent and  knowledgeable person, especially in view of the added danger to Bush from the  Colombian drug cartels.  </P> <P> This country has always taken its luck for granted. We shouldn't have to wait  to see what happens.  </P> <P> HILDA E. WENNER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

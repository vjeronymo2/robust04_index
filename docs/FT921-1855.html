			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / BCCI executive in court today THE first Bank of Credit and Commerce International executive to be charged in England with criminal offences will appear in court in London today. Mr Imran Mohammed Ahmad Iman, former BCCI account manager, will appear before City of London magistrates charged with two offences of conspiracy involving Dollars 179.4m. The Serious Fraud Office said last night that Mr Iman, from Edgware, north London, had been arrested earlier yesterday. The first charge alleges that between January 1 1986 and December 31 1990 Mr Iman conspired with Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, Mr Swaleh Naqvi and other members of BCCI's senior management to falsify the accounting records of BCCI (Overseas) by causing management fees and other charges totalling about Dollars 74.4m to be levied on certain loan accounts 'when to (his) knowledge the borrowers of those loans had been held harmless for all such fees, interest and charges by the bank'. The second charge alleges that between November 30 1987 and September 28 1990, Mr Iman conspired with Mr Abedi, Mr Naqvi, Dr Ghaith R. Pharoan and others to conceal loan guarantees amounting to Dollars 105m required by BCCI's auditors for audit purposes. Mr Iman is the second man to be charged in England in connection with BCCI. Last month Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi, a former managing director of Attock Oil, a group based in London, was charged with conspiracy. He is accused of conspiring with Mr Basheer Chowdry, BCCI's former UK regional general manager, and other members of BCCI senior management to supply false information to BCCI auditors showing that Attock Oil owed BCCI more than Dollars 76m. Mr Baqi has been released on bail and is due in court again on May 16.</p>

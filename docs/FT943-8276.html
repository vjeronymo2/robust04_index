			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Gallery chief apologises over Getty comments Mr Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, yesterday apologised publicly for upsetting Mr John Paul Getty II after the American billionaire philanthropist threatened to withdraw his Pounds 1m pledge to help keep the 'The Three Graces' sculpture in the UK. In a letter leaked to The Times and published yesterday, Mr Getty said he was 'astonished' at Mr Clifford's claim last week that Mr Getty's relationship with his late father may have been a factor in his offer to the fund to stop the statue being sold to the Getty Museum in California. Mr Getty said the claim was 'untrue and very embarrassing' to himself and the Getty Museum, and he threatened to withdraw the offer. The appeal, by the National Galleries of Scotland and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, aims to raise Pounds 7.6m to match the offer from the Getty Museum. Mr Getty's offer of Pounds 1m had left the appeal Pounds 800,000 short of the target. After a visit yesterday to the Department of National Heritage, Mr Clifford said he made his assertion in response to a leading question for which he was unprepared. He said: 'As soon as I said this I regretted the statement. 'With hindsight I realised that I should have utterly rejected the suggestion to the television interviewer as I know nothing about Mr Getty's relationship with his father.' Mr George Levy, a trustee of the London Houses Museum Trust, said: 'It would be tragic if this slight misunderstanding between Mr Clifford and Mr Getty were in any way to prevent 'The Three Graces' staying in Britain.' Mr Getty was not available for comment. Observer, Page 13</p>

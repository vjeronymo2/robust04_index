			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Distribution boosts Menzies A STRONG performance from distribution services and the absence of exceptional costs helped John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retail and wholesale group, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 25.4m in the year to May 2. Mr John Menzies, chairman, said: 'We now expect a return to our previous pattern of increased profits.' Turnover in distribution grew to Pounds 705.5m (Pounds 662.7m) for trading profits of Pounds 18.5m, a rise of Pounds 4m. Retailing turnover advanced by Pounds 16m to Pounds 376.3m, though profits fell 29 per cent to Pounds 11m (Pounds 15.5m). Last time there were exceptional costs of Pounds 4m relating to poor stock management and understatement of liabilities to suppliers in the Hammicks book wholesaling business. Since then the Hammicks retail chain of bookshops has been sold. Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, group managing director, said that Menzies could not maintain the level of investment necessary to develop the chain. The Pounds 6.8m proceeds were similar to the net assets and costs of sale. The retailing downturn occurred in spite of the 10.5 per cent increase in sales at Early Learning Centres, the toy retailer, in the UK. Mr Noel-Paton described ELC in the UK as 'the retailer of the moment'. This makes the situation in the US all the more perplexing. When asked why ELC Inc has not worked, Mr Noel-Paton replied: 'I don't know the answer to that question. I'm sure we're doing any number of things wrong.' The group has taken an extraordinary charge of Pounds 7m, 'a terminal, definitive provision', against trading losses and the maximum expected loss on disposal. Negotiations for the sale continue. A final dividend of 6.4p is proposed for a total of 10p (9.4p) and is payable from earnings of 28.1p (23.6p) per share. COMMENT Opinions about John Menzies may be shifting. Its results were well above expectations, it has healthy cash flow, and the divisional breakdowns - urged for years - have materialised, showing both a good performance in distribution and a poorer one in retailing. However, when ELC's success in the UK will boost the retailing side remains an unanswered question. Another is why have the benefits from restructuring, Epos, central distribution, and upgraded IT facilities, not shown through yet in the John Menzies retailing side? However, while it is rather stuck in a confectionery/tobacco/newsagent format, that WH Smith, its main rival, has moved on from, the bias towards wholesale is not a bad thing in the current climate. Assuming pre-tax profits of Pounds 28m for the current year, the group is on a prospective p/e of 12.6, a deserved discount. The shares have moved from a sell to an uninspiring hold.</p>

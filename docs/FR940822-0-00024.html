			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 20, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (PS&hyph;7&hyph;93) relating to tax-free exports of vaccine was published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 48801).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 29, 1993, temporary regulations (TD 8497) relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the vaccine floor stocks tax were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 62524). A notice of proposed rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (PS&hyph;50&hyph;93) cross-referencing the temporary regulations was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the same day (58 FR 62558).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments responding to PS&hyph;7&hyph;93 were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments responding to PS&hyph;50&hyph;93 were received, but no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public hearing was requested or held. After consideration of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, the proposed vaccine export regulations and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed vaccine floor stocks regulations are adopted by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury decision, and the temporary regulations relating to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vaccine floor stocks tax are removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of the comments received on PS&hyph;50&hyph;93 addressed the de  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimis exception to the floor stocks tax. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations provide that any person whose liability for tax does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not exceed $1,000 is not required to report or pay the floor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stocks tax. One comment requested that the de minimis amount be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased to $10,000. The de minimis exception was established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the administrative convenience of the IRS to eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessity of processing returns from persons holding small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts of vaccines and having a small tax liability. The $1,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> de minimis amount is adequate for this purpose and the comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is, therefore, not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another comment suggested that the exception be applied on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician-by-physician basis so that a group practice (such as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partnership or professional corporation) would have a de minimis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount proportionate to the size of the group. As noted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the amount of the de minimis exception is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with its purpose. Further, if adopted, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion could increase the administrative burdens of the tax.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, allocation problems would arise if a physician is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in practice through more than one group (such as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partnership and a clinic or hospital). Accordingly, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion is not adopted. The comment also suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> de minimis exception be treated as an exemption and that only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts of tax in excess of $1,000 be reported or paid. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion is inconsistent with the limited purpose of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception_to eliminate small returns. It is, therefore, not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fuel Floor Stocks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OBRA 1993 makes several changes to the Code with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the taxation of motor fuels. First, effective October 1, 1993,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it increases the rates of excise taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and aviation fuel. The gasoline tax, under section 4081,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases from 14.1 cents per gallon to 18.4 cents per gallon;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the diesel fuel tax, under section 4091, increases from 20.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cents per gallon to 24.4 cents per gallon; and the aviation fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tax, under section 4091, increases from 17.6 cents per gallon to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21.9 cents per gallon. These new rates include the 0.1-cent-per- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gallon tax that funds the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trust Fund. Second, effective January 1, 1994, OBRA 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally moves the point of imposition of tax on diesel fuel to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the terminal rack. Third, effective October 1, 1995, OBRA 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases the tax on fuel used in commercial aviation by 4.3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cents per gallon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBRA 1993 also imposes three floor stocks taxes, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not codified, on these fuels. The taxes are to be paid by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons holding fuel on the effective dates of the changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on gasoline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel fuel, and aviation fuel that are held at the first moment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of October 1, 1993, at a point in the distribution chain where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these fuels would not otherwise be subject to the increased tax  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates. The rate of the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax is 4.3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cents per gallon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on diesel fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held by any person at the first moment of January 1, 1994, if (A)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no tax was imposed on the fuel under section 4041(a) or 4091 as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in effect on December 31, 1993, and (B) tax would have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed by section 4081, as amended by OBRA 1993, on any prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal, entry, or sale of the fuel had section 4081 applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fuel for periods before January 1, 1994. The rate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is 24.4 cents per gallon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation fuel held by any person at the first moment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1995, on which the LUST tax was imposed under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4091 before October 1, 1995. The rate of the October 1, 1995,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor stocks tax is 4.3 cents per gallon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 29, 1993, temporary regulations (TD 8498) were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 62526). A notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;49&hyph;93) cross-referencing the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day (58 FR 62559).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Arts: Converts, cricket, comedy and soap - Television It took almost half the opening episode of Channel 4's Food File to work out why this new series, supposedly about diet, sounded so familiar: it was a religious programme. Now that real religion in this country has become a marginal affair (today's happy-clappy stuff seems to have little to do with faith and much to do with the universal need of a proportion of mankind for the rhythmical satisfaction of what anthropologists call 'dance-and-drum') all sorts of single issue taboos are filling the vacuum. They tend to be linked to one or other of the seven deadly sins. The clean-up-TV campaign always used the phrase 'sex-and-violence' but actually focused primarily on sex or, to use the sds term, lust. Now Food File is going for gluttony as the way of scaring us into being good. In the opening programme sermons were delivered by those unto whom the way, the truth, and the life have been revealed, and they are offering to lead us into the paths of righteousness. Once again bread and wine loom large, provided they are respectively very hard and in rather small quantities, but it turns out that the stuff which fills the holy grail is . . . virgin olive oil. What seems to have happened is that a number of young people, represented by presenter Drew Smith, have just come across the fact, well known for the past half century, that some aspects of the southern Italian diet appear to promote good health. With the usual zeal of youthful converts they now want the entire British population to change its eating habits to fit in with this revelation. They are not going so far as to compare life expectancy in Britain and southern Italy, since that might ruin the entire series, but they are busy trying to convert the happy Dutton family and make them good. The cricket World Cup may be helping to sell satellite dishes, but it is doubtful whether it is improving the image either of the game or of BSkyB. In cricket, unlike soccer, say, or rugby, there is no difficulty in telling the two teams apart: the ones with the bats are on one side and everybody else is on the other. So it is a mystery why anyone thought it was necessary for cricketers to wear pierrot pyjamas in vivid colours. All-white clothing looks beautiful against a green pitch whereas canary yellow or sky blue with striped highlights looks garish and vulgar; sometimes literally more like a circus than cricket. As for Sky's reputation, they have surely done themselves a bad turn by repaying the BBC's willingness to sell edited highlights of Wimbledon with a refusal to sell edited highlights of this event, thus ensuring deep resentment among those viewers (still a large majority of the population) who don't have dishes. There have been early day motions condemning Sky's policy from both Labour and Conservative politicians, and MPs of all parties are now talking about the need for a list of protected events which could not be monopolised by a single broadcaster. ***** On the other hand Sky's decision to screen Australia's new, explicitly sexy soap opera Chances, and America's new explicitly sexy dating game Studs, will probably help sell even more dishes. The clean-up people may make a lot of noise but there is no mistaking the fact that sex raises your ratings. Neither of these series could be called X-rated, but Studs goes well beyond the coyness and euphemism of Blind Date so that the men may be asked to guess 'Which of you did the ladies say would be most likely to make love in the back of a car?' And when asked 'What is the first thing you notice about girls' bodies?' Michael readily declares 'Breasts]' which produces lots of whooping from the audience and laughter from the female contestants. There is norra lorra that on Cilla Black's prim little show. If you must have programmes of this sort then Studs is far more honest and amusing than the British version - and the American contestants are not required to deliver those embarrassingly over-rehearsed 'jokes'. As for Chances, Episode 1 looks like seven parts Neighbours, two parts Dallas and one part Valley Of The Dolls. As in all Aussie soaps people say 'Without further ado' and 'I gotta hand it to yer, Digger' but the semi-nudity is tasteful enough to let it get by in Cheltenham. With terrestrial broadcasters so eager to kowtow to the Victorian hypocrisy which still dominates taste in Britain, such tiny moves towards more adult material will surely help dish sales. ***** Of the three new comedies The Big One (Thursdays on Channel 4) is the most fashionable, Mulberry (Mondays on BBC1) the most likely to last, and So Haunt Me (Sundays on BBC1) the funniest. That is not to say that So Haunt Me is another Fawlty Towers: there no longer seem to be any writers with the self discipline, nor department heads with the willingness to impose the discipline, necessary for the creation of series as consistently funny as that. Still, I have several times found myself laughing out loud at events in Paul A. Mendelson's account of a family moving into a terraced house which is haunted by an extremely Jewish mother, played with relish by Miriam Karlin. Mulberry is the name of the general factotum played by Karl Howman (familiar from Brush Strokes) who is hired by the not-so-very batty old grande-dame Miss Farnaby, played by Geraldine McEwan. This is hardly the sort of stuff that makes you roll off the old green sofa, but there is foreseeable strength and mileage in the relationship, and I suspect some viewers will grow fond of this peculiar couple. The stars of The Big One are Mike McShane and Sandy Toksvig, another odd couple, he huge and she tiny, and yet another pair of alumni from Whose Line Is It Anyway. They have in The Pocket Dream in London's West End, and the television series has them sharing her horribly messy flat. Toksvig is one of the three funniest women on British television (the others being Victoria Wood and Dawn French) but although some of the lines in The Big One are amusing, the idea that an odd domestic pairing is in itself enough to support a comedy series has, surely, worn perilously thin. ***** Some aspects of Channel 4's book review programme, Burning Books, are admirable: they get through a fair number of books quite quickly, the reviewers mostly seem more concerned with the books than with proving how clever they are, and it makes a wonderful change to have two people dealing with a book and not to know which is the interviewer and which the interviewee. The form here is for two people to discuss the book across a table as equals. Other aspects, however, can be very irritating: the huge flames are distracting because they look downright dangerous, the chatter at other tables in the background is also distracting, and last week an American journalist was allowed to deliver her review to camera in a high pitched monotone which was virtually incomprehensible. ***** The willingness of broadcasters to co-operate with the spin doctors of the political parties is becoming embarrassing. One of the parties 'launches' a poster - a poster, for goodness sake - and the news programmes dutifully send along reporters and camera teams to record the event, for all the world as though something significant was occurring. How long before the broadcasters are summoned to record the 'launch' of a politician's new hairstyle? Before this election campaign there was talk of ITN behaving this time like proper adult journalists and treating everything on its merits, even if this meant that at the end of the day slightly more attention had been paid to one side than the other. The hope was that the BBC might then follow suit, but all the signs are that the broadcasters are as timid as ever. The stopwatches are running and airtime is being divided not according to news values but according to party entitlement. The idea that television journalists ought to follow the example set by their print predecessors 200 years ago and fight for their independence seems as distant as ever.</p>

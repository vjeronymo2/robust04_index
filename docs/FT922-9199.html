			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Fowler to be Tory chairman SIR Norman Fowler, former cabinet minister and political ally of the prime minister, is to become Conservative party chairman. His appointment from Monday, expected to be announced at the weekend, came as Mr Cranley Onslow appeared to have retained his chairmanship of the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs by promising to stand down after another year in the job. Sir Marcus Fox, Conservative MP for Shipley, had planned to stand in next Thursday's election but, after Mr Onslow's announcement, was reconsidering whether to force a contest. The post of Conservative party chairman fell vacant after the appointment of Mr Chris Patten as governor of Hong Kong. Sir Norman's acted as an adviser to Mr John Major's during the election. His biggest challenge will be to restore party finances, which were in deficit even before the general election. Sir Norman, who resigned from the government in 1990, will stand down as chairman of the Conservative backbench Europe committee. Observer, Page 17.</p>

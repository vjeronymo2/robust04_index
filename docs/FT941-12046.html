			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Record producers propose TV music video channel Four of the world's largest record companies - Warner Music, PolyGram, EMI Music and Sony Software - yesterday announced plans to launch a cable television music video channel in the US. It could provide the first serious competition to MTV Networks, the pop music service owned by US cable group Viacom. The partners are thought to be considering launching local language services outside the US in some countries where MTV has been growing rapidly. MTV's programmes are broadcast in English. The four companies, together with Ticketmaster, the US entertainment ticketing group, said they were forming a partnership to operate an advertiser-supported, 24-hour channel which would be offered as a basic cable service in the US and launched in the fourth quarter of this year. They would seek additional partners, including cable television operators. Warner Music is a subsidiary of Time Warner, the entertainment group which runs the second-largest cable television service in the US. EMI Music belongs to Britain's Thorn EMI, while PolyGram is a subsidiary of Philips Electronics of Holland, and Sony Software is part of Japan's Sony group. The four companies launched a forerunner to the US service in Germany last month, in conjunction with Mr Frank Otto, a Hamburg radio executive. The German-language service, called VIVA, is in 90 per cent of the country's 13m cable homes. The US venture could have a tough time wooing cable companies and advertisers away from MTV and its sister channel, VH-1, which is aimed at the baby boom generation. MTV, which began operations in 1981, has built up a powerful brand name in North America - and increasingly around the world - with an unpredictable, iconoclastic style and original programming which goes beyond the simple transmission of pop videos. It is received in 57m homes in the US. The record companies yesterday gave few details of their programming plans, but indicated the channel would consist mainly of pop video transmissions, possibly accom-panied by retailing of music-related merchandise. The partners said they would continue to licence their own videos to other entities, which presumably means MTV will be assured a supply. Bertelsmann, the West German record company, and Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable system operator in the US, announced plans last September to launch a cable channel in the US which would allow viewers to choose the pop videos they want to watch, as well as buying music-related products from home. However, this idea may take a considerable time to reach the market.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Council performance varies widely Some local authorities in England and Wales promise to answer the telephone within four seconds - but others are prepared to leave it ringing for a minute. Several other examples of widely varying targets for councils are revealed today by the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, in a report preparing for the compulsory publication of performance indicators this year. Targets for answering letters also show inconsistencies. The Isle of Wight undertakes to answer all letters within three working days. Sunderland aims for five weeks and Easington, in County Durham, has a target of six weeks for a full response - although acknowledgements must be sent within seven working days. Surrey county council undertakes to answer the telephone within 60 seconds - although the authority now realises this was unambitious, and will cut the target to 20 seconds. North Yorkshire expects its staff to answer within four seconds. Typical targets are for letters to be answered within 10 days and telephones within 15 seconds. Councils will have to publish details of how often they achieve the targets. Mr Paul Vevers, associate director of the commission, said 93 per cent of authorities had set targets, which mostly compared well with private-sector targets - for example, British Gas aims to answer telephone calls within 30 seconds. He said response times could often be cut with minimal investment in electronic logging systems for telephones, or extra staff training. Is Anybody There?

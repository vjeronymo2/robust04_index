			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 9 (TANJUG) -- Josip Manolic, president  of the upper house of the Croatian parliament, has disclosed  that Zagreb has so far spent about one million German marks [DM]  on the war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  thus confirming that more than 60,000 Croatian Regular Army  troops are fighting there. Manolic, former chief of the  Croatian secret police, says in his memoirs, which are being  published in installments by the Zagreb paper GLOBUS, that about  63-64,000 Croatian regular troops have taken part in the  Moslem-Croat clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Tens of thousands of Croatian soldiers have been engaged in  the Bosnian civil war since its outbreak in 1992. They have  first fought within the allied Bosnian Moslem-Croat forces  against the Serbs, but since last spring, they have been  fighting with the Bosnian Croats against the Moslems. The  United Nations have persistently ignored Serb warnings about  Croatia's military engagement in the Bosnian war, but only after  the outbreak of the Moslem-Croat territorial clashes last spring  did U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali admit there were  some 6,000 Croatian Regular Army troops also fighting in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "All those (Croatian) soldiers in Bosnia had to be paid as  well as the ammunition and logistics costs. The war with the  Bosnian Moslems has cost Croatia at least three million German  marks a day, and as the war has lasted for nearly a year, the  costs incurred to Zagreb can be estimated at about one billion  marks," says Manolic.    Acting under pressure from the United States, the Bosnian  Moslems and Croats in March signed a ceasefire and agreement on  setting up a joint federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would  subsequently enter a confederation with neighbouring Croatia.  Manolic was among Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's closest  associates and a member of the innermost leadership of the  ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).    In April Manolic and Stipe Mesic, president of the lower  house of parliament, publicly accused Tudjman and the HDZ of  dictatorship, embezzlement and meddling in the Bosnian war with  a view to creating "a greater Croatia" at the expense of the  Bosnian territories. Manolic, Mesic and some other HDZ members  have left the HDZ and set up a new party -- Croatia's  Independent Democrats (HND).</p>

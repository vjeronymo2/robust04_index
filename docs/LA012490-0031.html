			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> HILLIARD ENSEMBLE SINGS AT FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH  </P> <P> Devotees of early music in Los Angeles have much to be grateful for, if only  for the enlightened efforts of the Da Camera Society, which has brought to the  Southland outstanding vocal ensembles including the Tallis Scholars,  Chanticleer and on Monday, the London-based Hilliard Ensemble. This latest of  the Society's "Historic Sites" concerts -- at First Baptist Church of Los  Angeles -- proved stimulating for the mind, satisfying for the heart and  nourishing for the soul.  </P> <P> The program surveyed 400 years of sacred polyphony, from an anonymous example  of 12th-Century organum to Di Lasso's profoundly affecting "Missa Pro  Defunctis." Producing a pure, limpid sound, senza vibrato, the four singers --  countertenor David James, tenors Rogers Covey-Crump and Mark Padmore and  baritone Paul Hillier -- demonstrated extraordinary dynamic control, maintained  perfect balances and delivered the texts with uncommon sensitivity and absolute  clarity. Intonation remained faultless, phrasing impeccable and blend sonorous.  It is rare to hear music delivered with such precision and polish, and rarer  still to hear it performed with such interpretive unity. TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LESBIAN SAILOR GUILTY IN WOMAN'S SLAYING  </P> <P> After deliberating for less than three hours, a Superior Court jury on Thursday  convicted a lesbian sailor of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of  another Navy woman last fall.  </P> <P> Sherral Lyn Clayton, 24, of Lemon Grove, showed little reaction to the verdict.  San Diego Superior Court Judge Carlos Cazares set sentencing for March 6.  Clayton could receive a sentence of 25 years to life in state prison for the  Oct. 7 slaying of Shelly Dupee, 21, of Spring Valley.  </P> <P> During closing arguments Thursday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Chappell said the  crime was premeditated and urged jurors to convict Clayton of first-degree  murder. Chappell said the victim was stabbed 54 times and her throat was  slashed.  </P> <P> But Clayton's attorney, Elliot Lande, argued that his client should be  acquitted based on her testimony that she stabbed Dupee in self-defense after  Dupee suddenly attacked her in her apartment.  </P> <P> The dispute between the two women erupted over a third woman -- Debbie  Picklesimer -- whom both had dated, according to testimony. Clayton testified  that, just before waving a knife, Dupee had declared, "You're not going to take  Debbie away from me."  </P> <P> In closing arguments, Lande said, "It is clear that Shelly Dupee was a very  jealous woman. It is clear that she was mean-spirited."  </P> <P> In rebuttal, Chappell said: "She killed the competition."  </P> <P> Clayton received several cuts on her hand during the struggle and was in a  hospital receiving stitches when she was arrested.  </P></p>

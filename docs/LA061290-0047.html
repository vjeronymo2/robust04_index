			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ASSEMBLY OKS BILL TO TAX 'TOOLS' OF GRAFFITI  </P> <P> The state Assembly voted 42 to 30 Monday to approve a measure that would allow  cities and counties to impose a special tax on sales of spray paint and  felt-tip markers -- the common tools of graffiti vandals -- to raise money for  programs to prevent and remove graffiti.  </P> <P> If approved by the state Senate, cities and counties could impose a 10-cent tax  on each can of spray paint and a 5-cent tax on marking pens.  </P> <P> The income generated would be given to anti-graffiti programs, which need more  money, said an aide to Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who sponsored the  measure.  </P> <P> Before the surcharge could be imposed, it would have to be approved by  two-thirds of the voters in a local referendum.  </P> <P> Under Proposition 13, counties and chartered cities can use the referendum  process to establish surcharges to support community programs. But Katz's  legislation extends the authorization to unchartered cities for graffiti  programs and sets up state mechanisms for collecting and distributing the  funds, the aide said.  </P> <P> The measure has been supported by Valley Organized In Community Efforts, a San  Fernando Valley-based coalition of churches and synagogues which argues that  ridding the city of graffiti is a key element of efforts to curb crime and  regain control of crime-plagued neighborhoods.  </P> <P> In a separate effort in the city of Los Angeles, the City Council is  considering a measure proposed by City Councilman Joel Wachs to tax all utility  customers to raise $9.7 million for city anti-graffiti programs.  </P></p>

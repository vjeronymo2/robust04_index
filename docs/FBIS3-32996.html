[sentence as  received]    The government of President Bill Clinton this week appointed  Richard Lobo to head the so-called Radio and TV Marti stations.  Lobo is said to be an ally of the groups that are hostile to the  Cuban revolutionary system.    "This individual does not have a critical point of view,  much  less an objective one, regarding those media sources.... He is  an extremist, because he would not have received support to be  appointed to that position if this were not the case," said  Andres Gomez, leader of the Antonio Maceo Brigade in Miami,  during a telephone conversation with PRENSA LATINA.    The extreme rightist Cuban-American Foundation immediately  expressed its support for Lobo and stated the Cuban community  should be very proud of Washington's appointment.    "No. There is no way the majority in our community approves  of this appointment, because we do not even approve of Radio and  TV Marti," Gomez added. His organization is part of a moderate  current among Cuban immigrants in the United States that  promotes a rapprochement with Havana    Gomez said he was almost sure Lobo was "a foundation man."  This organization was created during the years of the Reagan  administration, when the largest aggression against the Cuban  revolutionary government was carried out.    "Nothing that comes from that stock can elicit my admiration  or pride," said Andres Romero of the Cuban-Americans for Dignity  Organization, during a telephone conversation from Miami.    According to Romero, Lobo's appointment responds to the  efforts of political sectors in Washington that are interested  in obtaining an "extremist-styled" solution to continue making  money with the broadcast of hostile propaganda against Cuba.    Since it was first aired in March 1990, TV Marti's  broadcasts  have been unable to reach Cuban television viewers, but the U.S.  Congress approved a budget of almost $22 million to continue the  operations of the Radio and TV Marti stations for one more year.  Havana authorities have charged those media sources are part of  a coercive program to subvert Cuba's internal order.</p>

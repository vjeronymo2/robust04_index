			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK-Russia treaty lays the ground for wide co-operation BRITAIN and Russia yesterday turned their backs on the legacy of Cold War suspicion and signed a new bilateral treaty pledging peace, friendship and wide-ranging co-operation. The treaty, signed at Downing Street by Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first democratically elected president, and Mr John Major, the British prime minister, was the first such document since the 1766 Alliance of Amity and Commerce with Czarist Russia. The two leaders also signed five other agreements covering fields as diverse as a new telephone hot-line between Downing Street and the Kremlin, and measures to improve economic and military co-operation and the safe transport of nuclear weapons destined for destruction. Later Mr Yeltsin called on British businessmen to increase their involvement in the emerging Russian market economy and pledged to speed up payments owed to British exporters, with priority for smaller companies. He also told his City audience at the Stock Exchange that Russia needed help to reschedule its foreign debt. Until now discussions on debt rescheduling have focussed on debt incurred before January 1, 1991. Mr Yeltsin asked creditors to move the cut-off point to December 8, 1991, the formal demise of the Soviet Union. So far, both government and commercial bank holders of the former Soviet Union's estimated Dollars 70bn-Dollars 80bn foreign debt have been reluctant to include debts contracted in 1991 in any agreement. Germany, in particular, made large loans in this period to help finance homes for Soviet troops leaving east Germany and to prop up Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr Yeltsin said his government planned to cut value added tax from 28 to 20 per cent in January and reduce profits taxes. Although Russia still faced huge problems, 'the worst of our economic problems are now behind us' he said, referring to the wave of privatisations and market reforms. 'Not everyone has strong nerves. But we do have patience, commonsense and the ability to learn how to live a normal economic life.' The president, who faces a bruising political struggle with conservatives over both economic and foreign policy at next month's session of the Congress of Peoples Deputies, appeared heartened by the warmth of his reception in London. 'We agreed on everything, on economic, financial, political, ecological and military fields, everything,' he said, thanking Mr Major for his 'profound understanding of Russia and its reforms'. In the economic sphere the two sides agreed to set up a UK-Russian inter-governmental steering committee on trade and investment, in which businessmen would be directly involved. Mr Major said several big contracts for UK companies were 'looking promising'. John Brown, the engineering company is 'to go ahead with some urgency' in a venture with Gazprom, the Russian gas enterprise, to build a polyethylene complex at Novy Urengoi with support from the ECGD which, Mr Major said, now has Pounds 280m available to support trade with the former Soviet Union. Gazprom in turn is expected to place orders with Rolls Royce for replacement gas turbines and spares for gas pipeline transmission. ECGD support was also pledged for a new Moscow airport terminal at Domodedovo, and the Comstar telephone modernisation project.</p>

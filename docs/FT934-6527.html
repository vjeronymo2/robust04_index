			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sotheby's chief to quit in January Mr Michael Ainslie, president and chief executive of Sotheby's Holdings, is to leave the US-owned fine art saleroom in January. He will be succeeded by Mrs Diana Brooks, president and chief executive of Sotheby's worldwide auction business. Mr Ainslie, 50, joined Sotheby's in 1984 from the American National Trust. He said yesterday that he had always planned to stay for 10 years. He had told Sotheby's chairman and chief shareholder, Mr Alfred Taubman, last January that he wished to resign, and in April Mrs Brooks, 43, took over the day-to-day running of the company. Under Mr Ainslie, Sotheby's consolidated its position as an international auction house and the largest in its field. However, it was hit badly by the recession and this month announced a net loss for the first nine months of 1993 of Dollars 1.3m, although that was a slight improvement over 1992. Mr Ainslie, a large shareholder in Sotheby's, will remain a director but expects to take another job. Mrs Brooks' executive role will be shared between three or four colleagues.</p>

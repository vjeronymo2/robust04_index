			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Russia caught in republics' conflict RUSSIA was yesterday dragged further into conflict with other former Soviet republics, as the violence round the edges of what had been a monolithic Soviet Union deepened and intensified. Mr Mircea Snegur, the Moldovan president, said his parliament must 'declare war' on Russia, which he accused of directing the 14th Russian Army, based in the TransDnestr breakaway 'republic' within Moldova, against Moldovan forces. Reports yesterday from the TransDnestr city of Bendery, which twice changed hands between Moldovan and TransDnestr forces over the weekend, said TransDnestr guards still commanded the centre of the town. However, the Interfax news agency reported last night that tanks and armoured vehicles were being moved up to Bendery from Moldovan bases, and that MiG-29 fighter aircraft which had been handed over to the Moldovans when the Soviet military pulled out were being readied for bombing raids on the breakaway region. Meanwhile, leaders of the South Ossetian region being besieged by the military forces of Georgia, of which it is a part, said their only salvation was in union with Russia. Russia's parliamentarians view such a request sympathetically, but it would put Georgia in direct conflict with Russia. The South Ossetian leaders, talking to journalists in Vladikavkaz, the Caucasus city which is the capital of North Ossetia - an autonomous republic within Russia - said all possibility of a compromise with Georgia was over. Mr Alan Chachiyev, deputy speaker of the South Ossetian parliament, said: 'The only chance we see is to join with North Ossetia in the Russian Federation.' Mr Akhsardek Galazov, the South Ossetian parliament's leader, said that if Russia did not defend his people, volunteers would be gathered in North Ossetia and sent down to fight the Georgians - 'and who knows where that will end?' At stake in these conflicts is the future allegiance of Russian, or pro-Russian, minorities in regions under attack by forces of the countries in which they live. If Russia takes up arms in their defence - as both Mr Snegur and Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, have accused it of doing already - it opens the door for a host of other such actions, from the Baltics to Central Asia. Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday confirmed General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president, as the man in charge of these conflict areas, an apparent sign of presidential approval of Gen Rutskoi's uncompromising defence of the TransDnestrians and South Ossetians at the weekend, and of his promise to assist them with Russian arms. However, Gen Rutskoi's statements were roundly condemned by Mr Shevardnadze and Mr Snegur yesterday as a 'declaration of war'. Within Russia, the 'war party' seems to be gaining ground: Mr Sergei Filatov, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament, yesterday laid total responsibility for the violence at the doors of the Georgian and Moldovan presidents, and said that Russia should and would protect its army, its kith and kin, and the peoples who wished to be allied to it. The issue has become critical just as Mr Yeltsin and Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, prepare for a session of talks today in the Black Sea town of Dagomys. These talks are expected to be prolonged to include discussions between Mr Yeltsin, Mr Shevardnadze and the North and South Ossetian leaders tomorrow. Mr Kravchuk yesterday called for the TransDnestr area - which has at least as many Ukrainians as Russians in it - to be given federative status, the first time he has leaned towards the Russian position on the issue. However, the two presidents are expected to disagree sharply over the division of the Black Sea fleet and of the status of the Crimea - which, if Ukraine has its way, will not be discussed - as well as over division of former Soviet property, which Russia will in its turn seek to keep off the agenda.</p>

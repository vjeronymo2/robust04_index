			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA is also listing specific work practices for some kinds of Class II work which are common, such as removing flooring material or roofing material, as proposed. The generic list of work practices for all operations under this standard in paragraph (g)(1), covers most specific practices set out for each kind of removal. However, since both OSHA and participants believe that stating how each kind of material must be removed in specific terms will enhance compliance, paragraph (g)(7)(2) restates the relevant generic requirements in terms specific to each activity. For example, using wet methods for all asbestos work, unless the employer can show wet methods are infeasible, is now required, in the generic requirements, for all asbestos work [see (g)(1)]. However, wet methods encompass a range of work practices. For example, when removing material which is bound in a matrix, misting may be appropriate. Removing ACM or PACM which is not so bound, or where deterioration of the ACM has occurred, would require more aggressive wetting. Thus, in the paragraph applying to flooring removal, the employer must mist the ``snip point'' used for cutting sheet flooring. For roofing removal, the blades of all powered tools must be continually misted during use. OSHA believes these more specific directions will help insure that work is done protectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA proposed to require use of wet methods to remove sheet floor covering. RFCI guidelines state that floor tile is to be removed by prying up an edge but no mention of the use of water on the floor tile is made. The revised standards require the use of wet methods wherever feasible including operations involving the removal of all floor covering materials known or presumed to contain asbestos. P. Quirk, an asbestos consultant, recommended that ``Floor tile and sheet removal must utilize wet methods for all work'' (Ex. 3&hyph;34). A representative of the Resilient Floor and Decorative Covering Union expressed a similar view that ``the floor should be kept adequately wet during the entire operation'' (Ex. 7&hyph;37). Based on this support, OSHA has concluded that most flooring removals must be performed using wet methods when feasible and has included this requirement in the final with one exception. The exception allows floor tiles to be removed intact using heat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Specific Work Practices for Specific Class II Operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, certain precautions are always required for all work under these construction and shipyard standards in paragraph (g)(1). These are HEPA equipped vacuums, wet methods, and prompt disposal of waste and debris. Additional provisions apply to the removal of all Class II material [Paragraph (g)(7)]. These are required critical barriers in designated indoor activities and dropcloths in all.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA also includes more detailed work practices for specific Class II activities, such as the removal of roofing materials and resilient flooring material. Most of these requirements are more specific applications of general industrial principles for handling dust-generating materials, asbestos in particular. OSHA and many participants believe that employers are helped by specific work practice requirements so long as they do not restrict common sense accommodations to unique workplace conditions. The following discussion show the reasons for and support of OSHA's decisions for specific work practices for removal or disturbing ACM or PACM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Flooring Operations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Flooring operations are separately discussed because of the amount of interest in these activities manifest during the rulemaking, and the prevalence of asbestos-containing flooring materials in buildings. Because of the prevalence of asbestos-containing flooring, the frequency which it is maintained and removed, and the possibility of exposure if improperly done, specific requirements for flooring are needed to reduce significant risk to the extent feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

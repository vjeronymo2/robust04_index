			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Deal possible with Marcos THE Philippine government may drop its civil cases against former first lady Mrs Imelda Marcos, if she agrees to surrender part of her late husband's wealth, a senior official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Manila. The head of a government panel trying to recover the funds said Mrs Marcos had agreed to such an arrangement in principle and talks on a settlement could begin in Manila next week. However, he suggested that there were no plans to drop the criminal cases against Mrs Marcos.</p>

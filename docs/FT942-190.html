			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Clarke enrages Tory Euro-sceptics A powerful exposition by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, of his party's pro-European credentials from yesterday enraged Tory Euro-sceptics. Mr Clarke's reaffirmation of a personal commitment to a single European currency and to further deepening of co-operation in the European Union came as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, sought to head off a new outbreak of party infighting. The chancellor, speaking in Bonn, dismissed suggestions that the dispute over the presidency of the commission marked a fundamental shift in British policy. He called for Germany's Christian Democrats to join the Conservatives in promoting a common agenda for Europe's future. Mr Clarke's comments about a single currency kept just within the agreed government line that any decision must be taken by parliament. But the chancellor made no secret of his own view that Britain must be in a position to join a single currency if and when the occasion arises. He remarked that the government had twice signed up to the objective - when it joined the then EEC in 1972 and when it signed the Single European Act in 1976. He called on Britain and Germany to build on the intergovernmental arrangements in the Maastricht treaty to strengthen co-operation on foreign and defence policy. London and Bonn should also act together to promote further enlargement of the union and to push an EU-wide agenda favouring deregulation and liberalisation. In spite of approval for the speech from Downing Street, leading Tory Euro-sceptics responded with outrage. Accusing the chancellor of undermining the prime minister, the sceptics said the speech had in effect ended Mr Clarke's hopes of succeeding Mr Major. For his part Mr Hurd sought to assure a meeting of pro-European Tories that the government's decision to use its veto at the Corfu summit did not represent a lurch into the arms of the Euro-sceptics. Mr Hurd will use a speech later this week to develop the theme of a multi-speed Europe. Political Notebook, Page 15</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: NMB sold to Bank of England for nominal amount The short and unhappy life of National Mortgage Bank as a subsidiary of National Home Loans ended yesterday when its parent announced that it was being sold to the Bank of England for a nominal sum. In February 1992, NHL said it had decided to run down the business and would make no further investment in it. Mr Ian Hay Davison was installed as chairman to manage the winding down of the bank. Mr Jonathan Perry, NHL executive chairman, said NHL had already written off all its investment in NMB and the announcement merely transferred the ownership. NMB was set up in 1989 and dealt in commercial mortgages, leasing and second mortgage loans. It also offered current account banking facilities and had a full banking licence. By 1991, however, it was suffering in the aftermath of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, as local authorities began pulling deposits out of smaller banks. NMB's accounts show that institutions other than banks - mostly local councils - withdrew deposits totalling Pounds 292m in 1991, more than half its total deposits. The withdrawals led to a group of 10 banks agreeing to put up a Pounds 200m cash lifeboat for NHL, supported by an indemnity from the Bank of England. The arrangement was extended and increased in March 1992. The Bank of England's annual reports show that provisions for support operations in 1991-92, mainly in respect of NMB, totalled Pounds 115m at end-February 1993, falling to Pounds 105m at the end of February this year. The announcement merely changes the form rather than the substance of the Bank's support. NHL's core business is providing mortgages for residential property. It returned to new lending only four months ago through its Homeloans Direct subsidiary.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy by </F> anchorwoman Stella Ruffinelli during the weekly "Coordenadas"  program from the presidential residence--recorded, no date given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Ruffinelli: Let us  talk about what is probably a more conflictive, but unavoidable,  issue. Why do people believe [Army Commander] General Lino  Oviedo has so much power in the country. Is it just their  imagination or does he really have so much power? I am asking  you this question in your capacity as commander of the Armed  Forces.    Wasmosy: I would say that he is a very active  person. Within the Armed Forces he is probably the most  concerned about his subordinates. This attitude is probably  interpreted by some as if he were the most powerful person  within the Armed Forces. However, looking you straight in your  eyes I can tell you I have never had any problems with Lino  Oviedo. I, personally, here in my office, filled in the posts  of the Armed Forces organization chart. First I worked on it  with [Military Forces Commander Vice Admiral Eduardo] Gonzalez  Petit, then with the Army, Navy, and Air Force Commanders and  the chief of the joint staff. The logistics commander was also  present on some occasions as was [Division General Pedro de la  Cruz] Ocampos, the chief of staff. They can confirm that the  appointments were made directly by me.    I would like to refer to those remarks that so-and-so was  appointed because it will help Oviedo or that so-and-so is  against so-and-so, and that sort of comment. I can show you the  service record, the military law, and the seniority list, and  you will see that I have respected the officers' seniority and  their merits. So much so that the commanders of the  engineering, transmission units are the best there are. Nobody  can accuse me of having discriminated against anybody who was  the top of his class. By no means. Why do you think they  respect my decisions? Injustices surface sooner or later.    Ruffinelli: What many people question is the  possible political actions of Gen. Lino Oviedo.    Wasmosy: Do you consider it to be political action  when he helps each and everyone in his home town by building a  school, giving social assistance, and so on? I regard it as  absolutely normal. Now, if he stood up and said he wants to be  president of a Colorado Party precinct or that so-and-so must be  appointed, etc., yes, that is engaging in politics. I would  really like all my aides to help me. I am being frank and must  say that many commanders--within their jurisdiction--do so. Not  long ago we dedicated social projects with General Barreto, the  Curuguaty commander. When these ceremonies occur in rather  distant regions and there is no transportation, the media just  do not turn up.    Ruffinelli: When there is no means of  transportation?    Wasmosy: This is probably why these ceremonies are  not covered sufficiently. But they are all doing their best to  increase the level, to humanize the Army. Soldiers and  sergeants currently live like human beings. These activities  are criticized because it is always...[changes thought]... well  this is the price of being the Army commander, this is the price  I have to pay for being president of the Republic. As a means  of consolation, and to give myself a bit more courage, when I  receive criticisms which I accept happily--well, not happily but  which I tolerate...    Ruffinelli: Let us talk about that later...    Wasmosy: ...which I tolerate, because we must be  frank, I tell myself they are directed against the president of  the Republic. Juan Carlos Wasmosy is president of the Republic,  but only temporarily. Every criticism is directed against the  leader, against the authority. That is only normal. It happens  within the Army, religious congregations, among bishops and  cardinals, right? For example, you women sometimes complain  about your husbands, because they are the boss at home.    Ruffinelli: Of course. Well, we will see who is  the boss.    Wasmosy: Well, in some cases the husband is the  boss.    Ruffinelli: Engineer, sometimes Gen. Oviedo's  actions--which may be done in good faith--are questioned. There  is a very narrow margin between proselytism, campaigning, and  engaging in politics. As you well know, this is banned by the  Constitution. Right from the beginning of this interview you  have said that your main concern, your main goal is to respect  the Constitution. Is there any chance, if he were to engage in  politics, that ....    Wasmosy: If Gen. Oviedo were to engage in  politics, let us say seeking to obtain a post within a party  precinct, that is one thing.    Ruffinelli: I don't think he will go that far.    Wasmosy: That situation would justify your  criticisms, but if he is only helping the government--to which  the Armed Forces belong--implementing social projects because  you should recall that the Army...    Ruffinelli: Do you believe he is acting in good  faith?    Wasmosy: I believe he is acting in good faith.  What is more, I have no complaints against him. I believe that  to have the Army cooperating as it is now, guarantees this  democratic process.    Ruffinelli: Why?    Wasmosy: Because the Army will not tolerate  anything that violates the Constitution. People believe that we  will only live in democracy through the downfall of the Colorado  Party. We are proving that the Colorado Party brought democracy  back to the country and that it is consolidating this democratic  process. People also say that free elections and democracy are  not possible until Lino Oviedo is not discharged or retired.  [sentence as received] That is not true, young lady. Quite the  opposite. Let us look at things positively. I believe the  Colorado Party and an institutionalized, well organized,  rationalized Armed Forces are the best guarantee to consolidate  our democracy. This is not a story, I am absolutely convinced  of what I am saying.    Ruffinelli: Engineer. Changing the subject and  referring to another subject that has surfaced...    Wasmosy: I don't know whether I am passing your  test.    Ruffinelli: I am not testing you. We want to  share this moment with the SNT listeners throughout the country  during the last few days of this year. I want to raise another  important topic which has been a matter of concern lately: drug  trafficking and money laundering and the U.S. Government's  concern reflected in a press communique written and signed by  [U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay] Jon Glassman. What do you have to  say about this?    Wasmosy: There are three aspects to this problem.  There are countries that consume drugs, produce drugs, and  others that act as routes for drug trafficking. Let us hope our  country is not used as a route between producer and consumer  countries.    Ruffinelli: This is what we are being accused of.    Wasmosy: It would be regrettable if our youth  became hooked on this really lamentable vice. I have repeatedly  and publicly stated that I am in favor of a total struggle  against drug trafficking, money laundering, and I am against  those who kill to steal, who traffic in stolen vehicles, etc.    I believe Ambassador Glassman made a rather hasty comment  when he stated that honest people have been replaced by  dishonest people, yet failed to say who the dishonest people  are. One cannot make groundless charges. I respect him in his  capacity as ambassador but, as long I am president of the  Republic, I will not allow him to interfere in the domestic  affairs of this country. Paraguay is a small but sovereign  country.    There is a lot of talk about obscure situations, that  so-and-so is involved. If people provide me with evidence I  will dismiss the guilty parties. I have already removed several  people involved in the contraband of cigarettes, chickens, and  onions brought from Brazil or Argentina, but one cannot make  groundless charges and suspect everyone. Do people not trust  me? I have proven I am trustworthy. I want to tell the  listeners that I summoned Ambassador Glassman to Government  House together with [Alternate Senator Eustacio] Morel Garay and  General Escobar Anzoategui [National Antinarcotics Secretariat,  Senad, executive secretary] and told him that if he wanted to  know anything about the Senad he should ask General Escobar and  not Morel Garay or anybody else because there is a chain of  command that must be respected. We cannot tolerate intervention  at the various levels. Either you have trust or you do not. I  cannot decide if a person is involved in drug trafficking or  money laundering if I do not have evidence. If you tell me who  is guilty of these crimes and bring the evidence against the  person then it is my responsibility to follow it up, but in the  meantime I cannot prejudge.    Ruffinelli: Engineer, please allow me to mention  some figures that are of concern to the U.S. Embassy which, as  you known, is a landmark in international affairs. They say  that during the past years we have only managed to seize a few  kilos of cocaine, I think it was 48 kg or a similarly small  figure: meanwhile neighboring countries talk about tonnes. More  than 30 Paraguayan citizens charged with drug trafficking or  consumption have been arrested abroad, but this has not happened  here. This is out of proportion.    Wasmosy: There are two alternatives. Either drug  trafficking has dropped here or the entire government is  involved in this trade. Therefore, to uncover the government  officials involved in this trade I need the necessary means. I  have asked them to install radar units in Mariscal Estigarribia,  Ciudad del Este, Concepcion, and Ayolas and to provide two  helicopter-gunships operated by U.S. Marines. What better proof  is there than that to show I want to fight this scourge openly?    Ruffinelli: However, they maintain that when you  list the aid received you do not mention the DEA agents who use  the infrastructure exclusively designed to fight drug  trafficking.    Wasmosy: That is right but the U.S. Embassy has  also included in the global aid granted us the cost of bringing  an aircraft with radar [AWACS] to our country. I am grateful to  them for this aircraft but the decision to send it here was  theirs. They cannot charge the cost of sending an aircraft  equipped with radar to the aid granted to Paraguay. They are  trying to determine the origin of this nefarious merchandise  which is consumed in their country. They cannot charge this  cost to the aid granted to us. That is a U.S. expenditure or  investment, not a Paraguayan expenditure. No. If they were to  really grant us support and we did not fight drug trafficking,  then we would be guilty. But with what budget can I fight these  people who are much better equipped with more sophisticated  weapons than what our Army has. They have money to buy the most  sophisticated weapons. We have discussed this subject with the  presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay. This must be a joint  effort with the aid of the United States, which is the greatest  drug consumer. The United States must help us. What can we do  alone or in an isolated manner?    Ruffinelli: Engineer Wasmosy, do you know how this  is being interpreted? Jon Glassman, to some extent, has warned  that the funds obtained from money laundering and drug  trafficking may become a very strong political power that is  very hard to eradicate.    Wasmosy: I fully agree with him.    Ruffinelli: What worries him is the impunity that  may currently prevail in Paraguay and that is generating a  system of privileges that may even undermine the democracy we  are currently enjoying.    Wasmosy: This risk not only exists in Paraguay, it  exists in any South American country.    Ruffinelli: We are no exception.    Wasmosy: We are no exception. Do you think it was  easy to catch [Colombian drug trafficker Pablo] Escobar, or do  you think he was a sort of superman that flew from one place to  another? How do you think he got out of prison? There is the  answer to your question. [passages omitted]</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Row widens over government intervention in rail dispute The row over the extent of government intervention in the rail dispute grew yesterday as Labour claimed that Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, had threatened to veto any deal for signal staff that breached the government's freeze on the public-sector pay bill. The claim, which came as the second one-day rail strike brought chaos for travellers, followed a BBC radio interview in which Mr MacGregor appeared to agree with the interviewer's assertion that he would block any deal he did not like. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT rail union, said Mr MacGregor's intervention was 'unhelpful' and made negotiation of a settlement 'much more difficult'. Aides of Mr MacGregor said he never used the word veto and his remarks had been misinterpreted. The row was dismissed by a Downing Street official as a media invention. The transport secretary said the government was 'asking Railtrack to negotiate on the basis of the approach to public-sector pay that the chancellor set last autumn'. He agreed that he was in regular contact with Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, the state-owned rail infrastructure company. Mr Horton said he was being driven by a 'business and commercial imperative' and he would not 'buy peace' to end the signalling dispute. About 1,000 trains ran yesterday in spite of the one-day strike. Normally, about 15,000 trains run each day. They carried few passengers. Travellers either did not know the services were running or feared they might not be able to use them to return home. The rail union said it was alarmed about reports that unqualified managers had been used to operate the signal boxes. Mr Knapp has written to the Chief Inspector of Railways, urging him to investigate the allegations. Citing reports from Rugby, the Trent area, Shoeburyness and Paisley, he said: 'The possible disastrous implications of such practices are quite apparent and need no explanation.' Railtrack said the Health and Safety Executive was content with the competence checks applied to the staff working yesterday. Union officials said RMT headquarters were being 'bombarded' with calls from signalling staff opposed to the company's productivity package, which was rejected by union negotiators on Monday. 'They are being asked to swallow a huge package of new working practices for no gain,' a spokesman said. The RMT, which is holding its annual conference next week, has announced two further 24-hour strikes for Wednesday June 29 and July 6. Train companies claim compensation, Page 8</p>

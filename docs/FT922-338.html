			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Building Contracts: Pounds 35m orders won by AMEC company AMEC DESIGN AND MANAGE MENT has commenced work on the design, management and construction of three projects valued at Pounds 35m for the Boots Company at Beeston, Nottingham. The projects are for a new corporate headquarters, a partially automated warehouse building and the refurbishment of part of a Grade I listed building for offices and quality control laboratories. The new corporate headquarters is a single-storey building providing 3,260 sq metres of air-conditioned office accommodation for a staff of 100. This project is due for completion in May 1993. The warehouse extension, due for completion in mid-1993, is 5,780 sq metres in area and is 12.5 metres high to the eaves. Within the building will be a 'mini-load' materials handling system holding nearly 50,000 storage containers of toiletries and cosmetics which are accessed by computer controlled automated cranes and conveyors. From a stock range of almost 14,000 lines, products are picked manually from pallet racking and shelving and sent on a transportation conveyor to an automated sortation system which is being upgraded and is located in an adjoining warehouse. The new and existing warehouses will together enable Boots to sort over 4,000 order cases per hour. The refurbishment of part of the listed D10 production building, which was originally designed by Sir Owen Williams and opened in 1933, will provide quality control laboratories, additional office accommodation and will involve replacement of the fenestration and roof covering. Completion of the project is scheduled for March 1994.</p>

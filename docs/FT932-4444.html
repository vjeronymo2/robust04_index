			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Unigate Unigate's dividend increase suggests it must be anxious to convey the impression that it has turned the corner. Mr Ross Buckland, who has now notched up nearly three years as chief executive, has indeed sharpened the company's focus: a string of disposals and acquisitions confirms its primary interest in food and related distribution. That process will surely continue, but the change has yet fundamentally to transform the bottom line. Without the Pounds 4m reduction in the pension charge, underlying profits would have risen by a mere 2 per cent. That increase in turn was due entirely to a lower interest charge, itself a function of the timing of disposals and acquisitions as much as lower rates. The delay in disposing of the US restaurant business means the interest charge will rise again this year. Much now depends on the degree to which Unigate can manage genuine economies of scale in milk, and here the jury is still out. Though the dairy division's operating margin rose last year to 8.4 per cent from 7.5 per cent, the company is curiously evasive about how precisely this was achieved. The lower pension charge will have helped, as will the policy of franchising out milk rounds and shedding less lucrative supermarket business. But it will take more than that to combat the inexorable pressure on margins as consumers switch from home delivery to supermarket purchases. The shares are helped by a yield of nearly 6 per cent, but, without more evidence of growth, they are in need of such a prop.</p>

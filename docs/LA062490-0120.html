			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON SAM HALL KAPLAN  </P> <P> It must have been astonishing to all to read the unnoticeable caption on Sam  Hall Kaplan's departure from the L.A. Times (June 3).  </P> <P> With great irony the Real Estate's lead article about termites leaves me  wondering whether the pests have already begun to take their toll on your  paper.  </P> <P> The leaders of this section have removed the backbone, which has so  strengthened for so long what little spine existed in the Real Estate pages.  </P> <P> Now you have a rather odd collection of slithering media-hyped articles  appealing to a primordial readership at best.  </P> <P> JACK HILLBRAND  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: US helps Mayflower to Pounds 2.4m MAYFLOWER, the specialist UK automotive engineering company, increased interim pre-tax profits by 50 per cent, helped by higher productivity and a big jump in US sales. The pre-tax result for the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 2.37m (Pounds 1.58m) on turnover up 48 per cent to Pounds 48.2m (Pounds 32.6m). The interim dividend is raised to 0.45p (0.40p) on earnings of 1.28p (1.17p). Mayflower has grown rapidly in the last three years through the acquisitions of Motor Panels, the car and commercial vehicle body maker in 1991, and International Automotive Design, an automotive design and engineering consultancy. Excluding IAD, which was bought from the receiver in April for Pounds 3.25m, Mayflower increased operating profits from continuing operations by 62 per cent on sales up by 31 per cent. Sales in the US, where the Motor Panels subsidiary is involved in the engineering, manufacturing and assembly of truck cabs, jumped 92 per cent thanks to the recovery in demand for trucks above 16 tonnes gross vehicle weight. In the first half Mayflower derived 42.7 per cent of its turnover from the US and 46.9 per cent from the UK. It is developing an integrated automotive engineering and manufacturing operation in the US, following the opening of a product development centre in Detroit last year and the Dollars 7.5m (Pounds 5.03m) purchase of a stamping plant in Ohio this year. IAD lost Pounds 99,000 in the two months from May to June, but Mr John Simpson, Mayflower chief executive, said the operation was expected to break even this year after losing about Pounds 2.5m in 1992. The IAD workforce has fallen to 700 from some 1,100 a year ago and Mayflower was preparing a restructuring plan for the remaining IAD operations. The seat-belt webbing division suffered a 9.5 per cent sales fall, reflecting the decline in continental car production.</p>

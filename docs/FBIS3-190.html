While in Addis Ababa, Mr. Aidid held talks with the French,  Russian, Chinese, Italian, and Egyptian ambassadors to Ethiopia,  based in Addis Ababa, whom he briefed on the situation in  Somalia and his talks in Nairobi with the various groups of the  Somali community. He also briefed them on the agreement he had  reached with the leaders of Somali groups, an agreement based on  understanding, collaboration and mutual respect, far removed  from earlier mutually antagonistic attitudes.    Asked by the Egyptian ambassador to Ethiopia why he would  not  be attending the Cairo meeting, Chairman Aidid replied that the  SNA was not attending the conference organized by the Egyptian  Government in Cairo, because the meeting violated the OAU Cairo  agreement, which provided for the issue of the Somali people to  be left to the leaders of the Horn of Africa and the Somalis  themselves. The chairman went on to say that the Cairo  conference would have a disruptive influence on the ongoing  talks of the Somali people in Nairobi, Kenya. Chairman Aidid  said that the talks of the Somali leaders in Nairobi were being  supported and participated in by the leaders of the countries of  the Horn of Africa.    Aidid called on the Egyptian Government to stop interfering  in the internal affairs of the Somali people. He said if Egypt  really wanted to help the Somali people, the Egyptian Government  should support and implement the December 1993 accord reached in  Cairo, Egypt. The accord authorized the presidents of the  countries of Horn of Africa to find a lasting solution to the  crisis prevailing in Somalia and allow Somalis to decide their  own destiny.</p>

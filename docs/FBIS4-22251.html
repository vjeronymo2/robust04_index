			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lyudmila Dmitriyevskaya, chairman of the </F> presidium of the Collegium of Lawyers of the Republic of  Tatarstan, and Rashid Teunayev, chairman of the presidium of the  Collegium of Lawyers of the Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia:  "What Will Happen With Regional Economic Reform? It Must Be  Reinforced by the Legislative Capabilities of the Components of  the Russian Federation"]    [Text]  <H5>  Point of View </H5>   Russian federalism represents a rather motley and in many  places a still poorly painted picture that is too early to  remove from the easel to show at prestigious exhibitions. We are  fully in agreement with statements (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 5  March 1994) about the three pillars that will enable a new  Russia to sail out of the current political and economic storm:  a socially oriented market economy, local self-government, and  federalism, but we cannot fail to note that such statements are  still not being reinforced by real assistance to the regions in  the sphere of an independent legal structure. The last is  exactly the most fundamental question of a real and not feigned  attitude toward the rights of the regions.    In accordance with the new Constitution of the Russian  Federation, federal state property and its management, the  establishment of legal principles of a single market, the  federal banks, and civic legislation fall within the  jurisdiction of the Russian Federation (Article 71).  Administrative, labor, family, housing, land, water, and  forestry legislation, and legislation on mineral resources, on  the legal profession, and on the notary system are within the  joint jurisdiction of the Federation and its components (Article  72). Components of the Federation possess absolute state  authority (Article 73) outside the bounds of jurisdiction of the  Russian Federation and the powers of the Russian Federation on  subjects of joint jurisdiction.    It is apparent from the aforementioned that the Constitution  leaves to the components of the Federation extensive  opportunities to legislate in the sphere of commercial legal  relations that were previously regulated by the officially  recognized branch of economic law, and also by branches of  entrepreneurial and trade law that were previously unknown to  the socialist legal system; moreover, all of them relate to the  competence of the regions. The treaty between the Russian  Federation and Tatarstan showed that a whole series of powers  relating to the exclusive or joint jurisdiction of the Russian  Federation, but specifically questions of ownership, the use and  disposition of lands, mineral resources, forests and other  natural resources, state enterprises, other personal property  and real estate, the legal profession, the notary system, the  legal regulation of administrative, family and housing  relations, wildlife management, and others--all of these are  transferred to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Tatarstan.    It is superfluous to mention that the right to legislate  independently in the aforementioned sphere of competence of  components of the Federation is extremely important for those  regions that are endeavoring to create a legal regime that is  favorable for domestic and foreign investors and to ensure the  acceleration of their movement to a civilized market with the  help of modern methods of legal regulation. The need for the  regions to legislate legal relations assigned to them by the  Constitution in the sphere of property is especially important  against the background of the weak activity of the center in the  sphere of economic legislation. Up to the present time, basic  laws on joint-stock companies and associations, securities,  trade turnover, and rent have not been passed yet. A full draft  of the Civil Code has not been submitted to date, and there are  only unfounded rumors about work on the Trade Code. The federal  laws in force in the sphere of property relations are weakly  developed, or outdated and contain numerous unclear points and  contradictions. Under such conditions, federalism throughout the  world ensures filling in the gaps with the help of legislation  of the components of the Federation. As practical jurists, we  especially note the need for energetic law-drafting work at the  regional level.    At the same time, we must note with alarm that an attempt is  being made to subject the constitutional rights of the  components of the Federation to revision with the adoption of  other federal legislation. Thus, in Articles 2 and 3 of the  widely advertised draft of the general part of the Civil Code of  the Russian Federation, the concepts of "civil law" and "civil  legislation" are used in such a broad sense that the possibility  is legally and actually closed to the components of the  Federation to legislate in the economic sphere even within the  framework of its constitutional competence. Similar claims are  confirmed by statements of the developers of the draft of the  general part of the Civil Code that the sphere of action of  civil law has been substantially broadened, absorbing, for  example, land legal relations that now, they say, can be  regulated only by the Civil Code and federal laws. These authors  of the draft of the general part of the Civil Code categorically  deny the republics that are in the Russian Federation structure  the right to adopt such complex normative acts like codes,  declaring this to be an "obvious unconstitutionality and  elementary ignorance."    If it were a question of a purely academic discussion, we  who  are responsible for practical questions of the application of  the law would simply not have the time to take part in it. But  here we run into a different situation. After all, a Forest Code  was adopted in Altay, a Trade Turnover Code in Kalmykia, and  intensive work is proceeding in other regions on the development  of their own legal bases. Therefore, we would perceive an  obvious unconstitutionality and elementary indiscretion in  statements like those cited above, but we are faced with more  practical tasks. Therefore, we would like to advise the authors  of the draft Civil Code to submit it as a matter of priority to  the legal community in its entirety; that is, not just the  general but also the special part, so that the quality of the  work will be more evident to everyone, and also to include in  the draft Civil Code appropriate limitations on the sphere of  the civil legislation defined by the Constitution of the Russian  Federation and the federal treaty between the Russian Federation  and Tatarstan as a precedent for similar treaties with other  components of the Federation. If this is not done, the Federal  Assembly will have to carefully examine with a similar  independent effort the review of a still delicate balance of  constitutional mutual relations between the center and the  regions in the sphere of legislation. The heads of regions and  their legislative organs should also pay attention to the  unfolding situation. It is simply difficult for us, for example,  to imagine what a young progressive lawyer could do in the post  of president of Chuvashia on the advice of a well-known  progressive economist in that limited leeway that is outlined  for the components of the Federation in the draft of the general  part of the Civil Code.    Everyone in the regions is ready to act within the framework  of the general rules of a single market, but they are not ready,  and will never be ready, for petty regulating from Moscow of our  very different conditions of economic life.</p>

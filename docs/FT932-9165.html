			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Poor inflation figures sharply depress Dow Wall Street US SHARE prices fell sharply across the board yesterday after another bad set of inflation figures sent bond prices tumbling for the second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 34.32 from Wednesday's closing record high to end at 3,447.99. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 5.57 at 439.23 and the Nasdaq composite receded 6.05 to 675.64. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 294m shares. After Wednesday's unexpectedly strong producer price inflation report, yesterday it was the turn of the April consumer price index to scare the markets. The CPI rose 0.4 per cent last month, above expectations, and the 'core' measure of consumer price inflation  - which excludes the volatile food and energy components  - was also up a worrying 0.4 per cent. The figures, which suggested that inflation is picking up alongside the steadily growing economy, rattled Treasury investors, who sold bonds heavily. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down well in excess of a full point, and the yield was back up to almost 6.95 per cent. The rise in bond yields and the fears of inflation hit stocks from the opening, bringing the Dow average down sharply. The selling was apparent across the board, although there was some refuge for investors in gold shares, which traditionally act as a safe haven in inflationary times, and metals issues, which are seen as beneficiaries of higher commodities prices. A group of metals and gold stocks posted strong early gains, although some late selling left them mixed at the close. Alcoa finished steady at Dollars 66, Newmont Mining climbed Dollars 1 5/8 but ended a net Dollars  1/2 down at Dollars 50, Phelps Dodge put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 46, and Homestake Mining firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 17 7/8 , all in heavy trading. On the American Stock Exchange, Pegasus Gold firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 22 1/4 and Echo Bay Mines Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 11 1/8 . Philip Morris bucked the wider market trend, rising Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 50 5/8 on 2.9m shares traded after Merrill Lynch raised its intermediate-term rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'above average'. Motor shares declined in spite of more good news on car and truck sales. General Motors slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 . On the Nasdaq market, Apple ran against the grain, rising Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 55 1/2 after the company unveiled the updated version of its cross-platform multimedia architecture software, QuickTime for Windows. Canada THE US inflation news spurred solid gains in Canadian gold shares in very heavy trading and more than offset losses in some other sectors, but afternoon selling pulled the Toronto market well down from its intraday high. The TSE 300 index closed only 4.8 up at 3,801.3. Rises outscored declines by 432 to 322 after volume of 85.8m shares. The golds index rose 3 per cent as the New York spot gold price climbed USDollars 7.30 an ounce to USDollars 368.55.</p>

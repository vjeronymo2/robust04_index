			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL BACKS MASSIVE ORANGE DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> In a historic vote Tuesday, the Orange City Council endorsed a massive plan by  the Irvine Co. to build 12,000 homes, a hotel and major recreational facilities  over the next 20 years in the unincorporated area east of the city.  </P> <P> Council members voted 5 to 0 to approve the project's environmental impact  report, marking a milestone in the progress of what is a huge development even  by Orange County standards. Under the development plan, the Irvine Co. proposes  to dramatically reshape the face of Orange, where the current population of  106,000 would leap to nearly 150,000 by the time of the project's completion.  </P> <P> Led by Mayor Don E. Smith, Orange officials have long backed the proposal, but  residents have expressed reservations, citing the traffic and other problems  with absorbing a massive development on the city's eastern border.  </P> <P> Sherry Meddick, one of several residents who spoke against the plan Tuesday,  submitted a petition to the City Council that she said bore dozens of  signatures favoring rejection of the proposal.  </P> <P> "I think everybody is saying, 'Enough is enough.' The figure of 12,000 homes is  just too much," Meddick said.  </P> <P> The project is the largest single planned community ever attempted by the  Irvine Co., according to a spokeswoman for the developer. The company, Orange  County's largest and most powerful developer, owns about a sixth of the  county's land and is currently embroiled in controversy over its proposed  Laguna Laurel planned community.  </P> <P> But the Orange project dwarfs even Laguna Laurel, which would build 3,200 homes  on 2,150 acres of land.  </P> <P> The East Orange development would eventually contain nearly four times as many  homes and three times as much as land.  </P> <P> Not since the February, 1988, landmark agreement between developers and the  Orange County Board of Supervisors -- which ensured construction of nearly  18,000 homes in Rancho Santa Margarita, the Foothill Ranch and Dove Canyon --  has such a large plan been endorsed.  </P> <P> The 7,110-acre East Orange development is expected to be built in four or five  phases over the next 15 to 20 years.  </P> <P> Plans call for the development, currently outside the city limits, to be  annexed as each phase is completed.  </P> <P> More than 12,300 housing units would be built, along with a recreation center,  golf course and civic center. Two major commercial centers are expected to  create 27,000 jobs.  </P> <P> The 11-square-mile area, running along each side of Rancho Santiago Boulevard  and including Irvine Lake, would contain a hotel, four activity centers,  businesses and community services surrounded by residential neighborhoods.  </P> <P> But the project has its detractors. At a November council hearing, about 100  residents expressed fears that it would contribute to snarled traffic in the  city, and county officials have indicated their concerns as well, suggesting a  slate of road improvements that they believe should accompany the development.  </P> <P> And the Serrano Irrigation District, which has been supplying drinking water to  nearby customers for more than 50 years, has expressed alarm about the massive  project.  </P> <P> "The easy thing for this water district is to roll over and give up the  reservoir to the Irvine Co.," said David Noyes, Serrano's executive director.  "But my gut feeling is that it is wrong."  </P> <P> With 9,000 customers in Villa Park and parts of Orange, the district might be  forced to import its water from the Metropolitan Water District in Los Angeles  rather than draw from the Santiago Reservoir, more commonly known as Irvine  Lake, Noyes said. The reservoir is co-owned by the water district and the  Irvine Ranch Water District, which provides irrigation to agricultural  customers and is not associated with the developer.  </P> <P> Before Tuesday night's meeting, the water district's board of directors had  taken action authorizing a lawsuit if the City Council adopted the  environmental impact report for the amendment, Noyes said.  </P> <P> "Originally our contention was that the Irvine Co. didn't address water quality  in its EIR (environment impact report). But it's gone beyond that. Now they  want us out of the lake so the Irvine Co. can use it as another Lake Mission  Viejo. They want an aesthetic reservoir inside their development," Noyes said.  </P> <P> But at a recent water district board meeting, Brad Olson, in charge of the  developer's East Orange consultant team, pressured the water district into  moving from the lake, according to Noyes.  </P> <P> "They're asking us to abandon a local water supply that we've had for nearly 60  years. This is native water. We don't import it at all. It comes from Santiago  Creek which flows in from the Cleveland National Forest," he said.  </P> <P> At a City Council hearing in November, the development was criticized by some  residents concerned about growth and traffic problems. But Mayor Smith and  several other council members supported the proposed amendment, saying that if  the measure is approved the Irvine Co.'s future plans would come under close  scrutiny by city officials.  </P> <P> At that hearing, Smith said he understood the concerns expressed about  increased growth and traffic problems. But he said he believed that "This is a  good plan and it is good for the City of Orange."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jim Newton contributed to this report.  </P></p>

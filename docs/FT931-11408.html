			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / State keeps control of Bezeq THE ISRAELI government decided yesterday to maintain control for an unspecified period over Bezeq, the state-owned telecommunications monopoly, preferring a gradual programme of liberalisation in the sector and limited public share offerings to proposals for the early sale of a controlling stake to a strategic investor. Bezeq is one of the biggest of Israel's many state-owned companies and was earmarked as a prime candidate for privatisation when the Labour-led government took power last July promising to speed up the privatisation process. Critics said the decision showed the government's reluctance to embrace radical privatisation, despite its promises. The government has ruled out selling its control of Israel Chemicals and made little progress on other companies such as the airline El Al. But the cabinet sub-committee that controls privatisation, which includes Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Avraham Shohat, the finance minister, said competition in the economy would be enhanced by dismantling some of Bezeq's monopoly before letting it move out of the government's hands. The committee said it would move to allow private competition in cellular telephones and international links. The state would reduce its 75 per cent holding in Bezeq to 51 per cent through share offerings on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. Exactly when it would give up control was not specified. Israel's two biggest conglomerates, Clal Industries and Koor Industries, had expressed interest in buying control of Bezeq.</p>

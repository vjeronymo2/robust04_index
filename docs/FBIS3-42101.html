			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Munir Ahmad Khan] </F>   [Text] It is widely assumed that Pakistan has achieved  nuclear capability and can exercise the nuclear option if and  when in the future a political decision is made in this regard.  This capability has been earned at great technical economic and  political cost. As time passes, Pakistan will be subjected to  even stronger pressures to compromise on the nuclear issue and  roll back or even abandon its nuclear programme. National  interest demands that we retain our nuclear option as long as  India does as it may take India a considerable time before it  agrees to subscribe to the Non-Proliferation Regime for Sough  Asia as has been proposed by Pakistan. During this period  Pakistan has to maintain its nuclear capability. The question  is now can we sustain our nuclear option.    Realistically speaking, pressures on Pakistan will mount and  not decrease with time. The US commitment to non-proliferation  is toughening and not receding. World public opinion is turning  against nuclear weapons even in the hands of nuclear powers and  certainly more and more against the so-called near-nuclear  weapons states such as India, Pakistan and Israel. There is  hardly any difference of views among the nuclear-haves that  further proliferation has to be contained. So we will have very  few or no allies to back us up. We may even be on our own.    The assumption that once a country acquires nuclear  capability it cannot be eroded or taken away is rather naive and  an illusion. While it takes considerable technical skill and  political determination to achieve this, in the first place it  needs even greater effort to retain it later on. France was a  nuclear rebel until the 1980s but the changed international  situation and pressures from its partners in Europe and across  the Atlantic compelled it to conform to the NPT  [Nonproliferation Treaty] South Africa was able to build a small  nuclear arsenal by defying international embargoes over a long  time, but found it politically impossible to hold on to it and  had to surrender 8 or 10 nuclear bombs it had built. Ukraine,  with its 1,600 nuclear warheads, ranks as the third nuclear  power in the world and has sophisticated long-range missiles to  deliver them to any part of the world. Yet it cannot even  service this arsenal. Its economic and security compulsions  have forced it to give up this formidable capability. Even the  UK finds it harder and harder to hold on to its modest stockpile  of nuclear weapons in spite of its imperial longings.    It appears that its is relatively less difficult to climb  the  nuclear ladder but much harder to hang on after getting there.  We should not underestimate the challenges we will face in  sustaining our nuclear option and must prepare ourselves to do  all that it takes to keep it.    While it will become increasingly hard for us to retain our  nuclear option it is relatively easy to lose it. The quickest  way to do this would be to increase our nuclear rhetoric to win  greater public applause at home. This nuclear jingoism which  our politicians and technologists have engaged in to win cheap  popularity has been extremely costly to the nation. It has sent  completely wrong signals abroad and played into the hands of our  opponents. It also provides a ready excuse to India to continue  with its massive nuclear programme. It is, therefore very  important that both the government and the opposition and all  responsible leaders of various parties exercise restraint when  talking about the nuclear issue. This is needed particularly at  a time when the US Congress has started debating a revision of  the Foreign Assistance Act which could hopefully dilute the  Pressler Amendment and provide an opening for the US President  to resume US Pakistan cooperation in the economic and defence  fields.    Even if the Pressler Amendment is somehow miraculously  withdrawn or circumvented it will only be a temporary relief.  The nuclear issue between the US and Pakistan will not be  resolved as the US will continue to pursue its objectives  through other means. India will persist in strengthening its  nuclear muscle and reach posing a growing threat to our  securing. The stakes will get higher and higher. The strategy  we should develop must be one which enables us to keep the  nuclear option open for a long time. This means we should take  immediate steps to reduce our vulnerability to outside pressures  and build up the strength and stamina to resist coercion.    Politically we need a renewed commitment to our nuclear  programme and to maintain the nuclear consensus. The Government  and Opposition have to speak with one voice so that there is no  rollback and no unilateral compromise. This demands a measure  of political maturity on all sides. We have to take the nuclear  issue out of the political areas so that it is above petty  politics.    Economically, Pakistan is extremely vulnerable. Our  dependence on foreign economic and financial aid has to be  reduced. We have to put our economic house in order. This  requires making tough and unpopular economic decisions which is  not an easy matter for any political government. But we can not  expect the aid donors to underpin our economy so that we enjoy  the luxury of wasting funds at home and continue to postpone  economic reforms. Without a strong economy no country can ever  maintain a nuclear option.    In the defence field, we are highly dependent on foreign  military supplies equipment and hardware. India meets 80 per  cent of its defence needs through indigenous production while we  are critically dependent on imports. We have to build our own  defence industry. It will require a bold new approach to  mobilise our internal technical and human resources, involve the  private enterprise and establish the essential infrastructure  for our defence industry which we have neglected so far.    All weapon systems, including nuclear devices, lose their  effectiveness over time. New technological advances render them  obsolete. Defence preparedness is not static. It has to be  renewed and upgraded year after year. This needs both local  R&amp;D  and access to new and emerging technologies. Unfortunately, our  technological base is very small and is, in fact, not growing.  We do not have the skilled manpower systems and replace the  imported ones whose cost is increasing and the political price  becoming prohibitive. Getting dual-purposed and sensitive  technology from abroad is getting more complicated. Over the  last 15 years. We have lost access to R&amp;D [Research and  Development] laboratories and hightech establishments abroad  where Pakistanis are not admitted. Some people at home have  made wild claims about our attainments and raised doubts about  our intentions which have served to close doors on our students  studying abroad. We may well have lost two precious decades in  updating our knowledge and getting into the main stream of the  latest technology because we could not resist the talking too  much and raising slogans of technological defiance when we have  yet yet to develop a sound technological and scientific  infrastructure. Time has come for us us to get sober and get  down to work.    In the early years of our nuclear programme speed (or  apparent speed) was of paramount importance. Like others we  indulged in ad hocism and ignored the rules of the nuclear game;  and we are paying for it. The others learnt from their mistakes  and quickly set up institutions to tighten control over all  aspects of nuclear activities and developed well considered  policies. We are persisting in our old random ways which expose  us to greater political, financial and technical risks. Instead,  we should benefit from the experience of others and quickly  develop and institute our own Control and Command System so that  the nuclear capability we are supposed to have remains at the  command of the State and not at the whims of the individuals who  as politicians, technologists and policy makers, may use them  for their own ends. We have to send a convincing message to the  world at large that we, too, are capable of accepting and  exercising nuclear discipline and possess the maturity to  control what we have with as much responsibility and restraint  as others.    A country should have well-defined nuclear objectives which  should be pursued through a flexible nuclear policy which takes  into account the fast moving dynamics of the evolving world  scene. Even the superpowers have responded to changing  circumstances by adapting themselves rather than remaining  rigid. We should know what we want in the long run and achieve  it through our ability to negotiate with others without  surrendering our principles. Nuclear weapons are losing their  legitancy as weapons for warfare but they are useful as  deterrents and as instruments of negotiation to attain security  goals. Pakistan has to find a way to convince Washington that  the country specific amendment against Pakistan is indeed  counter-productive, and that US and Pakistan interests require  that Pakistan is not forced to give up the nuclear unilaterally  but only in a regional framework of security and  non-proliferation.    In brief, our continued retention of the nuclear option over  a long period will need much greater skill and acemen than we  are used to. We have to muture a nuclear consensus at home so  that the political will remains undiminished and people make the  sacrifices which are called for. We have to strengthen our  economy, modernuise and broaden our scientific and technological  base, strengthen our conventional defence and industrial  capability, refine our control and command system, calrify our  nuclear goals and policies, restrict our rhetoric and improve  our nuclear diplomacy. We have to build up our internal  strength and stamina to retain what we have and build on it  further to meet the inevitable challenges ahead.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gennadiy Gypylov report under the "News" rubric: "Yet </F> Another Path Will Link Russia and China"]    [Text] Chita -- A new interstate railroad will link Russia  and China: 410 km of track will run from the city of Zabaykalsk  to Irsha Station. A treaty has been signed by Chita Oblast  Administration and the Manchurian Government. Both sides are  very keen for tracklaying equipment to traverse the local  steppes as quickly as possible. The point is that the existing  "rail-link" is overloaded at this section, and at times up to  7,000 railcars accumulate on the border. Our foreign trade  vector is shifting ever more toward the East, Aleksandr  Dovgyallo, chief of the Transbaykal Railroad, believes.</p>

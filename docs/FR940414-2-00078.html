NRC has made a determination that events involving an actual loss or significant reduction in the degree of protection against radioactive properties of source, special nuclear, and by-product material are abnormal occurrences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The report to Congress is for the third calendar quarter of 1993. The report identifies the occurrences or events that the Commission determined to be significant and reportable; the remedial actions that were undertaken are also described. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This report discusses two abnormal occurrences at NRC-licensed facilities. One involved a medical sodium iodide misadministration and one involved a 1981 fatal radiation exposure of a radiographer. One industrial radiographer overexposure event and four medical misadministrations that were reported by the Agreement States are also discussed, based on information provided by the Agreement States as of November 1, 1993. The report also contains information updating four previously reported abnormal occurrences at NRC-licensed facilities and three reported by the Agreement States, and includes information on two other events of interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix D has been added to this report which includes events submitted by Agreement States that are likely to be categorized as abnormal occurrences. For these events, insufficient information was available as of November 1, 1993, to positively identify them as abnormal occurrences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the report is available for inspection or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555, or at any of the nuclear power plant Local Public Document Rooms throughout the country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 16, No. 3 (or any of the previous reports in this series), may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Post Office Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082.

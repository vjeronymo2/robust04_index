			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program] </F>   [Text] We continue with our interviews with the leaders of  the main political parties. Siphiwo Mogoda asked ANC President  Nelson Mandela how he felt about voting for the first time in  his life.    [Begin recording] [Mandela] It is difficult for me to  imagine  exactly how I would feel, except that to all of us it would be a  historic and very exciting moment, because our forebears have  fought for more than centuries for the day of liberation. To  make that cross would be the fulfilment of a long-cherished  dream which would enable us to close a chapter and to start  laying the foundation stone so that all our people, without  exception, can have a better life.    [Mogoda] Would you say things are more difficult outside  prison than they were when you were still inside?    [Mandela] These are things which are incomparable because in  prison, although one had time to sit down and to reflect on his  work and the mistakes that have been committed in the past, and  how to plan one's program, nevertheless it was not the type of  life one would like to imagine for himself. Outside one has the  opportunity to realize his life's ambition, to work with other  comrades, to meet people, to exchange views, and to be able to  make a contribution to the struggle for the liberation of our  people. There have been some positive things which we achieved  in jail, but in spite of that prison is something that we do not  wish anybody to go through. Whatever difficulties one faces  outside, you are facing challenges which are intended to get  your people to enjoy a better life.    [Mogoda] You are described as a former prisoner who came out  of jail not bitter at all. Have you forgotten how to be bitter?    [Mandela] No. One has got feelings, and one is human. There  are certain things which you feel ought not to have been done to  you, but when you have got a program to carry out, it is not  possible to concentrate on the negative aspects of your  experiences, and in this regard I am not unique. All my  colleagues who have been in prison, and those who have been in  exile, those who have been harassed inside, they haven't got  this feeling of bitterness, and they're concerned with promoting  the welfare of the people of South Africa and solving problems,  and therefore there is no time for bitterness, even if they  wanted to be.    [Mogoda] What sort of dream did you have while in prison  about South Africa and its people?    [Mandela] Well, I really wouldn't say that I had any  specific  dreams, except the important point of contributing to the  liberation of our people. I tried in my situation to follow the  campaigns launched by my colleagues, my comrades outside the  country under the leadership of Comrade Oliver Tambo, and I was  tremendously impressed by what they were doing. My only dream  was to make a contribution to the immortal work which they were  doing, highly impressive, competent leadership. My ambition, my  dream, was to do everything in my power and in my situation to  make their task as easy as possible.    [Mogoda] As a man who keeps fit, how much ls left of your  strength at this stage and how long will you continue to lead  the ANC?    [Mandela] Well, for my age, which now is 75, I feel  comparatively fit and I'm enjoying life, I'm enjoying the  challenges which face me. As far as serving as leader of the  African National Congress, this is not a position I have chosen  for myself. It's a position given to me by my comrades. I will  serve as long as they want me to serve. I am prepared to serve  for another 5 years but of course, as I have said before, I am  not getting young. At the end of that period of 5 years it will  be necessary for me to give way to a younger man.    [Mogoda] Would we say that there's someone that you are  grooming for this position?    [Mandela] No. It is for the comrades, at the right time, to  select a leader. All that I can say is that we have highly  competent comrades who can take the position of leadership, who  deserve that position, and therefore I do not think in our  situation it is necessary to groom any particular individual.

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHITSON, SUBS PICK UP SLACK FOR PADRES;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: WITH ALOMAR AND ROBERTS OUT WITH THE FLU, PITCHER HITS FIRST MAJOR  LEAGUE HOME RUN WHILE SHUTTING OUT CHICAGO, 3-0. PAGLIARULO AND CORA HELP HIM  WITH BIG DEFENSIVE PLAYS.  </P> <P> You would think that the way the Padres have been hitting lately would be  making the other teams sick.  </P> <P> You would think, considering that the Padres boosted their team batting average  by 34 points Monday and Tuesday alone, that maybe opposing pitchers would start  feeling queasy, march into the manager's office and beg out of the lineup.  </P> <P> But no. Instead, Roberto Alomar and Bip Roberts, the Padres' leadoff and No. 2  batters, caught a flu bug that had found its way into the team's clubhouse and  were scratched from the lineup less than an hour before the start of  Wednesday's game with the Chicago Cubs.  </P> <P> And you know what the Padres, those crazy quick-change artists, did? Plugged  Mike Pagliarulo and Joey Cora into the lineup, then went right out and turned  some sharp defense and Ed Whitson's second consecutive complete game and first  career home run into a 3-0 victory over the Cubs.  </P> <P> The Padres' third victory in a row and the Cubs' sixth consecutive loss came in  front of 20,579 in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> The Padres were coming off a two-night offensive display in which they scored  26 runs and had 36 hits. Nobody contributed more than the top third of the  Padre order -- Alomar, Roberts, and Tony Gwynn, which went 15 for 29 (.517)  with 13 runs scored in those two games.  </P> <P> But about 30 minutes before game-time, Alomar was slumped in a chair in front  of his locker, and Roberts was nowhere to be found. Bruce Hurst, today  scheduled starting pitcher, was sitting quietly in his chair, also feeling a  bit under the weather.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Pagliarulo was scrambling toward the elevator, heading for the  Padres' indoor batting cage.  </P> <P> "I didn't know I was in the lineup," Pagliarulo mumbled to the elevator  operator.  </P> <P> Pagliarulo went zero for two but stood out in the field. On this night, the  Padre offense as a whole was fairly quiet.  </P> <P> They scratched for a run in the first, when Joe Carter drove in Cora with a  single. And they got two more in the seventh. Whitson led the inning off with  the homer to left, the first by a Padre pitcher since Calvin Schiraldi put one  out against the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela last Sept. 23. And they got their  third run when Gwynn scored on an error.  </P> <P> They got eight hits against three Cub pitchers, including one by Benito  Santiago, who increased his hitting streak to 12 games.  </P> <P> So how about a word about the Padre defense?  </P> <P> Magnificent.  </P> <P> The Padres, who have just six errors, fewest in the NL, played their third  consecutive error-free game. It's not quite as impressive as Cub Ryne  Sandberg's streak, but not bad. Sandberg played his 104th consecutive errorless  game, extending the league record for second baseman.  </P> <P> The Padres' perfection in the field Wednesday started with Cora and Pagliarulo.  </P> <P> Cora made a leaping stab of a Sandberg line drive and shoveled the ball to  Garry Templeton to double off Mike Bielecki at second to end the sixth inning.  </P> <P> Then, he made the play of the game in the seventh. Dwight Smith sliced a drive  into the right-center gap. Gwynn caught up to it at the fence and threw to  Cora, the cut-off man. Cora turned and fired an on-the-money throw to  Pagliarulo at third to get Smith. The Padres led at the time, 1-0.  </P> <P> "Big play," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "Probably the key play in the game.  Joey did a remarkable job on that relay. It was good baseball. I'm not afraid  to put him in a game in any position. I can eventually see him being a regular  somewhere."  </P> <P> Said Gwynn: "I bounced the throw, but Joey made a great play by staying back on  it.  </P> <P> "I thought the key to the game was Cora and Pags."  </P> <P> Cub Manager Don Zimmer was unhappy with Smith's decision to attempt to take  third. He said Smith was on his own, that third base coach Chuck Cottier didn't  figure into it.  </P> <P> "Absolutely," Zimmer said. "On a ball to right-center, you don't look at the  coach. We haven't done anything right in a week."  </P> <P> Whitson didn't do much wrong. It was his second consecutive complete game and  his first shutout since July 8, 1989 at Pittsburgh, when he defeated Jeff  Robinson, 2-0.  </P> <P> "I've learned more in the last three or four years about how to pitch," Whitson  said. "Ever since I got back from New York. I feel good when I go out there,  that's the most important thing."  </P> <P> He allowed seven hits, but ran into trouble just once. That came in the sixth,  when three Cubs managed hits. But that was the inning Cora caught Smith at  third.  </P> <P> "The defense was absolutely superb," Whitson said. "Mike Pagliarulo and Joey  Cora . . . you can't beat those plays."  </P> <P> Cora had seven assists and three putouts. He was also the only Padre to get two  hits. Oh, yeah, he also stole a base.  </P> <P> Pagliarulo had four assists and two putouts. At the plate, he walked twice.  </P> <P> Pagliarulo made a diving stop of Andre Dawson's sharp grounder in the second  and threw Mark Grace out at second. Two batters later, Luis Salazar arrived at  the plate. Pagliarulo picked up his grounder and threw to Cora at second to  start a double play.  </P> <P> Two innings later, Pagliarulo speared Grace's line drive and threw to first,  where Smith had started toward second. Double play.  </P> <P> Since he didn't think he would be in the lineup, Pagliarulo had taken extra  fielding before the game.  </P> <P> "My arm felt like a rag," he said.  </P> <P> It didn't matter. His defense didn't suffer.  </P> <P> "(Defense) is as much a part of winning as anything . . . a three-run homer or  pitching a shutout," he said.  </P> <P> Templeton said the Padre defense has been strong this year because they are  aggressive in the field.  </P> <P> "It's just like being at the plate," he said. "Guys are staying aggressive on  defense. When you're not as aggressive, you tend to make more errors."  </P> <P> The Padres turned three double plays, helping Whitson immensely. The most  important came in the sixth, when Bielecki was at second and Jerome Walton at  first with just one out. The Padres led at the time, 1-0, and Cora's leap  preserved it.  </P> <P> Whitson didn't hurt himself with his first homer in a game.  </P> <P> "I've hit them in batting practice before, so I know what it's like," he said.  "When I saw it go over, it was clear sailing around the bases."  </P> <P> Said Zimmer: "We made too many mistakes. First, we get doubled off on two line  drives. Then, a guy tries to stretch a double into a triple in a one-run game  with nobody out and Grace and Dawson coming up. He's out by 10 feet."  </P> <P> He should have called in sick.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> You thought the only thing the Padres lost when pitcher Mark Davis signed with  Kansas City was some brilliant relief work. Well, they also lost their best  batting practice hitter among pitchers. The Padre pitchers like to hold home  run contests, but last year's were runaways. According to Amos Otis, Padre  batting coach, Davis routinely hit three or four homers a day. "Sometimes as  many as six," Otis said. So, with Davis out of the lineup, who leads this year?  Well, Andy Benes has two -- for the season. Dennis Rasmussen, Calvin Schiraldi  and Ed Whitson are close behind with one apiece. Whitson, of course, topped  them all with one in Wednesday's game, his first in the majors. . . . Mike  Winters was the third base umpire Wednesday night, replacing Bob Engel. Engel,  56, was given an indefinite leave of absence by the National League after being  arrested Saturday in Bakersfield for allegedly stealing 4,180 baseball cards  from a retail store. Engel was the home plate umpire for the series opener  Tuesday. He is scheduled to be arraigned May 2 on misdemeanor counts of  commercial burglary and petty theft. Winters is not a regular NL umpire. He  works the Pacific Coast League (triple-A), and one of four umpires under option  to the NL. . . . Pitching match-ups for this weekend's series with Pittsburgh:  Eric Show (0-2) vs. Neal Heaton (3-0) Friday, Benes (2-1) vs. Bob Walk (0-3)  Saturday, and Rasmussen (1-0) vs. Doug Drabek (3-1) Sunday. . . . The start of  Friday's game has been pushed to 7:35 p.m. to accommodate ESPN.  </P> <P> Minor League Dept.: Three Padre minor league shortstops are in bad shape. Luis  Lopez of Riverside (A) suffered a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament in his  left knee Tuesday. Scott Bream of Charleston (A), last year's third-round draft  pick, will undergo back surgery in May. And Jose Valentin of Wichita (double-A)  is out for at least 10 days with a separated left shoulder.  </P></p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee market's surge continues ROBUSTA COFFEE futures prices rose by Dollars 20 a tonne on the London Commodity Exchange yesterday with the November contract closing at Dollars 1,268 a tonne, after touching a fresh 2 1/2 -year high of Dollars 1,285 a tonne during the day. The sharp run-up in coffee prices over the past couple of days reflects a tightness in supplies of good quality beans to be delivered against the September contract. Market sentiment was also buoyed by the decision of Indonesia to join other producers in the coffee retention scheme, which makes the agreement more of a global one. Brazil has fought off a challenge by Colombia to its traditional position as the world's leading coffee exporter, according to figures released this week by the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (Febec), writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo. It had appeared that Brazil would be outperformed by its north-western neighbour for the July-June season. But a rebound in Brazilian shipments in June, pushing monthly exports back over the 1m bags mark, helped the country to regain its world leadership. Brazil shipped 15.9m bags (60kg each) compared with Colombia's 15.7m during the 12 month period ending in June. World exports were 76.5m bags. During the 1991-92 season, Brazil exported 21.9m bags, compared with Colombia's 14.6m. World exports that season totalled 76.4m bags The Brazilian resurgence is continuing. The country exported 1.4m bags in July, the highest monthly figure this year. August shipments should have reached 1.5m, according to preliminary estimates compiled by Febec.</p>

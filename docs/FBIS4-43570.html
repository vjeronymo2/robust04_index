			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A Belgian newspaper, LE SOIR, revealed that the  dual assassination of the presidents of Burundi and Rwanda,  which was behind the unleashing of violence in Rwanda, was  carried out by two members of the French armed forces who are  reported to have shot down the plane carrying the two heads of  state as they were landing in Kigali on 6 April.    There was an immediate denial from French Cooperation  Minister Roussin and from the Foreign Ministry. The Belgian  journalist who reported this is with us live from Brussels:    Good afternoon, Colette Braeckmann, can you confirm what you  wrote in your paper this morning, in other words that, although  you are using the conditional tense, you have good reason to  believe, according to your information, that it was indeed two  French soldiers who carried out this dual assassination?    [Braeckmann] Yes, a source which I consider to be a credible  one, which comes from Kigali and which groups together other  pieces of news in my possession, establishes that it was two  Europeans, two French nationals, who fired the missile which  shot down President Habyarimana's plane. What I do not know is  within what framework they may have acted.    [Announcer] Here you are saying two Europeans, but in your  paper it said two French soldiers. Was it two Europeans, or two  French soldiers?    [Braeckmann] Two French soldiers, but I do not know within  what framework they may have acted. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] As you can imagine, this is a serious accusation  which is categorically denied in France. How did they act?  According to the accounts you have heard, they fired a missile  didn't they?    [Braeckmann] Yes, according to all the eyewitness accounts,  two rockets were fired, shooting down the Rwandan president's  plane. The precision of this rocket fire was such that all the  sources assure me that the Rwandan military did not have the  necessary technical training to carry out this kind of operation  with such success.    [Announcer] How can one be sure that not a single Rwandan  soldier could use such weapons?    [Braeckmann] The source comes from...[Braeckmann pauses]  military cooperation assistants and experts in the Rwandan army  have given assurances that it is virtually out of the question  for a member of the Rwandan Armed Forces to have been able to  carry out this kind of operation and that specialists of another  country must have been called on to do it.    [Announcer] It is perhaps a delicate matter for you as a  journalist, but I must ask nevertheless: Are these sources which  are all in agreement with one another, to which you refer,  really serious sources, in your opinion?    [Braeckmann] They are serious, and I cannot say more about  the source, which comes from Kigali, because as you know the  situation is dangerous out there and people's lives are not  worth much.

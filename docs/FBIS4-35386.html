			<p>BFN     [Text] Progressive Socialist Party [PSP] sources have  stated that Minister Walid Junblatt has received a new plan from  the Army Command on a broader military deployment as a prelude  to the return of the evacuees. This plan will be implemented in  the mountain area between 9 and 15 June. The Army is estimated  at 5,000 to 7,000 Lebanese troops and will be deployed in most  of the mountain villages and towns, particularly the villages  that the evacuees will return to during the summer. The force  will erect fixed and mobile roadblocks at the entrances of the  villages, which were the scenes of various problems during the  war, to ensure the security of the citizens.    The PSP sources added that Minister Junblatt has welcomed  the  details of the plan and that he briefed the PSP leadership on  the deployment process. The sources noted that Minister  Junblatt has praised the role of the Army and of General Lahhud  before the popular delegations.</p>

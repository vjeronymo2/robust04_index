			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Excerpt] The Israel Navy yesterday received the  Nirit-category missile boat which will bear the name of Kidon.  The boat's construction began at Israel Shipyards some two  years as part of the plan to upgrade the Israel Navy missile  warships. The boat was designed in Israel on the basis of many  years of operational experience with missile boats.    The boat's body is identical to that of Saar 4.5. It is  61.7-meter long and 7-meter wide, and its maximum displacement  is 488 metric tons. The vessel will be equipped with  sophisticated modern means of warfare, including an electronic  combat system, a ship- detecting radar system, aircraft and  missiles, a control and monitoring system, Gabriel missiles,  Harpoon missiles, Vulcan and Phalanx antiaircraft guns, and  Barak, the Israeli-developed antimissile missile. The vessel's  maximum speed is 31 knots, and it will accommodate a crew of 45  officers and soldiers. [passage omitted]</p>

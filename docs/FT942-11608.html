			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Tories oppose more cuts in army Mr Tom King, Conservative MP for Bridgwater and a former defence secretary, warned last night that there was no scope for further cuts in the size of the army, Ivor Owen writes. He told the Commons that cuts made when the Options for Change policy was introduced in 1990 reduced the army to what should be regarded as its lowest acceptable level. Mr King, who joined other Tories in expressing anxiety about the 'stretch' to which army personnel were being subjected, urged the government to announce the outcome of the current defence costs study as quickly as possible. He said the scaling down of commitments resulting from the withdrawal of forces from Belize and the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty would not justify any further reduction.</p>

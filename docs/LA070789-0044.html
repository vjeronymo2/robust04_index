Residents had called police to report a man breaking  windows in the complex.  </P> <P> Officer Charles M. Rice Jr. arrived and found Gonzalez in the parking lot of  the complex.

Gonzalez was hit once in the left buttock, the hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The shooting is under investigation by the homicide unit, which reviews  shootings by police officers. Rice, a three-year veteran of the department,  will be assigned to administrative duties pending review of the shooting.  </P></p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Observer: Volunteer Good to see the Bank of England is more than pulling its weight when it comes to helping out east of the Urals. Senior official Tony Latter has just flown to Kiev for nine months as special adviser to Vadim Hetman, governor of the Ukrainian central bank. Latter, a top bobbin in Threadneedle Street's international division, was once Hong Kong's deputy secretary for monetary affairs. One of 15 or so people at the Bank who speaks Russian, he will spend his time advising Hetman on organising banking supervision and contacts with other central banks. A prime task will be helping to introduce the hryvnia, the new Ukrainian currency due to come into force next year. Since Latter volunteered for the stint in Kiev, where life is less than settled at the moment, he clearly has a taste for adventure. But it's to be hoped he also has a head for strong liquor. During evening meetings, the deceptively quiet but extremely assiduous Hetman thinks nothing of downing a glass or two of vodka. What's more, he expects colleagues to match him drink for drink.</p>

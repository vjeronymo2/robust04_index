			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Markets: Equities surge after bond clouds clear - London What a difference a few days can make. The surge in equity prices this week reflected a growing belief that US and UK interest rates will not have to rise - at least not yet. The recovery in London shares started towards the end of the previous week, when US payroll and unemployment data failed to provoke a feared increase in the Federal Reserve's interest rate. A string of further economic indicators this week calmed inflation concerns in the US and led to a strong performance by both bond and equity in the Europe and the US. The resurgence of the London market culminated on Thursday with a 41.4-point rise in the FT-SE 100, following confirmation that US producer prices were still subdued. Although the FT-SE shed 35 points yesterday, it still closed 104 points up on the week - and 150 points above its trough at the beginning of the month. Not all the good news came from the US. Conservatives meeting at the party's Bournemouth conference were able celebrate the fall in the UK's underlying rate of inflation to 2 per cent last month - its lowest level for 27 years. September's figures also suggested that falling unemployment was not resulting in pressure for higher wages. Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, said bond markets in the UK and abroad were exaggerating the likely upwards movement in inflation in the industrial countries, including Britain. The governor told the British-American Chamber of Commerce that financial markets were also probably exaggerating the likely pace and size of the increases in short-term interest rates that might be needed to keep inflation down. The governor's remarks found a ready reception in the City. A survey showed UK fund managers had already become much more optimistic about gilts following last month's base rate increase. The balance of fund managers looking to increase gilts holdings had this month jumped to 47 per cent from 4 per cent in September. As the clouds over the bond market dispersed, investors and traders were able to take a fresh look at recent corporate performance. NatWest Securities pointed out that the autumn reporting season had not been a disaster - in spite of a few high-profile cases such as BTR, the engineering group which warned of margin pressure, and SG Warburg, the merchant bank which revealed big trading losses. The chart shows that most company results and trading statements have exceeded market expectations - leading analysts to upgrade their profit and dividend forecasts. However, low inflation does not always spell good news. Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, this week opted out of the UK's baked bean price war, which has seen supermarkets selling own-label beans for 7p a can or less. It sold a canning and bottling plant at Stratford-upon-Avon to Campbell Grocery Products, a subsidiary of the US food group, for Pounds 37m. The depressed state of the housing market has also not helped Nationwide building society, which agreed to sell for just Pounds 1 a total of 304 estate agency branches it had acquired for Pounds 120m since 1987. Financial services groups paid high prices in the late 1980s for estate agencies, in the hope they could use them to sell a range of services such as home loans and insurance policies. The collapse of the housing market has led to mounting losses, closures and disposals. Any complacency over the inflationary outlook could also prove premature. The cost of raw materials used by British manufacturers rose significantly last month as the surge in world commodity prices pushed up the expense of imported materials. The cost of goods leaving factory gates rose at a relatively subdued rate, suggesting that many companies are still being forced to absorb rising costs. Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace components group, managed to report a slight increase in profit margins - but this was mainly because of a sharp reduction in the group's workforce, which has been cut by 3,200 to 45,700 in the past year. Lucas shares rose, even although its new chief executive, George Simpson, announced a further refocusing on the Birmingham-based company. The former Rover chairman's plan involves further disposals and a total of Pounds 214m in exceptional charges - double previous forecasts. VSEL, the Cumbrian-based maker of Trident nuclear submarines, faces restructuring of a different kind - being swallowed by another large defence contractor. GEC, the defence and electronics group, is this weekend considering whether to make a cash offer for VSEL, to counter an agreed all-share bid worth Pounds 479m from British Aerospace. Whichever group emerges victorious, the outcome will mean a further significant step in the consolidation of Britain's shrinking defence sector. Being taken over by a competitor might be a blessed release for Aerostructures Hamble, the aircraft components maker which came to the market in June and has already proved itself the worst performer of the recent wave of flotations. The shares, launched at 120p, yesterday collapsed to 24p after the group reported a sharp drop in interim profits, warned that next year's sales would be well below this year's and said its chief executive was stepping down because of ill-health. Institutions have become jaundiced about the quality of some of the new issues which have been flooding on to the market. The chairman of Aerostructures Hamble is Lord King, the former chairman of British Airways. He and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which advised on the group's flotation, can expect some stiff questioning from irate investors.</p>

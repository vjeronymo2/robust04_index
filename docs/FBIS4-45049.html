			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Moshe 'Ishon: "The Battle for Jerusalem"] </F>   [Text] Jerusalem has arrived on our agenda. We can no  longer avoid a discussion of this question. The facts  established on the ground by the PLO require a prompt reaction,  including deeds, so as not to leave an opening for  clarifications two or three years hence that might jeopardize  the integrity of the City of David that has been reunited.  Israeli policymakers must know and understand that what is not  accomplished today they will not be able to accomplish at the  time of the discussions on the final agreements between Israel  and the Palestinians. It is no longer possible to sweep under  the carpet the basic disagreements that separate Israel and the  Palestinians. In fact, Yasir 'Arafat repeated his clarification  that he is leading the way to the liberation of Jerusalem from  the hands of the "Zionist conquerors." He also appointed a  special minister for Jerusalem affairs. Recently Faysal Husayni  declared that "we will open additional political institutions in  Jerusalem."    The PLO is not satisfied with "Orient House," which has  become the focus of international political activity. This  organization is seeking to set up further centers in the city in  order to demonstrate, by so doing, PLO sovereignty, without  considering Israeli warnings nor the unequivocal declarations  that all of Jerusalem is the capital of Israel for eternity.    Under these circumstances it is "time to do" in order to  foil  the PLO plots aimed at redividing the City of David and setting  up the capital of a PLO state in it. This is the time to declare  to the PLO leaders that under these circumstances Israel will be  forced to void the agreement she gave upon the signing of the  Oslo accord, that it is the legislative and administrative body  of the Autonomy, or more correctly of the sovereign Palestinian  entity in Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip.    From the beginning it was a mistake to agree that the  Palestinian residents of Jerusalem would be permitted to vote  and be elected to the entity that engraved on its flag the  redividing of the city. Furthermore, the government also did not  stand by its initial obligation that the residents of East  Jerusalem would not be permitted to be elected to the  Palestinian authority. They would only be permitted to  participate in the elections via ballot boxes that would be  placed outside Jerusalem, such as in Ramallah, Bethlehem, etc.  Thus the first concession led to further concessions. It caused  complications that are some day likely to seriously affect full  and complete Israeli sovereignty over the city of the kingdom  and the Temple, toward which the eyes of all Israel are raised  in prayer and belief that it is ours for eternity.    But we will not dwell on mistakes connected with the past;  we  will turn our attention to the facts on the ground that should  alarm us to dangers lying in ambush at the entrance to the  eternal capital of the people of Israel and the State of Israel.  Indeed, there exists a broad national consensus among the people  of Israel and in the diaspora on everything connected to the  integrity of Jerusalem. However a consensus alone is not enough.  If it is not accompanied by deeds, it has no value. When the  time comes, it also will not save us in the great struggle for  Jerusalem.    Nowadays, when Israel still rules in Judea and Samaria and  the Palestinian entity is restricted to Gaza and Jericho, we  have the strength in our hands to determine on the political  battlefield everything connected with the integrity of Israel.  That will not be the case when the sovereign Palestinian entity  expands to the gates of Jerusalem and its environs. Then we may  no longer have the upper hand. It is thus better that things be  clarified already now, before we approach implementation of the  second phase of the "Oslo Agreement", by which all the  "conquered territories" will be transferred to Yasir Arafat's  command.    Lately, we have gotten better at recognizing the head of the  PLO and his intentions with the entry of the "Palestinian  police" into Gaza and Jericho. The leaders of the Palestinian  police declared upon entering those cities that they were headed  for Jerusalem in order to establish the capital of Palestine  there. Because words are not enough for them, there is no choice  but to stop them while they are still at the start of their  journey.    In this connection it is important to pay attention to the  words uttered this week by Teddy Kollek, the former mayor of  Jerusalem, on the program "Popolitiqa" on Channel 1 of Israeli  television. He said unequivocally that "Orient House" must be  shut down because this house has turned into a focus of  anti-Israeli political activity leading to a redividing of the  city. If Teddy Kollek has come to that conclusion, despite the  fact that he is not considered a part of the "radical right,"  nor one of the faithful of the "whole Land of Israel," it is the  duty of the prime minister and the members of his government to  pay close heed to these words.    The government also must not be permitted to turn a blind  eye  to the PLO flags flying over East Jerusalem, nor to the offices  that this organization is hurriedly erecting while ignoring  Israeli authority and law.    Yasir 'Arafat responds by waving the letter in his hand  containing the Israeli obligation to discuss the future of the  city, but there is nothing in it to prevent the Government of  Israel from removing the PLO and its political institutions from  East Jerusalem. Israel is the owner of the entire city,  including all its subdivisions without exception, even those  populated by Palestinians. There is no other sovereign beside  her. And a sovereign must behave as required in order to prevent  the establishment of facts on the ground that contradict laws  existing since the unification of Jerusalem.    Israel must demonstrate her sovereignty over all  subdivisions  of the city. We must also stop giving "good advice" to "tour  guides" to fold up the Israeli flag when they arrange excursions  for tourists and others in the eastern part of the city.    Whosoever folds up the national flag of the State of Israel  in East Jerusalem only encourages those who have evil designs  against her to fly the Palestinian flag on the main road of the  City of David.    Moreover Israeli authorities are, for some reason, ignoring  the close connections between the Palestinians in East Jerusalem  and the sovereign Palestinian entity in Jericho. Those ties  augur no good for united Jerusalem. Thus they must be stopped as  quickly as possible.    The battle for the integrity of Jerusalem is but an  inseparable part of the large battle being waged meanwhile  behind the curtains around the question: Will an independent  Palestinian state arise between the Jordan and the Mediterranean  Sea alongside the State of Israel? The campaign is not easy,  especially after the Rabin government signed the agreements with  the PLO that contain no clear and unequivocal answer to the  question: Where is the State of Israel headed?    The government preferred, for some reason, not to discuss  now  the tough issues, as they are termed by those involved in the  talks with the PLO, since discussing them would likely destroy  the agreement.    It is hard to understand what Rabin's brain trust gained by  avoiding the tough issues. They certainly brought no profit to  the people of Israel. Wittingly or unwittingly Israel has played  into 'Arafat's hands and enabled him and his entourage to strike  a stake for an independent Palestinian state in large parts of  the Land of Israel. The are exploiting the agreement to get set  up in the field, to establish as many facts as possible, each of  which is consistent with the clear Palestinian intention to  establish a sovereign country within the next two to three years  under Arafat's presidency.    As is his wont, 'Arafat is repeating the things he said  secretly in Johannesburg and is now declaring openly that he is  following in the footsteps of the founder of Islam, Muhammad,  who, in his day, voided an explicit agreement that he had signed  with members of the tribe of Quraish. In other words, the PLO  does not see itself obligated by its agreement with Israel, and  when the time is ripe, it will announce its nullification. And  we will be left holding that same piece of paper. Yet there are  those among us who congratulate themselves that there has been a  breakthrough on the road to peace...    There has been no breakthrough on the road to peace. There  has been a breach in the wall protecting unified Jerusalem. If  we do not go up on those walls to strengthen them in order to  prevent the enemy from redividing the eternal city that the  people of Israel have clung to for thousands of years, then  Jerusalem is likely to become a "sacrifice" on the "altar of  peace" that the Rabin government set up by signing the agreement  with Yasir 'Arafat.    It is not enough to declare that the Palestinians can forget  Jerusalem. In order for them to forget Jerusalem, we must  remember well the oath of the generations of David, king of  Israel: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my right hand be  forgotten."    Whoever does not remove Jerusalem from his heart, cannot,  must not be permitted to go on with his daily agenda while  ignoring what is happening in the eastern part of the city. He  cannot ignore the increasing political activity in "Orient  House," which continues to function with no interference.  Certainly he cannot reconcile himself to the establishment of  further facts on the ground, as expressed by the opening of PLO  political institutions on the outskirts of the city that is  entwined with the lifeblood of Israel from days of yore, since  King David purchased it from the Jebusite.    But the Rabin government is conducting a policy of amnesia.  On the one hand it remembers Jerusalem and swears loyalty to  her. On the other hand it forgets what it must do to preserve  the integrity of the City of David. It declares day after day  that Jerusalem will not be divided. At the same time Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres passes along a letter to the head of the  PLO in which he promises that "there is something to talk about"  even on the issue of Jerusalem. Not just that but he even  attached a copy of his Knesset speech in which he referred to  Jerusalem in order to placate the PLO.    In light of all the above, there is a growing fear that the  Rabin government is not at all excluding the possibility of  concessions, even in everything having to do with the integrity  of Jerusalem. What Rabin does not say aloud, his "poodle" Peres  says in public. According to him, a functional compromise can be  reached on a political rather than physical division of  Jerusalem. A wall will not be built, but the city will be  divided between Jews and Palestinians.    But, despite the efforts of the government to avoid actions  to prevent the establishment of PLO facts in Jerusalem, it  cannot hide what is happening there from the eyes of the public.    The people of Israel remain faithful to the oath of  generations not just not to forget Jerusalem but, in the end, to  raise its voice to force the government to act immediately for  the peace and integrity of Jerusalem.    If we remember Jerusalem and concern ourselves with her  integrity, only then is there a prospect that the Palestinians  will be forced to forget Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.    Seek the peace of Jerusalem.</p>

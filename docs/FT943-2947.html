			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Transparent standards Sir, Contrary to the claims made by Nigel Griffiths, the Labour spokesman on consumer affairs ('Wrong number. . .', September 7), no changes have been agreed between the Department of Trade and Industry and the British Standards Institution to reduce the volume level of telephones. BSI was asked by the DTI to look at ways of utilising, to the benefit of users, the improvements in the transmission efficiency of the public network due to digitalisation. This investigation was carried out by a BSI technical committee on which 20 UK trade, regulatory, network provider and consumer protection bodies are represented and which had knowledge of the work and sight of all papers throughout the investigation. A range of options has now been forwarded to the DTI. These do not include reducing the volume level by 25 per cent, as Mr Griffiths claims. These suggestions have not been incorporated into any British Standard or any amendment to a British Standard. Any proposals to so would be subjected to scrutiny by the relevant BSI committee and published as draft for public comment, as is the case with all British Standards. BSI does not produce or amend British Standards in secret but facilitates the creation of standards in a process that is transparent and dependent on consensus. Neville Purvis, chief executive, British Standards Institution, 2 Park Street, London W1A 2RS</p>

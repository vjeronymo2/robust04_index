			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / It's those men again The half-point rise in British interest rates may not help the government, but it could be a good career move for Mr Kenneth Clarke. The chancellor is not one to let such an opportunity pass him by. He popped up everywhere yesterday, presenting himself as a prudent, decisive and visionary national treasurer of steely resolve and delicate touch. We are invited to believe that he knows which monetary string to fine-tune, and when. It appears that he has found the magic formula that has hitherto eluded economists in the known universe. Yes, the self-styled canny Ken has discovered how to drive an economy to the very borders of Utopia without mishap. Neither you nor I nor Mr Clarke can be certain that this is so. Between you and me, I have my doubts. It is not even clear whether the rise in base rate was decided upon by the chancellor in happy concurrence with the governor of the Bank of England. Quite possibly, Mr Eddie George was quietly insistent. Thanks to Mr Clarke, the minutes of the meetings between the two are published. This gives the governor the powerful weapon of disclosure should the chancellor take a view different from his own. Either way, it would have been in character for Mr Clarke to conclude that, if unpalatable medicine is called for, it had better be administered at once. Thus obliged, the chancellor has put his name to an increase in rates that many will regard as sensible. He has also intimated, in his customary manner, that there will be no tax cuts before the November 1995 Budget. In short, he has come across as competent, and, better yet, a beacon of stability. This should be to his credit. In the kingdom of the maladroit, he who is capable earns respect and admiration. In due course this will benefit the chancellor, in spite of much wringing of Tory hands over the higher cost of mortgages. Did I say maladroit? Such a kind epithet. This is not a sign of commentator's softness; it is just that the ability of this government to pound its own face with custard pies of its own making is beyond parody. We need merely note the weekend performances by the prime minister and the chairman of the Conservative party. The latter, a Mr Jeremy Hanley, took only 24 hours to make a nonsense of the former's effort to convince us that the Conservatives are the party of law and order. The prime minister needed to do this because the home secretary, who should, hasn't. So on Friday Mr Major spoke of countering Britain's 'yob culture'. That was unwise, since it invited, and got, the riposte that the government has been in office for 15 years and we are now up to our eyes in yobs. Could anyone make things worse? Yes. On Sunday the party chairman depicted a clash of yobs at a prize-fight as a spot of exuberance. Later he apologised and said he doubted his own suitability for the job. Mr Hanley is famous for being the child of entertainers. It was curious of Mr Major to appoint him. Perhaps he was thinking, in this 50th anniversary year, of the wartime comedian, Tommy Handley, he whose show Itma ('It's That Man Again') gave us Mrs Mopp with 'Can I do yer now, sir?' and Mona Lott with 'It's being so cheerful that keeps me going'. Yesterday Mr Hanley was twittering chirpy nothings about the forthcoming party conference while Mr Clarke was raising interest rates. If the chairman of the Conservatives continues the slapstick he has started, we must all smile sweetly and say: 'It's That Man Again.' None of this would matter were it not for the government's desperate need to show that it is in control of its own conduct, that it is in a position to take two or three steps at a time without falling flat. Before the summer break I wondered aloud whether we could detect signs that Mr Major was getting better at his job. Not quite yet perhaps, but if he was blessed with a good - lucky - summer, his party would discover that he had re-established 'grip', leadership, an ability to convey the sense that he and his ministers were in charge and knew what they were doing. Alas for them, the Conservatives have not had a good July and August. The government has come out of it more spectacularly unpopular than it was in the spring. The prime minister, poor chap, runs and runs and stays in the same place. Quite possibly one cause is that other man again. As he indicates on the page opposite, Mr Tony Blair is claiming for the Labour party the image of financial rectitude that has fallen from the Conservatives' grasp. If the chancellor and the governor perceive a need for an increase in rates, he suggests, they must be right. Of course the new Labour leader also argues that a government under his prime ministership would not have started from here. It would have invested in infrastructure, education and training and thus be running an economy that could sustain low inflation at a higher rate of growth than achieved under the Conservatives. This is the argument put over the past year or so by the shadow chancellor. Mr Gordon Brown was away yesterday. Mr Blair's presentation of Mr Brown's thesis is of greater significance than is accounted for by a clash of diaries. We can take or leave the bit about Labour having the better formula for growth. The key point is Mr Blair's carefully implied commitment to low inflation. This may be interpreted as yet another tug of the party towards the centre of British politics. It is all of a piece with his tilt away from a pro-Catholic stance in Northern Ireland, his refusal to support the railway signallers' strike, and his outspoken statement that a married heterosexual couple is the best unit for the upbringing of children. Britain's silent majority, conservative at heart, will doubtless be comforted by such sentiments. Mr Major seeks to project a similar message. He has shown courage and consistency in dealing with Northern Ireland, but for the rest he is hamstrung. Since it has been there so long, the government gets the blame for everything that goes wrong. It is so out of favour that it cannot make political capital out of a prolonged and irritating railway strike. This casts a shadow over the chancellor's expectations of promotion. For while Mr Clarke may one day win the leadership of the Conservative party, conservatives are looking to Labour for their salvation.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: GE Capital pays Dollars 400m for Harcourt businesses One week after withdrawing its Dollars 2.2bn bid for US insurance and fund management group Kemper, GE Capital announced it is to pay Dollars 400m cash for the insurance business of Harcourt General. The financial services arm of General Electric will acquire three life insurance companies owned by Harcourt which between them have assets of Dollars 3bn and generated revenues in the year to last October of Dollars 550m. The proceeds of the sale, which amount to Dollars 375m after tax, will boost Harcourt's war chest for future takeovers. Mr Robert Tarr, chief executive, said the company now had cash balances of Dollars 800m and 'continued to look for acquisition opportunities'. Harcourt announced in February that it was planning to sell the companies in order to concentrate on its publishing and specialty retailing businesses. It had acquired the three - Federal Home Life, PHF Life and Harvest Life - as part of the acquisition of the publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1991. GE Capital said it would operate the companies as part of GNA, its existing insurance business. The companies underwrite individual life, health, accident and credit insurance, and sell annuity products. GE Capital dropped its bid for Kemper last week after its offer was topped by Conseco, another insurance group. GE Capital and GTE said the GTE Spacenet satellite communications business would be acquired by GE American Communications, a GE Capital company, Reuter adds from Stamford, Connecticut. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

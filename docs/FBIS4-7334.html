			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Khalequzzaman Bhuiyan,  convenor of the Central Committee of the Socialist Party of  Bangladesh, in a statement April 7 charged that the United  States was spreading a false propaganda without any evidence of  "nuclear arms development" by the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea and using the International Atomic Energy Agency and  the United Nations for the purpose.    "It is an anachronistic dream to try to stifle socialist  Korea and establish `domination' over the world with nuclear  weapons", he said, urging the United States to withdraw its  forces from South Korea.    The Action Front of Malaysia in a protest letter to Kim  Yong-sam on April 19 wrote that "development of nuclear weapons"  by North Korea was, in actuality, a false propaganda invented by  the West and that the South Korean authorities must not play  into the hands of the United States which is seeking its  political interests and hegemonism in Northeast Asia.</p>

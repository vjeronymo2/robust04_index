Speaking at an ANC fundraising  dinner in East London, he also said neither he nor ANC President  Nelson Mandela had accepted an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland].    He said the ANC had been looking forward to the meeting  which  was to have been held with the Zulu king this week but was  cancelled. "As of now we have never received any proposal from  the Zulu king as to what he wants so we don't know what he wants  apart from what was reported in the newspapers. We would like  to engage the king to hear what he wants and to see in what  manner whatever concerns he expresses can be addressed."    Clearly, in legal, political and constitutional terms, and  in  ordinary reality there was no such thing as an independent  kwaZulu/Natal. The question of the secession of any part of  South Africa could not be decided on except through democratic  processes. "Any matter that has to do with dismemberment of  South Africa in any way is a matter that would have to be  decided by the people of South Africa as a whole."    He said the ANC had not agreed to a volkstaat. What it had  agreed was to continue discussions with what was now called the  Freedom Front on the idea of a volkstaat. "To continue the  discussions and possibly conclude them before the elections,  we've agreed to that."    A document agreed to by the ANC and the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Union] in September last year stipulated  that any solution to the volkstaat question would have to be  consistent with the principles of democracy and non-racialism.  The two sides had agreed that any further discussion on the  issue should be guided by these principles. "So the proponents  of a volkstaat have an obligation to make proposals about a  (territory) that would be democratic, non-racial,  anti-apartheid, resulting in peace, absence of conflict and so  on. If a volkstaat consistent with these principles can be  proposed, I don't think the ANC will have a problem with it."  However no such proposal had been made. "So there is no  volkstaat to be accepted by Nelson Mandela or myself."</p>

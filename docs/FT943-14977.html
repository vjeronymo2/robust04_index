			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy Yesterday's producer price figures provide ammunition for both optimists and pessimists on inflation. Input prices are accelerating faster than financial markets expected, driven by the upswing in the commodity cycle. That will not surprise companies operating at the cutting edge of the real economy; prices of basic raw materials such as pulp, plasterboard and PVC have been rising for months. Yet the lowest annual growth in output prices since the late 1960's suggests these manufacturers have not been able to pass on higher raw materials costs to their customers. Against that background, the rise in the number of companies looking to increase prices - recorded by the CBI last month - looks more like wishful thinking than a real inflationary threat. There is no denying that manufacturers' margins are being squeezed at present, even though falling input prices in the second half of last year allowed margins to be widened a touch. Commodity prices are also a relatively small proportion of manufacturers' total costs. If tomorrow's average earnings figures show upward pressure on unit labour costs, the markets will have more reason to worry.</p>

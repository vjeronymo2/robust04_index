			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONN FAVORS E. GERMANS' BENEFIT CUTS;  </P> <P> EUROPE: THE CONTINUING INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS FROM THE EAST IS CAUSING  RESENTMENT. A CHANGE IN TREATMENT OF NEW ARRIVALS IS EXPECTED.  </P> <P> The major West German political parties are lining up in favor of a crackdown  on some of the benefits automatically extended to immigrants from East Germany.  </P> <P> The policy change is expected to be made after Sunday's national election in  East Germany, according to political sources here.  </P> <P> The continuing influx of East Germans, at a rate of more than 2,000 a day, has  been an increasing source of friction in West Germany's affluent society as  refugees from the East take up scarce living space in cities. Now a rising tide  of complaint by West Germans that East Germans are straining their social  services has forced the government to agree privately to cancel some benefits,  such as preferential emergency housing, that are given the newcomers.  </P> <P> Government sources said Tuesday that measures curbing benefits might be  announced as early as this week. They said the issue is on the agenda of next  week's Bonn Cabinet meeting.  </P> <P> Over the weekend, Oskar Lafontaine, the premier of Saarland state and the  opposition Social Democrats' likely candidate for the chancellery in West  Germany's next national election, announced that his party would end most of  the benefits given East Germans.  </P> <P> Under his plan, incoming East Germans would receive pensions if they are of  retirement age, but the pensions would not be as high as those for West Germans  who spent their adult lives working for their own pensions.  </P> <P> Further, he and other politicians have called for a wide range of measures that  would keep East Germans from coming to the West.  </P> <P> Lafontaine said the money used to provide emergency services to East Germans  could be better spent building up East German roads and cities to help keep  would-be refugees at home.  </P> <P> At the same time, Wolfgang Mishnick, the leader of the Free Democrats, the  junior partner in the West German governing coalition, declared that emergency  housing for the "resettlers" should be stopped after Sunday's election.  </P> <P> Most West German cities can absorb few additional immigrants, who are now  housed in gymnasiums, converted freight containers, air raid shelters, church  grounds and even on ships in ports such as Bremen and Hamburg.  </P> <P> Sixty-four cities and towns in the most populous state of North  Rhine-Westphalia, including prosperous Duesseldorf, have imposed a two-month  ban on newcomers from the East; others refuse to accept them altogether on the  grounds that they are already overcrowded.  </P> <P> Of the nearly 150,000 East Germans who have arrived in West Germany this year,  only an estimated 10,000 had homes to head for.  </P> <P> When the exodus from East Germany began last summer, many West German cities  and citizens welcomed the newcomers, seeing them as brave young people fleeing  Communist oppression.  </P> <P> But with the razing of the Berlin Wall and the liberalization of the East  German regime, most West Germans now view the newcomers as purely economic  refugees looking for a better life. And the increasingly bitter feeling is that  they are seeking that better life at the expense of West Germans who have  worked hard for what they enjoy.  </P></p>

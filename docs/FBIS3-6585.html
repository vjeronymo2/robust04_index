Yi said he was told by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu over  the  telephone that Han and his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher  coordinated their position over the phone a day earlier.    If Pyongyang refuses any either of additional IAEA  inspection  or inter-Korean envoy exchange, the third-round high-level talks  with Washington cannot take place and Team Spirit will be held  this year, Han was quoted as saying.    Under such circumstance, North Korean nuclear problem will  be  inevitably referred to the Security Council, which likely will  create tension in the Korean peninsula, Han told Yi. But Seoul  and Washington will make efforts to persuade Pyongyang in  agreeing to extra IAEA inspections and continue inter-Korean  dialogue to realize envoy exchange, Han said. "It now looks like  the (North Korean nuclear) problem has returned to the starting  point and all channels blocked, but in the long run, there is  room for hope if we continue dialogue," Han was quoted as saying.    Through dialogue efforts in the past year, North Korea has  lost sympathy from the international community and Seoul and  Washington have obtained sufficient grounds to persuade China to  follow their steps in regards to possible decision by the  Security Council, he said.    The government and DLP [Democratic Liberal Party] will meet  next week to discuss the North Korean nuclear problem.</p>

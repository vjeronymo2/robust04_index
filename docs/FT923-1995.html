			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Oki expects to make first loss for six years OKI Electric Industry, the Japanese communications equipment maker, expects to make an unconsolidated pre-tax loss of Y25bn (Dollars 200m) for the year ending next March, its first loss for six years. Oki blamed the slump in the semiconductor market. It added it will suspend its dividend payment for the first time in 14 years. The company had originally projected a Y2bn pre-tax profit and a Y3.5 dividend per share. It revised down its sales forecast to Y580bn from Y600bn, and said it would post an after-tax loss of Y16bn instead of an after-tax profit of Y9bn. For the first half to September, Oki said it would register Y19bn in pre-tax losses and Y9bn in after-tax losses, on sales of Y260bn. Oki said capital spending for the full year would be reduced to Y50bn from the planned Y53bn. The company said it would try to cut the workforce by 2,000 over the next three years. Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker, has revised upwards its forecast for the interim period to September due to brisk sales in video game machines. Its half-year pre-tax profit is expected to rise 6.5 per cent to Y81bn. It plans to increase its interim dividend by Y10 per share to Y35.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Gonzalez may have to seek coalition partners PRIME MINISTER Felipe Gonzalez of Spain yesterday celebrated his fourth successive general election victory by preparing a government which he has promised would contain many new faces. That administration could also include the conservative Catalan Convergencia i Unio as a coalition partner, although Mr Gonzalez might try first to form a minority government. The peseta rallied powerfully inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday in the wake of Mr Gonzalez's victory. Foreign exchange markets greeted the surprisingly comfortable victory by Mr Gonzalez and his Socialist party by lifting the peseta. In London, it finished at Pta76.84 against the D-Mark after closing on Friday at Pta78.27, and remained in second place in the ERM grid. The Madrid stock market took a gloomier view of the Socialist victory and the general index fell 4.4 points in moderate trading. The markets had assumed that a widely predicted victory by the conservative People's Party, led by Mr Jose Mara Aznar, would have resulted in early cuts in interest rates to revive the flagging Spanish economy. Mr Gonzalez, backed by the Bank of Spain, is likely to be much more cautious about lowering rates and is likely to concentrate in the next few weeks on introducing fiscal austerity measures and a tough 1994 budget to defend the peseta against attack by speculators sceptical of Socialist determination to cut public spending and budget deficits in the middle of a recession. In Sunday's election, the Socialists won 38.68 per cent of the vote and 159 seats, but lost their overall majority. Mr Gonzalez had held 175 seats in the 350-seat parliament since the last election in 1989. The PP won 141 seats, with the PP vote increasing from 25.9 per cent (107 seats in 1989) to 34.81 per cent. There were nearly 3m voters new to the party. There were no immediate clues as to whom Mr Gonzalez might invite into a coalition if he were to form one. The most likely partner would be the CiU, which governs Catalonia. With the CiU's 17 seats, the Socialists would have an overall majority in parliament. The Catalans are conservative and fiscally disciplined and the markets would view an alliance with them favourably. But Mr Gonzalez might find it easier to persuade his party to support potentially unpopular policies if he initially formed a minority government, rather than depending on a conservative coalition partner.

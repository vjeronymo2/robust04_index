			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc and lead prices rise on Australian group's output cuts ZINC PRICES jumped by more than 5 per cent when trading started in London yesterday after Pasminco, the Australian natural resources group, said market conditions were forcing it to restructure its loss-making zinc and lead mining operations at Broken Hill, with the loss of 500 jobs. Lead prices also moved up as analysts calculated that the restructuring would remove roughly 25,000 tonnes a year of zinc and about 32,600 tonnes of lead from the market. Some analysts suggested, however, that the higher prices would be short-lived unless other producers followed Pasminco's example. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group, said: 'It is rather surprising that this news has had such an effect. I would expect selling to come in when the market has reconsidered.' He suggested the higher price levels would not be sustained 'unless there are more cuts and the market is certainly nervous about this possibility.' Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, a subsidiary of the Westpac banking group, pointed out, however, that, although Pasminco's production cuts did not look very substantial when compared with zinc stocks of nearly 1m tonnes or lead stocks of about 640,000 tonnes, they would have an important impact on market supply and demand this year. He calculated that, if nothing else changed, the expected statistical supply deficit in the zinc market this year would increase from 50,000 to 82,000 tonnes while 'at one stroke the lead supply surplus is eradicated.' Mr Moore said that 'at today's prices' more zinc production cuts must be expected. On the London Metal Exchange zinc for delivery in three months reached Dollars 1,127 a tonne in early trading, an eight-week peak, before closing at Dollars 1,115.25, up Dollars 40.75. Three-month lead closed up Pounds 7.375 a tonne at Pounds 295.50. Pasminco said its Broken Hill operations were too inefficient to operate profitably at current low world prices for lead and zinc, in spite of capital investment of ADollars 304m since 1988. It said the northern operations, previously scheduled to close in 1995, would shut immediately because of mounting losses and the poor economic outlook in Australia and other developed countries. The remaining southern operations were to be restructured to increase production to 3,000 tonnes of ore a year from each employee, from about 1,500 tonnes a year. This would boost production at the southern operations to 2.4m tonnes a year compared with current production of about 2.6m tonnes from the combined operations. Asset write-downs, redundancy payments and restructuring were expected to cost about ADollars 40m before tax. Pasminco said in October that it expected to return to profitability in the year to June, following two years of heavy losses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- A draft report compiled by a  working group of the ruling coalition calls for the abolition of  regional bureaus of the construction, transport and other  government ministries, coalition officials said Tuesday [17 May].    The unit of the coalition's Tax Reform Consultation Group  also urged an early enactment of a basic law to promote the  decentralization of power.    The decentralization of power and local administrative  reforms should be pursued before tax reforms are implemented,  according to the report.    The proposal is intended to promote local administrative  reforms and the consolidation of local communities, the  officials said.    The proposal is expected to be incorporated into a package  of  recommendations a subcommittee on administrative and fiscal  reforms under the consultation group will make within the month,  they said.    Government ministries, however, are expected to resist the  proposed abolition of regional bureaus, government sources said.</p>

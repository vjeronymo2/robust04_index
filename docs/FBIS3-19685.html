			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Tissy Bruns </F> and Hans Monath; place and date not given: "We Want To Become  the Strongest Force"]    [Text] [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Scharping, you are the  success of the year. However, there are objections to you in  part of the political spectrum -- above all among those whom the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] wanted to reach in the  eighties.    [Scharping] I do not see it in this way. According to the  polls, the SPD has stabilized at 40 percent. This is a good  starting position, which is also confirmed by the election  result in Lower Saxony. If the question is aimed at the  occasional criticism that topics like equal status for women,  the protection of the natural foundations of life, or others are  receding into the background, this is not correct. They are  only increasingly related to the main social problem: the  combating of unemployment and the reestablishment of social  justice.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] However, these topics are not identical.  A topical example: The government program retreats on the  demand for a general speed limit and is not very specific about  a gasoline price increase.    [Scharping] The exciting question is how an ecologically  tolerable traffic policy is to be drawn up. Regarding  consumption, one has to provide the car industry with incentives  and, at the same time, with reliable basic conditions, so that a  reduction in so-called car fleet consumption becomes possible.  First of all, this is a matter of technical progress.  Regarding the speed limit, differentiated solutions that are in  keeping with the situation will be required. It is not very  imaginative to put up a sign with a speed limit everywhere. In  exclusively residential areas the speed limit of 30 km per hour  is appropriate and the municipalities have to be enabled to push  it through. A speed of 90 or 100 km per hour is appropriate on  highways, and on superhighways the location of the driver, the  traffic density, and the traffic burden make a difference. A  four-lane superhighway near a city is different from a six-lane  one somewhere in the country. We have an increasing number of  technical opportunities to react appropriately to these  different situations. We do not exclude the speed limit from  the program -- in no way. But a simple yes or no to the speed  limit results in a discussion on symbols, and symbolic debates  are usually rather fruitless. I give you an example: The Land  of Rhineland- Palatinate has always been suspected of opposing  the speed limit. In fact, there is a speed limit on 40 percent  of the superhighways in Rhineland-Palatinate, which is more than  in any other land, and their experience regarding accident rates  is very good. If this is flexibly handled, technical  possibilities and the people's sense of responsibility can be  usefully combined.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] You have given the country your three  topics: Work, work, work. When we hear the SPD talk about  ecology today, it often sounds like an appendage.    [Scharping] Then I recommend you to listen more closely.  Economy and ecology are inseparable components of the  development of the future. One must not create an artificial  contradiction between them. They are integrated, interrelated,  and unrenounceable components of the future development.  Economic development means growth that is in line with the  environment, but also the modernization of the social state, the  reduction of labor costs, and an intelligent organization of  work. There are people who believe that the economic  development could be more or less pursued from an Archimedean  point. I think that this is a rather primitive way of thinking  in a highly complicated and strongly intertwined society where  labor is divided. A point from which the whole complex  development can be advanced does not exist.    I want to give an example. At the end of the sixties, the  law on stability and growth was very much discussed in Germany.  More precisely: The magic quadrilateral was constantly  discussed because Karl Schiller had invented the formula of the  magic quadrilateral. It consisted of price stability, a balance  in foreign trade, full employment, and adequate economic growth.  It must be possible today to count at least up to three. That  is, modernization of the economy, intelligent organization of  work, and modernization of the activities of the state,  including the social state. This has to be translated into  reality. Ecologically oriented growth is an integral part of  the modernization of the economy.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] You want a leaner state and commit  yourself to the framework in the government program: no  increase in the state quota and no increase in the state debts.  You would be a chancellor of the crisis. Do you think that  there are also chances in the crisis?    [Scharping] Crisis? Let us rather talk of challenges.  First of all, ecological growth and, second, chances for the  modernization of the activities of the state. What is the  state? From my point of view, it has to guarantee the civilized  coexistence of people on the foundation of basic values and  basic rights and it has to guarantee the equality of  opportunities.    Whatever aspects may be taken -- social differences or equal  status for men and women -- I always come to the same result:  It is the task of the state to make a civilized coexistence  possible. It creates the framework for private initiative, also  for a private sense of responsibility toward the community, and  it has to provide equal opportunities.    However, this part of the state's activity is only accepted  if the citizens know and can trust that the state will use the  means entrusted to it in the most cost-advantageous and just way  possible. All three aspects, justice, efficiency, and  cost-consciousness, are grossly neglected at present.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Only by the Kohl government?    [Scharping] By the present government policy and by a social  trend that has developed all virtues of "I" considerably more  than the virtues of "we." A new balance has to be found.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] The virtues of "we" include the  preparedness for sharing. This cannot be ordered from above.  Is national feeling required for it today?    [Scharping] No, not at all. A sense of responsibility is  required, as well as the ability to put the striving for one's  happiness into a joint context. Everyone has the moral  obligation to contribute to the public welfare, the preamble to  the Hamburg constitution says. One could also quote Kant's  categorical imperative or Thomas Aquinas' four basic virtues.  Whatever it may be -- civilized societies cannot manage without  the harmony of freedom, equality, and fraternity.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] But this does not explain why I am  supposed to pay surcharges for people in the new laender and not  for people in Portugal.    [Scharping] I would not propose that to anyone. It would be  an absurd undertaking to play Germany's inner development off  against global questions of underdevelopment, the protection of  human rights, or environmental protection on a global scale.  But the opposite must not be done either. Aggression develops  from the social problems in Germany, from fear, hopelessness,  and the concern about jobs. Xenophobia, the hatred for  minorities, and the disregard of other cultures develop from  aggression. Precisely those who are interested in  multiculturalism, the respect for other opinions, and social  tolerance ought to advocate economic stability and social  justice all the more.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] This sounds good....    [Scharping] It not only sounds good. It is the truth.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] The Greens would immediately support the  concepts of tolerance and multiculturalism. Can you envisage a  Green foreign minister?    [Scharping] I will not hold any debates on a coalition, not  even on the sly. There will only be a political change in  Germany if the SPD clearly becomes stronger. But I add the  following: Policies cannot be made with trivial nonsense -- the  dissolution of the Bundeswehr and NATO, the immediate  introduction of a gasoline price of 5 German marks per liter.  Nor will the Greens' reliability increase if their leading  representatives state immediately after a party congress where  such resolutions were adopted that they are not so serious.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Have you therefore already eliminated a  possible coalition partner?    [Scharping] Once again: I do not hold any debates on  coalitions.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Scharping, we have not even asked you  a question about a coalition....    [Scharping] You asked whether I eliminate anyone. I only  rule out one thing, that is, a grand coalition.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] There is no doubt that you will need a  coalition partner. Thus, we are interested in your judgment of  the eligible candidates.    [Scharping] We can calmly wait for all that. Just like the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic Party  of Germany [FDP], the Greens are political opponents. Of  course, I want to convince many of those who have so far voted  for the Greens in the same way as others who have voted for the  CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] or the FDP so far. I value the  voters of all other parties. I have the firm impression that  the supply of possible coalitions will be greater than the  demand. Expressed in terms of the market economy, this, of  course, reduces the price. We want to become the strongest  force.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] We give up, and express our interest in  the plans of the strongest force. Did you start too early?  Your topic of work has been taken up by all parties. Now  people are asking about concrete alternatives to the SPD.    [Scharping] At any rate, the concern of the CDU/CSU about  the possible loss of government responsibility is perceptible  for the first time. This is justified and good from my point of  view and even urgently necessary from a general point of view.  This party has to be replaced because there is nobody who is so  much to blame for economic mistakes, the highest mass  unemployment rate, bitter social injustice, and the apparent  financial crisis of the state. In the first place, and for me  the most important, it has lost the direct and immediate basic  political capital, that is, confidence.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Will the slight economic upswing turn the  tables once again? The CDU/CSU is banking on it.    [Scharping] But what do we have in this field?  Unfortunately, I add immediately. In December 1993 there was a  sharp decline, particularly in the field of industrial  production. Now there are slight improvements, as compared to a  very bad year. This is to be explicitly welcomed and even more  so if the tender shoots of growth were even more ecologically  oriented. However, everyone knows that we would need a growth  of at least 1.5 percent or rather of 2 percent for the labor  market to move. Unfortunately, we will not achieve this growth  in the course of 1994. If this trivial economic policy, which  is completely uncertain for the enterprises that make  investments and hardly reliable, is not changed, nothing new  will develop.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] What does your program tell the voters:  The SPD does the following three things differently and better?    [Scharping] The economic and labor market policy, the social  policy, including help for families with children, and  distribution of burdens for inner unity. To start with the  last: The financial contributions to inner unity, which I  explicitly believe to be right, must not continue to be settled  at the expense of the employees and the wage- and  employment-intensive enterprises. For this destroys and impairs  the competitiveness of the medium-sized enterprises and craft  industries. Most of the innovations come from there, most of  the jobs are there -- that is, 50 percent -- and 70 percent of  the training takes place there. Thus, we are damaging our  economic future and social justice if we continue the usual  financing via solidarity funds and ancillary wage costs. With  all that, it is completely clear that the tax and rate quota to  be reached in 1995 must not be changed. However, within this  framework, there must be shifts because of economic reason and  social justice.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Let us come to the topic of foreign  policy. You said at the security conference there are no real  differences to that of the FRG Government. The Federal  Government presented a white book that provides for crisis  reaction forces for missions all over the world. The SPD  resolution was: No combat missions. Which is correct?    [Scharping] There are no differences in the basic  orientations: European integration, transatlantic partnership,  reliable and, if possible, friendly relations with the Eastern  states.    [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Combat missions: yes or no -- this is  also a basic question.    [Scharping] Regarding the combat missions, there is a clear  dividing line and a massive conflict between the SPD and the  government parties. We want to be a UN member, protect our  rights, and fulfill our duties there. We are sovereign in the  decision on how we will do this. Therefore, the Social  Democrats say: Strengthening the United Nations, yes to  peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The resolution adopted  at the Wiesbaden party congress draws a line that we will not  cross: No actions like the Gulf war.    [DIE TAGESZEITING] If you become chancellor, how will you  celebrate 8 May 1995?    [Scharping] As a day that freed Germany from fascism.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER NAMED AS FINALIST FOR CINCINNATI POST  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager John F. Shirey is one of seven candidates for the city  manager's job in Cincinnati.  </P> <P> City officials there released the names of the finalists last week.  </P> <P> Shirey said he has not been officially notified that he is on the finalist list  and has not been interviewed.  </P> <P> Shirey, the second-highest ranking official in city government, has been  assistant city manager for three years. He said Thursday that he is not  actively looking for a job but was contacted by a recruiter about the  Cincinnati post and decided that he is interested.  </P> <P> "I don't want you to say that I'm unhappy and disgruntled and looking to leave,  because I'm not," said Shirey, 41. "(Cincinnati is) a large city with large  city problems and large city challenges and a lot like what we find in Long  Beach. The difference is I would be the city manager and not No. 2."  </P> <P> Shirey said he expects he will go to Ohio for interviews next month. BETTINA  BOXALL  </P></p>

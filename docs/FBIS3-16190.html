Both countries have abolished customs check points to  encourage free movement of goods across the border. As a  result, the prices of food in local market places in the Kazakh  town of Shymkent located close to the Uzbek capital are lower  than those in state-run shops. Enterprises of the two republics  are also boosting direct ties.</p>

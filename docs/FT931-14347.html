			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Cost controls help Aerospace Engineering rise to Pounds 109,000 AEROSPACE Engineering, the Swindon-based precision engineering group, yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 27,000 to Pounds 109,000 for the half year to October 31. Mr John Davis, chairman, attributed the improvement to shrewd cash management, cost control and benefits flowing from the disposal of the loss-making aero engine testing business in July. The proceeds from that deal enabled the group - which turned in a Pounds 230,000 pre-tax loss in the last financial year - to reduce borrowings by Pounds 900,000. At October 31 these stood at Pounds 8.28m compared with Pounds 11m six months earlier. However, reflecting both the first-half performance and current trading conditions, the interim dividend is halved to 0.25p. Earnings per share emerged at 0.19p (0.05p). Turnover from the continuing aerospace engineering and electronics divisions, and the newly-formed power and control division, dipped to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 13.4m) - overall sales for the comparable period of the previous year amounted to Pounds 15.1m. Pressure on prices cut operating profits to Pounds 675,000 (Pounds 1.12m), but interest charges fell to Pounds 545,000 (Pounds 703,000). Mr Davis said trading conditions were unlikely to improve by the year-end. However, the aerospace division would benefit from the airline industry's growing preference for 'one-stop shop' engineering services and resilient demand for new aircraft. In addition, the electronics division generated strong interest in its latest microwave circuitry, vital for the transmission of large amounts of data in satellite and mobile communication systems.</p>

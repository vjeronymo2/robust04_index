Meanwhile, rapid increases  in cross-Strait economic exchanges have considerably enhanced  Taiwan's economic progress. Consequently, while maintaining a  medium-growth rate, Taiwan has been moving toward economic  recovery.    According to an estimation by Taiwan's "Economics Ministry,"  with a total output value of more than $10,000 per capita,  Taiwan's economic growth rate in 1993 was 6.08 percent, which  fell short of its original growth target of 7.00 percent. Due  to a recession in western countries in the first half of 1993,  there was almost no increase in Taiwan's industrial production,  exports, and export orders. The balance of Taiwan's foreign  exchange accounts, its currency supply, its stock price indices,  and the exchange rates for the New Taiwan dollar have dropped  considerably. In the second half of 1993, after the Taiwan  authorities drastically curtailed its Six- Year Economic  Construction Plan and formulated the Economic Invigoration  Program, and with various internal and external factors exerting  a comprehensive impact on the island, Taiwan's economic  conditions have improved somewhat.    Over the past year Taiwan's foreign trade gradually slowed  as  its principal economic component. Its exports to Europe and the  United States have decreased. Its trade deficit with Japan have  continued to worsen, with expected trade deficits with Japan for  the entire year totalling over $13 billion. According to  statistics, as of 20 November Taiwan's total imports and exports  were $68.7 billion and $57.6 billion respectively, registering  corresponding growth rates of 8.3 percent and 4.2 percent. Its  foreign trade surplus was $940 million [figures as printed],  down $2.23 billion over the same period in 1992.    That Taiwan was able to maintain a medium economic growth  rate of about 6 percent has an inseparable connection with the  rapid increase in cross-Strait economic exchanges. According to  Taiwan's statistics, cross-Strait transshipping trade from  January to September 1993 totalled $6.39 billion, and the value  for the entire year is expected to surpass $9 billion.  According to statistics, after the value on cross-Strait trade  with the PRC was deducted, Taiwan's foreign trade grew only 0.7  percent in 1993. Additionally, as a result of economic progress  in the PRC, Taiwanese businessmen have rapidly increased their  investments on the mainland. According to a survey by the  Zhonghua [Chung-hua] Institute for Economic Research, for every  U.S. dollar invested by Taiwanese businessmen in the PRC, Taiwan  will be able to increase its exports by $2. Taiwan's "Economic  Affairs Minister" Jiang Bingkun [Chiang Ping- kun] admitted:  The development of cross-Strait economic relations and trade  has become the driving force for Taiwan's economic progress.    Furthermore, economic transformation has gradually spread.  Following the expansion of island-wide demand in recent years,  Taiwan has accelerated its industrial restructuring. On the one  hand, contributions by the services industry to the total output  value will further increase; they are expected to reach 56  percent, higher than that of the manufacturing industry. On the  other hand, the number of labor-intensive industries has further  declined, whereas the number of capital and technology-intensive  industries has risen steadily. Small enterprises have been  developing into large ones. Large enterprises and giant  financial groups have been playing more and more important roles  during Taiwan's economic progress. Following changes in  industrial organizations, the markets of many manufacturing  industries -- including vehicle, engines, computer software and  hardware devices, and the paper making industry -- have  gradually fallen under the control of a small number of giant  firms. According to a survey, 300 large enterprise groups  control some 20 percent of Taiwan's nongovernmental economic  resources, a quarter of which are in the hands of five family  groups including Wang Yongqing, Gu Zhenfu, Cai Wanlin, Wu  Dongjin, and Xu Youxiang. The annual transactional value of the  five family groups amounts to 6,000 billion Taiwan dollars, or  more than 10 percent of Taiwan's annual total output.    Though Taiwan has begun to transform its economy from  catering to exports to fulfilling internal demand, the  willingness to invest within the island is still low. The  investment environment has not improved because of the  following: old production systems have not been withdrawn; new  production systems have not been established; and problems  include difficulties in obtaining land, increases in labor  wages, higher environmental protection requirements, and adverse  impacts from political factors. Small and medium enterprises  have continued to move out. Taiwan lacks a powerful internal  force to enhance economic progress. The "Economic Invigoration  Program" aimed at spurring the nongovernmental sector's  enthusiasm to invest has failed to obtain its expected target.  The number of newly-registered companies has been declining  every month since May 1993.    There are hidden worries about whether Taiwan can still  achieve economic progress in 1994. Factors which will propel  Taiwan's economy to recover to some extent include official  efforts towards "economic invigoration," the launching of large  investment projects already formulated by some giant financial  groups, and the ongoing rapid development in cross-Strait  economic relations and trade exchanges; but the economy will not  develop rapidly. Restraining factors which will hinder Taiwan's  economic progress are the restricting international economic  recession and the Taiwanese authorities' financial difficulties  in 1994, due to which the rate of increase in public investment  within the island will decline; private consumption, after  rising for several consecutive years, may also decline in 1994.</p>

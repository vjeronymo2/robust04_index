			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / People: Summers move to Capel Mark Summers, previously chairman of Hill Samuel Private Client Management, has moved to James Capel, responsible for business development within the investment management division. 'TSB (Hill Samuel's parent) had been taking quite a tight grip on us and one of the things they decided to do was to put the private client investment management operation into a newly created Knightsbridge private bank.' He disagreed with the strategy, and was anyway invited to take early retirement, after 31 years at Hill Samuel. Summers, 53, says that 'with children to educate and so on, I was looking for a house that could utilise my experience and it seemed that James Capel possessed very much the same ethos as we had'. His task is to increase public and professional awareness of James Capel's private client investment operation where funds under management have increased from Pounds 300m six years ago to Pounds 2bn today.</p>

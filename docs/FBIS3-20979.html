			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anne Lombard: "Chlorine Regulated At the Faucet"] </F>   [Text] The Lyonnaise des Eaux [water company of Lyon]  and SAGEP [water company of Paris] are validating the first  installation of electrochemical microsensors--amperometric cells  costing less than 10 francs[Fr] each--to regulate the chlorine  in potable water.    Since chlorine must be used to purify potable water, sensors  are needed to verify that the chlorine content is neither too  high nor too low. The question is at one and the same time a  legal one (0.1 mg/l of admissible residual chlorine), one of  prevention (kill the bacteria without poisoning the drinker),  and one of comfort (ugh! the horrible taste of javel water!).  The answer? Regulate the dosage continuously and in real time.  Drawn by the technology of chemical microsensors, Sagep,  Lyonnaise des Eaux, and Parisienne des Eaux, have recently  achieved the first chlorine amperometric microsensor for use in  water. Apic Systeme, another subsidiary of the Lyonnaise  company, together with Cylergie, a GIE [economic interest group]  subsidiary of the Lyonnaise des Eaux, and the Swiss Microsens  company, developed the measurement operating software. The  project required three engineer-years and an investment of Fr1  million a year over a period of two years. Several pilot  installations, each equipped with some 15 sensors, are  undergoing validation in Paris and in the regions.  <H5>  Enhanced Reliability </H5>   Manufactured as an electronics component, hence  mass-produced, each amperometric cell will cost around 10  francs. At this price, it will be feasible to multiply the  number of cells and to effect measurements on a continuous  scale, in real time (the response time of the sensor is less  than a minute), and with reliability enhanced by multiplying the  number of measurement points. By means of these tiny throw-away  chips (they are 1.5 mm thick, 4 mm wide, and have a life of six  months), the chlorine will be regulated... at the consumer's  faucet! By way of comparison, the macrosensors used, one at the  output of a water treatment plant, and one at the input to the  distribution network, cost Fr60,000 each. They require bimonthly  maintenance. The microsensor requires none. The Lyonnaise  company will market the method both by sale of the cell to other  water companies, and in the form of a "pen" for spot-testing  samples. The company is conducting research in the direction of  bacteriological detection.</p>

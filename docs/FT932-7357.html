			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Investors turn up their noses at food shares: Guy de Jonquieres explains a change of recipe as markets look for defensive stocks STOCK markets have long viewed food manufacturing as a safe haven in harsh economic times. Yet despite deepening recession in continental Europe and uncertain recoveries in the US and Britain, many branded food stocks on both sides of the Atlantic have recently sunk to low levels. Last week, prices of European industry leaders, including Cadbury Schweppes, Unilever and United Biscuits fell further after Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN, said France's biggest food company was ready to cut prices to hold its market share of difficult markets. How difficult is clear from the 5.7 per cent drop in BSN's first-quarter sales. In the same period, Unilever's operating profits stagnated in Europe and North America, while at Nestle, the world's largest food company, sales volumes rose only 1 per cent. This gloomy news comes less than two months after Philip Morris, the world's biggest tobacco company, rocked confidence in the power of consumer brands by slashing the US price of Marlboro cigarettes to keep market share. There is growing evidence that the industry is gripped by fundamental forces, which augur yet fiercer competition and further structural change. The recent worldwide fixation among consumers of all income groups with price and value is viewed by many manufacturers as a permanent trend. One reason is the widespread expectation that economic recovery will be sluggish. 'In earlier recessions, people thought that when it was all over, they would board an express train again,' says Mr John Campbell, an industry analyst with County NatWest. 'That is not their perception this time.' But consumers are also becoming more discriminating as they are bombarded with an ever wider choice of products by manufacturers seeking growth in food markets where overall volumes are flat. That is particularly true in the US, where many product categories are contested by more numerous, equally-matched companies than in Europe. In many European countries, by contrast, competition in the food industry is more often imposed by retailers. As they concentrate into fewer, bigger groups, with greater buying power and scale economies, they are dictating terms even to their largest suppliers. Retail pressure is intensifying at both ends of the market. At the lower end, hard discounters such as Aldi of Germany have prospered by offering a narrow line of keenly-priced basic products. After expanding strongly across the continent in the 1980s, Aldi and other European discounters have begun moving into the UK. Simultaneously, many continental supermarkets are intent on emulating the success of British chains such as J. Sainsbury, which earn large profits from high-quality own-label ranges. Mr Ian Davis, head of the European consumer industries practice of McKinsey, the management consultants, argues that own-label pricing is fast setting the standard to which branded products must compete. Both trends - also evident in slightly different forms in the US - threaten to squeeze the profit margins of branded food manufacturers long after recession is over. How can manufacturers fight back? Recent industry developments point to four broad answers: Accelerated restructuring and cost-cutting to improve margins and price competitiveness. Such initiatives have recently been taken by companies including BSN, Procter &amp; Gamble of the US and PepsiCo's Frito-Lay snacks division. More rigorous weeding out of weak businesses and a tighter focus on those with solid market positions. Though some companies, including Cadbury Schweppes, Unilever and United Biscuits, took action in the 1980s, others have been much slower. For instance, Nestle's towering strength in chocolate and soluble coffee masks mediocre performances by several other businesses in which it is a marginal player. The company recently signalled that it may start making disposals, possibly by swapping assets with competitors. More selective brand support. Cadbury has halved to six the number of brands at Trebor Bassett, its sugar confectionery division, to concentrate resources on the strongest. BSN may soon start axing brands which are not market leaders. Speedier innovation. This is the industry's current buzz-phrase, as manufacturers strive to tempt consumers and earn higher margins by developing more distinctive new products and variations of existing ones. However, the exercise has limitations. The cost of marketing new products continues to rise, and nine out of ten usually fail. Even successes can be a mixed blessing. Some manufacturers admit that the more new products they launch, the less loyal consumers are to established brands. Furthermore, some types of product, such as mineral water and baked beans, are inherently resistant to innovation. These trends together point to a more volatile and unpredictable future for an industry once renowned for its monolithic stability. But are they also a recipe for sustainable profits? Many experts agree the answer will depend on manufacturers' success in cutting costs. But even then, some believe shifts in consumer psychology and the retail environment will make really high returns increasingly hard to achieve. 'I think things are going to get a hell of a lot tougher for brands,' says Mr Davis of McKinsey. 'The real survivors will be those which can prosper on margins of 5 to 10 per cent, instead of 25 to 30 per cent.' Lex, Page 16</p>

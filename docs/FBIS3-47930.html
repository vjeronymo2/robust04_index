Consequently Denmark will  gradually cease aid.    So said Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical  Liberal Party) yesterday after a meeting with Thai Foreign  Minister Prasong Sunsiri in Bangkok. This means that Thailand  will become the first developing country ever to cease to  qualify for Danish aid because its economy is too well developed.    "But I have stressed that the country can receive other  forms  of aid. For example, soft loans and credits for noncommercial  purposes," Helveg Petersen said.    Thailand will also be able to take $25 million from  Denmark's  environment and catastrophe fund as compensation for the loss of  aid. [passage omitted]    During the talks the foreign minister also touched on  Thailand's relations with neighboring Burma.    "I stressed that every opportunity must be taken to put  pressure on the Burmese Government, and that I believe that  Thailand must continue to grant residence permits to Burmese  refugees," the foreign minister said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adnan Caglayan] </F>   [Text] Ankara--Diplomatic traffic is increasing between  Iran and Turkey due to a recently established climate of close  cooperation in economic, political and security spheres.  Iranian First Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi, Iranian  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's brother and former head of  Iranian radio and television, is expected to visit Turkey on May  2, diplomatic sources told TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN].    "Economic and political issues will be discussed by Turkish  officials during this visit. Hashemi will hold a meeting with  Turkish Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk and is  expected to be received by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and  President Suleyman Demirel," a high-ranking Iranian official  told TDN.    Hashemi will outline the Iranian government's views on  latest  developments in the region and the world, the same source said.  "The Karabakh question, the Bosnia problem and the issue of  northern Iraq will be the main topics of the consultations. The  views of the Turkish and Iranian governments are quite similar  on these subjects. The question for the two friendly countries  is how to act together to solve these problems. Economic issues  will also be discussed by Turkish and Iranian officials. There  is a political will to accelerate economic relations between the  two countries," he disclosed.    Iran has recently launched a new liberalization project,  designed by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, that aims to create a  powerful economic system, which will integrate Iran into the  global economic system. Hashemi-Rafsanjani is proposing a  privatization campaign for state-owned enterprises, to lift  government subsidies, to develop Iran's resources other than  crude oil, to encourage exporters and lessen the Iranian  economy's dependence on oil revenues.    Meanwhile, a Turkish delegation, comprising Eximbank,  Treasury and State Pipeline company (BOTAS) officials, will  visit Iran in early May.    During the visit, Turkish and Iranian officials will discuss  the natural gas pipeline project, which there are plans to  extend to Europe via Turkey. Iran, which ranks second in the  world in terms of natural gas resources, is attaching great  importance to this project since its oil export revenues are  declining due to low world market prices. Turkey is also trying  to break its dependence on natural gas imports from the Russian  Federation.    Turkey has taken an extremely positive stance toward this  project. "We want to realize it as soon as possible," Hayrettin  Uzun, general director of BOTAS, told TDN.    The delegation will determine the conditions of the purchase  by Turkey of 3 million barrels of crude oil from Iran. This  deal was decided on at the Turkey-Iran Joint Economic Commission  meeting in Tehran in February.    The talks will also focus on the economic difficulties  facing  both countries. Iran, which is trying to reschedule its foreign  debts to Western countries, is expected to propose repaying its  $70 million debt to Turkey in cash instead of with crude oil,  despite its shortage of foreign currency. Turkish and Iranian  officials will discuss how to develop the two countries'  secondary resources with the aim of increasing their revenues.  Economic relations and opportunities for cooperation with the  Central Asian republics will be two of the main items discussed  during the talks.  <H5>  Security Talks </H5>   Meanwhile, the eighth Turkey-Iran Joint Security Committee  meeting is continuing in Tehran, having begun on Monday.  Interior Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Muharrem Goktayoglu is  attending the meeting, as the head of the Turkish delegation.  Decisions reached in previous security meetings and the  activities of the subcommittees are among the topics being  debated.    The committee is working on developing new policies to be  implemented in the future.    The Joint Security Committee was established by a security  agreement signed in 1992 in Tehran. According to this  agreement, Iran has been handing over members of the outlawed  Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to Turkey.    The security agreement foresees the type of cooperation  between Turkey and Iran that will lead these countries to  handing over individuals who are suspected of perpetrating acts  against either country. Within the framework of this agreement,  joint security committees and subcommittees hold periodic  meetings to discuss latest security developments.</p>

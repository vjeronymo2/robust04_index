			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: BORDEN POSITIONS D'AMATO FOR TOP JOB  </P> <P> Anthony D'Amato has been elected president and chief operating officer of  Borden Inc. in a move that positions him to succeed Borden Chairman R. J.  Ventres when Ventres retires next year.  </P> <P> "Mr. D'Amato's promotion is an important step in preparation for an orderly  succession," Ventres said.  </P> <P> "The news signals who the next head of Borden will be," said John McMillan,  analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.  </P> <P> D'Amato, 59, is a 31-year Borden veteran who came from the company's chemical  operations. He led the evolution of that business into its current packaging  and industrial products division. His promotion is effective July 1.  </P> <P> Joseph Saggese, senior group vice president of Borden's packaging and  industrial products division, was named to succeed D'Amato.  </P> <P> In promoting an executive from the company's chemical group, Borden's board  followed precedent. Ventres and his predecessor, Eugene Sullivan, came from the  non-food side of Borden, which in 1989 accounted for 27.2% of its $7.6 billion  in revenue.  </P> <P> "The D'Amato appointment means that Borden is in capable hands and won't change  that much," McMillan said. He said the promotion, well before Ventres'  November, 1991, retirement, "gives D'Amato a chance to get his feet wet in the  food business because he comes from the chemical business."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, D'Amato said he hoped in the next year and a half to  implement Borden's plans to cut costs by restructuring its dairy division and  updating its plants and equipment worldwide.  </P> <P> "The vision and strategy have been set," D'Amato said. "I hope to be the key  factor in implementing it."  </P> <P> D'Amato said Borden would maintain its "pretty aggressive" stance in Europe,  especially in plastics and packaging. "We intend to continue to be aggressive  in Europe."  </P></p>

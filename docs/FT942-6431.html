			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Government near victory on contracting-out reform The UK government is on the verge of winning an important policy reform from the European Commission over limiting the scope of European labour legislation in the case of the contracting-out of public services. The victory would come at a useful time for the government just before the European elections and would offer some evidence that the European Union is moving to accommodate the UK's deregulatory approach on employment matters. The government has been lobbying in Brussels for several months to exclude contracting-out from the European Acquired Rights Directive (1977) - known in the UK by the acronym Tupe - which protects the jobs and conditions of employees when the undertaking they work for changes hands. The government has faced strong opposition from the social and employment affairs directorate general in Brussels and from the European trade union movement. But it has support from the governments in France and Italy, who are both interested in reform of the public sector. More decisively, the German government has swung its weight behind reform of the directive after a recent ruling from the European Court of Justice, involving a German insurance company, which said that a single woman cleaner should be covered by Tupe. The belief among UK businesses that Tupe does apply to many cases of contracting-out has impaired the government's programme of encouraging the public sector to contract out services to private companies, and it has reduced the expected savings to the exchequer. There has been much legal dispute in the UK over what kind of business undertaking is covered by Tupe and how much of an employee's pay and conditions should be transferred. But the courts, most recently the Court of Appeal, have often sided with the trade unions which have argued for the widest possible application of Tupe. The UK government has been arguing that Tupe should be amended to make it clear that it applies to only whole economic undertakings, rather than to individual activities, such as cleaning or catering, within such an undertaking. The latest proposed revision of Tupe states: 'The transfer of only an activity of an undertaking . . . does not in itself constitute a transfer of an undertaking'. This revision is being examined by Commissioners in Brussels and if none of them strongly objects it could become law next month without going to a full Commission meeting. Officials in Brussels are privately optimistic about clinching the reform. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

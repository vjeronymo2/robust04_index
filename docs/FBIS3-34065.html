			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Cockpit of Intrigues"] </F>   [Text] President Clinton is fast gaining recognition as  the patron-in-chief of secessionists of South Asia. After his  recent gesture to Ghulam Nabi Fai, chief of one of the  Pakistan-funded outfit of Kashmiri separatists in the US, it has  now been disclosed by the US-based Council of Khalistan that  Clinton has also expressed his concern for "Sikh rights" in  Punjab. He has done so in a letter to Congressman Gary A. Condit  who had drawn the former's attention to "the crisis in  Khalistan." The mischief is writ large on statements both by  Condit and Aulakh, the leader of the Sikh separatists. Yet, the  State Department would have us believe that the letter was  written to Condit only by way of courtesy -- a letter in which  Clinton refers to Punjab as though it were the 51st state of the  US. In doing so, the Department has conveniently tried to divert  attention from the clear prospect of an early end to the  prolonged campaign of brutal murders in Punjab, from the  establishment of an elected government and from increasing signs  of normalcy there. This happy turn of events should have  gladdened the hearts of Americans whose government has  repeatedly professed to come down heavily on international  terrorism. But Clinton's administration has deemed it more  important to warm the cockles of the hearts of foreign-based  chiefs of separatist organisations who have been demoralised by  the rapid restoration of peace in Punjab.    Secessionists of every kind have good reason to think that  Clinton and his buddies in the White House are there to ensure  that they all will remain in business. They have discovered that  they only need to pose as great champions of human rights to  enlist Clinton's sympathy. In fact many worthies of the  under-world around the world may take the cue from the American  lobbyists for secessionism-cum-terrorism or their agents  entrenched in present-day White House. The bulk of Clinton's  staff seems to be preoccupied with salvaging his reputation in  the wake of his and his wife's alleged malfeasance during his  tenure as Governor of Arkansas. This may be one reason why  lobbies working for dubious causes, apparently find "human  rights" a magic formula to manipulate the White House.    Washington, in fact, is likely to become famous less as a  capital of think-tanks than as the key nerve-centre of  specialists in political destabilisation in the third world.  What a parody of the world leadership of the unchallenged  superpower! The CIA, the great expert in subversion, has nursed  Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] which has now taken  over as the arch-stabiliser in South Asia. Clinton's touching  concern for the feelings of American lobbyists for Pakistan's  proteges among the Kashmiri and Punjabi separatists is apt to  make ISI happy. It can count on its traditional links with the  Pentagon being reinforced by a cooperative bureaucracy running  the White House. Anyone can now get any dirty work done through  Clinton's close aides just by chanting the mantra of human  rights.</p>

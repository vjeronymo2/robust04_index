			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Gap profits rise 11% in first quarter THE GAP, one of the most widely respected specialist retailers in the US, yesterday reported an 11 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits, to Dollars 45.3m after tax. Operating profits rose from Dollars 67.1m to Dollars 73m. Sales during the 13 weeks to May 2 rose from Dollars 490.3m a year earlier, to Dollars 588.9m. This partly reflects store expansion. The Gap operates 850 Gap outlets, compared with 814 a year ago; 151 Banana Republic stores, compared with 131; and 235 GapKids, against 185. The fashion retailer added that same-store sales had risen by 5 per cent, and said that it was satisfied with the outcome. However, it warned that the 'economic environment continued to be challenging' with promotional activity more pronounced than in 1991. Wall Street, viewed the figures as disappointing, and marked the shares Dollars 3 7/8 lower at Dollars 37, in early trading. Tiffany &amp; Co, the US-based jewellery retailer, said first-quarter sales and earnings results were below expectations, especially in Japan, Reuter reports from New York. Earnings declined to Dollars 3.1m from Dollars 4.4m in 1991, before a Dollars 6.3m charge for an accounting change, in spite of a 10 per cent increase in sales to a record Dollars 107.2m.</p>

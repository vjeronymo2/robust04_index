			<p>BFN     [Text] The president's decision to sign the law temporarily  suspending the affiliation to political parties of active duty  members of the military and policemen was made known at Congress  at noon yesterday. The law thus enters into effect immediately.    In congressional circles, the executive branch's decision to  promulgate the law a few days before it became effective  automatically, according to the term stipulated by the  Constitution, was interpreted as a positive gesture, and a sign  of the president's willingness to respect congressional  decisions. The executive branch had until 1 June to promulgate  the bill.    The law that has just entered into effect has only two  articles, and says:    "Article 1. The membership of active duty members of the  military and policemen in political parties or movements is  hereby temporarily suspended, and political parties or movements  will erase their names from the party lists."    "Article 2. The active duty members of the military and  policemen mentioned in Article 1 will recover, at their request,  their full membership and seniority in the corresponding  political party or movement once they retire."  <H5>  Hurdles Still To Be Overcome </H5>   Congress passed the bill temporarily suspending military  members' and policemen's political membership in November of  last year, but the executive branch vetoed the bill.    The veto was based on a technicality, as the executive  branch  said it had agreed on the need to adjust the military and police  field of action to what is prescribed in the Constitution. The  objection referred to the wording of the bill, which was  allegedly imprecise. The executive also objected to the  requirement forcing military members and policemen to request  their reenlistment once they retired, as it believed the  reenlisting should be automatic. Congress dismissed these  arguments and overrode the veto. The law could still face a  hurdle before implementation, as those who feel affected might  file a petition asking that the law be declared unconstitutional.</p>

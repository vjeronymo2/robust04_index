			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE WRITER HEPPENHEIMER TREATED FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS  </P> <P> Thomas A. Heppenheimer, a nationally known science writer from Fountain Valley,  was listed in fair condition Friday with three gunshot wounds, UC Irvine  Medical Center officials said.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley police said that Heppenheimer, 42, was reported shot at his  home on Thursday by his longtime companion. Police said they are not  recommending filing of charges because they believe Angela Lee Johnson, 30,  acted in self-defense after Heppenheimer threatened her. Johnson was not hurt,  police said.  </P> <P> Heppenheimer, 42, suffered two bullet wounds to the head and one to the left  shoulder, according to UCI Medical Center officials.  </P> <P> Heppenheimer is the author of several science-related nonfiction books,  including "Earthquake," and also writes frequently for science magazines and  newspapers.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley Detective Steve Williams said that Johnson, who has lived with  Heppenheimer for 10 years, had fled from him during a dispute Thursday  afternoon and locked herself in a bedroom.  </P> <P> "He (Heppenheimer) forced the door open, and she said she shot him because he  was carrying a club of some sort," Williams said. The officer said police are  not sure how many shots Johnson fired with the .25-caliber pistol.  </P> <P> "We are turning over our information to the district attorney's office, but  we're not recommending charges against either person," Williams said. He said  that police found no previous arrests involving Heppenheimer.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The single failure criterion requires that any single failure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within a safety-related system not prevent proper protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action of the overall system when the system is required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function. The Leak Detection System design is such that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of one division will not prevent the system from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing its safety function. Common mode failure protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions have been addressed in the NUMAC LDM design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comprehensive General Electric software V&amp;V and configuration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management control programs minimize, although they cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entirely eliminate, the likelihood of a common mode NUMAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument failure due to software problems. The hardware  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (firmware) and software for the PNPP NUMAC Leak Detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitors will undergo a formal software verification and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> validation (V&amp;V) process by General Electric, that is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed by the end of the year, equivalent to the one reviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and approved by the NRC for the safety-related Wide Range Neutron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NUMAC instruments are designed to minimize both their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> susceptibility to, and generation of, electromagnetic and radio- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency interference (EMI/RFI) to prevent spurious operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and allow their use in safety-related systems. As part of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broader plan by GE to improve the testing has been performed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GE on the Leak Detection Monitor configuration in order to both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expand the overall qualification region, and to obtain test data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific to this application. This testing ensures the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualification of the Thermocouple Input Unit (TCIU), a NUMAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circuit board which is unique to the LDM application, and also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extends the NUMAC EMI/RFI qualification region to include both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher and lower frequencies than previously tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NUMAC instrument design concept has undergone review by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC, and the initial instruments of the NUMAC product line (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Logarithmic Radiation Monitor and Wide Range Neutron Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System) have received NRC approval via Safety Evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated GE Licensing Topical Reports. The various types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUMAC equipment in operation at other nuclear power plants have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components and software modules which are similar to and in some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instance identical to the NUMAC LDMs. Therefore, based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC reviewed and approved NUMAC software and hardware control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs instituted by GE, the design features to minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> software/hardware (or their interface) problems, design features  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to minimize susceptibility to EMI/RFI, and testing to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance to EMI/RFI, installation of NUMAC Leak Detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitors at the PNPP does not create the possibility of a new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The replacement of the analog Riley temperature modules with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microcomputer based NUMAC Leak Detection Monitors will not affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any design conditions or impact the margins of safety for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various Leak Detection System monitored parameters in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification Table 3.3.2&hyph;2 will not be changed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by this modification. Only the CHANNEL FUNCTIONAL test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval is being extended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NUMAC Leak Detection Monitor design, with the attention paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> towards minimizing the potential for, and the effect of,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> software/hardware and/or EMI/RFI related problem or common mode  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures and resulting operational experience has demonstrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that replacement of the existing Riley temperature modules with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUMAC Leak Detection Monitors would not result in a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Perry Public Library, 3753 Main  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Street, Perry, Ohio 44081. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Jay Silberg, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trowbridge, 2300 N Street NW., Washington, DC 20037.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> John N.

Specifically, the amendment would increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stroke time, as specified in Table 3.6.3&hyph;1, for reactor core isolation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling (RCIC) valve RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;8, from 13 seconds to 26 seconds and the note  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) reference would be deleted from RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;8 and RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;63. The note (j)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that the stroke time specified in the Table reflects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for containment isolation only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. This proposed action does not involve a significant increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the probability or consequences of an accident previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated. RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;8 and V&hyph;63 are containment isolation valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are normally open. Failure of the valves to open or close  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot cause an accident. The mitigating capability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;8 and V&hyph;63 is not changed in that the valves will continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be closed within the established time limits. This ensures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection of the safety related equipment necessary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued compliance with the requirements of General Design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 4. In those accidents which involve a source term and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential adverse dose release consequences, no credit is taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the closing of the valves; therefore the increase in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable time for closing does not increase the consequences of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. This proposed action does not create the possibility of a new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different kind of accident from any accident previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated. The requested Technical Specifications change does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not represent a change in modes of operation. It does not, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself, require physical modification to the plant, although it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be used to allow a gear change in RCIC&hyph;MO&hyph;8. The new gears  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent a standard configuration for Limitorque motor operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will require a routine design change. The required Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specification change maintains the licensing basis for the plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as discussed in response to question 1. Hence, no new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different kind of accident is possible as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. This proposed action does not involve a significant reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a margin of safety. The increase in stroke time will increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the peak temperature in the HELB profiles and thereby decrease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the margin available from the equipment qualification limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, sufficient margin remains to assure the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operability is maintained and there is no reduction in the margin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of safety. Additionally, there is no reduction in the margin of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety because increasing the stroke time will not change the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postulated radiological releases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

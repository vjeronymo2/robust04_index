			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Walt Disney Executive Dies Mr Frank Wells, a leading member of the Walt Disney management team which has transformed the faltering fortunes of the US entertainment group over the past decade, was killed on Sunday in a helicopter accident in eastern Nevada, writes Richard Waters in New York. Mr Wells, 62, president and chief operating officer of the group, was brought in alongside Mr Michael Eisner, the company's chairman and chief executive, in 1984. The two men have been credited with leading a revival of the group, turning it into one of the strongest US entertainment companies. A lawyer, Mr Wells joined the Warner Brothers film studios in 1969 and was vice-chairman there before moving to Disney 10 years ago. He took a back-seat role to the younger Mr Eisner. However, Mr Wells was credited as one of the most weighty of the new management team, exerting considerable influence over the renaissance of the company. Despite its EuroDisney trauma, the company has expanded its film, television and theme park activities in the past decade, raising its annual revenues from Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) to Dollars 8.5bn. Mr Eisner yesterday paid tribute to Mr Wells's 'wisdom, charm, zest for experience and challenge, (and) his naked and awesome intelligence.' Analysts said that Disney had one of the strongest executive groups of any company in its industry, and that the death did not leave the group's management seriously weakened.</p>

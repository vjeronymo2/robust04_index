			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> PUTTING STROKE FROM PREP DAYS HELPS TIM SIMPSON TAKE LEAD  </P> <P> Defending champion Tim Simpson, who revamped his putting stroke overnight,  cruised to an eight-under-par 64 Wednesday to take the first-round lead in the  Disney Golf Classic.  </P> <P> Simpson, who has three PGA Tour victories in 13 years, made nine birdies and  one bogey over the Lake Buena Vista Course, considered the easiest of the three  layouts used in the $1-million event.  </P> <P> "I played real solid, drove well and hit some good iron shots," Simpson said.  </P> <P> But the change in his putting made the difference, Simpson said.  </P> <P> He putted for two hours Tuesday, adjusting his stance and slowing his stroke to  return to a style that he had used in high school. "I just had to change, it  was so bad," Simpson said.  </P> <P> Bill Buttner was two strokes behind the leader after his round of 66, also at  Lake Buena Vista. Buttner, who hasn't won in eight years on tour, had four  birdies on the front side and an eagle on the par-five 14th hole.  </P> <P> Simpson was three strokes ahead of five golfers with 67s -- John Mahaffey, Paul  Azinger and Mike Smith, who toured the tough Palm Course; Nick Price, at Lake  Buena Vista, and Dave Barr, at Magnolia.  </P> <P> Mahaffey, a 10-time tour winner, and Smith each had six birdies.  </P></p>

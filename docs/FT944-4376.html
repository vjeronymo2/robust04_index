			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: MGM hopes for a happy ending - Its new films are critical for sale prospects According to the critics, Stargate was sure to fail. Rolling Stone magazine described the Dollars 70m science fiction film as a 'giant-size loser', 'oppressively snoozy' and 'hell' to watch. Yet Stargate has been one of the most successful films in the US this autumn, taking Dollars 61m in five weeks, according to Variety magazine. Its success could not have been better timed for MGM, its US distributor, which is struggling to regain its reputation as one of the great Hollywood studios. Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled French bank which reluctantly took over MGM in a 1992 bankruptcy case, is compelled under US law to reduce its investment to 25 per cent by May 1997. It has appointed Mr Frank Mancuso, a long-time Paramount executive, as MGM chairman with a brief to prepare it for sale. Stargate was one of the first films to be released after Mr Mancuso's arrival in July 1993. It is also in the forefront of a series of new films which MGM and United Artists, its sister studio, will release over the next year. Mr Mancuso sees Stargate as 'a great start' that 'shows what we're capable of'. However, he is well aware that the next releases will be critical in determining the prospects for MGM's sale. The company was a wreck when Mr Mancuso arrived. United Artists was defunct. MGM had sold its famous production lot at Culver City to Sony, the Japanese electronics group. It had also sold its library to Mr Ted Turner, the CNN television mogul, although the company had held on to the UA library of 1,500 films. Mr Mancuso's first objective was to assemble a new team to revitalise MGM and to resuscitate UA. He hired Mr Michael Marcus, an executive at CAA talent agency to head MGM and Mr John Calley, a veteran US producer, to run UA. Mr Calley's appointment was a popular choice in Hollywood. Mr Mancuso also scored points for shoring up MGM's finances by securing a Dollars 350m revolving credit line from a consortium led by Chemical Bank, in addition to a Dollars 400m commitment from Credit Lyonnais. However, Mr Marcus was accused of favouring his old CAA clients at MGM. The group's troubled history was also said to deter stars and directors from signing up with the studios. MGM and UA are now set to release 20 films over the next year. The premieres begin with next week's US opening of Speechless, a comedy starring Mr Michael Keaton and Ms Geena Davis. Next year's releases include a film version of Tank Girl, the cult cartoon, and Rob Roy, a historical epic starring Mr Liam Neeson, culminating with the Thanksgiving Day premiere of Goldeneye, the new James Bond film. Releasing films is not enough. As one rival studio chief said: 'So what if they're opening 20 new movies? That could mean 20 opportunities to lose money.' However, Rob Roy and Tank Girl have attracted favourable advance publicity and Mr Mancuso claims to be confident that the group's 1995 performance will be 'at least in line with the industry average'. He has also been building up other parts of the business. MGM Television has been relaunched by adopting what he calls the 'bread and butter approach' to television with LAPD, a police drama, and a new series of UA's The Pink Panther. Mr Mancuso's latest venture is to try to copy the retailing success of Walt Disney and Warner Brothers with the opening this month of a flagship MGM Studio Store. Meanwhile MGM is under scrutiny from its prospective purchasers. The group has already attracted a string of suitors including PolyGram, the London-based entertainment group, Bertelsmann, the German media concern, and Mr William Koch, the US computer mogul. Film studios are sought-after commodities - as illustrated by the recent fight for Paramount. MGM may be in very different shape from the profitable Paramount, but is still, according to Mr Michael Kuhn, chairman of PolyGram Film Entertainment, 'a great brand name'. Credit Lyonnais has so far spurned all the bids in the hope that Mr Mancuso's strategy will pay off and it will be able to sell MGM for more than the estimated Dollars 2bn it has sunk into the company. The success, or failure, of Speechless and the 1995 releases will help determine how high that price will be. There is also the possibility of Mr Mancuso joining the fray by mounting a management buy-out. 'That was one of the reasons why I took this job,' he said. But this does, of course, leave Mr Mancuso in a tricky position - given that the more successful he is at reviving MGM, the higher the price of the company will be.</p>

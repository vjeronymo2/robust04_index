			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal follows direction in the Payette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, 1988 (Forest Plan). The decision to be made is whether the sale area should be entered at this time for timber harvest and associated activities, and, if so, the specific conditions of entry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preliminary issues include the proposal's effect on roadless characteristics, vegetation, water quality, biological diversity, fisheries, soils, wildlife habitat, and economics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preliminary alternatives being considered include no action, one that seeks to achieve Forest Plan objectives to maximize timber growth and yield, and the proposed action alternative that modifies timber management intensity in response to the preliminary issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) considering the proposed action and a reasonable range of alternatives will be prepared. The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and to be available for public review by March 1995. The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers early notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of that proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Circuit, 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final environmental impact statement is scheduled to be completed by July 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Responsible Official is David F. Alexander, Forest Supervisor, Payette National Forest, McCall, ID 83638. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David F.

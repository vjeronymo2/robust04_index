			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUPLE SEEK SCR GRANTS DATA FROM STATE ARTS COUNCIL AND NEA  </P> <P> A married couple, who touched off the Costa Mesa arts-funding controversy when  they charged South Coast Repertory with using city funds to pay for a flyer  urging support of the National Endowment for the Arts, may be taking their beef  with the theater company to a higher level.  </P> <P> According to several sources, John and Ernie Feeney have requested and received  copies of SCR's grants from the California Arts Council.  </P> <P> And Martin Benson, SCR co-founder and artistic director, said the theater  company has been told that the Feeneys also requested and received a copy of  SCR's most recent NEA grant.  </P> <P> The Feeneys could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but a spokeswoman for  Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) confirmed that they asked for  the legislator's assistance in obtaining the state documents. Joanne Anglin of  the CAC said she received and processed the request about two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Anglin, and Barbara Kling of Frizzelle's office, both said they have not been  contacted by the Feeneys regarding any further action.  </P> <P> "I don't know what their particular purpose is," Benson said Tuesday, but he  added that he presumes it relates to the pro-NEA flyer. The grant documents are  public record, Benson noted: "They're welcome to wade through it at their  leisure." RICK VANDERKNYFF  </P></p>

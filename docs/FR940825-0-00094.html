			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Unless inconsistent with statutory program purposes, cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Whenever possible, advances will be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by all HHS awarding agencies to the recipient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Advance payment mechanisms include electronic funds transfer, with Treasury checks available on an exception basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Recipients may submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on PMS&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms as may be authorized by HHS. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special HHS-wide instructions for electronic funds transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. The HHS awarding agency may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the HHS assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When the reimbursement method is used, HHS will make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Recipients may submit a request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the HHS awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, HHS may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, HHS advances cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the recipient's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, HHS reimburses the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment will not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Unless inconsistent with statutory program purposes, to the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, the HHS awarding agency will not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraph (h) (1) or (2) of this section applies: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or HHS awarding agency reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States. Under such conditions, the HHS awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. (See 45 CFR part 30). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, HHS will not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

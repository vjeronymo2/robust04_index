			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rudolf Scharping, SPD president and </F> minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate, by Jean-Paul  Picaper; place and date not given: "Rudolf Scharping: The  SPD's Moderation"]    [Text] [Picaper] The publication of your economic program  did not increase your popularity ratings. Perhaps it talks too  much about taxation....    [Scharping] But this is not true. You have to tell people  the truth before elections. We do not want to increase the  general level of taxation and social security payments, but  distribute them differently, with two objectives: social  justice and encouragement of demand. We will reduce the charges  which weigh on investment in order to create new jobs and launch  new products.    [Picaper] But the Socialists have the reputation of imposing  taxes.    [Scharping] This is precisely what has changed. If the state  has new ideas, it must not immediately translate them into new  taxes, but achieve them with the money it has and strive to work  at less cost. We have promised to prevent any increase in the  state's share of the GNP. It is currently 45 percent, which is  much too high.    [Picaper] Do you want to reduce bureaucracy?    [Scharping] We have 18 ministries. Two or three could be  eliminated. We will reduce bureaucracy and open the  decisionmaking processes to the citizens. We want to modernize  the state's work, separate politics from everyday administrative  tasks, and speed up the delivery of permits for industrial  installations and the marketing of new products. Our priorities  are economic growth, protection of the essentials of life, and  consolidation of public finances which are burdened by a very  large debt. These problems will be easier to solve in the  European framework, especially with France, than they are  country by country.    [Picaper] Do you intend to create a special tax for  rebuilding East Germany, as your East German colleague Wolfgang  Thierse has suggested?    [Scharping] No, why should we dream up new taxes? However,  Germany has lost its way under Kohl. There is some egoism in  this. After reunification, the Bundesbank damaged growth in  Germany with its extraordinarily high interest rates, which  concurrently imposed a very heavy burden on our European friends  and partners, particularly France.    [Picaper] Will you offer the finance portfolio to Karl-Otto  Poehl, former president of the Bundesbank, who is a Socialist?    [Scharping] Unless I am mistaken, Karl-Otto Poehl disagreed  with Helmut Kohl's government during the implementation of  German monetary union. For many years he was a very respected  president of the Bundesbank. Since his resignation, he has  worked in a private bank. His judgment is very important to me.    [Picaper] Do you intend to give a ministry to Daimler-Benz  Chairman Edzard Reuter, who is deeply involved in politics and  who will shortly leave his post as chairman of his enterprise?    [Scharping] We are not speculating on the formation of my  government. That will come in August. There are many capable  entrepreneurs in SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] ranks  with whom I have frequent discussions, including Edzard Reuter.  <H5>  Stronger Franco-German Cooperation </H5>   [Picaper] German production is going badly....    [Scharping] Germany is experiencing many social tensions and  regional disparities with some rich regions like Hamburg or  Frankfurt, but also very poor regions, especially in the East.  Our country still has major assets: its level of vocational  training, the productivity of its industry and the quality of  its products. It has weaknesses, like the other European  countries: unfavorable investment conditions and much too slow  a transfer of the results of research into new products.    [Picaper] And the European weaknesses?    [Scharping] They are to do with inadequate cooperation.  The Germans and French are cooperating in aeronautics and  space, but why not do so with regard to high-speed land  transport -- the high-speed train and ICE [intercity express  train]? We would be able to produce a joint product. We ought  also to improve in the trans-European information and  communications networks, especially in view of increasingly  fierce international competition.    [Picaper] Do you intend to eliminate nuclear energy, as the  Greens do?    [Scharping] We can abandon it, especially if we succeed in  exploiting renewable energy sources which will be one of the  growth markets of the future, solar energy for instance. There  are ill-informed people who think there is not enough sun in  Europe. In Japan and the United States, they have set to work  under the watchword of "ecolution" -- a combination of "ecology"  and "evolution." Europe must do the same, to avoid building up  an irreversible technological lag.    [Picaper] Will the complementary tax of 10 percent on gross  incomes higher than 60,000 German marks [DM] for single people  and higher than DM120,000 for married couples with which you  want to replace the 7.5 percent general solidarity tax be enough  to cover the budget deficits?    [Scharping] The revenue it will produce will be the same,  but, economically and socially, this will make a big difference.  It will enable us to release 80 percent of incomes from any  additional tax. We are suffering from a paralysis of the  internal economic situation, and a marked weakness in growth.  To overcome the two, we must create more demand and hence not  overburden medium and small incomes.  <H5>  Not Increasing Property Tax </H5>   [Picaper] Will you increase wealth tax?    [Scharping] No, let us wait to see what the Constitutional  Court says on this subject. We have promised not to increase  the property tax for enterprises or individuals if it is  allocated to retirement capital.    [Picaper] Hans Peter Stihl, the president of the Chamber of  Trade and Industry, said that your inheritance tax will ruin  many small- and medium-sized enterprises.    [Scharping] He is right. That is precisely why we do not  want to increase it.    [Picaper] Last year, DM62 billion went abroad. Will you  remove banking secrecy to improve deductions at source?    [Scharping] No. But, in Europe, we must harmonize capital  tax. This will take some time. I have seen that it is on the  agenda for the German term as European Union president which  begins on 1 July. Theo Waigel has taken this objective. I am  anxious to see the result. Moreover, we are consulting with  experts to improve the German system even before European  harmonization.    [Picaper] In France, there are a number of tax-free savings  opportunities. I cannot see anything comparable in Germany.    [Scharping] In our country, life insurance is virtually  tax-free. But I have told you that we intend to study the  savings policies of other European countries to bring us closer  to other systems first.    [Picaper] In our country, direct taxation is lower than in  yours. The reverse is true with regard to indirect taxation.  Have you thought about that?    [Scharping] I am aware of it. It does not just relate to  taxes but also energy prices and other spheres. I do not want  to make any predictions, because we must first assess the state  of the treasury. We do not just have a very high public debt,  almost DM2,000 billion, but also hidden deficits in  supplementary budgets. Until we clarify all that, we will not  be able to draw up a financial policy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Claudia Villegas] </F>   [Text] Havana, 21 Apr -- More than 40 Mexican companies  will begin trading with Cuba because of all that country has to  offer, declared Diego Fernandez Roos, head of the CEMAI [Mexican  Businessmen's Council for International Affairs] Latin America  Coordination Committee.    During the 11th full session of the Mexican-Cuban  Businessmen's Commission, the CEMAI established closer ties  between Mexican businessmen and Cuban authorities to make the  initial contacts that will allow more trade between the  countries.    In an interview with EL FINANCIERO near the end of the  businessmen's visit to Cuba, Fernandez Roos declared that there  is a lot of disinformation about Cuba's economic situation and  its capacity to become a real trading partner with Mexico.    Trade between Mexico and Cuba currently amounts to only $150  million with a positive balance in favor of Mexican businesses.  The chemical, agricultural and livestock, health, and  construction sectors are among the most attractive areas for  investment. The CEMAI representative believes political issues  should not affect the choice of an export destination, as is the  case with Cuba.    One of the most important companies participating in this  business meeting is Jugos de Valle, a corporation that considers  Cuba to be among its most attractive export markets. Manuel  Albarran, director of the company's international development  department, asserted that any company that is planning to go to  international operations should consider Cuba because it is  practically a "virgin" market. He said the prospects for  introducing bottled drinks to the island are particularly  interesting because they imply introducing new products into the  consumption patterns of the Cuban people, a market of more than  12 million people.    Albarran, who described the 11th meeting of the  Mexican-Cuban  Businessmen's Committee as a complete "success," declared that  Jugos del Valle has not ruled out the possibility of making  direct investments in Cuba.    Diego Fernandez explained that Cuba is ripe for foreign  investment and asserted that Fidel Castro's government is  seeking to widen the island's economic opening. He added that  although the CEMAI has held 10 meetings between Mexican  businessmen and Cuban authorities, there has never been so much  interest shown by the two parties to increase commercial  relations.    Aside from the Cuban Government's large investments in  Mexican corporations such as Cemex, Television Azteca, and  Mexipetrol, there are midsize companies that view Cuba as an  interesting trading partner able to fulfill its payment  commitments.    The National Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext), in  collaboration  with the CEMAI, sent invitations to Mexican companies interested  in negotiating with Cuba, which has faced a U.S. Government  economic embargo for more than two decades.    Francisco Callarisa Salcedo, sales director of the Mac'Ma  group -- cookies and pasta makers -- declared the Cuban market  could become an important consumer of Mexican products. He  added that it seemed illogical that although Mexico is only a  two-hour flight from the island and only a day and a half by  boat, countries like Spain -- Cuba's second largest commercial  partner -- and France are conducting such a large amount of  business with the Caribbean nation.    Optimistic about statements Cuban authorities will make at  the "The Nation and the Emigrants" meeting, the first held since  the Cuban Revolution, Mexican businessmen are convinced that  Cuba is going through a period of change in which Mexico must  participate.    "The Nation and the Emigrants" meeting begins today with the  attendance of Cuban emigrant organizations such as Cuba Libre  and with the certainty that Fidel Castro, the island's leader,  has not suffered any attack, according to reports from Cuban  Government sources. Cuban Minister Roberto Robaina will for the  first time address Cuban emigrants, most of whom live in the  United States, on the topic: "The Relationship between the  Nation and the Emigrants: Current Status and Prospects."</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Colgate deal lifts it to leader in liquid soap COLGATE-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, is buying the liquid hand and body soap brands of SC Johnson Wax, the privately-held US cleaning products group, in a deal that would make it world market leader in liquid soap. The company also announced an 11 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 142.8m in the third quarter in spite of sluggish sales in North America and Europe. Colgate-Palmolive is market leader in liquid soap in the US, while Johnson Wax is market leader in Europe and the Pacific with its Tahiti, Douss Douss, Pouss' Mousse and Soft Wash brands. Colgate-Palmolive said the brands it was buying had annual sales of Dollars 75m in the fast-growing market for liquid soap, a relatively recent product innovation. It would not disclose the price of the deal but said it was not material. Although Colgate-Palmolive has a strong global position in consumer products, many of its markets in the developed world are mature and it has been looking for new areas of growth. Worldwide sales fell to Dollars 1.82bn from Dollars 1.84bn in last year's third quarter, but the company said they would have been 8 per cent higher without adverse shifts in exchange rates. Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 89 cents.</p>

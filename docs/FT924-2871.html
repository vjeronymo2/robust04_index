			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Airsprung Furniture shows 37% advance to Pounds 2.3m AIRSPRUNG Furniture, the Wiltshire-based supplier of beds and upholstery, reported a 37 per cent jump in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 2.32m, in the half year to September 30. The group, whose shares will become a constituent of the FT-A All-Share Index in January just 18 months after joining the main market from the USM, is paying an interim dividend of 3.15p (2.63p), payable from earnings per share of 11.82p (9.82p). Turnover expanded from Pounds 26.9m to Pounds 28.6m. Mr Michael Coppel, chief executive, said solving production problems at the pine furniture factory and a 69 per cent increase in sales from the contracts division underpinned the performance. A Pounds 440,000 swing from interest charges of Pounds 335,000 to receipts of Pounds 105,000 reflected tight cash management and the Pounds 3.2m rights issue in mid-1991. Mr Coppel said 'good business sense' had pulled Airsprung through the recession, and the prospect of improving exports would help maintain the interim performance at the year-end.</p>

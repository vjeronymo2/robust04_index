			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Security service cleared on phone taps THE security service has been cleared of installing bugging devices or tapping telephones unlawfully, by the two judges who scrutinise its work, Alison Smith writes. Sir Thomas Bingham, the commissioner who reviews intercepting communications, and Lord Hustice Stuart-Smith, the commissioner who reviews the security service, both use their annual reports to express confidence the service is not acting illegally. The assurances do not refer to specific incidents, but are clearly directed at rumours that the so-called 'Squidgy' and 'Camillagate' tapes, allegedly recordings of a telephone conversations between members of the royal family and friends, had originated within the security service. Commenting on newspaper reports of eavesdropping operations, Sir Thomas said: 'Such stories are, in my experience without exception, false. They give . . an entirely misleading impression both of the extent of official interception and of the targets against which interception is directed'. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said he based his opinion on the tight control within the system and the fact that operations were so complex that resources were unlikely to be squandered on them and they would be hard to conceal.</p>

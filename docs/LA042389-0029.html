			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUNNING HOUSE  </P> <P> My wife and I are in San Diego for the fifth consecutive spring, and read Paul  Gordon's story about the Dunning house ("Fighting for the Survival of an Old  House," April 9). If there was ever anything printed in your newspaper with  human interest, that one should win the prize.  </P> <P> Even out in my country (Montana), somewhat similar conditions have and still  continue to be developing. And I would think this type of "happening" occurs  most everywhere throughout our country. Things are continuously lost to  developers' onslaughts.  </P> <P> I am an architect and continuously look for new jobs, but not at the expense of  losing our historical ties with the past -- especially the unique and  irreplaceable past.  </P> <P> I hope that Paul Gordon's message will stir similar feelings in your area.  </P> <P> MAX KUHR  </P> <P> Havre, Mont.  </P></p>

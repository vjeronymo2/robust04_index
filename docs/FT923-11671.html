			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Construction industry recession is worsening THE deepest recession to afflict the construction industry for more than half a century is getting worse, according to government figures published yesterday. These indicated that construction orders during the three months to the end of May fell by 16 per cent compared with the previous three months and by 9 per cent compared with the March - May period last year. A separate survey of 140 English and Welsh estate agents, also published yesterday, confirmed the lack of recovery in either house prices or sales. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which conducted the study, appealed to the government to double the threshold at which stamp duty becomes payable on house purchases from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000. A government concession to withdraw stamp duty for purchases of up to Pounds 250,000 ends next month. The ending of the concession has been strongly criticised by housebuilders and estate agents. The institution said that raising the threshold to Pounds 60,000 would assist first-time buyers. Slightly more than 41 per cent of agents questioned by the institution said that house prices had continued to fall during the three months to the end of June. A further 57 per cent said prices had remained static. Less than 1 per cent reported a price increase. Mr Peter Miller, an official at the institution, said there was no improvement in the market, even if the worst of the price falls appeared to be over. Figures from the Department of the Environment showed that the value of construction orders for private homes, in constant 1985 prices, fell by 11 per cent during the three months to the end of May compared with the previous three months, and was 13 per cent lower than during the corresponding period last year. Private industrial orders for the three months to May were 24 per cent lower than in the previous three months, and 21 per cent lower than during the March - May period last year. Private commercial orders, mainly for offices and shops, were 9 per cent lower than both the previous three months and the corresponding period a year before. Public-works orders - which cover roads, hospitals and other infrastructure  -were 14 per cent and 5 per cent lower respectively. Only public-housing and housing association orders for the three months to May showed any improvement. They were 34 per cent lower than in the previous three months but 89 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year.</p>

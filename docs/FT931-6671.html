			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Community life - Radio LAST Sunday, Radio 4, determined to ease us out of the distress we must all have felt at the Merseyside news, showed us lives of restraint. First, the start of Goodbye to All That, where Simon Parkes visits artistic communities. His first was Deya in Majorca, famous as the retreat of Robert Graves. Even in its best days it was evidently not without its faults; the poet Brian Patten recalled 'screaming drunks'. But quiet and, in those days, hard of access. An hour after this came In Search of Utopia, also about life in communities, but of a different kind. Presenter Felicity Goodall dealt mainly with the feelings of children in such places, where (at Bruderhof, for example) child-care, meals and property are all communally organised, and no intimacy is allowed until a couple are engaged. At Findhorn in the north of Scotland, perhaps the oddest of the visits, there is communication not only with plants but with fairies and elves, and this a religious foundation. It seems to work; cabbages grow there up to 40 lb] More communities next week. Until the end of March, Radio 3 is reviewing the arts of the 1920s. Here is some of what is to come: archive recordings of literary grandees on their contemporaries; popular music of the time, English, American, German and even Russian; today's critics on new views of the then-current novelists; Maria Jolas, wife of the founder of Transition, on Paris figures like Picasso, Stravinsky and Joyce; a reappraisal of Aldous Huxley, with readings of some of his stories. Last Sunday's talk by Vita Sackville-West on Orlando and tomorrow's by Prince Antoine Bibesco on Proust make a good start. But Radio 3 listeners who complain about too much talk will be very cross. Fay Weldon's The Hole in the Top of the World on Radio 3 on Sunday is basically a romantic piece. Matt, a famous scientist, studies the ozone layer from a lab in the Antarctic with Nina, a young female scientist and rival to his wife Simone, but Ms Weldon does not write basic pieces. Simone thinks Matt to be in danger, not only from Nina, sharing his work and contemplating marriage, but from 'the UVs' through the hole in the ozone. The hole, Simone believes, is due not to CFCs but to all our illusions breaking out into space. This theory is more interesting than Simone's trip to the Antarctic lab with her toy-boy Andrew, soon seduced by Nina. Perhaps it is basic, after all. The cast are all American, with Walter Matthau as Matt, not one of his great performances. The co-production with LA Theatre Works was recorded in Santa Monica under Shaun MacLoughlin. On Thursday Radio 4 gave The Architect's Dream by Neil Rhodes. The dream was to build a two-mile-high city, clearing all the neighbouring land, but Ashley, the architect, retired first, and is now just building an extension to his retired neighbour Eric's house. Eric's wife, Mildred, is as silly as Ashley's wife Kay is bossy, and the two dislike one another within neighbourly bounds. Eric, making a model of Ashley's dream, sensibly bashes Mildred with a hammer. Disputes are forgotten when Ashley visits him in the prison hospital. Kay and Mildred become mates too, and that's about all there is. I thought the characters boring and the dialogue dull. Richard Wortley directed.</p>

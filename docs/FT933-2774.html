			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Weak Ukraine plays into Russia's hands: Economic union means giving Moscow control of many of the levers of power TUMBLING about in an economic and political free fall which offers little support for its 52m people, Ukraine still seeks, after two years of national independence, to discover a settled national identity. The country's politically active population still tries to digest the shock of a decision - made a week ago at a Russian-Ukrainian presidential meeting in the Crimean resort of Massandra - to transfer the Black Sea Fleet from joint to wholly Russian control, to lease the main naval port of Sevastopol, and to return the 176 strategic nuclear missiles to Russia. The deal - which President Boris Yeltsin of Russia has presented as a fact and President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine has insisted is merely proposed - would require, on Russia's part at least, the cancellation of Ukraine's Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.62bn) debt for oil and gas, and the delivery of fuel for Ukraine's nuclear power stations. There would be also an agreed procedure on the future use and control of the missiles. There were scattered demonstrations: Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the Rukh nationalist party, used the language of 'betrayal'. Yet, ridding itself of an expensive and obsolescent fleet and base, and missiles which Ukraine probably cannot fire and for which it has no doctrine determining at whom they should be fired, is probably not a gut issue for most thoughtful citizens. Larger matters, however, loom. Next Tuesday, the Ukrainian parliament debates the Massandra accord and a future economic union within the Commonwealth of Independent States. Next Friday, Mr Kravchuk and his colleagues travel to Moscow to discuss just such a union, which Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, yesterday said would mean a centralisation of all monetary emission in the Russian central bank for all members. Certainly, if it were to function at all, a union would mean a subordination of many of the levers of economic policy to a central, inevitably Russian-dominated, control. On the experience of Massandra, Ukraine will be in poor shape to strike a good deal. On his own admission, Mr Kravchuk was steamrollered into agreeing whatever he did agree. Mr Boghdan Kravchenko, head of a leading economic and training institute, said: 'The leadership has lost faith in its ability to properly manage the country.' No wonder. Official analysis of the economy for the first half of this year describes a position which may be one of pre-collapse. Inflation hovers around 50 per cent a month; production of most goods, including food, continues to fall by 10-20 per cent; gross domestic product fell by 7 per cent over the first half of 1992. A budget which had a relatively modest deficit early this year has plunged in the last few months to one with a deficit of 10-12 per cent of GDP. In reality, the official forecast of a 12.3 per cent deficit by the year-end may be doubled. Privatisation, expected to bring in 650bn karbovantsi brought only 1.5bn - at today's exchange rate, less than Pounds 78,000. The helpless contemplation of this decline has brought to the front rank of political life the representatives of the 'pro-union' approach in Ukraine - a group whose present strength accounts for the 'swing to the east' which Mr Kravchuk has evidently been taking. Its most prominent advocate in the cabinet is Mr Valentin Landik, a 47-year-old company boss from the eastern coal and steel city of Donetsk, now deputy prime minister in charge - significantly - of relations with the CIS countries. 'I want there to be integration between the CIS states. I want an economic union to be concluded. Why? Because the situation is getting worse. We can't sell our goods in the west because of bad quality - and thus we should trade our goods and co-operate with the east so we can go forward together,' Mr Landik said in an interview. But his conception of union is vague, reflecting both the lack of serious preparation given to the issue and to the riven politics of the state. As he admits, the parliament will debate the issue next Tuesday 'and God knows what they will decide'. He believes that 'without an economic union the sovereignty of Ukraine cannot be safeguarded', reflecting the fears of industrialists that the fraying links with Russia must be restored if collapse is to be averted. Certainly, he sees a customs union as essential. He wants prices somehow to be brought into line and he hints that the Ukrainian bargaining position might be to try to secure an oil price of Dollars 50 a tonne, as against the agreement now in force which prices Russian oil at Dollars 90 a tonne, with full world prices next year. 'World prices for oil is death for us,' he says. There are two signs of hope. The two prominent reformers who served in, then left government, Mr Viktor Pynzenyk and Mr Volodomyr Lanovoi, have either created or are creating economic institutes to further their pro-market ideas. Privatisation, though meagre in its results, is still on the official agenda and large companies - including Mr Landik's former company, Nord - are transforming themselves into share companies. In agriculture, always regarded as Ukraine's wealth, only a few thousand private farms have appeared. Mr Nigel Spooner, an adviser to the agriculture minister, says the government is now working on plans to introduce competition in the distributive part of the food chain, starting with vegetable depots and the shops which they supply. As for the state and collective farms, Mr Spooner believes they should ultimately be privatised as large units, rather than be broken up. As in Russia, the political stasis freezes everything. Everyone says elections must come next spring at the latest: and while the socialist grouping, representing the industrial interests of eastern Ukraine, may on present showing secure the largest bloc of seats, groupings like New Ukraine and others are now seeking and getting the backing of the new commercial interests to pursue market-oriented policies. A recent poll suggested more than 50 per cent of the population still wanted to take the capitalist road. The bottom line is statehood. 'The political elite is not going to surrender that,' says Mr Kravchenko. 'People are sacrificing a great deal in the present conditions, but there is still a willingness to stick it out to preserve independence.' That such an eventuality should even be mooted shows the depth of the Ukrainian crisis. But the best guess must still be that the Russian leadership's renewed will to dominate is not so strong as to force the issue, nor the Ukrainian leadership's loss of confidence so precipitous as to put statehood on any conceivable bargaining table.</p>

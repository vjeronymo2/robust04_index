			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Treasury could net Pounds 1bn from cable growth A new wave of cable construction in the next decade is likely to make cable services available to nine out of 10 households and could net the government more than Pounds 1bn, according to the Cable Television Association. The association, which represents the mainly US-owned companies building cable television and telephone networks, believes as many as 100 new licences are likely to be granted in the next three years as cable companies seek to extend their networks to smaller towns and rural areas. Existing cable licences cover about 14.5m homes, about 70 per cent of the UK total, although fewer than 1m homes have been connected. Cable operators are expected to spend more than Pounds 5bn in the next five years constructing networks in the 130 areas already franchised. Mr Richard Woollam, director-general of the Cable Television Association, said: 'There is strong interest among operators in extending their networks, perhaps by using radio technology to provide connections in less populous areas.' He said this could lead to the granting of franchises for up to 4m additional homes, putting cable in reach of about 90 per cent of the population. Licences to build cable systems are granted by the Independent Television Commission under the 1990 Broadcasting Act. It awards them after an auction, for areas containing up to about 500,000 people. The proceeds go to the government. The most recent licence to be awarded, covering west Kent, went to Eurobell, a cable operator with franchises in the Crawley area of West Sussex and in Devon. Eurobell will pay Pounds 1.6m initially, then 2 per cent of television revenues after five years of operation. The west Kent franchise - a mixture of urban, semi-rural and rural communities - is typical of future franchise areas. More than two-thirds of its 100,000 residents live in or near Tunbridge Wells and Sevenoaks. Eurobell plans to build wire-based networks in those towns, but will pioneer radio technology for the rest of the area. The ITC has three licence applications pending - for the Blackpool area, south-east Anglia, and parts of Derbyshire. A US regional telecoms operator with extensive UK cable interests is believed to have bid Pounds 800,000 for the Blackpool franchise. The ITC said it expected an increase in demand for cable licences for areas not already franchised. The largest franchise expected is for Belfast, which could cover up to 500,000 homes if extended to the whole of Northern Ireland. A recent Commons trade and industry committee report on 'superhighways' called for areas not yet franchised to be offered to operators by the end of next year. That target is widely regarded as over-ambitious, but pressure on the ITC to ensure that most of the UK has an operator able to offer cable services is likely to grow. According to the FT's New Media Markets newsletter the ITC has rejected a proposal by Mercury, the main competitor to BT, which would have allowed the telecoms operator to build a television microwave system across those parts of the UK not already covered by cable franchises.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Standing Committee of the General People's  Congress [GPC] this evening concluded its extraordinary session,  which was chaired by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, the chairman of the Presidential Council and the GPC's  secretary general. The session continued to review the items on  its agenda, addressing national developments, including the  document of pledge and accord among the political parties to  emerge from the political crisis and build the new Yemeni state.    The discussions of the members of the Standing Committee  focused on the means to implement the pledge and accord  agreement and the GPC's future tasks.    The brother secretary general delivered a speech at the end  of the GPC's work in which he reviewed national developments and  the GPC's relevant stands. He stressed the need to shoulder our  national responsibilities at this crucial stage in the history  of our people and country and overcome all the negativism and  false steps witnessed by our Yemeni homeland during the  transitional period and thereafter. He indicated that our  people have suffered much from the crisis and that all concerned  should measure up to their responsibilities and rise above minor  issues and subordinate everthing else to the interest of the  homeland.    The Standing Committee adopted a number of internal  decisions  and measures. A press release was issued at the end of the  extraordinary session of the GPC's Standing Committee.  Following is its text:    In a climate full of confidence and hope, the GPC's Standing  Committee held an extraordinary session on 19-20 Sha'ban, 1413  hegira, corresponding to 30-31 January, 1994 under brother  secretary general of the GPC, Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the  chairman of the Presidential Council. The session was devoted  to a discussion of the present general state of affairs in light  of the document of pledge and accord drafted by the Yemeni  Political Forces Dialogue Committee on 18 January, 1994. As  well as reviewing the contents of the document, the Standing  Committee studied the reports related to the progress of the  national dialogue and its ramifications on all fronts and the  subsequent developments and intensive contacts to prepare for  the final signing of the document. In this regard, the GPC's  Standing Committee expressed its full support for the GPC's  statement issued on 18 January, which announced the GPC's  acceptance of the document reached by the parties to the  dialogue of the political forces to build the new Yemeni state.  At the same time, the Standing Committee appreciated the  efforts of the committee of the political forces and the  document it worked out -- the document which the Standing  Committee believes to be a program for the next stage in the  life of the Yemeni people, who entered the modern age when they  restored their unity on 22 May, 1990 and chose the democratic  road of its own free will, the crowning day of which was 27  April, 1993.    In this context, the Standing Committee asserts that  commitment to this document and eagerness to implement it truly  embody the depth of commitment to the democratic option, which  the GPC was the first to adopt.    The accord document is a further contribution to the  efforts to firmly establish democracy in the life of the state  and society. This requires collective action by all forces and  the mobilization of all energies to implement it creatively to  ensure that it is transformed into practical steps on the  ground. The exceptional importance of this document stems not  only from the fact that it has put an end to the political  crisis from which our homeland and people have suffered, but  because it serves as a safety valve which will ensure that  similar crises will not recur in the future, and will abort any  sedition and plots aimed at harming the unity and democracy.    Hence the need for and importance of the practical  implementation of this document by all parties to the state's  institutions as soon as the document signing ceremony is over.  This is the true yardstick for measuring the high national  responsibility and ability to transcend narrow interests and  adopt the supreme interests of the homeland and people.  Undoubtedly, implementing the accord document with maximum  success requires that all efforts be united through full  cohesion among all national, legislative, and executive  departments and institutions of the state and that the  implementation process be spared any acts of one-upmanship.  Throughout the duration of the political crisis, such acts have  gravely harmed the state and society, thus endangering the  homeland's unity, security, and stability, and even the life and  future of every Yemeni citizen.    In this context, the Standing Committee emphasizes the  importance of making available the appropriate atmosphere for  the final signing of the accord document. Meanwhile, most  regrettably, it has noticed the unjustified continuation of some  ramifications of the crisis, especially the cessation of the  general census of the population, houses, and installations  while it is in its final stage, in addition to some media  ramifications. The Standing Committee believes that if the  course of dialogue, accord, and mutual concessions at the table  of a national, responsible dialogue has resulted in this  national document, which has won broad popular support, then the  continuation of this course within the framework of commitment  to constitutional legitimacy and its institutions and abidance  by the tasks and powers as specified by the Constitution and law  will provide sufficient protection for all stages of the actual  implementation of this document. Besides, the existence of a  broader popular participation in the programs of implementation  will enhance the possibility of implementing the document and  will prevent any attempt to shirk abidance by the document.    In this regard, the Standing Committee believes that  building  the modern Yemeni state is a great historic process that cannot  be achieved without the broadest possible popular participation,  especially by political forces and national intellectuals who  really believe that the state of law and order, the state of  institutions, and the state of stable constitutional legitimacy  that is based on the people's free will, is the main objective  which has been sought since the homeland restored its unity on  22 May 1990. This objective was at the forefront of the  national tasks of the 27 September and 14 October glorious  revolutions.    In light of this, everybody is called on today to renounce  the methods followed during the transitional period and to  resort to new methods that are in harmony with the historical  nature of this lofty national mission which we should accomplish  with one political will and with high national responsibility to  rise to our greater national objectives sought by our masses to  live a secure and stable life in a climate of justice, freedom,  and equality.    Given the large-scale Arab and international support for the  document of pledge and accord, the Standing Committee expresses  its satisfaction with this great national and international  response and thanks all brothers and friends who expressed their  concern over our country's unity and democratic experiment.  Those brothers and friends spared no effort to reach a  satisfactory end to the political crisis. They also blessed the  document of pledge and accord reached by the dialogue among the  Yemeni political forces.    As the GPC Standing Committee ends this extraordinary  session, it greets and appreciates our people who have suffered  a great deal throughout the crisis which endangered the people's  food, security, and future. Despite all this, our people showed  great patience and readiness to make sacrifices to safeguard  unity and democracy. Our valiant Armed Forces proved to be a  shield that protects the homeland and its unity and that they  will never become a tool to destroy the homeland and shed the  blood of its sons.    On this occasion, the Standing Committee renews the pledge  that the GPC will always remain -- as it has always been --  loyal to the interests of the homeland and people, concerned  about their unity, safety, and stability, and determined to  proceed on the road toward prosperity and progress for all the  sons of the people.    Let us move together toward the future; let us converge  efforts to triumph in the battle for construction. Let us work  together to build the edifice of the modern Yemeni state. Let  us always raise high the banners of unity and democracy. Our  God will grant us success as He is our best supporter.    Issued by the GPC Standing Committee at the conclusion of  its  extraordinary session in Sanaa on 31 January 1994.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Capco places post-1997 debt successfully CASTLE Peak Power Company (Capco), a joint venture between Exxon, the US oil group, and China Light and Power, the Hong Kong utility controlled by the Kadoorie family, yesterday said it has successfully concluded a USDollars 133.5m private placement of debt whose maturity spans Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Some supra-national borrowers, such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, have raised debt which matures beyond 1997, as has the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, a Hong Kong government-owned corporation. But Capco is the first private sector company to tap US debt markets for funds which mature after the change-over. Details of the transaction, which was arranged by Salomon Brothers, are sketchy. As it was a private placement the borrower does not have to disclose any information. However, it is understood that Salomon engaged Standard and Poor's to conduct a private assessment of Capco. Standard and Poor's awarded it an A rating. The debt, which was placed during the third week of August, attracted a yield of around 125 to 135 basis points above prevailing 10-year US Treasuries. Two tranches, of roughly equal amounts, were issued for 10 years and 15 years. Capco originally sought USDollars 100m, but investor interest was such that the issue was increased by 30 per cent. Mr David Hudson, a director of Salomon in Hong Kong, said: 'The popularity of the issue points to a favourable opinion of the long-term prospects of Hong Kong and bodes well for other Hong Kong issuers interested in tapping the international capital markets for long-term debt.' Mr Leonard Rubin, executive director of Exxon Energy, said the response of investors showed that they share a positive view of Capco's prospects in the long term.</p>

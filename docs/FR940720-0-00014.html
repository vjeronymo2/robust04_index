			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The NRC professional rate has increased slightly from $132/hr to $133/hr;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. Resources for these activities had previously been included in overhead, but are now assigned directly to the class of licensees that they support;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The number of licenses in some classes has decreased as compared to FY 1993 due to license termination or consolidation, resulting in fewer licensees to pay for the costs of regulatory activities not recovered under 10 CFR Part 170; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The budget for some classes of licensees has increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC contemplates that any fees to be collected as a result of this final rule will be assessed on an expedited basis to ensure collection of the required fees by September 30, 1994, as stipulated in OBRA&hyph;90. Therefore, as in FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993, the fees will become effective 30 days after publication of the final rule. The NRC will send a bill for the amount of the annual fee to the licensee or certificate, registration, or approval holder upon publication of the final rule. Payment is due on the effective date of the FY 1994 rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Amendments to 10 CFR Part 170: Fees for Facilities, Materials, Import and Export Licenses, and Other Regulatory Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five amendments have been made to Part 170. These amendments do not change the underlying basis for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation_that fees be assessed to applicants, persons, and licensees for specific identifiable services rendered. The revisions also comply with the guidance in the Conference Committee Report on OBRA&hyph;90 that fees assessed under the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (IOAA) recover the full cost to the NRC of all identifiable regulatory services each applicant or licensee receives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the agency-wide professional hourly rate, which is used to determine the Part 170 fees, is increased from $132 per hour to $133 per hour ($231,216 per direct FTE). The rate is based on the FY 1994 direct FTEs and that portion of the FY 1994 budget that does not constitute direct program support (contractual services costs) and is not recovered through the appropriation from the NWF. As indicated earlier, the decrease in the FY 1994 budget as compared to the FY 1993 budget is primarily for direct program support, which is not included in the hourly rate. Thus, the reduction in the budget has limited impact on the hourly rate but will show up as a direct reduction to the amount allocated to the various classes of licensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the current Part 170 licensing and inspection fees in &sect;&sect;170.21 and 170.31 for all applicants and licensees are revised to reflect the very small increase in the hourly rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the definition of special projects as provided in &sect;170.3 of the regulations is revised as a result of (1) the NRC's experience in implementing the 100 percent fee recovery program during the past three years and (2) the NRC's most recent fee policy review, required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The NRC believes that the costs for some requests or reports being filed with NRC are more appropriately captured in the 10 CFR Part 171 annual fees rather than assessing specific fees under 10 CFR Part 170. These reports, although submitted by a specific organization, support NRC's development of generic guidance and regulations (e.g., rules, regulatory guides, and policy statements), and resolution of safety issues applicable to a class of licensees, such as those addressed in generic letters. Therefore, the applicable definition in &sect;170.3 and the footnotes in &sect;&sect;170.21 and 170.31 are revised to indicate that 10 CFR Part 170 fees will not be assessed for requests/reports which have been submitted to the NRC:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In response to a Generic Letter or NRC Bulletin that does not result in an amendment to the license, does not result in the review of an alternate method or reanalysis to meet the requirements of the Generic Letter or does not involve an unreviewed safety issue;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In response to an NRC request (at the Associate Office Director level or above) to resolve an identified safety, safeguards, or environmental issue, or to assist the NRC in developing a rule, regulatory guide, policy statement, generic letter, or bulletin; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) As a means of exchanging information between industry organizations and the NRC for the purpose of supporting generic regulatory improvements or efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The terms ``alternate method'', ``reanalysis'' and ``unreviewed safety issue'' are explained in more detail in Section IV, Section-By-Section Analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, &sect;170.11(a) is amended to establish an exemption from fees for State-owned research reactors if they meet the technical design criteria for the exemption and are research reactors used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifth, Fee Category 2 is amended by establishing two additional fee categories, 2.A.(2) and 2.A.(3), which cover licenses authorizing receipt and disposal of Section 11e.(2) byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act. The current 2.A. category has been amended to read 2.A.(1). The current 4.D. fee category has been eliminated. This action recognizes that: (1) Source material licenses are issued to cover these licensed activities and therefore they are more appropriately placed in the source material category; and (2) that a further distinction should be made between those licenses whose primary purpose is to authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material requiring the establishment of a new tailings pile and those licenses authorizing the receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material incidental to tailings piles created by mill operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Category 16 of &sect;170.31, reciprocity, is amended to include a fee to recover the NRC's costs of reviewing revisions to the initial NRC Form 241 filed by 10 CFR 150.20 general licensees. Agreement State licensees requesting reciprocity for activities conducted in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters are subject to 10 CFR 150.20. The first time within a calendar year that an Agreement State licensee conducts activities in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters, it must file a completed NRC Form 241. Revisions to the initial NRC Form 241 are filed for review and authorization when persons using the 10 CFR Part 150.20 general license either add locations of work, use different radioactive material or perform additional work activities in a non-Agreement State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

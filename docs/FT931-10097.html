			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Robusta COFFEE prices closed down heavily at the London Future's and Options Exchange in the wake of Monday night's late 5 cent fall in the New York arabica market. London continued to be less volatile than New York, partly because of lower fund participation. New York prices fell further in early trading on renewed technical selling, but later were recovering some of the losses. London dealers said the market remained very edgy. Technical factors were still driving prices, with fundamental influences pushed firmly into the background. On the LME ALUMINIUM and NICKEL prices, which touched respective five and four-week highs, gave up some of the gains by the close as the higher levels attracted profit-taking. Dealers said the strength of both metals appeared to be technically motivated, with little news or physical activity to justify advances. On Nymex PALLADIUM futures were hovering near life-of-contract highs at midday as widespread worries over near-term supplies remained the dominant factor. Compiled from Reuters</p>

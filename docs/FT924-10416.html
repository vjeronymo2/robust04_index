			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: Etruscans with a love of wine women and song - An ancient people who are now politically correct THE ETRUSCANS are politically correct. Since their Roman conquerors were brought into disrepute by Mussolini's fetish for the style and ambitions of Julius Caesar, they have appealed to modern Italians as natural ancestors. So most Italian universities have chairs of 'Etruscology', and so Giovanni Agnelli of Fiat regularly dips into corporate funds to stage Etruscan jamborees both at home and abroad. The show now on in Paris extends Italian partisanship further: Jack Lang, the French Minister of Fun, introduces Etruscan archaeology as a substratum of modern Europe - giving the Etruscans another dimension of political correctness, at least in the eyes of Europhiles. The Etruscans are open to claims of this sort by the peculiar nature of their survival. They were the first victims in the laboratory of Roman imperialism: the Romans effectively purged the world of Etruscan literature, without which it is very difficult to form clear ideas about Etruscan culture. We rely on the archaeological remains, supplemented by no more than a few vague comments by ancient writers indicating that Etruscan society was characterised and eventually undermined by its love of wine, food, sex and music. So it is easy to idealise these people (as DH Lawrence and others have done) and easy to overlook some features of the archaeological record which spoil the ideal. Ironically, archaeological evidence points to the Etruscans as the inventors of fascism: certainly the first fasces - a double-edged axe carried as a symbol of authority - is Etruscan, not Roman. If Mussolini had known this, the present popularity of things Etruscan might be diminished. But as it is, the juxtaposition of the Etruscans at the Grand Palais with Picasso is testimony to their attraction: the Etruscan throngs, when I was there, considerably outnumbered those for Picasso. The spirit of Europeanism has enabled an impressively discreet gathering of Etruscan material from around the continent. For the Etruscans did connect with peoples over the Alps and along the French and Spanish coast; and most importantly, they introduced the Celtic world to wine drinking and wine production. German chieftains in Bavaria, Gaulish princes by Marseilles - Etruscan market research revealed these as the targets not only for shipments of proto-Chianti, but also some finely-wrought vessels with which to celebrate and share the new beverage. The Etruscans make a satisfying show. One of their painted tombs has been reassembled here, and the sort of lifestyle its paintings depict - banqueting, dancing, aristocratic conviviality - is amply documented by selections of fine jewellery and fine vases. Such things were pouring out of Etruscan tombs from the late 18th century onwards and it is not surprising that they had an impact upon modern European taste. At just the time when rich young men and women were making the 'Grand Tour', the Etruscans were yielding souvenirs in abundance. So although Britain was, in ancient times, entirely peripheral to Etruscan activity, Britain is the only other place in Europe which has the place 'Etruria' on its map. Josiah Wedgwood was responsible for this: impressed by the quantity and quality of vases coming out of Etruscan tombs, he called his new factory 'Etruria' and began to imitate Classical designs. The exhibition gives almost half its space to charting this belated Etruscan influence, and rightly so. But visitors should not be too deluded by the apparent direction of 'scientific progress' implied by the displays. The implication is that early students of the Etruscans were fantasy-mongers whose fantasies have now been replaced by sober scholarship. The truth is otherwise. At least one of the contributors to the catalogue has written glowingly of Etruscan artefacts which were, in fact, Made in Italy not very long ago. A scientific archaeology of the Etruscans is impossible: most of the objects on display here were excavated with all the skill of a dog recovering an old bone, and clandestine explorations continue to thwart proper research in Italy. We can decipher the Etruscan language as it appears in inscriptions: but without any significant literature, this language has failed to reveal much about those who used it. Great areas of knowledge about the Etruscans, such as their political organisations or their internal history, remain entirely mysterious. And perhaps they always will, and perhaps it is better that way. So long as the Etruscans stay inscrutable, Jack Lang can wax about the 'spontaneity' of their art, Giovanni Agnelli can write tenderly as though they were his great-grandfathers, and they can challenge us all to try our luck and see what we make of them. The Etruscans and Europe is at the Grand Palais, Paris, until December 14, then moves to the Altes Museum, Berlin in the New Year.</p>

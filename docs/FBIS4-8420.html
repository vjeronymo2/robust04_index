			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 12 (ATA) -- President Berisha has  received a letter from the publisher and the editorial board of  the newspaper LLAIKO VIMA, a paper published in Gjirokaster in  the Greek language for the Greek minority. The letter follows:    The April 10 incident in the border point of Peshkepi e  Siperme grieved all the employees and readers of this paper.  Acts of this kind, wherever they come from, have nothing to do  with the sincere feelings of the peoples and the desire of the  Greek minority in Albania to play the role of the bridge and  factor of friendship between the Albanian people and the Greek  one.    We believe in the will to clarify this incident to the end  in  order not vanish hopes for relations of good neighbourliness.    On this occasion we also express our profound and most  sincere condolences to the families of the victims, who were  unjustly killed. Our paper offers the families of the victims a  modest sum of 80,000 new leks in support.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TO FOOT BILLS, TROUPE TO STAGE A WALK-A-THON  </P> <P> Wary of giving the impression that they're flush with money now that private  contributors have salvaged their season, officials of the Grove Shakespeare  Festival are beating the bushes for people to enter a fund-raising  "walk-a-thon" on Saturday.  </P> <P> The 16-kilometer "Walk for William" is being sponsored by the GSF Guild along  with a closet sale of costumes and props from various productions in the hope  of raising about $2,000.  </P> <P> A similar combined event last year raised nearly $4,000, Grove artistic  director Thomas F. Bradac said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The walk, which requires an entry fee of $20 for each participant, consists of  four 2 1/2-mile laps. The route winds through the city; participants will  receive a "Walk for William" T-shirt.  </P> <P> "We're also encouraging walkers to sign up sponsors to give money for each  kilometer they walk," Grove spokeswoman Dede Ginter said. "People who do not  wish to walk but want to show their support are urged to sponsor Tom. He's  going to do the full 16 kilometers."  </P> <P> After the walk, which steps off at 8 a.m. from the Festival Amphitheatre at  12852 Main St., "we'll clean out Shakespeare's closet," Ginter said. "We'll be  selling off handmade, one-of-a-kind costumes, props, masks and puppets."  </P> <P> The closet sale is to last until 6 p.m. or until the closet is bare, whichever  comes first, she said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The current revolutionary courts throughout the  country will be dissolved and then these courts will be formed  anew where necessary, at the discretion of the chief of the  judiciary. According to a bill that has been approved by the  Majles and has become law, dealing with charges such as  threatening the nation's domestic and foreign security, warring  with God's representatives or corruption on the earth, insulting  the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, armed activities  and assassinations, destruction of institutions for the purpose  of opposing the government, spying for foreigners and crimes  related to smuggling and narcotics, will be handled by the  revolution courts.    The verdicts by the revolution courts are final except in  cases involving execution and stoning to death, Islamic  penalties, personal vengeance, confiscation of assets, and blood  money in excess of one-fifth of the full blood price. The  convicted person can request an appeal, and in this case the  judicial proceedings will be turned over to the appeal courts,  which will convene in the province centers. Under this law, the  general courts must replace all the various existing courts and  they will have the jurisdiction to hear penal, civil and  nonlitigious cases (nonlitigious cases are matters such as  appointing guardians for minors and other such things, where the  issuance of a verdict will not harm or benefit anyone).    The chief of the judiciary, whose prerogatives have  increased  under this law, is required within no more than five years of  the law's effective date gradually to form the general courts  and revolution courts and to create conditions for this law's  implementation throughout the country. From the time of the  formation of the general and revolution courts in each judicial  precinct, all conflicting laws and regulation in those precincts  are void.    Several days before this bill was approved in the Majles,  Shushtari, the minister of justice, discussed the "great changes  facing Iran's judicial apparatus." He said that all the nation's  judges must prepare themselves to implement this law. He said:  It took 12 years to prepare this bill.    An informed legislative source who did not want his name  disclosed, said: If properly implemented, this law will probably  eliminate some of the confusion that now exists in Iran's  judicial apparatus. He also mentioned the right to request an  appeal on heavy sentences such as execution, stoning and  personal vengeance. Although these can be positive steps, the  existence of sentences such as stoning to death and confiscation  of assets shows the reactionary and worn-out essence of the  nation's judicial apparatus. According to him, "warring against  God's representatives and corruption on the earth" are cases  where there is no specific accusation, just as putting the crime  of insulting the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the  same level with endangering national security also shows the  oppressive essence of the Islamic regime.    He said: One must wait to see if courts such as the special  clerical court, the military court, the religiously prohibited  crimes court and others will be dissolved or not.</p>

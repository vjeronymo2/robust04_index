			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges up in lacklustre trading session Wall Street US share prices edged higher yesterday in a lacklustre session highlighted by the second-quarter results of the leading US energy groups, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.80 better at 3,741.84, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.14 at 454.25. Volume on the Big Board was a light 211m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 0.61 at 434.06, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.20 to 716.88. The restrained tone which had dominated trading last week carried over to yesterday's opening. Prices opened firmer but failed to make much headway, with the market held in check by renewed uncertainty over the timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to tighter money. With Mr Alan Greenspan's recent warning on interest rates still ringing in the ears of equity investors, the market looked for inspiration elsewhere and came up empty. Activity in the bond market was as non-committal as in stocks, and there was but a shred of second-tier economic guidance on offer. The National Association of Realtors announced that sales of existing homes last month had dropped 3.6 per cent. The news, while was nominally supportive of a scenario which sees the Fed delaying its next strike on rates, was merely shrugged off. Instead, Wall Street concentrated on further news on how the corporate sector fared during the second quarter. The overall impression was not particularly favourable, but few stocks were hit hard. Wall Street was, however, disappointed with the big oil groups, which reported their downstream profit margins had come under pressure as crude prices climbed during the second quarter. Among the companies publishing their results, Mobil closed down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 84 3/8 and Texaco was unchanged at Dollars 63. But Exxon added Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 , even though its results fell short of expectations. By contrast, Black &amp; Decker surprised analysts by posting better-than-expected earnings of 24 cents, up from 20 cents in the year-earlier period. The tool maker's stock was marked up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 18 3/4 . Capital Cities/ABC appreciated Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 79 3/4 on its announcement of net income of Dollars 1.23 a share, up from 92 cents a year ago. CBS dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 309 as the media group commenced a programme to purchase 3.5m shares at Dollars 325. Canada Toronto stocks closed slightly lower in light trading with the the TSE-300 composite index slipping 7.77 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 4,168.39. Declines led advances 399 to 315. Volume of 41.60m shares was below Friday's 56.13m shares and trading value was CDollars 465.0m compared with CDollars 470.4m. American Barrick announced a bid, which it valued at CDollars 14 a share, for all of Lac Minerals' outstanding shares. Barrick's shares lost CDollars 1 to CDollars 31 3/8 . Royal Oak Mines, which launched a bid for Lac earlier this month, was up CDollars 1/4 to CDollars 5 7/8.</p>

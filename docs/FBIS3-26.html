			<p>Europe     Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vol. III, No. 10,  10 March 1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Latin America Group featuring brief summaries of foreign  media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most recent  sources available to FBIS.      Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East European Divisions of  Europe/Latin America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for summary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications. The EER is published in two  editions, one for Western Europe (also including media coverage of  Canada and Turkey), and the other for Eastern Europe.  Drawing  primarily from domestic media sources of these countries but also  using other foreign media where appropriate, the EER focuses on  national and regional economic issues, such as economic  competitiveness, regional economic integration, economic reforms and  other changes in economic policies, and foreign trade and  investment.      FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S. Government.  All comment or analysis contained herein is  attributable to the cited media source, unless otherwise indicated.

An article in  the 7 March LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES stated that the revival of Super  301 "can only add to the difficulties faced by the (EU) Twelve in  speaking with one voice in Marrakesh..."  However, the 7 March LA  TRIBUNE DESFOSSES article pointed out that "in Brussels, as in other  capitals, everyone is convinced that (President) Clinton's decision  is targeted to intimidate only Japan," not the EU.      French press reporting also contained the following official  statements, most of which were also critical of the United States.  For example:      * GATT Director Peter Sutherland:  Sutherland was quoted as  saying the U.S. action is "a new effort in bilateral trade, which is  about to test the results obtained in the Uruguay Round before they  are even implemented."  (LIBERATION 4 Mar 94)  "The concept of  managed trade constitutes a dangerous and unfortunate notion.  When  bureaucrats interfere (in trade), the potential of risks increases."  (LE FIGARO 4 Mar 94)      * Prime Minister Edouard Balladur:  "Happy to get rid of the  label of bad boy of world trade," Balladur stated that the Super 301  decision "completely validates the French position that one cannot  have a system of free trade where each country creates its own  justice." (LIBERATION 5, 6 Mar 94)  "It is the negation of an  international free trade system, which is what we have always said  it was." (LE FIGARO 5, 6 Mar 94)  Balladur, criticizing U.S.  "threats" against France as a "breach of the rules of the game,"  declared, "It is proof that we are right to ask for the suppression  of Super 301.  If we do not, the Uruguay Round agreement will only  be hot air." (LES ECHOS 7 Mar 94)      Despite the negative comments by these officials, the press did  report a more positive assessment:      * EU Officials:  An article in LIBERATION claims that while  officials in the EU are declaring that they are hostile to the U.S.  unilateral approach on trade with Japan, in private "some officials"  understand U.S. "aggravation," acknowledging that the United States  "had first tried everything, all in vain."  The article cites one of  these unnamed official sources as saying, "This (Super 301) affair  may threaten to deteriorate the climate of trust a bit more,  especially in financial markets.  But, if it ends in the Japanese  making a gesture, in them launching a real budgetary effort to  stimulate domestic demand, then Europe will profit from it."  (LIBERATION 4 March 94)      U.S.-France Fish Dispute      The press also noted coUents on the U.S.-France dispute over  U.S. fish imports to France, on which France had imposed strict  inspection regulations, prompting the United States to propose  retaliation against French cheese.  An editorial in the 7 March LA  TRIBUNE DESFOSSES stated that the United States "threatened"  retaliation because "the Clinton administration has acted under  pressure from the National Fisheries Institute and the shipowners'  lobby, arguing that Massachusetts fishermen were losing $200,000 a  week because of the restrictions on Fish imports imposed by France."  The press also reported the following official comments:      * Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's Staff:  Viewing the  retaliation threat as an indication of a tougher U.S. trade policy,  Balladur's staff contended, "If the United States is stepping up the  pressure on international trade, it is to cast doubt on the Uruguay  Round's main achievement, which their Senate refuses to consider:  the institutionalization of a World Trade Organization." (LA TRIBUNE  DESFOSSES 7 Mar 94)      Foreign Minister Alain Juppe:  "Our decision (regarding fish  imports) conformed perfectly with the applicable Community  regulations.  If the United States engages in retaliatory measures  against France, they will be responsible for an escalation (of trade  tensions) just when we are preparing for the Marrakesh  conference....  One should ask if this would be a good signal."  (LE  FIGARO 5, 6 Mar 94) (DiI)      FINLAND      STUDY FINDS JOB TRAINING SUCCEEDING--According to a recent study,  the national adult vocational training program has been enjoying  some success in the greater Helsinki region.  The study, conducted  in Uusimaa Province Labor District, which includes the densely  populated Helsinki region, found that one of every three district  trainees finds a job within two months of leaving the program.  Kari  Kiuru, writing in the 25 February HELSINGIN SANOMAT, claims much of  the program's success is due to its flexibility in responding to job  market changes.  Officials constantly monitor these changes and  solicit suggestions from industry on, for example, training programs  which could fit the needs of laid-off workers.  New or expanded  courses, however, cannot always keep up with rapid changes in  student demands.  The boom in the export sector, for example, has  led to a recent surge of applications for relevant training:  200  people applied for just 20 available spaces this year.      In 1994, Uusimaa District will receive 163 million markkas, which  will allow it to accept 12,000 students, or about one-tenth of the  the area's unemployed.  The district will offer a wide variety of  training opportunities, covering about 100 job fields and divided  into some 800 separate courses.  Training lasts anywhere from one  month to as much as an entire year.

FRANCE      BALLADUR MODERATES CIP PROVISIONS--Faced with mounting criticism  from labor unions and student demonstrations, Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur has made "important" concessions to change the new  Professional Insertion Contract (CIP), a measure which has been  denounced by labor, student, and opposition forces as a  discriminatory "Youth Minimum Wage."  According to Delphine Girard  writing in the 4 March LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, Balladur made these  concessions to calm the "social tempest" he created in approving a  law to implement the CIP, which originally would have allowed  employers to hire those under 26 years of age--even those with a  junior college degree--for 80 percent of France's guaranteed minimum  wage (SMIC) and would have required that the company provide a  mentor "to help the new employee to begin his career."  Balladur has  agreed to "redefine" the CIP, stating that mentors must provide real  training within the company."  He has also replaced the provision  allowing junior college hirees to be paid at 80 percent of the SMIG  with the stipulation they must be paid instead at 80 percent of the  "conventional minimum wage" of the industry, which cannot be below  the regular SMIC.  Those with no degree, however, may still be hired  at the below-minimum-wage rate.      Balladur's concessions were made not only under pressure from  labor, students, and opposition groups but also from members of his  own governing coalition.  An article in the 3 March LA TRIBUNE  DESFOSSES reported that former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac entered  the debate, having declared "a Youth Minimum Wage is an ill-adapted  way to solve unemployment," bringing with it "important  inconveniences."  An article in the 4, 5 March LES ECHOS noted that  Chirac had added, "If we allow companies to hire young people with a  salary less than the SMIC, the difference must be counterbalanced by  real training in the company..."  The UDF Youth Movement also made  public its objection to Balladur's choice of fighting youth  unemployment, asking him to "review his options."  The president of  the finance committee of the National Assembly, Jacques Barrot,  contended that "the text of the implementation law on CIP is not  satisfactory," and that the tutorial obligations of companies using  the CIP must be better defined.  He also said that "more detailed  coordination on the strategies taken toward junior college graduates  is needed."      Despite Balladur relenting to these pressures and subsequently  redefining the CIP provisions, the labor unions are not convinced he  has gone far enough, Girard continues in the 4 March LA TRIBUNE  DESFOSSES.  The unions still refuse to support what they insist on  calling the "Youth Minimum Wage" for those with no college  education, to which Balladur responded, "Better this than nothing at  all."  Workers Force (FO) head Marc Blondel declared, "Tensions will  continue.  We still disagree with the prime minister's proposals."  French Democratic Confederation of Labor (CFDT) secretary general,  Nicole Notat, claims the government is trying to appear to relent on  the issue "without relenting." (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in  French 4 Mar 94 p 2; 3 Mar 94 p 4; Paris LES ECHOS in French 4, 5  Mar 94 p 2)      EMPLOYERS STAY OUT OF CIP DEBATE--The controversy that has  embroiled the government and the labor unions over the CIP is not  regarded as such by employers, according to an article in LA TRIBUNE  DESFOSSES.  Employers state that "there either are jobs or there are  no jobs."  Employing more workers depends above all on business  activity and that "this type of measure (the CIP) can only serve to  plug holes where personnel are needed for six or eight months," or  until the economy picks up.  However, the article claims employers  view the CIP as "rather positive," noting that apprenticeship  contracts have worked well and that the idea of lowering the wage  cost is nothing new.  The danger, according to employers, is that  the CIP is becoming too politicized and is too associated with a  Youth Minimum Wage.  As for the fears that the young will take jobs  away from the more experienced, the article cites statements from  staff members at the Vallourec company as saying, "It is a false  problem since a company is always tempted to do just that.  The CIP  would change nothing."  Other employers pointed out that they prefer  a more long-term hiring policy and that in any case, companies are  looking for workers with at least a junior college education rather  than those with no advanced education. (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE  DESFOSSES in French 7 Mar 94 p 6)      INSEE BACKS OFF EMPLOYMENT STUDY CONCLUSIONS--The National  Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) has modified  the conclusions of a study it conducted with the Bureau of  Information and Economic Forecasting (BIPE) on the impact on  employment of either a reduction in employer's social welfare costs  or a reduction in youth wages.  The study, ordered by the Senate  when the five-year law on employment was being considered, reported  (see West Europe Economic Survey Special Report, Vol III, No 7, 24  Feb 94) to have established a much sharper macroeconomic effect on  employment when employer social charges were reduced (almost 300,000  supplemental jobs in the medium term) than would establishing a  "Youth Minimum Wage" (almost 150,000 more jobs).      In a communique released on 2 March, INSEE changed its  conclusion, explaining that it is not possible to determine a  precise distinction between the effects of lowering employer costs  versus lowering youth wages.  (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in  French 4 Mar 94 p 3)      BANKS USE FROZEN IRAQI FUNDS TO PAY CREDITORS--Three large French  banks--Societe Generale, National Bank of Paris (BNP), and the Union  of French and Arab Banks (UBAF) have used frozen Iraqi assets to  compensate the accounts of Iraqi clients without French Treasury  approval, according to an article in LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE.  After  months of investigation, the Finance Ministry has concluded that  these banks have completed financial operations of several hundreds  of millions of francs, despite the freeze on Iraqi assets in France  instituted in August 1990 following the Gulf War.  Economy Minister  Edmond Alphandery must now set the amount of the fines, which can be  up to three times the sums in question.      The banks, having debited and credited accounts of Iraqi clients,  reduced their financial exposure on Iraq.  In so doing, they have  "designated themselves privileged creditors," the article notes.  Between December 1992 and April 1993, for example, nearly 60 million  francs (Fr) disappeared from Iraqi accounts at UBAF.  The banks  argue that the transactions were made in "good faith and in a formal  manner."  The article points out that some Iraqi creditors were not  so lucky.  The CED-Viandes and Dumez companies, for example, have  been trying for two years to recoup money from Iraq and have,  without success, been trying to serve the banks with seizure notices  on the Iraqi assets. (DiI)  (Paris LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE in French 21  Feb 94 p 38)      AEROSPATIALE WANTS EU AID TO FIGHT U.S. COMPETITION--French  Aircraft and Space Industries Group (GIFAS) President Serge Dassault  would like the EU to promote--"as (President) Bill Clinton does (for  U.S. aircraft companies)"--Europe's aircraft industry, according to  an article in LES ECHOS.  The article claims that the thinking of EU  officials, meeting currently in Brussels to adopt a couon position  on the next GATT aircraft industry negotiations, has been "marked"  by the "intervention" of President Clinton to win the Saudi Airlines  contract for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas at the expense of the  Airbus consortium.  The article claims this augurs poorly for  aircraft industry subsidy negotiations with the United States which,  according to Dassault "is trying to enclose Europeans in rigid  regulations to which the United States itself does not conform."  Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois adds: "We do not have to go  along with the U.S. game of managing the negotiations.  But, we must  defend our system of reimbursable advances, which is a good system  based on the idea of risk sharing.  At the same time, we must also  prepare to progressively adopt indirect aid, as it is given in the  United States, in order to have two irons in the fire and to achieve  a balance between the two systems." (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS in  French 2 Mar 94 p 10)      EIB TO LOAN FRANCE MORE THAN FR15 MILLION--According to an  article in LES ECHOS, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is ready to  increase its lending if the EU White Paper plan to increase growth  and employment in Europe requires it.  The bank loaned nearly Fr130  billion to its target countries in 1993--funds which were raised  without difficulty on the international markets--and the bank has  the means to sharply increase its lending, according to bank  president, Sir Brian Unwin.  "With a financing capacity of 144  billion ECU's and a total loan portfolio of 98 billion ECU's, the  bank can do more for Europe's economy," Unwin said.      In France, the EIB intends to increase its loans for public  works, environmental protection, and automobile industry projects.  Last year the country, which is the fourth largest beneficiary of  EIB loans after Italy, Spain, and Britain, received Fr14.6 billion  from the bank, a figure more than 13 percent higher than 1992 and  which represents 12.4 percent of total  1993 EIB lending.  This  amount was largely devoted to regional development to reinforce  economic and social cohesion in Europe, lending which adheres to EIB  statutory goals.  More than 50 percent of the loans were accorded to  local projects in "industrial decline" zones or "delayed  development" areas.  EIB lending for industrial priorities is also  in line with general EU goals: transportation will receive Fr6.6  billion for the super fast train, TGV Nord, and the Channel tunnel,  while the aircraft industry is slated for Fr1.4 billion.  The  environment will also garner increased support as will the  automobile industry.  According to unnamed directors of the bank,  EIB has "a very specific project currently under study which would  involve French auto makers Peugeot and Renault." (DiI)  (Paris LES  ECHOS in French 28 Feb 94 p 8)      LONGUET DISCUSSES TEXTILE AID--Industry Minister Gerard Longuet,  speaking at a late February roundtable discussion with textile  manufacturers, stated that if they had ideas for investment projects  for their industry they should submit them to the government  because, "If there are projects, there will be money."  He also  noted that the government could allocate Fr160 million to textile-  clothing investments without any requirements linked to employment.  Such allocations would come from new regional funding approved to  aid small to medium-sized industries, which in 1994 will amount to  Fr80O million for various programs.  Additionally, the textile-  clothing industry will be able to obtain EU funds targeted for  training, of which France's share is Fr700 million and which is to  be split among the automobile, electronic, and textile industries.  These funds, however, are for training in the broader sense, such as  that for trade certification and data processing technicians and not  for training related to specific projects.  Longuet repeated that  while these training funds can generally help textile companies,  specific "projects are still needed" to generate additional help.  (DiI)  (Paris LES ECH0S in French l Mar 94 p 8)      WINNERS OF BALLADUR ECONOMICS LISTED--Gerard Desportes and  Nathaniel Herzberg writing in the Paris daily LIBERATION have  reviewed the results of 10 months of Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur's administration and has noted that except for the  education field where Balladur's attempt to help finance private  schools failed, many groups gained as a result of his economic  policies.  They are:      Small Investors -- Privatizations gave small investors  opportunities to buy shares of such companies as Rhone-Poulenc, Elf-  Aquitaine, and National Bank of Paris at a discount price.  According to the authors, such a discount on these shares amounted  to a "gift" of Fr5 billion to investors.      Farmers -- The authors claim Balladur was "extremely firm" in his  support for farmers during the GATT negotiations, despite the risk  of international crisis.  Last May, Balladur granted farmers Fr1.9  billion to "sweeten" the oil seeds agreement and Fr1.5 billion in  November to facilitate the passage of the modified Blair House  agricultural agreement.      Small Business -- Balladur temporarily banned the opening of  large retail stores, a subject of controversy among small business  owners who face stiff competition from such large stores.      Big Business -- To foster employment, Balladur has lowered the  cost of labor and money, instituted more flexibility in the labor  code, granted assistance to foundering sectors of the economy, and  transferred part of the social costs paid by companies to the state  budget.      Doctors --  Private physicians, a group traditionally favorable  to the Right, have benefited from Balladur's economic policy, which  raised taxpayers health insurance contributions and lowered the  number of hospital beds.      Civil Servants -- These employees have maintained their  retirement benefits and purchasing power, unlike the rest of the  population, which has not only been affected by two "highly  unpopular" austerity measures to reduce them but have also  experienced lower private sector salaries.      The Press -- Showing "great understanding" for the difficulties  affecting the press, the Balladur government has repeatedly  supported modernization in this sector and granted "exceptional"  assistance, which will total Fr721 million over several years, to  publications foundering because of the loss of advertising funds.  Retirees -- The authors contend that this group has benefited  from Balladur's "greatest coup," which will modify the entire  retirement system.  This change will be implemented by stages and be  completed by the year 2003 and temporarily settles the problem of  the retirement system's deficit. (RM)  (Paris LIBERATION in French  15 Feb 94 pp 4-5)      CONZE CONCENTRATES WEAPONS PRODUCTION IN CHER--Convinced of the  need to "gather forces," Henri Conze, director general of the  General Armaments Delegation (DGA), signed an agreement with  Aerospatiale, Matra Defense, Thomson and Giat-Industrie to create a  number of jobs in the Cher department, where the weapons industry  holds 20 percent of all industrial jobs.  Aerospatiale will create  over 60 jobs before the end of 1995 and 40 more in 1996 in its three  regional factories: one of which produces spare parts for aircraft,  the second of which is dedicated to "small missiles," and the third  of which manufactures ballistic missiles.  Matra Defense will create  35 new jobs in its local plants, where the air-to-air Mica missiles  are manufactured.  Some 200 jobs will be created by Thomson and 15  by Giat-Industrie in the manufacture of various types of munitions.  The DGA itself will transfer to the Cher department some of its lIe-  de-France "missions," including the production of powders and  explosives.  In addition, a weapons specialist will advise the  region's prefect and a trade mission will promote the region's  special defense products such as the Eryx missile.  The  reinforcement of weapons manufacturing in the Cher region should  ease this industry's budgetary problems and help it save an  estimated 230,000 jobs. (RM)  (Paris LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS in French  14 Feb 94 p 11)      GERMANY      GERMANS OUTPACE JAPANESE IN PRODUCTIVITY--In 1993, Germany  outstripped Japan in industrial productivity for the first time,  according to a study by Bernd Hof of the Institute of the German  Economy in Cologne.  According to Hof, Japanese labor productivity,  measured in terms of real GDP per worker, declined by 1.2 percent in  1993, compared with only a 0.1 percent drop for Germany.  In fact,  Hof found that the productivity gap between Japanese and German  industry continues to widen.  While the recession-related decline in  production has caused the profits of Japanese companies to "tumble,"  German firms appear to be recovering and making progress, at least  in cutting costs.  By reducing workforces and increasing  productivity, the Germans have been able to achieve lower unit wage  costs and higher profits.  This development also has its darker  side, however, as evidenced by current unemployment figures and  fears that, when the next economic upturn comes, the skilled workers  currently unemployed either will no longer be available or will be  employable only at "disproportionately" high costs.  The Japanese  share these fears and are therefore hesitant to lay off permanent  staff.      Hof, arguing that the "real" reason for the decline in Japanese  productivity is its traditional reluctance to lay off workers, sees  a "remarkable parallel" in the German automobile industry, with one  "essential" difference as exemplified by Volkswagen.  Although  Volkswagen has reduced working hours for its employees by 20 percent  rather than lay them off, it has benefitted from workers giving up  12 to 13 percent of their wages.  Consequently, Volkswagen is in a  better wage-cost position than a Japanese company where workers are  working fewer hours but drawing full salary. (JS)  (Berlin DIE WELT  in German 15 Feb 94 p 12)      FRENCH-GERMAN REFINERY DEAL IN TROUBLE--Elf Aquitaine, two-thirds  owner of the privatized Leuna refinery in the Halle-Bitterfeld  region, is attempting to renegotiate the agreement under which it  purchased the plant from the Trust Agency.  The agreement calls for  Elf and its German co-owner, Thyssen Handelsunion (THU) to build a  new 4.5 billion German marks (DM) refinery with a 10-million-  ton/year capacity; the Trust Agency is pressing Elf to start  construction or risk a DM1.5 billion contract penalty and  cancellation of the sale of the profitable Minol gas station network  which made the agreement attractive to the French in the first  place.  Elf is reportedly looking for new investors so that it can  become a minority shareholder but THU is not interested in  increasing its share.  Since the original agreement, oil market  trends have dictated that refinery output be reduced, rather than  increased, and Elf has begun to privatize some of its own  operations.  Because Elf's new management is selling stock on the  market, it wants to avoid risky projects and is citing increased  competition, declining demand, and flat economic growth in eastern  Germany as grounds for revising its investment policy.  Guenter  Rexrodt, German minister of economics, has insisted that Elf begin  with the agreed upon construction and maintains that Elf cannot  reduce its holdings by returning shares to the Trust Agency pending  resale.  Rexrodt has allowed, however that renegotiation of later  stages of the agreement may be possible, and notes that contacts are  continuing with other firms, including British Petroleum, which  showed interest in Leuna during 1992 negotiations.  (CW)  (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 2 Mar 94 p 20)      HERMES INSURANCE FOR RUSSIAN RAILCAR SALES--Economics Minister  Guenter Rexrodt has advised the Berlin railcar firm, Deutsche  Waggonbau (DWA), that he expects DM555 million in Hermes export  credit guarantees to be available to support the company's 1994  sales to Russia.  At the same time, however,  the ministry has  expressed reservations about Russia's ability to meet international  business standards, which normally dictate making a 15-percent down  payment on contracts.      The recently privatized DWA had requested DM765 million in  guarantees for the current year but the German Government has cut  1994 credit guarantees to CIS countries from DM4 billion to DM3.5  billion, thus limiting guarantees for individual export contracts.  Consequently, DWA envisions needing more insurance guarantees in  1995 and 1996.  The 1994 limits, however, do not affect pending  applications for DM111 million in credit insurance on an existing  Russian contract and for DM110 million on an order from Kazakhstan.  (CW)  (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 28 Feb 94 p 15)      ECONOMIST SAYS GERMANY MISSED LONG-TERM GROWTH CYCLE--According  to one economist, Germany's failure to abandon outmoded industries  in favor of the growth sectors of the information age has caused it  to miss a long-term economic growth cycle and condemned it to a  lengthy struggle with recession and high unemployment.  Leo Nefiodow  of the Institute for Mathematics and Data Processing in Sankt  Augustin contends that Germany has failed to recognize information  technology as the driving force of the latest in a series of 50-year  growth cycles.  Instead of encouraging the development of growth  industries in the information field, Nef iodow argues, Germany has  continued to subsidize the dying industries of the previous cycle,  which was characterized by energy-intensive industries like  automobiles and petrochemicals.  Consequently, those who believe  renewed German prosperity will come with the next economic upturn  "will have to wait a long time."  In fact, no upturn will come  unless the country's economic structure adapts to these underlying  shifts in the world economy.      In Nefiodow's view, other countries--notably Japan--have done a  better job of riding the latest economic wave.  He notes that only  one German firm--Siemens-Nixdorf--plays a significant role in the  information field, while Japan is represented by over 20 companies.  Nef iodow ascribes Germany's failure to capitalize on the current  cycle primarily to social and cultural factors.  Germany's emphasis  on individualism and hierarchical forms of organization, he  maintains, makes it less able to respond to the demands of the  information age than Japan, with its stress on group well-being and  teamwork.  While Nefiodow believes it is too late for Germany to  catch up, he contends the country may be well positioned to  anticipate the next one, which he thinks could be driven by the  information, environmental, and health industries, since Germany has  high-quality measurement and process control and software and  systems technologies and a top-flight chemical industry.  Above all,  however, he emphasizes Germany's high degree of public awareness of  environmental, health, and information issues.  (RoH)  (Munich  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 21 Feb 94 p 20)      JOBLESS RATE, POLICIES COMPARED TO WEIMAR REPUBLIC--According to  commentator Wolfram Engels, the unemployment rate in Germany is  almost as high today as during the Weimar Republic but the German  Government, unlike the Weimar Republic, has failed to alleviate the  situation by reducing the cost of labor.  Engels notes that the  unemployment rate in February 1932 stood at 19.2 percent and that  the current rate--counting those in various publicly funded work  programs and other "hidden" forms of unemployment--has reached 18.2  percent.  "However," he writes, "that's where the similarity ends."  Weimar's Chancellor of the Reich Heinrich Bruening, Engels points  out, reduced the cost of labor from 5.57 million unemployed from  5.57 million to 4.1 million by August 1933.  A reduction in the cost  of labor, Engels maintains, would prove similarly effective today,  with an 8-percent cut in real wages sufficient to produce full  unemployment.  According to Engels, however, the German Government  is moving in exactly the opposite direction.  Its new nursing care  insurance program, he maintains, will "ignite a rocket" of labor  cost increases.  Engels suggests that the program could increase the  cost of labor by 6 percent or more within a few years, inevitably  leading to a further loss of jobs.  (RoH)  (Duesseldorf  WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE in German 11 Feb 94 p 150)      PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT ATTRACTING ATTENTION--With the number of  unemployed in Germany at 4 million persons, the idea of expanding  the part-time work force to alleviate the situation is attracting  increasing attention.  Cologne's Institute for the German Economy  (IW) reports that 2.66 million more Germans could be employed if the  percentage of part-time workers in the labor force were raised from  the current 15.5 to the 34.3 percent found in the Netherlands.  Experts note, however, that the service sector would have to be  significantly expanded and the proportion of working women slightly  reduced if this adjustment were to succeed.  Calculations show that  reducing the 22 million-person full-time labor force in Germany by  2.53 million would add 5.19 million new part-time jobs to the  existing 4 million.  Various surveys indicate that between 10 and 17  percent of full-time workers would be willing to accept part-time  employment, while somewhat lower percentages of unemployed persons  would be agreeable to part-time work.  As of December, 281,000  jobless were willing to work part-time but only 32,000 part-time  jobs were reported available.

Rexrodt noted that German  industry had overlooked the Mexican market during the boom years of  the 1980's, but had rediscovered its potential since the creation of  the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  German companies  now hoped, through Mexico, to gain duty-free access to the U.S.  market.  Rexrodt also pointed out that increasing trade with Germany  offered an opportunity for Mexico to lessen its dependence on the  United States, which currently accounts for 70 percent of all  Mexican foreign trade.      German trade with Mexico, which amounts to about DM5 billion, has  "still not realized its full potential," according to an article in  the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG.  By contrast, some progress has been made  in the field of capital investments.  In 1993 alone, Germans  invested DM20 billion in Mexico, 10 times more than in 1992.  Experts expect a similarly high level of investment in 1994.  According to the article, Mexico's recent trend toward economic  privatization, coupled with its balanced budget deficit and its  relatively low 8-percent inflation rate, have created favorable  conditions for German investors.  In addition, the two countries  have concluded an agreement to prevent double taxation, although  they  have yet to sign an investment protection pact.

The platform  contains a large section on economic reforms and programs which  advocate the following:      * Taxes      --Divide revenues equally between the central and local  governments.      --Extend the tax base, reduce individual tax rates.      --Remove taxes from Treasury bills since it "serves no purpose"  and the same result is currently being achieved by lower interest  rates.      --Reduce red tape and accounting procedures.      --Abolish local income taxes, health taxes, health benefit  contributions, and regional double taxation.  Allow individual  regional and local taxes.      --Combine the payment of personal income tax (IRPEF), VAT, social  security tax, and disability taxes for small companies and have them  submitted under a single tax return.      --Modernize the way tax evasion is fought by accurately  determining income and expenses.      * Employment      --Introduce shorter work hours which will increase  competitiveness on foreign markets.      --Support the EU's "Delors plan" for employment but it and the  quality of life a priority by complementing the plan with "social  and economic reorganization," including flexibility, part-time  employment, and paid time off.      * Privatizations      --Continue Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's privatization  program, which among other things will bring order to the banking  system--including savings banks--and ensure change in bank  leadership.      * Finance and Markets     --Open markets, which are restricted and dominated by a few  producers, to institutional investors.      --Provide tax incentives for pension, closed-investment, and real  estate funds.  Pay for profits and transfer payments from these  funds with shares of stock.  Establish local stock markets and  guarantee voting rights to small and institutional stockholders.      * Southern Policy      --Discontinue supporting a "decaying social structure" in  southern Italy.  Include the south in general national policies.  Encourage the creation of a network of viable small and medium-sized  companies in that region.

Moreover, the government will soon hold  negotiations with the Marconi company to discuss its anticipated  merger into the new "giant" corporation.  Portugal Telecom will be  ready for the privatization of about 30 percent of its capital by  the end of the year.  The government estimates that it will earn 120  million contos from the privatization process.

In so doing, he  elicited strong political reactions from his own party, the Spanish  Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) and opposition groups.  The article  noted that the Spanish pension system, which is administered and  funded by the government, increased spending 73.5 percent during  1989-93 and that forecasts indicate a 20 percent increase by 1997.  However, Solbes publicly reassured workers that the system could  still pay benefits but not over the long term.  He attributed this  problem to an aging population, longer life expectancy, fewer  contributors, and more annuitants.  Solbes suggested substituting  the current payment system for one which more closely resembles a  defined contribution plan rather than the current defined benefit  plan, which guarantees pension benefits regardless of the amount  contributed.  Currently, contributions are mandatory for 15 years.      An article in the 23 February EL PAlS claims that Solbes's  remarks created a sharp reaction from factions within the PSOE.  Although Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez defended Solbes by  stating that he had acted in a manner which "brings him credit," he  added that government pensions do not represent "a problem for today  or tomorrow."  Gonzalez reassured current pensioners that they were  well protected" and that there would always be decent government  retirement benefits for all citizens.  He also said that "problems  would not surface until the years 2020 or 2025" but governments  needed to prepare in advance for changes in Spanish demographics.  Socialist senator Juan Barranco stated, "this type of declaration  unfortunately makes the PSOE lose votes and creates uncertainty  among the citizenry."      This same article states that reaction from opposition groups was  "far more belligerent" than that from the PSOE.  People's Party (PP)  spokesman Rodrigo Rato demanded that Solbes appear before the  parliament to explain the government's position on social security  issues.  Rato characterized the finance minister's remarks as  "irresponsible" and criticized him for "scaring people."  According  to United Left (IU) Coordinator General Julio Anguita: "Solbes is  only stating the obvious.  There is not going to be enough growth in  employment to generate the necessary resources to be able to pay out  retirement pensions."  Additionally, Fernando Gimeno, coordinator of  the joint committee for the Office of the Controller of the  Currency, reproached Solbes by stating that "such declarations only  create uncertainty among people from lower income brackets who don't  have the money to contribute to pension plans."  Gimeno added that  the government was now working on reforming the taxation system for  government pensions and he thought it "unfortunate" that people were  trying to come up with scenarios for 15 years hence.      Responding to the criticisms, Solbes remarked that the government  would continue to guarantee pensions but reaffirmed that "it will be  necessary to review them" given the change in Spanish demographics.  Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra agreed, stating that in the  future the state system would guarantee a "decent pension."

The Labor Ministry plans to blur two  distinct categories which define workers as either "temporarily  incapacitated" or "temporarily disabled."  These definitions would  be combined into a single "temporary" category, paying benefits for  less than the current six years.  By reducing the time that someone  would spend on "temporary disability" before going on to be declared  "permanently disabled," the Labor Ministry hopes to return workers  to their jobs once they have overcome health problems so they do not  remain on disability for six years.  Funds would then be directed  exclusively to those who really need them.      The Labor Ministry also plans to establish teams, which would be  administered by doctors working for the Social Security system, to  evaluate disabled workers (EVI).  According to the article, the  doctors will introduce more rigorous standards for the evaluation  process to return employees more quickly to the work place.  These  doctors would also review pensions which are in force to determine  the status of disability benefits in the event that the worker  should recover.

Rivera,  reports that BBV President Emilio Ybarra announced during a  shareholders meeting that the bank was seriously considering the  purchase of a "significant" amount of shares of Banesto, Spain's  third largest bank and the subject of a Bank of Spain mandated  reorganization.  Ybarra did not specify if BBV would be the only  buyer or if other financial institutions would be involved but he  added that everything would depend on "the conditions of the sale."  He stated, "we are not going to be blinded by the zeal to be number  one nor will we close the doors to other competitors."  Ybarra noted  that it would be "interesting" to buy Banesto because such a move  would reinforce BBV's position of leadership.  He cautioned,  however, that BBV would not consider growth "at any cost."  He  stressed that BBV would only contemplate the purchase of shares if  it were deemed in the best interest of all shareholders.  Reportedly, shareholders were divided on the proposed takeover.  Ybarra also underscored that Banesto "would be worth zero were it  not for the support of all of the banks," adding that Banesto's  losses in 1993 will reach "over 50 billion pesetas."  He confirmed  that Alfredo Saenz, who was formerly vice chairman at BBV, would  continue as Banesto's chairman if the takeover occurs.  The article  reported that the Bank of Santander is BBV's "principal rival" in  the upcoming takeover bid for Banesto.  Because of their size these  two banks would make it difficult for smaller institutions to bid on  shares.

Jose Bevia, a Socialist and first vice president of  the Congress, stated that the committee was to be created with a  "basic agreement between Socialists and PP members."  Bevia was  pleased that a committee had been decided on because it ensures  public, open sessions, which the press will be able to attend.  The  special committee will be coordinated by three members from the PSOE  and PP respectively.  IU and Catalan Convergence and Union (CiU)  will each have two representatives.

AMS divides the labor market into  four sectors:  industry, construction, private services, and public  services.  The private services sector, which is the largest,  includes most service industry workers, such as bank and insurance  company employees and journalists.  The number of jobs in this  sector has fallen by 7-percent in the last three years and is  expected to continuing falling.  Unemployment is also expected to  increase in the construction sector, where 29 percent of the jobs  have been lost.  The public sector, which includes teachers and  health and child care providers, has seen a 7 percent drop in the  number of jobs.  This decrease is now expected to level off.  Only  in the industrial sector, made up mostly of blue-collar workers, is  an increase forecast.  The sector has, however, already lost 24  percent of its jobs, and AMS fears these jobs are now gone for good.

This is the conclusion of an assessment published in  the business weekly VECKANS AFFARER.  According to the assessment,  Volvo has "lost" the last four years, which its competitors have  used to conclude international partnerships.  Its credibility  damaged, Volvo is hardly in a position to seek new long-term  partners immediately.  Therefore, the most viable alternative is to  establish a series of limited partnerships for specific projects.  This strategy would reduce costs while retaining the company's  independence and reputation.  The assessment cites Volvo's agreement  with Mitsubishi to develop a new midsize car as a model for future  cooperation.  Under the agreement, Volvo will develop a successor to  its 400 model at greatly reduced cost while gaining access to  Japanese technology.  The Swedish firm also recently concluded an  agreement with Chrysler to build jeeps in Thailand.

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Old craft in a modern setting - Nick Garnett visits Brian Stack, who combines his culture with his business THE DINGLE Peninsula is the western terminus of Europe, the final outpost before you fall into the Gulf Stream. On a sunny day in April, the water is pastel blue and the Brandon mountains are capped in snow. An ordnance survey map reveals the strata of primitive cultures that once took root here: the weird beehive huts of early Christian hermits; the monastic life exposed by the lonely Gallarus oratory shaped like an upturned boat; the crooked Ogham stones of the late Iron Age on which the Celts chiselled a simple structure of angled lines as a written script. The area around the coastal town of Dingle is also a gaeltacht. It is one of 10 or so parcels of land in Ireland where the populations encapsulate a significant proportion of fluent Gaelic speakers. Special attention is cast on them, with the help of a Udaras (Gaelic for 'authority'), whose task includes funnelling cash to businesses. The regional manager for the Udaras in Dingle, Steve O Culain, says it is illegal to discriminate against businesses run by non-Gaelic speakers, but the Udaras clearly prefers using money in a way that bolsters Ireland's ancient language. One tiny company benefiting from operating in a gaeltacht is that of Brian Stack, jewellery-maker and jewellery-seller. But he benefits more from operating in a beautiful area popular with tourists. Visitors account for 65 per cent of Stack's total yearly sales of Pounds 180,000, largely because the 40-year-old has piggy-backed his business on two local attractions. One is the artefacts left by the Celts, such as the Ogham stones, high crosses and metalware. 'A lot of the interlace work in the seventh and eighth centuries was incredible,' says Stack. 'There is a theory that these workmen had proper workshops and a type of college system to learn crafts in gold, silver and stone.' Stack and his workshop reproduce miniature examples of Celtic art in gold and silver. The other attraction is Fungie, a dolphin which popped up in the sea off Dingle five years ago and has stayed ever since. Fungie has become an attraction for tourists, who also like Stack's gold and silver facsimiles of the cute cetacean. Stack did a seven-year jeweller's apprenticeship in Cork before working in Canada and building his own house in Dingle. He rented his first shop in Dingle in 1981, opened another outside the peninsula in the tourist haunt of Killarney, and then a workshop in Dingle. He has just moved the workshop to a new, larger building, with a shop attached, provided by the Udaras. About half the jewellery Stack sells is bought from other jewellery-makers, though he expects this proportion to drop. 'The margin on made-up jewellery we buy is about 100 per cent and a little more on the things we make, say, 130 per cent,' he says. The workshop and three retail outlets generated a profit last year of between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000. Stack employs three in the shops (and gets occasional help from his wife, Mairead, a teacher) and four apprentices. Training grants from the Udaras cover 60 per cent of apprentices' wages for the first year, and after that on a declining scale. The Udaras also forks out for 60 per cent of capital equipment. This includes Pounds 20,000 of casting machinery, bought because the economics of jewellery-making work against handcrafting. Much of Stack's own jewellery is handmade: gold and silver bent, soldered, cut and punched into shape. To lower the costs, more jewellery will now be made by casting. The rubber cast is taken by a handmade design, and wax injected into it. The wax pieces are fixed to a common stem and plaster is poured around that. The wax is removed by steam, and silver or gold poured into the mould - aA vacuum system sucks the metal into the mould's furthest corners. There is plenty of space for all this in the 155 sq metre premises, whose subsidised rent is about Pounds 1,200 a year, rising eventually to an unsubsidised rent of about Pounds 3,000. The casting equipment comes from the Isle of Wight, precious metal from Johnson Matthey in Dublin, and gemstones from London and Switzerland. Some of Stack's headaches are familiar to most owners of small businesses. 'We have built up gradually over ten years, which is a good thing, but my biggest problem is I never got management training of any description. That would have helped with things like controlling stock, forward planning, and understanding how to foresee demand.' Seasonal demand and the need to build up stocks every year for the summer tourist sales hurts cash flow. 'By the beginning of the next season, you are in a tight squeeze on that. We'll be producing more with the casting machines, so to counteract these new cash flow pressures we intend to take on work for other jewellers.' He intends reducing the number of different items the company makes. Stack uses a Pounds 20,000 overdraft from Allied Irish Bank. The troubles in the North still have a debilitating effect on tourism, and remain, for businessmen like Stack, a source of annoyance and bewilderment. 'It's the great tragedy of Ireland. It hampers everything, shifting all development right down the line. It's such a mess.' Like most of his fellow countrymen, Stack harbours a relatively genial disposition on life. 'I've been very lucky, thanks be to God.' Brian de Staic, Sraid an Doirin, An Daingean, Co Chiarrai, (Brian Stack, Green St, Dingle, Co Kerry) Republic of Ireland. 010-353-66-51298.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> SOUNDS FAMILIAR;  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY AIMS TO PLEASE, NOT TO CHALLENGE  </P> <P> The Pacific Symphony's five-concert summer series at the Irvine Meadows  Amphitheatre, which starts Wednesday, will focus on the tried-and-true, "very  popular classical music," in the words of Louis G. Spisto, the orchestra's  executive director.  </P> <P> The concerts have been organized around such "themes" as the opening "All  American Celebration" (Wednesday is July 4; there'll be fireworks); all-Mozart  and all-Beethoven programs July 21 and Aug. 18 respectively, an "Espana"  program Sept. 1 and the closing "Tchaikovsky Spectacular" Sept. 15. Conductors  are Evans Haile July 4; Toshiyuki Shimada July 21; Kate Tamarkin Aug. 18; Lucas  Richman, the Pacific's assistant conductor, Sept. 1; and Bruce Ferden Sept. 15.  </P> <P> "People like to feel, when coming to a summer venue, that they are there to  hear and experience music they already believe they will enjoy," Spisto says.  "They're not coming for new experiences."  </P> <P> "That's true for us and for Hollywood Bowl as well," he adds. "They want music  that is pleasant, pleasurable and to a large extent entertaining. We make no  excuse for the programs."  </P> <P> So far the strategy is a success. "Certainly the themes have helped sales,"  says Spisto, reporting 4,638 series subscriptions sold as of June 15 (last  summer, the orchestra sold fewer than 2,700). That translates into  approximately $570,000; reaching the summer budget figure of $600,000 should be  a piece of cake.  </P> <P> "It is very likely that we will be expanding in future seasons. But not next  year," Spisto says, striking another don't-rock-the-boat-type note. "We want to  have two to three seasons of a real solid base before we expand. One thing that  is clear about other orchestras which have gotten into trouble: When you expand  too fast, you wind up paying for it later. We're very happy with doing five  concerts."  </P> <P> What: The Pacific Symphony  </P> <P> When: Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. Series continues July 21, Aug. 18, Sept. 1 and 15.

The groupings, the  "Centric Bloc" consists of "dissidents" from former Premier  Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and  Slovak National Party (SNS): the Alliance of Slovak Democrats  (AD SR), led by former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko, the  Democratic Union of Slovakia (DUS) of current Premier Jozef  Moravcik and Cernak's NDS-NA. The centrists, who have seven  posts in Moravcik's eighteen-member cabinet, are holding a  constituent congress on Saturday [26 March]. "The NDS-NA's place  will be right of center of the political spectrum; it should  head towards the European Democratic Union," said Cernak, former  SNS chairman. The latest poll gives 1.3 percent for Cernak's  party, while the AD SR would receive 1.2 percent of votes.</p>

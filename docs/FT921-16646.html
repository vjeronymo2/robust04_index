			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Sudanese MPs to be appointed GENERAL Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese military leader said yesterday the authorities would appoint a transitional parliament in the next few days, Reuter reports from Khartoum. The general, who dissolved Sudan's elected parliament when he seized power in July 1989, said the appointed assembly should set a good example for a proposed elected assembly. The Sudanese military junta has previously resisted calls for a return to government under a civilian constitution and Gen Bashir has said he will never allow political parties. The military leaders were thought to favour 'popular congresses' along the Libyan model, where local councils send delegates to a national congress similar to a conventional parliament. Gen Bashir, in an Independence Day speech in the town of Abu Hamad, 280 miles north of Khartoum, said the appointed assembly would be able to propose and pass legislation, vet decrees by the ruling Revolution Command Council and ratify treates and agreements with other countries. He implicitly welcomed the success of the Islamic movement in Algerian elections last week, saying the Algerian government had been wise to let Algerians choose freely.</p>

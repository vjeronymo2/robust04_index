			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Bonn likely to be site of European central bank GERMANY looks almost certain to be chosen as the home for the planned European central bank after the European Community summit in Lisbon at the weekend. Ten of its EC partners agreed, under a plan put forward by the Portuguese presidency, that Bonn could be the site of the Bank and its planned forerunner, the European Monetary Institute. However, the plan foundered on Britain's opposition. Mr John Major killed an agreement by saying the UK was not prepared to decide on the bank's site now. The UK still hopes that the bank's foreign exchange operating arm will be based in London, British officials have indicated privately. But a Portuguese minister said Britain knew this was not possible, given the UK's Maastricht treaty reservation about joining the final stage of economic and monetary union. The summit endorsed the need to ratify the Maastricht union treaty after the reverse it suffered in the Danish referendum. The summit also agreed to settle by December the question of future EC financing, after an acrimonious debate in Lisbon that ended in deadlock because of conflicting interests of northern and southern EC states. EC leaders agreed that negotiations to take applicant countries from the European Free Trade Association (Efta) could start immediately the goals of a budget deal and ratification of Maastricht were reached. On the European Central Bank, Germany said it would prefer Frankfurt to be its home, but it could accept the choice of Bonn if its partners wanted to prevent the bank's presence making one of Europe's main financial marketplaces dominant. The vexed issue of where to site the bank and nearly a dozen other planned EC institutions, which have still to find a home, was discussed over a late dinner on Friday night by EC leaders. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's prime minister, who put forward the compromise, said: 'We have never been so close to a solution (on EC institutions' sites) as this'. Four previous EC summits have ducked the issue. But it has been given urgency by the Maastricht treaty commitment to agree a site for the institute - and, by implication, for the central bank - by the end of this year. President Francois Mitterrand of France apparently agreed to the Bonn compromise, as did Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch premier, who had been pushing the rival site of Amsterdam. Decisions on siting other EC institutions is far more confused. Because of uncertainty about Denmark's eventual place in the Community, Portugal switched the planned EC environmental agency away from Copenhagen to Madrid. This prompted changes in the institutions being offered to other EC states. But it was a measure of the air of compromise in Lisbon that France and Belgium seemed close to settling the EC's longest-running institutional war  -to decide whether the French city of Strasbourg or Brussels, the Belgian capital, should be the permanent home of the European Parliament. Portugal has suggested that Strasbourg should continue to host a minimum of 12 plenary sessions of the parliament, but that members of the European Parliament could hold up to five 'extraordinary' full sessions in Brussels.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Angolan opposition will soon have a new party.  It is the CDA, Angolan Democratic Confederation. The party,  which is still making arrangements for registration with the  Supreme Tribunal, has said the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola and the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] cannot be the only political  parties in the country. Gaspar Neto, chairman of the CDA's  constituent commission, felt indignant when he said:    [Begin Neto recording] The Angolan problem will not be  resolved by only those two political forces. [end recording]    Gaspar Neto is a man of few words but feels distressed with  the crisis that has brought the country to its knees. He did  not announce an immediate solution to the country's problems,  but said nobody should be in power for ever.    [Begin Neto recording] Parties cannot aspire to power the  moment they come into being. We will learn from Angolan and  international experiences. At the right moment we will disclose  to Angola and the world the CDA's plans to gain power. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Santander acquires City property GRUPO SANTANDER, the Spanish banking and financial services holding, aims to spend up to Pounds 100m (Dollars 151m) on City of London property as part of a strategy to diversify its business interests and build up profit centres outside Spain. Santander said yesterday it had spent some Pounds 18m to acquire D'Arcy House at 146 Queen Victoria Street and a further Pounds 13.75m to buy 1 Bishopsgate, the London headquarters of Fidelity Bank. It is in the final stages of purchasing a third property close to St Paul's Cathedral for about Pounds 20m. A spokesman for the group said acquisitions, which mark Santander's first move into real estate, would continue in the City and with an investment ceiling of Pounds 100m. 'London has been preferred to other centres because of the profitability of its property market,' he said. Santander's business diversification strategy was underlined last month when it announced a Pounds 400m joint venture with British Telecommunications to develop data transmission services in Spain. Mr Emilio Botin, the Santander chairman, told shareholders earlier this year that he aimed to increase the group's presence abroad and wished to raise the proportion of the group's net profits earned outside Spain from a present level of just over 30 per cent to 50 per cent.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / South African Referendum: Vote heralds rapidaccord on interim government - Timetable to multiracial cabinet AGREEMENT on a multiracial interim government should be achieved rapidly by South Africa's constitutional negotiating forum, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). Codesa has yet to agree and there are many issues still to be negotiated, but a three-phase plan has already emerged from the bilateral talks between the two main participants, the government and the African National Congress (ANC). Their proposal is as follows: By the end of next month, Codesa could announce an agreement on interim government. The existing tricameral parliament, which includes separate houses for whites, coloureds and Indians, must then give the agreement legal force. A multiracial Interim Government Council could be established by June, appointed by the 19 parties and groups represented at Codesa. The council would likely hold veto powers over the country's existing cabinet, though this has yet to be agreed. Independent commissions would be established to oversee the public media and preparations for elections. Four multi-party committees would oversee foreign affairs, security, local government and the budget. The tricameral parliament would continue to sit while multiracial legislative elections were prepared. By at least mid-1993, elections would be held for a multiracial interim legislature that would draft a new constitution. The interim legislature would probably comprise only a single legislative chamber instead of the two originally insisted on by the currently ruling National Party. Seats would be allocated by proportional representation, with decisions on the constitution requiring a two-thirds majority. By mid-year, the Interim Government Council would be replaced by a new cabinet representing, on a roughly proportional basis, the parties elected to the legislature. The National Party has proposed that parties pass a 15 per cent threshold for representation in the cabinet, but this, as it would exclude everyone but the ANC and National Party, will be resisted in Codesa. Cabinet decisions would be taken by consensus; the National Party wants the presidency to be held in rotation by different parties. The new constitution would be agreed by mid-1994. Multi-party power-sharing, either entrenched in the constitution or agreed informally, would continue for at least five years, with decisions agreed by consensus. It is not clear whether there is agreement for a rotating presidency or for a single elected president. Regional elections would be held to regional legislatures. The National Party wants each party represented in the regional assemblies to be allocated an equal number of seats for that region in the upper house envisaged for the new national legislature that will follow the interim arrangements. This would give minority parties a disproportionately large influence in the upper house, a measure that has not been agreed by the ANC, which has assented only to strong regional government. The National Party hopes that the long period of consensus government will mean that the consensus principle will survive even after full majority rule is achieved by the end of the century.</p>

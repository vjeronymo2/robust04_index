			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Valuable junk: Saleroom THE cargo of an Asian trading junk, which sank 100 miles off the coast of Vietnam in the 1690s, is to be offered at Christie's in Amsterdam in April. It consists of about 28,000 pieces of porcelain produced in China for the European market. Christie's expects to raise Pounds 1.5m from the auction. Most of the money will go to the Vietnam Salvage Corporation, an agency owned by the Vietnam government, which asked Christie's to dispose of the porcelain. Hallstrom Oceanics, a Swedish underwater services company which handled the excavation, is also a beneficiary. The porcelain is of no great historic or aesthetic value but there is keen collector interest in items recovered from the seabed. In 1986 Christie's brought in Pounds 10m from the Nanking Cargo, more than 150,000 pieces of export porcelain, plus gold bars, recovered from a Dutch East Indiaman which sank near Singapore in the 1740s. This caught the public imagination and attracted enthusiastic bidding. Christie's is marketing the new find, dubbed the Vung Tau Cargo after the nearest Vietnamese province to the wreck, by dividing the hoard into small groups of plates, jars, and bowls. Many are estimated at a few hundred pounds a lot, to attract private collectors. One problem is that American dealers and private buyers are, in theory, prevented from importing items of Vietnamese origin. Unlike the Nanking cargo, the Vung Tau porcelain was acquired for decoration rather than use. It was bought by the middle classes of Amsterdam, London, and Paris - and by King William and Queen Mary for Hampton Court.</p>

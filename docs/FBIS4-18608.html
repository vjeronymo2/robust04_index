			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 6 (AFP) -- The European Commission  Wednesday [6 April] decided to take Greece before the European  Court of Justice for imposing a blockade on its neighbour  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  in a dispute over its name.    European External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek  said the decision was taken in the belief that the February 16  trade blockade breached EU [European Union] rules, which provide  for free trade between members and third parties.    The case will begin in Luxembourg on April 13, Van den Broek  told a press conference here.    Greece disputes Skopje's right to call itself Macedonia,  which it says implies territorial designs on the neighbouring  Greek province of the same name.    Athens imposed the blockade, by preventing Macedonia-bound  goods passing through the northern Greek port of Salonika, after  a large number of countries recognized Skopje under the name The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.    Greece has justified its action by citing Article 224 of the  European Union Treaty, saying that its security is under threat.  The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is the guardian  of the Treaty.    Calls for Greece to be taken before the European Court of  Justice have been opposed by some for political reasons: Athens  currently holds the six-month EU presidency.    Van den Broek said here Wednesday that Athens had been asked  to resume discussions with Skopje to try to resolve the dispute.</p>

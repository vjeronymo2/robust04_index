			<p>BFN     [Text] Twenty-four hours ago, the cabinet approved a law  setting out the military plans for the next six years. Defense  Minister Francois Leotard has now given more details on the  French Army's equipment. The priority will be the modernization  of weapons, nuclear and nonnuclear weapons. Francois Leotard  was interviewed by Frederique Barrere:    [Begin Leotard recording] Modernizing our forces  means, of course, keeping our nuclear dissuasion for ever. The  law provides 130 billion francs to preserve and renew our  nuclear capacity. So, we have decided to continue our efforts  as far as the M5 missile is concerned. It will start to be used  in the year 2010, not in 2005. We will continue the program  concerning four SSBNs of the new generation. The basic weapons  we need are taken in due consideration: Leclerc tanks, the Tigre  helicopter, the nuclear aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle --  which will be operational by mid-1999 with its flotilla of naval  version Rafale interceptor- planes . The Air Force will also  have Mirage 2000D; as you know the first planes of this kind are  being used in Bosnia-Herzegovina now. Lastly, in line with our  crisis-management strategy, we will start a program for  long-range precision weapons which should be completed by 2001.  [end recording]</p>

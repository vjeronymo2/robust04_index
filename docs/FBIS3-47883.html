			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Review of Defense Outline With Broad Vision </F> Urged]    [Text] Is it proper to expand our activities and begin  dealing with new tasks in addition to what we have been doing?  It would be a lie if we said we did not feel that way.  However, reviewing the outline of the defense plan has been a  pending issue since the end of the cold war. We would like to  welcome the willingness Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  expressed at his New Year's press conference.    The prime minister explained his idea to begin reviewing the  outline one year earlier than the Defense Agency's schedule, and  thus complete it during fiscal 1994. Because of this, it is  said an advisory organization originally scheduled to be placed  under the jurisdiction of the Defense Agency's director general  will become an advisory body to the prime minister.    It is a major political task to determine Japan's ideal  future defense in line with a new ideology. It can be said that  since the prime minister explained his intention to tackle the  issue himself, that proves he accurately understands the  importance of the new task.    The outline of the current defense plan was formed under the  Miki cabinet in 1976 as a guideline for building up the nation's  defense capability when the cold war between East and West was  moving toward detente. Its goal was to "single-handedly and  effectively deal with limited and small-scale invasions." It  was prepared on an idea called "improvement of fundamental  defense capability."    It is said the outline is not designed to deal with threats.  However, due to the escalation of confrontation between the  United States and the Soviet Union during the 1980's, the  outline actually strengthened Japan's defense capability in  dealing with threats, mainly "potential threats from the Soviet  Union."    Following the 1989 conclusion of the cold war, the Soviet  Union collapsed in 1991, and the structure of East-West  confrontation disappeared. Of late, a new source of  apprehension is Russian rightists coming into existence.  However, it is probably a political phenomenon. It does not  mean Russia has begun reconstructing the strong military power  of the former Soviet Union. Moreover, the Russian economy is so  weak that Russia is unable to abruptly rebuild a strong military  power even if it wanted to.    If aforesaid views are true, then we can say the military  threat has been reduced remarkably. Nevertheless, the Japanese  Government so far has been delaying the process of reviewing its  defense outline. We feel the government is trying to find a new  threat.    The DPRK's nuclear weapons project and its development of  the  Nodong-1 missile, which can be used to attack Japan, are indeed  causes of anxiety. We may also need to keep our eyes on the  modernization of Chinese naval force. It seems the frequent  occurrence of regional conflicts will continue in the future.  However, it is not a good idea to fuss over these issues, saying  they are major threats.    On the contrary, we think the quality of the threats has  changed. The new world order which will take the place of the  cold war is still unclear, and a sense of fear and uncertainly  is growing. How we deal with these matters should be the basis  of the new defense outline.    To do this, military streamlining alone is not enough. As  the prime minister said, Japan needs to "voluntarily lead the  disarmament movement." This is the only way we can clearly show  Asia that Japan does not intend to become a major military  power, or will not use military power to back its diplomacy.    Defense authorities have strengthened their idea to use a  plan designed to reduce the full number of Self-Defense Forces  [SDF] personnel from 180,000 to 150,000 as an answer to the  "voluntary disarmament." However, the SDF has never maintained  180,000 members. Currently, it has only 153,000 personnel.    Direct invasion by a foreign enemy is unlikely. Civil war is  beyond imagination. We urge the government to seriously study  the possibility of forming a UN cooperation team by venturing to  reduce the scale of the Ground Self-Defense Forc.    The new outline should serve as a guideline for building  Japan's defense capability. At the same time, it should also  become Japan's message to the world. In this sense, rather than  relying on the knowledge of specialists, the government must  study a new defense doctrine from broad perspectives, taking  Japanese common sense into consideration.</p>

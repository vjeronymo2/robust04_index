			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Bang Nielsen: "NATO Against Cut Plans"] </F>   [Text] NATO will stand fast at its present strength and not  undertake additional military cutbacks, according to a statement  that NATO's defense ministers adopted at a meeting yesterday.  This goes dead against the Danish Government's plans to reduce  Danish military expenditures in the next defense agreement by  around 5 percent, an amount corresponding to 750 million kroner.    Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup (SDP [Social Democratic  Party]) does not see any problem with the Danish military  cutbacks, however. "Denmark, in comparison to a number of other  NATO countries, has cut relatively little over the past few  years, and when we measure in defense expenditures per capita,  Denmark is doing fine."    In the press release from NATO, it states that the  organization in "an uncertain world must preserve its military  strength and capabilities, so the alliance can fulfill its  missions." At the same time it was emphasized that NATO's new  peackeeping role places increased demands.</p>

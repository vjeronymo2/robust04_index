			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Kohl: Germany Is Heading Toward a </F> Good Future"]    [Text] Chancellor Helmut Kohl continues to note an  economic upturn in the new laender. "The things that have been  already achieved here over the past three years have not even  started in other areas," he said at an East Thuringia regional  conference in Gera. "The GNP in eastern Germany has increased  by over 7 percent since 1993, in Thuringia itself it has even  increased by a double figure."    According to Kohl, private and public investments in eastern  Germany in 1994 will probably rise to 160 million marks, a level  of investments that was not even reached during the so-called  economic miracle years. Germany is heading toward a good  future, said Kohl. The size of unemployment is still dramatic,  therefore all efforts will be be made to guarantee growth and  employment opportunities. In Gera itself, a new Benefits  Department of the Federal Insurance Fund for Office Employees  will be set up, with 1,000 jobs.    Earlier on, Thuringian Minister-President Bernhard Vogel had  pointed out the difficult situation in East Thuringia. "Nowhere  else in the world has uranium ore extraction caused such damage  as here," he said. Federal Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt  promised further support for the restructuring of the region.  The general redevelopment of Saxony and Thuringia will last up  to 15 years and cost about 13 million marks, he said. But the  federal enterprise Wismut GmbH also represent a major economic  factor, he said. The uranium ore extraction areas are  developing into model areas for environmental and redevelopment  technology.</p>

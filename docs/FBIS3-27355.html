According to the "PEOPLE'S DAILY" [RENMIN RIBAO] (overseas  edition) today, the feasibility study of the second phase of the  project at Aoshan has passed a technical appraisal.    With an investment of 29.96 million U.S. dollars, the phase  consists of oil tanks, with a combined storage capacity of  500,000 cu m, and supportive facilities.    The base will have an annual handling capacity of more than  10 million tons upon completion.    Zhoushan is a harbor with a lengthy coastline suitable for  building docks; along 164 km the water is as deep as 10 m. It  has a 1,000-sq-km inshore area, about the same size as that of  Rotterdam Harbor in the Netherlands.    The paper noted that the Zhoushan City Government has  decided  to develop the port with foreign investment and cooperation.    At present, Zhoushan is speeding up the construction of  infrastructure facilities to pave the way for the overall  development of the port. An airport is expected to open to  domestic routes in 1995, the paper reported.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL APPROVES NEW CITY POLICY ON  AIDS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee Monday approved a proposed new AIDS policy  that officials say is the most comprehensive urban blueprint in the nation for  dealing with the fatal disease.  </P> <P> The 40-page document was approved by the Arts, Health and Humanities Committee.  </P> <P> Two other committees must review sections of the document before it can be sent  to the full City Council for final approval.  </P> <P> The policy guarantees city workers infected with acquired immune deficiency  syndrome the right to confidentiality and bars city employees from refusing to  work with others who have AIDS, or the human immunodeficiency virus that  triggers AIDS.  </P> <P> The policy also formalizes existing city AIDS programs, including the  distribution of AIDS prevention kits, which contain condoms and printed  information about the disease.  </P></p>

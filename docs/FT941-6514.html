			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kmart slips further into the red in final quarter Kmart, the US retailing group that ranks as the world's second biggest, has ended a dismal year by reporting after-tax losses of more than Dollars 1bn for the fourth quarter to January. Its shares, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 19 1/8 in early trading, closed unchanged at Dollars 19, near their 12-month low. Net losses of Dollars 1.19bn for the quarter, compared with net profits of Dollars 535m last time. For the year, Kmart reported net losses of Dollars 974m, against net profits of Dollars 941m last time on sales of Dollars 34.2bn, against Dollars 31bn. A big factor in both sets of figures was a pre-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 1.3bn announced two months ago. However, the company acknowledged that the main reason for the poor financial performance in the quarter and the year was an erosion in its gross margin to 24.9 per cent, from 26.5 per cent last year, caused by the highly competitive conditions in the retail market. During the year, Kmart moved to counter five previous years of stagnant earnings by embarking on a radical restructuring. It sold its loss-making Pace Membership Warehouse and PayLess Drug Stores chains, announced an extensive relocation of its discount stores, embarked on the rapid expansion of its new Super Kmart format, and prepared to sell minority stakes in its specialty retailing operations. The shares have responded poorly to the moves because the market is not yet convinced that Kmart has found a formula that will restore earnings growth. It is suffering tough competition in a saturated market, particularly from its bigger rival Wal-Mart. Kmart said yesterday that if continuing operations were split from discontinued operations and all the restructuring provisions were stripped out, it would have reported net income of Dollars 534m for the full year. However, this would still have represented a decline from Dollars 882m the previous year on the same basis. In the fourth quarter, sales rose to Dollars 10.27bn from Dollars 9.44bn excluding the discontinued operations. Excluding the restructuring provision and other non-recurring charges, net income from continuing operations fell to Dollars 247m from Dollars 501m, or to 53 cents a share from Dollars 1.07. After all charges, the net losses of Dollars 1.19bn translated into losses of Dollars 2.61 a share, compared with earnings per share of Dollars 1.15 last time.</p>

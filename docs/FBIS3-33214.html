			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by William Melendez; from the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria  said today that the government continues its efforts to get the  country removed from the UN permanent supervision list in  connection with the human rights situation.    The foreign affairs minister believes that the situation  with  respect to human rights has changed substantially since signing  the peace agreements, which generated a series of changes.  Salaverria says that following that improvement in the  protection of the right to life the government continues making  efforts to be removed from the UN list.    [Begin Salaverria recording] We will not see El Salvador's  removal from the list until the end of February or the beginning  of March. The human rights commission meeting lasts five  months. [end recording]    Salaverria admitted that there are still after effects of  the  war that show up as violent acts, but they are of a criminal  nature. The minister says that the removal of El Salvador from  the list following the observations by Pedro Nikken, independent  human rights expert sent by the United Nations, is possible with  the strengthening of institutions such as the Human Rights  Ombudsman.    [Begin Salaverria recording] We must strengthen our own  institutions. We have a human rights ombudsman; we a have human  rights prosecutor. They are strengthening their offices, and  they are strengthening their techniques. We hope that one day  there will not be a need for international observation. [end  recording]    The minister said that although results on the efforts to  place the country in a new stage regarding respect for human  rights are still not known, several UN member countries have  expressed their support for the initiative.</p>

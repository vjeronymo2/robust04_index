			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Jennings Group agrees debt for equity swap JENNINGS Group, Australia's largest homebuilder, yesterday said it had reached agreement with its banks and its biggest shareholder on a debt for equity swap to strengthen its balance sheet. The group said the deal would eliminate a ADollars 195m (USDollars 141.3m) deficit on shareholder funds which developed as a result of its exposure to falling asset values in the Australian property market. Jennings said Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand construction, forestry and energy group which owns 48 per cent of the company's stock, had agreed to convert ADollars 152m of debt to ordinary shares. Fletcher Challenge would hold 43 per cent of the reconstructed company. Jennings' banks would take a 39 per cent stake in return for the conversion of ADollars 58m of secured debt into ordinary shares and the capitalisation of about ADollars 5m in interest into equity. Jennings shares closed unchanged at 15 cents on the Australian Stock Exchange, compared with an all-time low of 10 cents last month. The company said its core Australian housing business was performing 'very satisfactorily'. The group said sales over the seven months to July were up by 8 per cent to ADollars 306m.</p>

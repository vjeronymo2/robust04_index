			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Michel Marlaud, French ambassador to </F> Rwanda, by Christophe Boisbouvier in Kigali on 11 April --  recorded]    [Text] [Marlaud] We have evacuated 617 expatriates so far.  This is last night's figure. Another 89 were evacuated this  morning, and a third convoy is on its way to the airport.    [Boisbouvier] Are these expatriates of different  nationalities?    [Marlaud] They are of different nationalities. Of course,  most of them are French nationals, but there are also Belgians,  Canadians, nationals from Oman, Indians, nationals from  Mauritius, several nationalities including, of course, nationals  from almost all European Union countries such as Greeks and  Germans, a wide- ranging number of nationalities.    [Boisbouvier] What about the numerous Belgians who are still  here?    [Marlaud] The Belgians have now arrived in Kigali. As far as  we are concerned, we will continue to include Belgian nationals  in our evacuation plan. There is a significant number of  Belgian nationals in the convoy which is on its way to the  airport. I believe that the Belgians who are arriving will  gradually take care of their own nationals.    [Boisbouvier] Will any French nationals be left in Rwanda  after the evacuations?    [Marlaud] There is a number of French nationals who, if need  be, could decide to stay in Rwanda although the Foreign Ministry  has strongly encouraged our nationals to leave this country, but  we cannot compel those who do not want to leave to do so.    [Boisbouvier] Have you got an example?    [Marlaud] There are a number of priests and nuns who  sometimes refuse to be evacuated despite our advice and despite  the help we are ready to give them. Moreover, the embassy  remains open for the time being.    [Boisbouvier] Do you intend to evacuate all diplomatic staff  at the end of the evacuation operation?    [Marlaud] The embassy is open for the time being. As long as  no other decision is made, it will remain open.    [Boisbouvier] What is the mission of the French force in  Kigali now? Is it only to carry out the evacuation, or is it  also to maintain order at the airport and in other sensitive  zones?    [Marlaud] The mission of the French forces is to ensure the  safety of French nationals and other nationals who wish to leave  Rwanda.    [Boisbouviere] Nothing else?    [Marlaud] This is the mission that was given to them. I  believe that this was said in Paris quite clearly.    [Boisbouvier] Did many French nationals die?    [Marlaud] Well, apart from the crew of the presidential  plane, one death has been confirmed.    [Boisbouvier] That of a white father in southern Rwanda?    [Marlaud] Yes, but please allow me not to give too many  details because I am always wary of the closest relatives  hearing about it before they have been told directly. I would  rather not elaborate.    [Boisbouvier] There has been talk of a cease-fire in the  country between the government and the Rwanda Patriotic Front  [RPF] rebels, for 24 hours. What is the situation this Monday  at noon?    [Marlaud] There are still on-going talks between the  government and the RPF. The UN Mission in Rwanda is acting as a  go-between. No agreement on a cease-fire has been reached so far.    [Boisbouvier] Do you think that it will be possible to reach  an agreement over the next few hours, given the conditions  demanded by the two sides?    [Marlaud] The Rwandan government called for a cease-fire  right away. So far, the RPF has rejected it. It remains to be  seen whether the RPF will finally agree to this cease-fire  throughout the country.    [Boisbouvier] The Rwandan government, which was appointed a  few days ago, has been denounced by some as a government with a  hard line against the RPF. What do you think about that?    [Marlaud] As far as the replacement of President Habyarimana  is concerned, the new interim head of state is the former  speaker of the National Assembly. This is in keeping with the  provisions of the former Rwandan constitution and with the  provisions of the Arusha agreement. The sharing out of  ministries and ministerial posts between the political parties  has remained the same as it was as far as the sharing out of  power provided for by the Arusha agreements is concerned. As  for the political balance of power within this government,  everybody can judge it differently.    [Boisbouvier] If there is a cease-fire tomorrow, do you  think  that a political agreement in the spirit of the Arusha  agreements is still possible after all that has happened over  the last few days?    [Marlaud] What is certain is that there is no solution to  Rwanda's problems if there is no reconciliation, if people are  not able to work and live together. The Arusha agreements were  an effort in that direction and it is the only way out of the  Rwandan crisis.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The U.S. Forces in Japan  have informed Tokyo that they have "fiscal problems" in paying  their share of court-ordered compensation totaling hundreds of  million yen to residents near a U.S. air base suffering from jet  noise, government officials said Friday [27 May].    Under the bilateral status of forces agreement, the U.S.  Forces are required to cover 75 percent of compensation  payments, while the Japanese Government covers the remaining 25  percent.    The Defense Facilities Administration Agency and the Foreign  Ministry will soon launch negotiations with the U.S. Forces on  how to deal with Washington's fiscal constraints, the officials  said.    In February last year, the Supreme Court dismissed demands  by  residents near Yokota Air Base in Tokyo for banning night and  early morning flights there, but awarded them 112 million yen in  compensation for noise pollution in the past, upholding two  lower court decisions.    Tokyo, after having paid 160 million yen, including  interest,  to some 128 Yokota residents by last December, asked the U.S.  Forces in March to refund their share of the sum, a demand which  was rejected.    On March 30 this year the Tokyo High Court, in another  Yokota  lawsuit, again rejected a ban on night flights but ordered the  government to pay 724 million yen in compensation, including  interest, to 596 residents near the base, acknowledging that the  jet noise inconvenienced them. Both residents and the  government accepted the ruling in April.    Tokyo will soon urge the U.S. to shoulder its part of the  burden for this case too, the officials said. They said the  U.S. refusal to pay might be related to anticipated further  compensation payments to noise victims near Atsugi Air Base in  Kanagawa Prefecture.    The Supreme Court, having created a precedent with its  Yokota  ruling, in February last year ordered the Tokyo High Court,  which had turned down compensation claims by Atsugi residents,  to hold a retrial over the issue.</p>

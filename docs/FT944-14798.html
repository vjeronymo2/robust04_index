			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Higher exports boost September car production Car production rose 7.8 per cent in September to 125,138, the highest level for the month for 21 years, as output was boosted by higher exports, Kevin Done writes. Production for export rose by 17.9 per cent year-on-year to 55,136, while output for the domestic market rose only 1.1 per cent to 70,002. Car production in the first nine months of the year rose 3 per cent to 1,075,001, but the growth has accelerated in the past four months. Export production in the first nine months rose 6.1 per cent to 418,134. Export growth has come from Rover as well as from Honda and Toyota, which are both developing new car plants in the UK with about three-quarters of production earmarked for export. Production of commercial vehicles in September rose 15 per cent year-on-year to 20,763.</p>

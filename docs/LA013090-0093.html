			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CURRIE LEADS MASTER CHORALE AT MUSIC CENTER  </P> <P> John Currie may be a lame duck, but he's not going to roll over and play dead.  Sunday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Music Center, the  departing music director of the Los Angeles Master Chorale, abetted by a solid  quartet of soloists and a well-chosen program, led persuasive, spirited  performances -- perhaps to prove the point.  </P> <P> The first half of the concert featured the premiere of a revised version of  "Mid-Winter Songs on Poems by Robert Graves" by the USC-based composer Morten  Lauridsen.  </P> <P> This elegant and engaging setting of five "winter" poems by the English writer  is firmly in the American tradition. The spacious orchestration, jazz rhythms,  widely spaced harmonies peppered with sevenths and ninths and intricate, sinewy  counterpoint are recognizable points of reference.  </P> <P> Its ready accessibility is not derived from its sources, however, but from the  direct and effective setting of the words, the use of brief, unifying melodic  fragments and the evocative backdrop provided by the orchestra. Currie led a  dramatically shaped and technically competent performance.  </P> <P> He concluded the program with Haydn's "Mass in Time of War," a work whose  joyousness belies its title. The Master Chorale captured its full exuberance  with a big, bright, well-balanced sound and emphatic phrasing. The solo quartet  -- soprano Cynthia Westphal Johnson, mezzo Paula Rasmussen, tenor Bruce  Johnson, baritone Peter Van Derick -- were particularly well-matched, and  provided serene, mellifluous contrast. The orchestra supported with vitality,  though it occasionally lagged.  </P> <P> The concert began with a sprightly, rough-hewn account of the brief  "Magnificat" attributed to, but not unquestionably by, Pergolesi.TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

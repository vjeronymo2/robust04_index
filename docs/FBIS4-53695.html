			<p>BFN     [Text] Utsunomiya, May 21 KYODO -- The leader of new party  Sakigake [Harbinger], a 15-member opposition group in the House  of Representatives, criticized chief coalition strategist Ichiro  Ozawa on Saturday [21 May] of trying to turn the country into a  major military power.    In a speech in Utsunomiya, some 110 kilometers north of  Tokyo, Masayoshi Takemura said he was opposed to Ozawa's  argument for turning Japan into what Ozawa calls an "ordinary  country."    When Ozawa says "ordinary country," he means one which owns  a  military commensurate with its economic capability and assumes  responsibility jointly with the United States for troubles in  the world, Takemura said.    Takemura, who served as chief cabinet secretary until late  last month in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, said his party will never follow the path toward such  a military power.    Takemura said Japan should make international contributions  in such nonmilitary fields as environmental protection,  north-south issues, aids and narcotics.    Ozawa is regarded as the de facto leader of the ruling  coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which is  nominally headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    While Ozawa calls for changing Japan into an "ordinary  country," Takemura has proposed the nation be a "small but  twinkling country."    Many political analysts say differences between Ozawa and  Takemura represented the underlying cause for the breakup of the  Hosokawa cabinet.    Takemura's Sakigake did not send any member to the Hata  cabinet, but has vowed to back it up from the outside of the  cabinet until the fiscal 1994 budget passes through the Diet.</p>

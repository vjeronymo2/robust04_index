			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "The Veto Proves the Cabinet's </F> Weakness"]    [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has been warning for the  past one-and-a-half months that the austerity measures should be  aimed at solving the current problems of the country and warns  that these steps should not create new and greater problems.    It seems the government did not take these warnings too  seriously and went ahead to implement certain measures with the  potential of creating social disorder in an already volatile  society.    Demirel has been urging the leaders all along not to take  excessive measures like closing down factories and other state  facilities, which will only serve to increase the jobless rate  in Turkey and sow the seeds of social upheaval. The president  is aware that some sensible austerity measures are needed but  sees that this should not create social discord in the society.  If the price of immediate economic salvation is social unrest  then the president says we have to accept the fact that the  austerity measures can be delayed or can be implemented at a  slower pace to avert a crisis which could eventually turn into  political turbulence.    This is one of the reasons why the president on Wednesday  vetoed the bill which was designed to sell off all residential  accommodation and social facilities owned by the government.  This would have meant the accommodation provided for civil  servants at highly reduced rates being taken away from them and  being sold by the State to the public to earn money.... The  president felt the loss to the country because the anger and  social unrest created by the sale of the homes for civil  servants would far exceed the revenue of 100 trillion Turkish  lira expected from the sale of these accommodations to the  public. The president says civil servants cannot afford current  rents but, with their meager salaries, can only afford low-rent  State accommodation. The loss of these privileges would create  deep resentment among civil servants and this is the last thing  the country needs at the moment.    Both Demirel and Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk  share  the view that social unrest has to be avoided at all costs,  because once the people take to the streets it will be very hard  to convince them to return to their homes. One leading state  official, who asked not to be named, told the TURKISH DAILY  NEWS: "If these trends continue and the workers as well as the  civil servants spill into the streets none of us would be able  to face them any more." This is clearly what Demirel sees on  the horizon and is set to avert.    So Demirel did his duty and took the appropriate decision to  veto the bill. When he did so, the coalition partners, instead  of feeling betrayed or voicing some kind of criticism, seemed to  bow to the verdict and reacted in a positive manner. Deputy  Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, the leader of the Social  Democrat People's Party (SHP), was quick to say there were  several clauses in the bill which they felt were defective and  that the veto gave them the opportunity to correct these  mistakes.... True Path Party (DYP) spokesman Hasan Peker said  the president had given the government the opportunity to make  amends.    This is a rather odd situation. If the two parties governing  Turkey jointly felt the law was defective then why didn't they  try to correct their mistakes in the Parliament, and why did  they simply allow such a bill to clear the house?    This is a government which cannot even defend its own  legislation. The entire episode demonstrates the incompetence  and weakness of the coalition administration. Turkey clearly  does not deserve this.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Amcor acquires UK corrugated box maker Amcor, the Australian paper group, has bought the 51 per cent interest which it did not own in Willander Holdings, the UK-based corrugated box manufacturer. The UK company was originally privately owned by three partners. Amcor acquired a 49 per cent interest in March 1991, and has subsequently expanded operations significantly - adding a second corrugator at its Coalville plant in 1993. Amcor did not disclose details of the latest purchase, but said its total investment was around ADollars 40m (USDollars 30.7m). Edels Music, the New South Wales-based music group, has made an 11th-hour bid to acquire Brash Holdings, the Australian electronic goods retailer which called in the administrators last month. Last week, the administrators announced the planned sale of Brash's main assets to companies associated with Mr Ong Beng Seng, the Singaporean businessman, although creditors have yet to give final approval. Edels said its deal would give creditors a higher return than the earlier offer.</p>

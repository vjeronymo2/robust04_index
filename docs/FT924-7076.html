			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Capital down at Pounds 8.84m CAPITAL RADIO, the London commercial music station, saw pre-tax profits fall 9 per cent from Pounds 9.84m to Pounds 8.84m for the year to end-September. Mr Ian Irvine, chairman, said a difficult year had reflected the continuing depressed state of the economy and a very short term advertising market. However, costs and turnover had been held and the fall in profit had mainly been the result of extra promotion costs. Mr Richard Eyre, who joined as managing director last December, also emphasised that Capital's weekly audience reach had increased in almost all social groups despite growing competition. For all adults in London it grew from 39.7 per cent in October-December 1990 to 43.9 per cent in April-June 1992. The balance sheet remained strong with cash balances of Pounds 19.5m and no borrowings. Earnings per share fell 7 per cent from 9.4p to 8.7p but the total dividend stays at 5.25p with a final of 3.5p. A priority this year was to push up commercial radio's advertising share from its present total of just over 2 per cent. The share price fell 3p on the results and Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, marked down his forecast of pre-tax profits for this year from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 9.5m.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Iosco setback over common capital requirements - Iosco Conference ATTEMPTS to reach agreement on common capital requirements for securities firms and banks hit another obstacle over the weekend when US securities regulators held out for tougher standards than those sought by other regulators. The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), a grouping of securities regulators from more than 50 countries, discussed the issue of capital requirements, at the start of its annual meeting in London. The organisation's technical committee, chaired by Mr Richard Breeden, who heads the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, will meet again tomorrow morning in an attempt to resolve the issue, which has already been under discussion for more than three years. A meeting of the committee on Sunday failed to agree on the amount of capital that securities firms must set aside to cover the risk of holding securities. Mr Breeden is said to be holding out for a 4 per cent capital requirement to cover the risk, while other regulators are arguing that 2 per cent would be enough for any firm holding a large, diversified portfolio of securities - as opposed to individual securities, which would carry a 4 per cent requirement. A recently-agreed European Community directive on capital adequacy includes the 2 per cent requirement. When the directive is implemented, EC securities firms will have to maintain their capital at a level equivalent to 2 per cent of their gross positions in securities and 8 per cent of their net positions - calculated by taking account of long and short positions and hedging strategies. Regulators yesterday raised the possibility of most Iosco members agreeing to the 2 per cent requirement, with the US left on the outside. However, such a compromise would damage Iosco's standing, regulators say, because of the international reputation of the SEC. If the SEC were left on the outside, it could also prove difficult to persuade bank regulators - grouped in the Basle Committee on banking supervision, rather than Iosco - to agree to the proposal. The Basle committee has virtually concluded its own deliberations on capital requirements for securities trading by banks in parallel talks. The lack of an agreement by Iosco is holding up plans to push ahead with joint action on the issue, which has been stalled for much of this year. If the new capital requirements were imposed by individual securities regulators, without the agreement of the US, trade in US equities could shift offshore, to regimes with less stringent requirements. A compromise has been under discussion which if enforced would have the effect of preventing this migration of business to offshore centres without imposing a common international capital requirement.</p>

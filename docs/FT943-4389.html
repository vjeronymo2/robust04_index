			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / US invasion of Haiti may come within four weeks: Pentagon activates seven cargo ships for a military operation The Clinton administration is lining up its media forces to win public support for an invasion of Haiti, now widely expected within a month unless the country's military rulers step down. The White House said yesterday its patience was 'wearing thin' and the Pentagon announced that seven cargo ships were being activated for possible use in a Haiti operation to restore Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president. Mr Aristide was ousted by a military coup and exiled three years ago. The US has suggested it would use massive force - about 10,000 troops - in any intervention to keep down casualties. 'Patience is wearing thin,' said White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. 'The coup leaders' days are numbered. . . we are moving toward the endgame in this policy,' she said. President Bill Clinton is likely to avoid seeking a congressional vote to back the invasion, but is understood to be planning a national address to win popular backing for the first military offensive of his presidency. Mr Clinton held a three-hour session on Wednesday night to consider invasion plans with senior foreign policy advisers and White House staff. The meeting was interpreted as a signal of renewed urgency in the administration to restore democracy to Haiti. The US government's stiffening resolve was made clear by Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, who warned Haiti's military leadership prior to the meeting that 'their days are definitely numbered. . . One way or another, the de facto government is going to be leaving.' Pentagon officials are understood to have informed the White House that a US-led multinational force is ready to go, but the president needs to win over the American people before launching an operation which could involve US casualties. White House assessments of the popular backing for a Haiti invasion are likely to be the critical factor in deciding both when and if the administration decides to act. Mr Clinton's advisers seem to be split on possible public responses. National security advisers are expected to start briefing Congress members next week on the reasons for US involvement, the plans for a speedy withdrawal and the outlook for a UN peacekeeping operation. Seeking to avoid a vote would be a break with the Bush administration's policy of winning congressional backing for US operations in the Gulf war. However, it would have a recent precedent in the Reagan administration, which began its invasion of Panama without a vote in Congress. 'Consult, execute and then defend' is said to be the policy envisaged by the administration. Wednesday night's meeting also considered plans for a final push to persuade Haiti's military leaders to step down. This could involve covert action which would attempt to exacerbate rifts between Haiti's military commanders and offers to provide safe passage for Haiti's leaders.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: CUDAHY;  </P> <P> JURY SETS $570,000 PRICE FOR CONDEMNED PROPERTY  </P> <P> After four years of bickering over the value of a property that the Cudahy  Redevelopment Agency condemned to build a Tiangus shopping center, a Los  Angeles Superior Court jury last week settled the matter.  </P> <P> After listening to real estate appraisers representing the Redevelopment Agency  and the former property owners, Ted Burkett and his wife, Theresa Champagne,  the jury decided that Burkett and Champagne should receive $570,000 for the  one-third acre at Florence and Atlantic avenues, City Manager Jack Joseph said.  </P> <P> Burkett, who was left blind about seven years ago by diabetes, was asking  $836,000 for the property, while his wife had asked for $696,000. When the  Redevelopment Agency made its formal offer to buy out the Burketts in 1986, it  offered $480,000, but later offered to settle out of court for $588,000, Joseph  said. Burkett refused to accept the Redevelopment Agency's offer.  </P> <P> Burkett sued the city when he heard that his property was going to be  condemned, but a Superior Court judge ruled in the city's favor. Burkett, who  is now living in Bellflower, said the forced relocation has caused him a great  deal of hardship. He said he plans to appeal the judge's decision to allow the  city to take his property for redevelopment.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Untitled commentary by the KOMMERSANT-DAILY Economic Policy </F> Department]    [Text] Fierce election competition made the already-narrow  boundaries of Central Bank's special accounts too restrictive  for more energetic electoral coalitions. The specificity of  advertising activities made using cash especially tempting.  Strict reporting requirements, however, made it impossible to  use this instrument legally.    Therefore, it is unlikely that the official documentation of  electoral coalitions regarding receipts and expenditures of  money from electoral special accounts reflected the true budgets  party finance officers operated with in the course of election  campaign. By unofficial estimates, most coalitions spent  considerable amounts of cash not reported to the Central  Electoral Commission. By the estimates of specialists in the  Ministry of Press and Information, overall the coalitions may  have spent between 100 and 150 million rubles [R] from the  "black cash box" on the preparation and distribution of  advertising materials. This practice, of course, is just  beginning to become a special feature of election campaigns in  Russia. In developed democracies it is an inalienable part of  politics as a whole and elections in particular. The so-called  "street" (or "sick leave," etc.), which refers to large amounts  of cash distributed on behalf of candidates, have been a subject  of numerous political scandals in the United States. It appears  that such scandals are inevitable in Russia as well. One may  assume that the first signals of violations on the part of  competitors will start coming to the control and audit service  of the Central Electoral Commission at the time when tough  interparty fighting begins in the Federal Assembly.</p>

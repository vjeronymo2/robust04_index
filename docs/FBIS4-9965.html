			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report released yesterday by Robert  Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American  affairs, Panama's dollar-based economy, the existence of a free  zone in Colon Province, loose control over the exchange of money  and raw material, and lenient laws have made Panama vulnerable  to drugs.    The report states that the Panamanian Government has not  made  any new, decisive efforts to curb the laundering of drug money  in the past year, that Panamanian laws must be perfected, and  that Panama's control organizations and resources are inadequate.    According to a U.S. State Department report on international  drug trafficking presented to the U.S. Congress, a number of  countries, including Panama, are victims of corruption fostered  by drug traffickers. The Panamanian Government has rejected  this accusation several times, saying that it is making all  possible efforts. Vice President Guillermo Ford thus reacted to  the report:    [Begin Ford recording] I am going to say this publicly and  through our embassy. In 1990 the Republic of Panama issued a  decree-law by which the Banking Commission would introduce rules  to govern the management of cash through banks. Recently,  through a cabinet decree, a new law was issued involving all  assets coming into Panama through any port of entry. All  countries are doing this.    Meanwhile, Panama approved the Mutual Legal Assistance  Treaty, which has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate. I think  that instead of criticizing and promoting the idea that Panama  supports drug trafficking and money laundering, we should all  work together to eradicate these two scourges. [end recording]    Nevertheless, the U.S. Government says that cocaine  consumption has become a true worldwide scourge that corrupts  and destroys lives, and it has accused Panama of lacking the  political resolve to deal with the corruption caused by the drug.    [Begin Ford recording] I must say publicly that I think it  is unfair to say that Panama is not doing enough to eradicate  this scourge. [end recording].    The State Department report asserts that drug production and  trafficking are increasing and creating new opportunities for  international criminals. In addition to Panama, the report  lists Bolivia and Venezuela among the Latin American countries  that are not making an effort to fight drug trafficking.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Rejection" issued by the National Army of Democratic </F> Kampuchea spokesman in Kampot on 4 April -- read by announcer]    [Text] On 3 April, there was a sarcastic report hinting  that the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] had  abducted an American woman and three Cambodians in Kampot  Province and was holding them for ransom.    The NADK has nothing to do with this matter and vehemently  rejects this accusation, which stems from bad political aims.  [passage omitted]    There is no reason for the NADK to kidnap anyone for ransom.  They should look for the culprit among their own people instead.  [passage omitted]    [Dated] 4 April 1994    [Signed] The NADK spokesman</p>

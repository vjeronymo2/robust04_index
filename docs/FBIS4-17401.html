			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Sobolev: "Tired of Confrontation in </F> Groznyy. Discussion of Russian President's Directive in  Chechnya"]    [Text] Chechnya President Dzhokhar Dudayev has announced  that his analysis services are carefully studying Boris  Yeltsin's directive ordering the Russian Government to hold  consultations with the North Caucasus Republic. In Groznyy they  are also tired of confrontation, and, presumably, time is on the  side of those who are prepared to seek compromises. But the  upcoming talks will be complicated by two facts: Moscow will  demand that Chechnya acknowledge that it is a component of the  Russian Federation and, moreover, the Russian leaders are still  in contact with political forces in opposition to Dudayev. But  these facts are an increasing irritant to Dudayev and his  associates.    Certainly, one cannot regard as coincidental the fact that  in  these past few days the Chechnya state security department has  received an order to deploy its subunits. The point is,  according to Ayub Satuyev, the department's deputy chief, the  opposition could become more active next week. "The leadership  has the strength and resources to curb the enemies of the  people, and we will adopt the toughest measures with regard to  the opposition," he said.    But the opposition, which intends to hold its own meeting in  Moscow next week, is accusing certain circles in the Russian  leadership of attempting, as Abdulla Bugayev, leader of the  "Marsho" party said, to "find a compromise with the Dzhokhar  Dudayev regime, ignoring the interests of the Chechen people and  of the republic's entire multinational population."    "One should realize that the people are tired of Dzh.  Dudayev's tyrannical regime and of Moscow's inconsistent and  unclear position," one Chechen opposition leader said.  "Otherwise there will be a spontaneous explosion and the  consequences could be very serious."    A. Bugayev called for free, democratic elections in  Chechnya,  involving all social and political forces. "Chechnya democratic  forces do not intend to retreat from this position, even if the  Russian Federation Federation Council or some other organ of  authority decides to declare the Dzhokhar Dudayev regime legal,"  A. Bugayev said.    Not that all Chechen opposition figures are that resolute.  Yaragi Mamodayev, head of the republic government of people's  confidence, urged the leaders of all political forces and  movements in Chechnya to achieve national reconciliation and  work out a common position at the upcoming talks with Russia.    Commenting on Boris Yeltsin's directive, Ya. Mamodayev said:  "My government of people's confidence believes that the Russian  side's efforts to work not only with Dzhokhar Dudayev, but also  with opposition political movements could result in a deeper  political split in Chechnya and could complicate the already  fragile negotiating process. For that very reason we are urging  all our compatriots not to split into pro- and anti-Dudayev  factions, but to subordinate their personal or group ambitions  to national interests in order to deliver Chechnya from total  crisis after it has been through so much."    Ya. Mamodayev believes that no single political movement or  group of forces can objectively express the will of the entire  people. So, he said, we are proposing to hold a congress of the  Chechen people in the very near future to get to grips with the  problems of the relationship between Russia and Chechnya.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / European Bonds EUROPE'S government bond markets have two concerns: the prospect of higher German interest rates and the risk that the French vote against ratification of the Maastricht treaty, writes Sara Webb. The fact that the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged after Thursday's council meeting was greeted with relief in the bond markets. For although the Bundesbank raised its discount rate as recently as July 16 - to 8.75 per cent from 8.0 per cent - the markets have continued to fret about whether it will raise the Lombard rate as well. The bank remains concerned about German M3 growth, and is determined to pull it back from 8.7 per cent to its target of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent. However, the markets were relieved when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's president, said on Thursday it saw no reason to raise the Lombard rate. The other favourable news for the European bond markets was French opinion polls showing firm support for ratifying Maastricht. Although the French referendum on EMU is not until September 20, the European markets are likely to remain hostage to the opinion polls. Wednesday's poll in Paris-Match magazine showed 56 per cent favoured Maastricht, with 44 per cent against. This boosted French and other European bonds. However, while the main bond markets were encouraged by the news in Germany and France, the Nordic markets were hit by a sudden rise in Finnish interest rates. The Bank of Finland announced on Thursday it would raise its key tender rate to 16 per cent from 14.62 per cent from today in an attempt to stem the recent outflow of capital. The news lifted Finnish yields immediately: that on the 11 per cent, seven-year government bond climbed to 12.7 per cent on Thursday, against 12.3 per cent the previous Friday. Swedish bond yields were also pushed up. However, after Finland announced economic measures on Thursday night to calm the markets, Nordic yields fell and the seven-year Finnish bond yield dropped to 12.52 per cent on Friday.</p>

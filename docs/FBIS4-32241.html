			<p>BFN     [Text] The Sejm Social Policy and Health Commissions have  come out in favor of including contraceptives on the list of  medicines for which only 30 percent of the price has to be paid.  They have also come out in favor of introducting sex education  in schools and of withdrawing handbooks containing inadequate  sex information. Today the commissions are discussing  implementation of the laws on family planning and conditions  permitting abortion. The deputies have adopted the text of  recommendations for the prime minister, for which they demand  government implementation.</p>

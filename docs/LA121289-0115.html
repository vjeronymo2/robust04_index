			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> TRANSIT OFFICIALS DENIED TRAM FUNDS  </P> <P> In a continuing financial battle over Laguna Beach's "cable car on wheels,"  Orange County transportation commissioners voted Monday to deny more than  $300,000 to Laguna Beach Municipal Transit Lines.  </P> <P> Meeting in Santa Ana, Orange County Transportation Commission members said they  were still unhappy with the Laguna Beach transit authority after an audit  earlier this year showed poor cost-benefit performance. Also, the commission's  staff was miffed over the transit line's decision to go ahead and buy a new  tram to replace the distinctive blue, rusting "village trolley" -- against  OCTC's advice. The staff had recommended leasing a vehicle or privatizing the  service.  </P> <P> The trolley and three trams were used in prior years to shuttle summer visitors  from Laguna Canyon to festivals and activities throughout the city. The system  runs along Coast Highway, Laguna Canyon Road and other major streets to handle  additional summer traffic.  </P> <P> City transit officials were seeking $68,411 as reimbursement for the purchase  of a new tram, and $240,000 for future vehicles.  </P> <P> In May, OCTC rejected an earlier request for trolley replacement funds after 11  summers of service, creating a public outcry in defense of the bus, designed to  resemble a wooden-seated cable car.  </P> <P> City officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> OCTC did approve $237,063 in other funding requests submitted by Laguna Beach  on Monday, mostly for general transit line operating costs. Commission staff  members said negotiations on future vehicle purchases will continue in a bid to  resolve remaining issues. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN  </P></p>

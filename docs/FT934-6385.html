			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Keeping a check on cheques Sir, British banks are changing the system by which they process and clear cheques ('Banks set to process cheques for each other', November 15). Surely they should be taking steps to reduce drastically the volume of cheques handled. This has been effectively accomplished in Switzerland. Every bill that I receive is accompanied by a standard payment transfer form. At the end of each month I group together all forms for payments due and sign a single debit authorisation. I mail all of these to my bank (in an addressed envelope which my bank provides for me) and within five working days I receive from my bank an itemised list of the payments which have been made on my behalf and confirmation that my account has been debited. I have a cheque book but seldom, if ever, use it. T J Walsh, La Estancia, 17 Chemin du Derochoz, 1801 Le Mont-Pelerin, Switzerland</p>

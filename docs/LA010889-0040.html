			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELER'S DIARY: A MOVABLE FEAST MOVES FROM PARIS AREA TO PAU  </P> <P> In the early '70s, a diminutive and somewhat rotund chef named Michel Guerard  won three Michelin stars for his tiny restaurant on a back-of-the-lot fringe of  Paris.  </P> <P> It was called Pot au Feu, and serious and famous eaters flocked there until  Paris, in its infinite wisdom, decided a new roadway was needed. Alas, it was  placed right in the path of Guerard's tiny temple. The fire went out at Pot au  Feu, but it burned even brighter in Guerard's belly.  </P> <P> Michel and his wife Christine picked up the pieces and moved to the vicinity of  Pau, southeast of Bordeaux and east of Biarritz, where royalty used to play, a  whistle away from the Spanish border.  </P> <P> Christine's family had property in the middle of a wide area of thermal springs  first developed by Henri IV. She and Michel settled in the town called  Eugenie-les-Bains, so named because Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, came  here to bathe in the natural hot springs.  </P> <P> Together they built a small but elegant hotel that shelters 35 guests (eight  more rooms are being built). Each room was given a name that would summon a  dream -- buttercup, citronella, rosewood, clouds. Some faced the magnolias,  palms, bamboo, tulips, water lilies, orange trees and banana trees. Others  faced the pool set in a meadow sprinkled with peonies and iris.  </P> <P> There are tennis courts for the hyperactive, petanque for those who want to  roll a ball down an alleyway, and billiards for inclement days. There isn't a  room deodorant spray can in sight; bundles of fresh rosemary hang in the room  closets, tied with white ribbons.  </P> <P> While the spa was developed, Michel created Cuisine Minceur, a cuisine of  slimness, and even wrote a book about it. He confessed that he had been a chef  gourmand who liked his robust food. But Christine, who would soon marry him,  whispered in his ear: "You know, Michel, if you would lose some weight you  would look great."  </P> <P> Those few words created a whole new enterprise. And from Michel's new kitchen  in the South of France there came a whole new way to eat elegantly while  sidestepping calories. A sample menu might include lobster salad with mangoes,  roast pigeon with spicy mincemeat, crepes filled with apples and a lemony  apricot mousse.  </P> <P> To be sure, a chef of his talents couldn't avoid producing, at the same time, a  carte gourmande -- golden pates, a "pillow" of mushrooms and truffles in cream,  fat disks of foie gras from Landes (some say the best in France), oven-roasted  salmon perfumed with truffle oil, pastry fritters stuffed with crayfish and an  artichoke salad swimming in olive oil, plus pig's feet and mashed potatoes with  truffles, rabbit and chopped bits of goose with sweetbreads.  </P> <P> Of course, one could end the horn of plenty with iced fruit and sherbet  spilling out or go the whole cochon (hog) with the dessert du roi, the dessert  of the king -- all in chocolate, including a hot souffle, chocolate ices and a  pot de creme.  </P> <P> Even for those who eat at the Cuisine Minceur and are laved by the waters,  Michel and Christine suggest having one last meal chosen from the gourmand  menu. You will have earned it after you've tubbed in hot spa water, been  sprayed with a hose and taken an underwater massage where a masseuse works over  your belly.  </P> <P> For some (though not for me), a white mud bath is sheer weightless heaven;  weightless because you seem to float in white goo. And after radio evaporation,  a tingling high-pressure needle shower and a swallow or two of diuretic water,  there is, for ladies anyway, the beauty parlor.  </P> <P> During the stay, whether in the spa or not, one is encouraged to drink mint and  chamomile tea and to inhale the verbena, sweet basil, chives and sage that  perfume the air. You can walk a boulevard lined with rosemary to the fussy  little church that stands at the crossroads at the very entranceway to Michel  and Christine's corner of heaven.  </P> <P> The success of Les Pres d'Eugenie would have satisfied most kitchen creators,  but not Michel. He spent seven months at wine school and bought the Chateau  Bachen estate a few miles from Eugenie-les-Bains. Here he is growing four kinds  of grapes that he will begin to market this year under the label of the Baron  de Bachen. They will be bottled in elongated flasks that resemble tall bottles  of Bordeaux, a region which is, after all, a neighbor.  </P> <P> It is a white wine fruity with suspicions of cumin and thyme to tease the  palate. In the middle of the wine field sits the Baron's old 17th-Century  chateau, which Michel and Christine have redone in splendid style, with a big  kitchen range that Christine designed (and sells to other restaurants and large  houses), and even an octagonal porcelain hot tub. This is where they live.  </P> <P> Besides all that, the Guerards are about to produce an armagnac, a cousin of  cognac being distilled at another chateau 45 minutes away. What else? Well,  Michel has given up Bloomingdale's, where he maintained a fine food station for  awhile.  </P> <P> He still creates frozen foods in France, Switzerland and Belgium, an outgrowth  of his work with Stouffer's, which produces Lean Cuisine -- an idea he  developed with Stouffer's parent company, Nestle.  </P> <P> In the center of the vineyard, below the grand building where the grapes will  be pressed, barreled, aged and bottled, a tiered amphitheater is taking shape.  </P> <P> Summer musical festivals will be held there. Michel Guerard -- wine maker,  armagnac distiller, creator of Cuisine Minceur and Cuisine Gourmande -- might  very well do a turn on stage himself.  </P> <P> "I may sing," he says. He surely has plenty to sing about.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Les Pres d'Eugenie hotel and restaurant, 40320 Geaune, France.  </P></p>

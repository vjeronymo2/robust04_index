			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Mikhail Kalmykov </F> and Vilor Niyazmatov]    [Text] Tashkent 27 April TASS -- "I have no doubts that we  needed the Commonwealth of Independent States. Otherwise we  would have had a Yugoslavian version here after the collapse of  the Soviet Union. History shows that such apprehensions are  grounded," Uzbek President Islam Karimov told a joint press  conference here, devoted to the results of French President  Francois Mitterrand's state visit to Uzbekistan.    Replying to an ITAR-TASS question, the Uzbek leader noted  that he believed the future of the CIS lay in economic  integration, including the formation of inter-state  transcontinental corporations, which could unite Russian and  Uzbek enterprises in joint-stock societies.    "We believe that the future of the CIS depends precisely on  the formation of such associations, uniting the enterprises of  Russia, Uzbekistan, and other republics. It will be even better  if such associations are created not on a bilateral, but on a  multilateral basis," Karimov stressed.    Asked by ITAR-TASS to comment on the idea of the Euro-Asian  union, recently voiced by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev,  Karimov said: "Much is left unsaid when the term Euro-Asian is  used. If this implies a single parliament, single suprastate  structures and even a single citizenship and a single  constitution, it means the restoration of the old union, no  matter how it is called. I am vehemently opposed to any  comeback of the past. It is not for this that we have achieved  sovereignty and are now engaged in national revival. There is  no return to the past. History moves only ahead."    "To put it in a nutshell," Karimov stated, "the Euro-Asian  idea smacks very much of populism, no matter who voices it."</p>

(Oct. 18): Most mornings when I open The Times, I have learned to  expect the familiar, painful twinge of heart when I read about the senseless  killing of another child in East Los Angeles. What a surprise to open the View  section and read that just miles away in a bird sanctuary, white, middle-class  families "play" at killing in the game of paint ball on a Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> PATRICIA GRIMES  </P> <P> Los Osos  </P></p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Alcatel chief predicts flat earnings for year MR PIERRE Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group, yesterday estimated that last year's net profit rose by between 12 per cent and 15 per cent, but that earnings would probably be flat this year, writes William Dawkins in Paris. This indicates that profits rose to at least FFr7bn (Dollars 1.29bn) in 1992 from FFr6.2bn in 1991. It also appears to back up recent warnings from analysts that profit margins in the telecommunications equipment market, from which Alcatel Alsthom derives more than half its profits, could shrink in the next few years.</p>

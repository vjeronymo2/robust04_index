			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: Turkey's largest steel cable group seeks backer CARNEGIE International, the London securities house, has been mandated to find a buyer for a controlling stake in Celik Halat, Turkey's largest steel cable manufacturer. Carnegie and Mr Artif Cezairli of Toros Securities, an Istanbul broker, have been formally approached by Mr Nasrullah Ayan of Turkinvest, Turkey's best-known corporate raider, to sell what is believed to be a near 50 per cent stake worth about Dollars 20m. The sale could effectively bring to a close a year of intense stock market speculation for Celik Halat which has been at the centre of a number of takeover rumours. Brokers anticipate a round of Turkish mergers as companies look for foreign partners ahead of the move to customs union with the European Community in 1995. Celik Halat, which has 70 per cent of Turkey's steel cable market, earned revenues of around Dollars 45m in 1992. Exports accounted for 30 per cent of group sales. Mr Cezairli confirmed that a number of Europe's leading steel manufacturers were potential bidders but declined to give the names of companies already approached. Mr Ayan is putting his stake in Celik Halat up for sale after failing to secure control of the company.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (4): More flexible than overdrafts - Small business finance / A look at asset-based lending Leasing and hire purchase have rarely had a better press. Largely swept away is the old image of HP companies lending more expensively than the banks. In its place, asset financing is increasingly being seen as a flexible form of finance that can be cheaper for small businesses than bank overdraft. Asset-based finance remains one of the few sources of medium-term finance for smaller companies and one of the only places that start-up companies can turn to for funds. While the image of leasing suffered as the result of a small number of photocopier supplier agreements, it is arguable that the industry's reputation has emerged from the recession in more robust shape than that of the banks. 'There have been stories recently of the banks relaxing their lending criteria,' says Lesley Kay of the Finance and Leasing Association, which represents many of the UK's leasaing companies. 'But small businesses which have had bad experiences with banks feel more comfortable if they can get finance from a finance house.' Small companies have also had heavyweight encouragement to seek alternatives to the overdraft which is still used more frequently to raise finance in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. Responding to the debate about small company access to capital, the chancellor of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, this year encouraged companies to seek alternatives to overdrafts. To finance short-term assets - such as working capital - companies might consider factoring, both recommended. For fixed assets, they suggested companies should look at leasing. The attraction for small companies is threefold. First, there is certainty. Assets cannot easily be repossessed by the finance house as long as payments are maintained. An overdraft, on the other hand can be withdrawn. Small businesses are also more likely to raise fixed-rate finance rather than the variable rate of most overdrafts. Finally, hire purchase and leasing offer a variety of opportunities to use capital allowances in a tax efficient manner. The steady growth of financing is evident in the figures. According to the FLA, its members lent Pounds 13.9bn in the 12 months to August 1994, an increase of 11 per cent over the same period last year. Of that leasing was up only 3 per cent to Pounds 7.3bn but it is rapidly being caught by hire purchase, up 32 per cent at Pounds 6.1bn. The FLA estimates about a quarter of this by value and much more by volume is finance for small business and that about 50 per cent of small companies fund their equipment purchases through hire purchase or leasing. The rapid rise in hire purchase can be explained by the fact that many companies have discovered hire purchase is barely more expensive than finance leasing where the asset reverts to the lessor company at the end of the lease. Leasing is particularly attractive to new companies that have no track record and would have difficulty raising overdrafts. Because finance houses are as interested in residual values of underlying assets as they are in the state of the business they are backing, they have a wholly different approach to banks. The finance houses have also tended to specialise in certain asset classes; close asset finance, for example, has developed an understanding of the value of printing equipment which has made it the first port of call for companies seeking to set up printing presses. One beneficiary of leasing's flexibility is Sheffield Omnibus, a start-up company that wanted to buy 12-year-old second-hand vehicles in 1990. The banks would not look at assets of that age. But a finance house which was familiar with the residual value of commercial buses, was able to finance the deal. Now that the company buys new assets for its expanded fleet it still chooses to use a finance house rather than the banks. Finance and hire purchase is attractive for companies with assets with long lives such as buses. But companies trying to buy computers have less chance of raising finance. These assets have notoriously short lives, not because they quickly wear out but because they are rapidly considered obsolete. Quite simply, a two-year-old computer's market value falls extremely quickly. The residual value of such investments is probably something only the manufacturer will be fully equipped to assess. Such deals will remain the preserve of financing companies that support equipment suppliers. For the very smallest unincorporated companies, leasing may also be about to become a more accessible option. Until now, the UK's small army of unincorporated companies have been covered by the Consumer Credit Act (CCA) when they borrow up to Pounds 15,000. Rather than working in their favour, the FLA estimated this has denied them access to more than Pounds 100m of finance which finance houses would have been willing to lend. The problem is that the Consumer Credit Act weakens a finance company's ability to repossess assets. If, for example, an unincorporated company had already repaid a third of the agreed amount when it defaults on its payments, a finance house would need a court order to repossess the assets. As a result a number of finance houses simply chose not to risk the costs of dealing with these companies. But in June the Office of Fair Trading recommended that business lending should no longer be covered by the Consumer Credit Act. The department of trade and industry is studying the recommendation and is expected to announce its intentions shortly. If business lending is excluded for the CCA, this would not only boost the number of prospects for the finance and leasing industry. It could also provide a much larger population of companies using a more stable way of financing the main assets in their businesses, reducing their vulnerability to banks the next time the business cycle turns down.</p>

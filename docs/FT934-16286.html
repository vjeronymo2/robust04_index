			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / AEEU points to Germany as role model BRITISH industry needs legally-based works councils on the German model, the AEEU engineering and electrical union has told the House of Commons employment committee inquiry into the future of trade unions. The country's largest manufacturing union, in a written submission, said greater worker involvement in running companies would help Britain compete effectively in world markets. 'If more British companies are to be world class, it is vital that unions become part of a wider progressive partnership. In Germany, unions play a constructive, leading role in the works council system and British unions would almost certainly do the same.' The unions' 'negative confrontational history' should be discarded in favour of a more positive, partnership approach. 'The right to independent employee representation within the workplace should be embodied in law. This would be a real test of how representative unions are where it matters most - at the place of work.' The concept of employee representation should be apolitical rather than at the whim of a change of government. 'The present government's approach to individual rights at work is meaningless without access to employee representation in order that these rights may be pursued. The right to join a union is of little use unless recognition is guaranteed.' World class companies 'unlike the British government' see good wages and conditions, together with a constructive dialogue with employee representatives, as 'integral to, rather than contrary to, corporate success'. There was praise for the industrial relations systems in Germany, Japan and Sweden - countries with the 'best long-term trading records in manufactured goods that have well developed employee representation systems'. The AEEU drew particular attention to the merits of the Rover agreement signed by the unions last year.</p>

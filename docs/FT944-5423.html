			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Siberia's cold cauldron is hotting up: Roger Garside travelled to the land the Tartars called wonderful and found the bathhouse a good place to learn about its business culture A year ago the author was preparing for a three-month visit to the heart of Siberia. It resulted last month in a joint venture with former academics to raise an investment fund for the region. Russia's Strength Will Grow Out of Siberia. These words greet me from a billboard on the road to Academic Town, half an hour from Novosibirsk, capital of Western Siberia. 'That is a prophecy of Mikhail Lomonosov, an 18th-century scholar,' explains Larissa Denisova, a graduate of the town's university. 'You think it's over the top? But we already produce three-quarters of Russia's oil and gas and almost all its gold and diamonds. With Moscow and the communists off our backs we'll make Lomonosov come true.' It is winter, the temperature is -200C, the sky above the snow laden forest is a brilliant blue. I have come to Academic Town for three months to investigate the opportunities for international investment in Siberia, and Larissa is to be my guide. I have chosen the town as my base because it is an extraordinary concentration of intelligent and knowledgeable people. It was founded 30 years ago to house the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences, it grew into one of the greatest science centres in the world. One of its academics is Maxim Bushuev, now an entrepreneur and he has thought up the idea of a co-operative venture with the west. The bleak housing estate for workers and technicians where Larissa has found me a flat is not quite what I had in mind, but I tell myself that if I am to encourage others to invest here, I had better find out what Siberia is really like. And if Larissa has not triumphed as a housing agent, she more than compensates in other ways. At 27, she looks like Michelle Pfeiffer, has the will of Margaret Thatcher and a great sense of humour. She is just the person we need to break the barriers left from 70 years of bureaucratic rule, and to find evidence to persuade investors to put their money into Siberia. That evidence will need to be good. At the beginning of this year, an international survey placed Russia third from the bottom of a list of 104 places in which to invest. Russia's economics and politics are a mass of contradictions, but I am surprised to find that Larissa, and other well-educated Siberians, are unconcerned by the difficulties which alarm foreign investors. Unlike Muscovites, Siberians hardly read newspapers and watch the television news in a state of semi-detachment. Larissa says: 'Why should we spend our time following the goings-on in Moscow? We have to get on with building our lives. We find ways to cope with the policies they make.' In the next few days I am impressed how hard people are working to build new lives - and new companies. I become absorbed in their struggle to create coherence and profit out of the incoherence and waste bequeathed by the old system, so absorbed, indeed, that I do not bother to set up my BBC World Service aerial. I have found my way into a cauldron of entrepreneurial activity, and my only anxiety now is that the lack of business culture may mean that projects are too ill-prepared to attract foreign investors. Any worries that we might be cold-shouldered are soon dispelled. Families I have only met once invite me to their homes for dinner. My landlady keeps me supplied with good food and drink: meat-filled dumplings smothered in sour cream, borsch, beef stroganoff, salted salmon, smoked chicken, good bitter beer and the best fruit juice. On the first weekend, Larissa takes us cross-country skiing through woods of silver birch. With us is Sergei Zaitsev, one of the explosion of young entrepreneurs who have understood that the deficiencies of the old economy offer them great opportunities. Communist rule favoured defence production and heavy industry at the expense of the consumer, and Zaitsev is making a fortune by doing something to correct the balance. In the late 1980s, when he was a graduate student in high energy physics, he visited Belgium on a youth delegation. He slipped away from the official programme and persuaded a Belgian company to form a joint venture with him. The company was Carin, supplier of hair care products to much of the hairdressing trade in western Europe. A Belgian aircraft carried the first consignment to Siberia. Today, Sergei's company has a turnover of Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.5m) and cannot meet demand in its home province. It wants capital for expansion. He feels he has earned his Italian clothes and his chauffeur-driven BMW. On another weekend, Nikolai Zagoruiko, a senior scientist in the Academy of Science, invites me to the banya, Russia's variation of the sauna. Naked, we work up a sweat in the hot room, receive a thrashing with birch twigs, take a shower and massage, exit into the night air (-200C) for total immersion in a natural pool, then start again. Afterwards we relax in a log cabin built by the professors with their own hands. They have brought simple food from home, and observe the classic rules of the banya - single sex and no alcohol. The only decoration is part of a tree-trunk, stripped of its bark. True, it bears an unmistakable resemblance to a girl's torso, but even this concession to the flesh has a certain innocence: it is the torso of a very young girl. This evening, I hear Nikolai's story. 'In the 'stagnation years' of the late 1970s and early 1980s I built an industrial organisation on the principle of rewarding people according to their personal productivity. 'This was heresy] We were too successful, so they closed us down to stop the heresy from spreading. In recent years, I have done something to mobilise people in the institutes of the academy into a consulting network. 'With state funding for science drying up and professors earning less than bus drivers, most of us in Academic Town are looking for ways to apply our knowledge to manufacturing or services - those of us still here, that is. Perhaps a third have emigrated.' Nikolai's principal business role now is as president of an investment fund. In the weeks that follow, he will bring me a number of good investment proposals, based on scientific findings but practical, and proven on some scale. He is in his late 60s, and combines worldly wisdom with social ideals, which ensure that the projects he brings me include ones adapted for small farmers or Russians repatriated from parts of the former Soviet Union where they are now unwelcome. One of my fellow guests in the banya is Sergei Yakushin. 'I run Siberian Fair. We organise trade fairs here in Siberia and in the rest of Russia, and abroad. This year we will put on 140, 40 of them abroad. 'We have a wonderful site in Novosibirsk to build our own exhibition centre  -right at the geographical centre of Russia. On one side, the Ob, one of our great rivers of Siberia, on the other, the highway and railway to central Asia.' He monitors Siberia's fast-changing economy closely. 'From this spring, I will charge Russian companies the same prices as foreigners. Two years ago, I would not have dared, but since then I have seen many Russian companies grow stronger.' Another visitor to the banya is Viktor Kornikov. His face is heavy, Asiatic, dark-skinned and toughened by life. Never for a moment do his eyes betray his thoughts or feelings. I guess he is a descendant of one of those peoples who inhabited Siberia before the Europeans arrived. He was an electronics researcher at the academy and a senior manager in a factory making microchips until, long before privatisation began, he gave up those secure positions to start his own business. He and a few colleagues sorted through chips discarded for waste by the factory, to sell those that were good for restricted use. With his savings from that, he started in the food business, and is now one of the biggest traders in Tomsk. The food trade is very profitable, but also a target of the Russian mafia. I want to know how he copes, because our venture may arouse interest in the same circles. Viktor turns his impassive face to me, pauses for a moment, then gives me an opaque answer: 'In Russia, everyone has an umbrella, and mine is a sports association.' His meaning becomes clearer when I ask him whether he has problems obtaining payment for the consumer goods he supplies to hundreds of kiosks. 'No,' he replies, 'If they don't pay, they receive a visit from members of a sports group I sponsor. I'm sorry,' he adds with a slight shrug of the shoulders, 'but it's necessary.' The banya session ended, Nikolai drives me home down a long, straight road lined by trees that will meet at infinity, perhaps. Beyond the trees the snow-covered plain stretches to Europe, certainly. Overhead are the biggest moon and brightest stars I have ever seen. On their way to Europe, the Tartars named this land Sibir (wonderful) but it is untamed and awesome. Men subsist on the edge of the wild. So we work together, energised by the riches beneath us. Tomorrow we will be at it again: more projects, more entrepreneurs, more hope of making Lomonosov come true.

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINE INVASION;  </P> <P> 10-MILE IRVINE-TO-BEACH TRAINING HIKE STARTLES SUBURBANITES  </P> <P> Groggy from a late night at work, Patricia Holland of Irvine said she struggled  through her morning run along San Diego Creek in her hometown Monday, barely  able to keep her eyes open.  </P> <P> Until she was surrounded by Marines.  </P> <P> "It was like something out of a movie," said Holland, who is more used to  dodging bicyclists and jeering motorists. "All of a sudden I was faced with  advancing troops. It was quite intimidating."  </P> <P> But the Marines reservists meant no harm. Instead, more than 70 of them --  wearing camouflage uniforms, field packs and boots -- trekked from Irvine to  Corona del Mar State Beach during a rush-hour training hike. While the march  startled some civilians, it was intended only to show Orange County that the  part-time Leathernecks are still rough and ready.  </P> <P> The troops marched in twos past swank office parks and pricey homes on  palm-lined streets, a 3 1/2-hour jaunt that made for good exercise -- even if  it didn't resemble wartime conditions.  </P> <P> "This route shows the civilian community our training to maintain a  combat-ready status," said Lt. Col. D.J. Kingsbury, commander of the Marine  Aircraft Group 46, a reserve unit based at the Marine Corps Air Station in El  Toro. Smiling after the hike, he said: "Besides, it was a lot of fun."  </P> <P> The unit -- a mixture of men and women who usually spend their days as postal  workers, bankers, aerospace engineers, college students and the like -- trains  one weekend a month and two consecutive weeks in the summer.  </P> <P> The rare tour through residential and business neighborhoods began at 6:30 a.m.  at Jeffrey Road in Irvine, continuing on bike paths along San Diego Creek and  later past UC Irvine. The unit then marched on sidewalks or road shoulders down  MacArthur Boulevard and San Joaquin Hills Road in Newport Beach before turning  onto Marguerite Avenue to reach the ocean.  </P> <P> Along the way, the troops got some strange looks, but Marines reported that  people waved and honked horns in support.  </P> <P> "It was a blast," said Lance Cpl. Dwight Brumbaugh. "There were a lot of eyes  looking at us."  </P> <P> Many of those who watched the procession, led by a pair of soldiers wearing  fluorescent-orange vests and followed by a small troop truck, said the troops  cut a strange figure marching among Mercedeses and tank-topped joggers.  </P> <P> John Hamilton, who was visiting a friend on San Joaquin Hills Road, looked  surprised as the Marines trudged by.  </P> <P> "I thought I got through with this sort of stuff a long time ago," said  Hamilton, a World War II veteran.  </P> <P> Others, like Holland, made parallels to movies. "'One minute I'm riding along.  The next thing I know, it's 'Platoon,' " said Jan Ellison of Irvine.  </P> <P> Although these recreational marches are not common outside the county's  military bases, it is up to each individual unit whether to schedule them for a  change of pace, said Marine spokeswoman Cpl. Sharon Farrell.  </P> <P> While hiking, the troops sang or whistled a few marching songs.  </P> <P> But as they neared their goal, they began chanting with vigor. "They were  grunting some Marine talk or something," said Dave Vistaunet, a parking  attendant at Corona del Mar State Beach who watched the soldiers file down  Marguerite Avenue and into the park. "We were wondering what they were doing.  We were going to charge them for parking -- they got four spots," he added,  joking.  </P> <P> Beach-area residents said the troop movement made them uneasy at first.  </P> <P> "It scared me to death. I didn't know what they were doing," said Linda Easter,  who operates a Marguerite Avenue day-care center from her home. "It was neat,  though. At first I thought we were getting into trouble. I mean, with all that  (is) going on nowadays."  </P> <P> Children at the center met the troops and, in a role reversal, gave out  high-fives and candies.  </P> <P> "We were surprised and scared, like there was a war or something," said Megan  Stolte, 8.  </P> <P> After the hike ended at the beach, the troops got out of their boots to relax.  A few of the reservists changed into swim suits.  </P> <P> "It was a simple walk to the beach," said Lt. Col. Ken Derry, a 14-year reserve  veteran, sipping a Coke after the group reached its goal. Even though some  troops were rubbing their sore feet, it could have been worse, Derry said. "We  could have gone to Camp Pendleton," the Marine base in San Diego County, he  said.  </P> <P> Gunnery Sgt. Dana Marshall said the walk reminded him of pictures he saw of  German soldiers marching through European cities during World War II. "I was  glad we were only training," Marshall said.  </P> <P> One reserve spoke of another relief.  </P> <P> When asked about the best part of the hike, Gunnery Sgt. Bob Martinez pointed  to where the hike ended. "It was when we stopped over here," he said, digging  into lunch.  </P></p>

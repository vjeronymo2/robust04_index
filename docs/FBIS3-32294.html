			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 4 Feb, CANA -- Three motions  dealing with the Caribbean Community (Caricom) charter of civil  society, the establishment of a Caribbean court of appeal and an  assembly of Caribbean parliamentarians were unanimously passed  in Guyana's parliament Thursday, but the government ran into  some criticism.    Guyana's foreign minister, Clement Rohee, moving the first  motion on the charter, said it was, in his "humble opinion,"  non-controversial and should be welcomed in all Caricom member  states.    Rohee, however, faced criticism from the main opposition  People's National Congress (PNC) and the small Working People's  Alliance (WPA).    PNC shadow foreign minister, lawyer Clarissa Riehl, noted  that the Guyana cabinet had considered the draft charter at a  sitting in August last year. He said the draft should have been  circulated in high schools, universities and in other public  fora.    Riehl, who said the PNC supported the motion in principle,  questioned whether any consultation on the charter had ever  taken place and what form it would take in the future.    "I would like to know why a copy of the charter was not laid  in parliament itself at some date prior to today's date and even  at a minimum, why a copy of this charter, as a common courtesy,  was not appended to the motion paper," the former magistrate  told parliament.    "This administration, Mr. Speaker, appears to have the  greatest difficulty in assimilating this term -- consultation.  They banter the word around and they don't seem to understand  the meaning of it."    Riehl also asked about the structured programme to raise  public awareness on the charter of civil society, suggesting the  draft copy should have been "sent around" to become a talking  point in the country.    She added: "Mr. Speaker, one gets the distinct impression  also that this government is only paying lip-service to West  Indian togetherness because these things are treated with such  disdain."    Riehl also pointed out several similarities in the charter  with principles enshrined in Guyana's Constitution, which she  said were piloted by the PNC, including equality before the law,  political rights and women's rights.    She urged Rohee to get the "largest number of people"  involved in the consultative process regarding the charter.    WPA leader, economist Clive Thomas, said his party had long  called for such a charter, but added it remained "disappointed"  with the draft.    "I think that the charter, in our age, must be a charter  which moves from the declaration of principles, from the  statement of intent to the activation of enforceable covenants  and rights for people with due procedures and institutions and  mechanisms for redress," Dr. Thomas remarked.    He said the current charter is basically useless without any  mechanisms for enforcement and any legal or other procedures to  ensure it becomes an obligation for caricom states.    "Without the entrenchment of the rights in this charter into  the laws of the institutions and the procedures of this land and  in the rest of the Caribbean, it will remain the piece of paper  on which it is written," he told parliament.    He questioned the point of having a charter talking about  respecting the right to life which at the same time does not set  up standards by which governments should be measured regarding  children and maternal mortality and life expectancy.    "What can be more fundamental to the right of life than  being able to live? How can you have a charter of civil society  that ignores any standards altogether of the determination of  the social rights of people in this caribbean region?" he asked.    "How can you speak about access to social services without  defining precisely and in enforceable terms how people will get  access to education, to health services, to sanitation and so  forth that you can take to the court or some body for redress  because the charter has the force of law?"    Thomas also criticised the West Indian Commission-proposed  charter for the "vaguest of vague" references to environmental  concerns and ignoring Amerindian rights.    "It doesn't even mention the word indigenous, almost as if  it is completely abstracted from Guyana or even the part of the  Caribbean where indigenous peoples still survive," Dr. Thomas  declared.    He said the draft should be nothing more than a starting  point for debate.    The charter, first proposed by the West Indian Commission,  deals with a wide range of issues such as respect for  fundamental civil, political, economic, social and cultural  rights, the rights of women and children, greater accountability  and transparency in governance and a fair and open democratic  process.    Leader of The United Force (TUF), Manzoor Nadir, also said  he supported the bill in principle.    The Guyanese foreign minister defended the charter, saying  the process has to start somewhere. He said it was not drafted  by the Guyana Government, but was a regional document with  inputs from all the countries.    "We have to start the process somewhere," Rohee said. "The  process of consultation will be spread throughout the length and  breadth of Guyana as far our possibilities allow."    Debate, he added, will begin after the motion has been  passed in parliament.    Rohee also denied the Guyana Government has gone to sleep on  a proposal put forward by Trinidad and Tobago's prime minister,  Patrick Manning, calling for an economic and political union  involving Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad.    "The Manning initiative has been overtaken by the proposal  that was raised by the honourable prime minister of Barbados  (Erskine Sandiford) who called for a confederation of Guyana,  Trinidad and Barbados after or during the course of the heads of  government meeting in the Bahamas (in 1993)," Rohee said.    Sandiford, Rohee added, has promised to circulate his  thoughts on the confederation. "It is in the light of that  development, Mr. Speaker, that the Manning initiative lost its  momentum and was overtaken by the proposal advanced by the  distinguished prime minister of Barbados."</p>

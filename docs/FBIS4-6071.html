			<p>BFN     [Text] A government source disclosed on 12 April that, in  connection with concluding the "Prevention of Accidental  Incidents Treaty" with the ROK, the Japanese Government plans to  make no reference to the airspace around Takeshima in the  treaty. In response to suspected nuclear arms development in  the DPRK (North Korea), both governments hope to reach an  agreement on the treaty under which either nation will be  required to give advance notice of flight plans by its military  aircraft. Currently, there exists a territorial dispute between  the two nations over Takeshima.    Japan and the ROK plan to conclude the treaty to prevent  accidents that could occur between Japanese and ROK aircraft on  missions in Tsushima airspace, where Japanese and ROK air  defense identification zones (ADIZ) overlap. However, there  remains a problem as to how the two nations plan to deal with  Takeshima, over which there is a territorial dispute. So far,  Japan has not dared to send off its military aircraft on  missions around this island as it arouse the territorial issue.  Thus, the area has been treated in the same manner as the  northern territories, being set aside as a sort of gray zone in  connection with defense-related matters.    In the process of concluding the agreement, the Japanese  Government has decided to follow its past tradition, planning  not to mention Takeshima in the treaty for the time being and to  only ask for prior notification of planned flights over the  Tsushima Straits, where both nation's military aircraft  frequently fly over.</p>

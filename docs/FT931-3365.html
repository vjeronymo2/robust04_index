			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (10): PW's happy families ACCOUNTING FOR SUCCESS: A HISTORY OF PRICE WATERHOUSE IN AMERICA 1890-1990 by David Grayson Allen and Kathleen McDermott Harvard Business School Press Dollars 35, 373 pages IT WAS booze that first brought accountants from Price Waterhouse to the US in the late 19th century, and big bucks that kept them there as their firm grew into one of the largest practices in the world. In the 1880s, partners travelled from the London office on behalf of British brewing companies to investigate potential American acquisitions. By the early 20th century PW would become an independent firm with twice as many clients in the Fortune 500 as its next largest competitor. Over many decades, there were tensions with the partnership in Britain, which proved highly reluctant to give the US firm autonomy. In 1901 Arthur Dickinson, the British-born head of the US firm, felt the need to justify vulgar advertising in the form of a circular to business contacts announcing his appointment. In a memo to his London partners, he said: 'We cannot afford to sit down and wait for business to come to us as you can in England; our competitors are all much in evidence . . . even assuming that we have a better reputation and do better work . . . does not go far with people like the majority of the Commercial classes here.' Corporate histories deserve to be handled with extreme care. The degree of puff makes most of them slip far too easily from the hand. By allowing two professional writers to do the work, PW took the first step to avoid the worst excesses of the genre. Its editorial control over the content of the final copy is less clear. The sense of independence is not enhanced by a 40-page section listing the name and date of admission of every partner and principal, and a series of photographs resembling the corporate equivalent of a family photo album do not give a good impression of independence. In fact, the book generally manages to maintain a degree of balance, and occasionally it manages to drop in slight indiscretions culled from internal documents and candid interviews with past or present members. In a profession which is notoriously secretive about its finances, one of the more interesting revelations is of PW's substantial profitability during the 1970s. A graph shows that net income as a proportion of fees billed was held in the range of 20 to 25 per cent between 1967 and 1978. But there is little in the book that could be used in evidence against PW. When lawsuits are mentioned, the authors tend to place most emphasis on the firm's defence and rather less on the opposing view. More generally, they periodically lapse into unquestioned praise, or assertions that put PW into a positive light yet which are not justified by their sources. The title of the book is a prime example. Others include such phrases as 'Price Waterhouse's illustrious past century . . . The most interesting theme to emerge from the firm's history is that many of the issues being debated today in the American profession have been consistently under discussion for decades. Perhaps inevitably, the authors spend too much time on PW's contribution without providing sufficient context of the wider issues facing its competitors and the professional bodies. Yet on other issues the reader is left wanting to know more. For example, only a few brief paragraphs are devoted, and without much analysis, to the reasons for the failed mergers with Deloitte in 1984 and Arthur Andersen in 1989. The authors obviously had wide-ranging access to internal working papers which, frustratingly, are unlikely to be made available to other scholars seeking their own interpretation. However, shortfalls aside, Accounting For Success provides a lucid insight into the development of the accountancy profession and one of its largest players over the last century, and is certainly a useful addition to the skimpy existing literature.</p>

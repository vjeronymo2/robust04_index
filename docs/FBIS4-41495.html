			<p>BFN     [Text] Ingushetia has worked out a real plan to bring the  refugees back home in line with President Yeltsin's decree  concerning four communities in North Ossetia's Prigorodniy  region. As Interfax correspondents report, the plan was  announced by Ingushetia's President Ruslan Aushev at a meeting  in the administrative center of Nazran Friday [24 June] night.    He revealed that the first to return to the Dachnoye,  Dongaron, Kurat, and Chermen communities at the initial stage  1-5 July would be the families whose homes are safe. Expected  back within five days from July 5 to 10 will be the refugees  living in temporary dwellings. After that, the rest will return.    Aushev also reported that subsequently more villages would  be  set aside on agreement with the Ossetian authorities for those  Ingush families that had resided there before the conflict.  According to the federal migration service, there are 49,000  Ingush refugees from North Ossetia on the territory of  Ingushetia now.    However, Aushev stressed that the plan could be translated  into action only if the Ossetian side signed a protocol to this  effect.    North Ossetia's President Akhsarbeck Galazov and his  Ingushetia counterpart Aushev are scheduled to meet on Saturday  with Dagestan officials and the interim governor Vladimir  Lozovoy to act as mediators. Representing the Federation  Council will be Ramazan Abdulatipov, its vice-chairman.</p>

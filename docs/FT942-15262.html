			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (13): Thatcher-style public relations - Profile / Tansu Ciller The prime minister is running behind schedule. The man with the face like a cooked ham is a British public relations adviser who used to work for Mrs Margaret Thatcher, her British former counterpart. Another adviser is on the phone to Elle magazine in Germany about the possibility of doing a cover story during Mrs Tansu Ciller's trip to Bonn. Unfortunately, Mrs Ciller's policy achievements have often failed to match the aplomb of her public relations. She is certainly not the 'agent of change' that one western ambassador suggested. But for all her lack of experience, she has a strong instinct for survival. Her party's narrow victory in local polls on March 27 is largely put down to her popularity. The man on the street says that she should be given the benefit of the doubt. It is hard to find a shopkeeper who blames her for the economic mess - though that is not the view in the boardrooms and banking halls of Istanbul. Mrs Ciller is a walking contradiction. A successful, independently wealthy woman in a male-dominated, Moslem society, she seems equally at home donning the headscarf in deference to Islam or a football scarf in support of the soccer team Galatasaray's short-lived but heroic run in the European Cup. Her rise to power owes much to the patronage of Mr Suleyman Demirel, the former prime minister, whose election to the presidency paved the way for Mrs Ciller's leadership victory. Mr Demirel was reportedly impressed by her robust criticisms of the late Turgut Ozal, then Motherland party prime minister, when she worked for Tusiad, the businessmen's association. During the election campaign of 1990, Mrs Ciller was frequently photographed on Mr Demirel's right hand. It worked for the six-times prime minister. His True Path party won the election, though without an outright majority. What perhaps he did not count on was having to give Mrs Ciller a senior cabinet position. After more than 10 months in office, Mrs Ciller's hold on power is still something of a mystery. Her impetuous management style has shaken the crusty bureaucrats in Ankara. The casualty list is impressive - two central bank governors have resigned since she became prime minister. The former head of the state planning organisation has become one of her most virulent public critics. Her victory in the True Path party congress in June 1993 over Mrs Ismet Sezgin, nominally the choice of Mr Demirel, is largely unexplained. She seemed genuinely puzzled when asked during the campaign how many party MPs could be relied on to vote for her. One senior DYP figure says none of the cabinet supported her candidacy. Mrs Ciller, a 48-year-old former Istanbul economics professor, is in many ways a political 'naif'. The Turkish press has been kind. Despite rumours about her husband's irregular business dealings - particularly about the collapse in the 1980s of the Istanbul Bank, of which he was a director - there seems to be no Whitewater waiting to engulf the prime minister. Cynics point out that Mrs Ciller helped the newspapers financially with generous tax breaks and investment incentives just before the leadership challenge. Her economic policies will continue to be under close scrutiny, but her political ideas remain obscure. Her strong line on the Kurds clearly served her well in the local elections. Indeed, one of the most lasting impressions of her administration has been the way she has accommodated the military - in the fight against the Kurds and in the more parochial matter of pay rises for the armed forces and the extension of the service of General Dogan Gures, the chief of general staff. Gen Gures was among the first of the public figures to applaud Mrs Ciller's recently unveiled austerity package.</p>

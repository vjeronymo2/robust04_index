			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Arts: Back to new music - BBC Proms The BBC has a proud tradition of encouraging new music in Britain. However noble, this is work for which it is difficult to get recognition and the opportunity afforded by the 100th season of the Promenade Concerts is predictably one that the BBC has seized with alacrity. Under the general theme of looking back, this year's programme incorporates a selection of past BBC Proms' commissions. There is no point in being sentimental about this. Many - possibly most - are heard once and never again. Even a Maecenas as bountiful and well-informed as the BBC only strikes lucky occasionally in the difficult world of contemporary classical music. Ostensibly, the Proms' director has selected the half dozen or so works being revived this year, but in reality the sifting process has already taken place over the years. On Monday and Tuesday we heard again two of those which have found life for themselves beyond their first performances - each surviving through some popular appeal, though of different kinds. Monday's choice was Nicholas Maw's Scenes and Arias. Written in 1962, revised four years later, it now has five Proms' outings to its credit. Its attraction is a sultry, sun-soaked romanticism, which involves orchestral textures so dense as almost to engulf the three female singers (here the splendid trio of Elizabeth Woollett, Susan Bickley and Jean Rigby). Although one can trace a descendency from Mahler to Tippett, Maw established a voice of his own in this score. All it lacks is variety: one gets sated by so much generalised richness before the half-hour is up. On Tuesday, James MacMillan's The Confession of Isobel Gowdie (first performed in 1990) lasted the same length of time, but felt much shorter. The canny Scottish composer dramatises his material strongly and provides unmissable markers so that the audience knows where it is within the piece. Stravinsky is the main influence here, especially The Rite of Spring, but there is a drive in the music which cannot come just from emulation. As a single, near 30-minute movement, it is an impressive achievement and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under Jerzy Maksymiuk made an exciting job of it. Each of the concerts also included a piano concerto. Monday's Prom had Mark Elder and the BBC Symphony Orchestra providing a spruce accompaniment for Mitsuko Uchida in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, but their tidiness remained prosaic, where hers became elfin-light precision. The next night Kathryn Stott was the soloist in a demure performance of Rakhmaninov's Third Piano Concerto, which made up in detail and musicianship what it lacked in animal red-bloodedness. One point to her credit: she played the big cadenza in the first movement with more right notes than I have heard before.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, 6 June (YONHAP) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam held an extended summit meeting Monday [6 June]  with his Uzbekistani counterpart Islam Karimov to discuss  promoting economic cooperation and enhancing the rights and  interests of ethnic Koreans living in Uzbekistan.    Kim suggested that the two countries sign a treaty on the  use  of natural resources and set up a trade committee to activate  trade and investment, according to officials accompanying the  president.    The South Korean president called on the Uzbekistan  Government to prepare measures soon to expand cooperation in  construction and various technologies while Karimov welcomed the  request and promised to take the necessary steps, the officials  said.    Welcoming the present state of active trading and  joint-venture projects in some fields, the two presidents shared  the view that the Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding  (MOU) signed during Kim's visit will help boost bilateral  exchanges in various areas, the officials said.    The agreements and MOUs signed during the past days cover  aviation, culture, free passage, bioengineering and agricultural  technology.    Expressing thanks to the Uzbekistan Government and its  people  for helping ethnic Koreans who were trying to resettle after  being forcibly taken to Uzbekistan from the Russian Far East  under the rule of Josef Stalin, Kim asked Uzbekistan to continue  protecting the rights and interests of these Koreans, according  to the officials.    In particular, Kim stressed that ethnic Koreans could play a  role in building relations between the two countries, they said.    Karimov, meanwhile, emphasized that the 200,000 ethnic  Koreans in Uzbekistan are proper citizens under Uzbekistani law  and, therefore, will not be subjected to discrimination or  unfair treatment under any circumstances, the officials said.    Uzbekistan's president praised ethnic Koreans for their role  in developing the country and pointed out that some are serving  as high-level officials including vice minister, according to  the officials.    Kim and Karimov witnessed the signing of agreements on  aviation and other fields before giving a joint new conference.    Kim was to leave for the Russian Far East city of Khabarovsk  Monday afternoon after an official send-off ceremony at Tashkent  airport, winding up his three-day state visit to Uzbekistan.    Kim will also visit Vladivostok and meet with Naval  commanders at Russia's Pacific fleet headquartered in the  Russian Far East city. While there, Kim will go on an  observation tour of a submarine and other naval equipment before  returning to Seoul late Tuesday.</p>

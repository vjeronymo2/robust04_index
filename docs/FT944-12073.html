			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Business 'bounce back' reported Optimism about trading prospects over the next year is rising among medium-sized companies, which are bouncing back strongly from the recession, National Westminster Bank said yesterday. Medium-sized businesses - those with sales of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 130m - are once again net borrowers after three years spent repaying debt and reducing overdrafts, the bank says in a quarterly survey. However, recovery in some sectors such as retailing is still 'patchy', with profit margins under severe pressure, it warns. But in aggregate the medium-sized companies are increasing net long-term borrowing more quickly than they are reducing overdrafts, the bank says. Businesses in this category account for 30 per cent of gross domestic product in the UK and employ 8m people, nearly 40 per cent of the non-government labour force. As a result of downsizing and outsourcing by companies with sales of more than Pounds 130m, the medium-sized companies' importance was growing both in terms of share of GDP and share of employment. Three quarters expect their businesses to do better next year and two thirds believe the economy will improve. A significant number of these companies expect to increase employment over the next three months. Part of the survey was based on a survey of NatWest bankers dealing with these medium-sized companies. They said the sector's overall growth was not at present constrained by lack of access to capital. 'Lack of finance is now not the issue,' said Mr Kevin Jennings, director of commercial marketing. 'Over the last few months getting orders has been the real issue for companies with sales of Pounds 10m to Pounds 40m.' Mid-Corporate Directions. National Westminster Bank, Tel: 071 454 2613.

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER LODE COUNTY'S CEMETERIES YIELD TREASURE TROVE OF AREA LORE  </P> <P> Four generations of Hart Ralph Tambs' family are buried in the Sonora  Historical Cemetery. That is where he found the grave of his great-uncle Fred  O. Ralph, who died in 1873, a relative he had not realized was buried there. He  also found the grave marker of a first cousin who died when he was 25 days old.  </P> <P> But when he looked a week later, the marker had been stolen. Tambs, 67,  discovered that such incidents are commonplace and result in many people being  unable to locate their ancestors' graves.  </P> <P> "There were markers for everyone at one time," he said. "Those missing were  stolen or destroyed by vandals."  </P> <P> Tambs decided to do a plot map of the Sonora cemetery. He also has mapped six  other cemeteries in the area and has plans to do 23 more. It is his gift to the  people in this Mother Lode community in the Sierra Nevada foothills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unscrambling a Puzzle  </P> <P> And on a personal level, it is a puzzle he never tires of trying to unscramble.  </P> <P> "Look at this faded headstone," Tambs said as he began reading it to a visitor.  " 'Erected by S. G. to the memory of Nelly, Jan. 14, 1861.' I'm going to do  some research and find out who S. G. and Nelly were. I'll bet there's a good  story there."  </P> <P> Tambs is just completing his survey of the Sonora Historical Cemetery.  Townspeople call it "the old cemetery on the hill."  </P> <P> All the cemetery maps and records had been lost, so Tambs had to copy the  inscriptions from all 1,060 markers. Poring through county records, he found  information about 619 other people buried there whose graves are now unmarked.  From all this information, he pieced together a plot map.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, all the cemetery plot maps in the county have disappeared over  the years," Tambs said. "People go to the cemeteries and look for graves of  loved ones or ancestors who died years ago and can't find them. This will  help."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retirement Project  </P> <P> Altogether, Tambs is doing plot maps for 30 known cemeteries in Tuolumne  County. It is a voluntary effort, his retirement project. (He retired in 1975  from his job as an engineer for Pacific Telephone Co.)  </P> <P> One thing he has not figured out is what motivates graveyard vandals.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to understand why anyone would desecrate a grave, but it  happens all the time. An average of six grave markers a week have been  vandalized or stolen while I have been doing the survey in this cemetery," he  said. Some steal headstones and put them in their back yards. Can you imagine  that?"  </P> <P> He encountered a heavy concrete marker that had been knocked off its concrete  base and broken in two. "It took more than one person to knock that one over,"  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Damaged Headstone  </P> <P> The inscription on the damaged headstone read:  </P> <P> "Magie Mersereau. Died March 30, 1884. Aged 24 years &amp; 26 days. Goodby  Babies dear. As I can no longer be here. To Heaven have Gone. Will meet you  there."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heart-Shaped Stone  </P> <P> Nearby was a tombstone, flat on the ground, in the shape of a heart with the  inscription: "Susan Hester Curnow. Died March 21, 1910." Tambs pointed out the  oldest tombstone in the graveyard, that of Louise Lepaper, who was born in  Paris in 1824 and died in Jamestown in 1856.  </P> <P> To get information from old, weathered wooden markers, Tambs waits until the  sun is just right, with the light coming in at a 45-degree angle. To help him  read the faded inscriptions he uses powder, chalk and magnifying glasses.  </P> <P> One tombstone was for William K. Rushing (1835-1880), a rancher. A nearby  mountain is named in his honor. At the headstone for Happy Hen Chow Ng  (1856-1948) Tambs remarked: "He was the last resident of Sonora's Chinatown. I  knew him when I was a boy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Much to Be Learned'  </P> <P> "There's so much to be learned in the cemetery. The history of the whole area  is here."  </P> <P> Tambs has prepared plot maps of the old cemeteries in Columbia, the  19th-Century Gold Rush town now a state historic park. Sharon Grout, a ranger  at the park the last 11 years who oversees the cemeteries, lamented the  vandalism, especially by Satanists.  </P> <P> "Devil worshipers scrawl anti-religious pentagrams on the tombstones. They  knock over grave markers and destroy them. We have caught groups in the  cemetery at night when there is no reason for anyone to be there," Grout said.  </P></p>

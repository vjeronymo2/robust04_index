			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Dobson Park 21% down and 'cautious' DOBSON PARK Industries, which faces falling sales of mining equipment because of the threatened closure of British Coal pits, yesterday reported a 21 per cent downturn in pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.3m for the 53 weeks to October 3. The directors said trading remained gloomy and the company was unable to give 'any indication' about future dividend levels. Mr Alan Kaye, chairman, said UK and overseas markets for the company's mining equipment, instrumentation and power tools would remain difficult. 'That's why we are taking a cautious stance. It would be unwise to predict we'll make more next year,' he said. The profits fall, down from the Pounds 13.1m recorded for the 52 weeks to September 28 last year, was mainly due to recession in Europe and lower sales of industrial electronics products to US defence and aerospace companies. The final dividend was maintained at 3.85p to make an unchanged total of 5.75p. Turnover fell to Pounds 209.3m (Pounds 233.7m), mainly due to a Pounds 21m fall in mining equipment sales. However, benefits from previous years' restructuring helped limit the fall in the division's operating profits from Pounds 6.64m to Pounds 6.44m. About half the division's sales went to British Coal, mainly for rebuilding work on older equipment. New equipment sales to British Coal were depressed. Operating profits from industrial electronics fell to Pounds 4.63m (Pounds 5.48m) while power tools reported a loss of Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 995,000 profit). Reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 2.5m) were charged, and the payroll fell more than 4,000 to 3,615. Net interest costs increased to Pounds 1.05m (Pounds 858,000), but net borrowings declined to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 11.1m) cutting gearing by 2 percentage points to 12 per cent. Earnings emerged at 5.52p (7.05p) per share. COMMENT Dobson Park is seen as an income stock, so the clear warning on the dividend might have been expected to be more damaging on the shares than yesterday's 4p fall to 58p. But the market half expected a cut this time and the shares have some support at this level, a ten-year low. With British Coal, most of the damage stems from uncertainty about how many pits will close. Once a decision is made - the company hopes in January - second hand equipment will be transferred out of decommissioned pits and sent to Dobson for reconstruction. But new orders are likely to remain very low. Assuming an early decision on pit closures, profit forecasts of Pounds 9m to Pounds 9.5m are possible, especially if a timely property disposal can be made. This is well short of the Pounds 11m needed to cover the dividend, suggesting a cut is likely next year and further pressure on the share price until then.</p>

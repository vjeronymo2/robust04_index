			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 13 Jun (EFE) -- Research carried out by  polling enterprises shows that the Peruvian presidential  candidate with the best chance of winning the 1995 elections is  one who is independent and able to solve the unemployment  problem, the economic crisis, and the hunger problem.    Here are the issues that currently worry Peruvian's the  most:  unemployment (31.4 percent), the economic crisis (21.7 percent),  terrorism (18.1 percent), low salaries (6.6 percent), hunger  (5.9 percent), education (4.4 percent), drug trafficking (4.2  percent), and corruption (3.6 percent).    The poll conducted by the Imasen enterprise reveals that  former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's chances  have dropped to 28.3 percent while current President Alberto  Fujimori enjoys the support of 39.8 percent.    Perez de Cuellar's popularity probably dropped due to his  delay in deciding whether or not to run in the April 1995  elections.    If Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar went to a second round,  Fujimori would obtain 46.8 percent and Perez de Cuellar 40.3  percent.    A survey by Imasen in April showed the electoral preference  also leaned in Fujimori's favor with 45.6 percent compared to  43.6 percent for the former UN secretary general.    Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont, who has just announced his  candidacy, received 14 percent support while former President  Fernando Belaunde received only one percent.    Belaunde's electoral campaign, which started a few months  ago, appears the most aggressive.    "Authoritarianism must not continue at Government Palace,"  stated Belaunde who said the article of the 1993 Constitution  that authorizes immediate presidential reelection "is an  adventure that harms the people of Peru and America."    The Datum polling enterprise announced that the candidate  must establish a real relationship with electors because his  success or failure relies on a harmony between what he preaches  and what the people need.    Another polling enterprise, CPI [expansion unknown], has  found the candidates must appear independent and must reconcile  social aspects with the modernization of the economy.    Other enterprises maintain that the discrepancies between  what candidates promise during campaigns and what happens once  elected has caused the people to disbelieve in political  speeches.    The Forum enterprise has stated that "nefarious experiences  of the past mean the people no longer want political speeches,  rather direct messages, free of superfluous words."</p>

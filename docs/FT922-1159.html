			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rebounds by 1.2 per cent in thin trade SHORT-COVERING of positions and small-lot bargain hunting took the Nikkei average back above the 16,000 level yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei gained 185.77, or 1.2 per cent, to 16,106.99 in a thin market after a day's low of 15,860.90 and high of 16,215.38, share prices fluctuating on movements in the futures markets. Volume declined from 244m shares to 220m. In spite of the rise in the Nikkei, falls led advances by 469 to 448, with 177 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks picked up 7.03 to 1,247.21, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead 0.59 to 976.18. Reports that the government was considering the allocation of Y5,000bn to a supplementary budget prompted dealers to cover short positions in the futures market. The government is expected to announce a fiscal or monetary stimulus to support the sluggish economy ahead of the G7 summit meeting next month. However, market participants also seem to be worried that politicians might be paying lip service to the idea, or that the figures involved could be speculative. Daiwa Securities said that as long as domestic institutions did not come back into the market, a rise in share prices would be unlikely. 'The problem is that nobody feels the urgency to buy now,' added a Daiwa analyst. High-technology blue chips, however, were sought by trust banks and foreign investors. NEC put on Y6 to Y820 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 to Y1,290, although Toshiba shed Y8 to Y592 as some institutional investors liquidated holdings. Real estate issues rebounded, some investors believing that the sector was oversold. Daikyo gained Y5 to Y675, rising for the first time in eight trading days, and Mitsubishi Estate firmed Y4 to Y745. Steels, previously sold on earnings worries, gained ground. Nippon Steel rallied Y6 to Y269 and NKK Y8 to Y249. Short-term trading moved up some speculative theme stocks. Meiji Milk, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y19 to Y1,010 and Snow Brand Milk Y15 to Y806. In Osaka, the OSE average improved 45.39 to 19,045.91 in volume of 12.4m shares. Roundup THE BOUNCE in Tokyo failed to have much effect on other markets in the Pacific Basin. HONG KONG moved forward for a second consecutive day, as a wave of afternoon buying buried earlier losses. The Hang Seng index shot up 77.92, the biggest gain in more than three weeks, to 5,897.86 as turnover grew to HKDollars 2.99bn from HKDollars 2.73bn. NEW ZEALAND finished broadly lower as the recent jitters on the Tokyo stock market again kept buyers on the sidelines. The approaching July 2 announcement of the government's annual budget is also having its traditional dampening effect on the market. The NZSE-40 index closed 14.17 down at 1,516.36 and turnover eased to NZDollars 21.3m (NZDollars 23.9m). Brierley Investments lost 3 cents to 96 cents in volume of 4.2m, the most active issue in the market. There have been rumours that it is planning to sell some or all of its 16 per cent stake in Carter Holt Harvey to International Paper, of the US, which already owns an equal stake in CHH. TAIWAN declined in active trading as strong early gains were eroded by steady selling pressure. The weighted index dipped 7.18 to 4,690.48 in turnover of TDollars 61.5bn (TDollars 49.2bn). AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index added 7.6 at 1,643.9 in turnover of ADollars 266m, after ADollars 175m, as some large lines of shares were dealt on the market. Gold mining issues rose in line with an increase in the bullion price. MANILA tumbled on profit-taking after news that the Philippine Congress late on Monday had proclaimed Mr Fidel Ramos, the former defence secretary, as the next president. The composite index dropped 65.68 to 1,453.86 in turnover of 190m pesos, after 245m. The Dollars 2 3/4 fall to Dollars 35 3/8 in PLDT in overnight US trading caused other commercial and industrial issues to decline. KUALA LUMPUR ended mixed after light trading. The composite index was off 0.53 at 593.52. In SINGAPORE, shares closed little changed as cautious sentiment kept most investors away. The Straits Times Industrial index firmed 1.86 to 1,490.64. Turnover rose to SDollars 144.6m from SDollars 78.6m. Activity centred on the re-listed Goldtron, formerly Gold Coin, which was taken over by Acma Holdings. Some 98.2m shares were traded, the majority of which were said to be placed by Acma. Blocks were traded at between 59.4 and 68 cents a share. DHAKA extended its upward trend in heavy trading, encouraged by the Bangladesh government's decision to waive gains tax on shares and securities from July 1. The all-share index climbed 5.2 to 347.7.</p>

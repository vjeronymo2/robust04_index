			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / French truck strike losses disputed: Government and employers differ over impact on economy THE French government and employers yesterday differed sharply over the scale of the economic damage inflicted by the 10-day truck strike. Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, said supply shortages had seriously hit some companies but would have no impact on national economic growth, set to reach 2 per cent this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, head of the economics commission of the Patronat employers' group, insisted that the damage could harm growth. 'We believe this great Gallic event has discredited and weakened us,' he added. Several industrial federations called on the government yesterday to allow them a moratorium on tax and social security payments, in order to help them through the cash flow shortage caused by the strike. 'Several thousand industrial companies have been forced to make lay-offs and have lost sales, especially in export markets, at the moment when the general economy is in a marked slowdown,' said a joint statement by the steel, mechanical, chemical, textile and electrical industry federations. Farming and tourism are the worst-hit sectors, said Mr Sapin. The government would decide on assistance case by case, through the inter-ministerial industrial restructuring committee (Ciri). The government would consider requests for aid from foreign companies which had lost money because of the strike, but help would go to French businesses first, said Mr Sapin. The ABF French banking association yesterday called on its members to show 'understanding and flexibility' towards companies in difficulty and to study the situation with local authorities and professional groups. Small businesses are likely to be worst hit, said the ABF. The direct damage to French and foreign companies caught up in the stoppage is variously estimated at well below FFr5bn (Pounds 500m) by finance ministry officials and and 'several billion francs' by the Patronat. The employers estimate that a loss of five days' production would be equivalent to 2 per cent of a year's total gross domestic product, but is not sure yet how many full days of production have actually been lost. It expects to produce a more precise estimate in the next few days. Farmers angry at EC agricultural reforms ransacked two supermarkets in the southern town of Nimes, and dockers set up their own road blockade in the south-western port of Bordeaux yesterday to protest against reforms in their pay and working conditions, Reuter reports from Paris. The profusion of street protests this summer - radical farmers attempted to blockade Paris last month - highlights the fragility of the unions and of worker representation in France despite 11 years of almost uninterrupted Socialist rule. A recurring government complaint during the truckers' dispute was that the protesters had no representative spokesmen. Only 10 per cent of French workers are unionised, and in a sector such as trucking, where many are self-employed, dialogue with the government has proved difficult. See editorial comment</p>

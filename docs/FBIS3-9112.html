			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Knin, 18 Mar (TANJUG) -- The Executive Committee  of the Serb Democratic Party of Krajina [SDSK], chaired by  former Krajina President Milan Babic, today rejected a proposal  put forward by Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serb  Krajina, to appoint Borislav Mikelic as prime minister of the  new Krajina government, this party announced today.    The announcement says that the appointment of Borislav  Mikelic as the new RSK government's prime minister-designate  represents an act of ignoring the will of the parliamentary  majority, which is a constitutional obligation and common  practice in parliamentary democracies throughout the world.    It has also been said that this party was in favor of a  national unity government, "remaining open to negotiations on  the composition of the government with all political factors,  which is in the national interest."

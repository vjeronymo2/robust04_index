			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Dispatch" report from the station's theoretical </F> reporter from the province's rural work conference: "How To  Help Peasants Hold Their Ground in Markets"]    [Text] For people throughout Liaoning, the year of 1993 is  inspiring. As of 1993, the province has consecutively  stabilized its grain output of more than 15 billion kg in the  last four years. The province has basically become  self-supporting in its supply of grains and major nonstaple  foodstuffs. The long-standing economic pattern with its large  portion of industrial production and small agricultural  production portion has incurred fundamental change. This is a  historical breakthrough made by the province in its economic  development. However, the major topic discussed at the  provincial rural work conference was not aimed at maintaining  the achievements. Opinions raised at provincial rural work  conferences by attendants from units at province, city, county,  and district levels were concentrated on how to guide peasants  to enter markets and how to deal with the deep-rooted problems  of rural areas.    During the discussion at the provincial rural work  conference  (Ding Zhonghuo), mayor of Kaiyuan city, described problems they  ran into the city's called on peasants to plant a large number  of hawthorn trees and to greatly develop the production of wild  sesame over the past few years in order to help peasants  increase their incomes. It was unfortunate that the 7.5 million  tonnes of hawthorns produced this year were not sold out and  peasants who had engaged in the cultivation of wild sesame also  suffered losses. Thus, the government's good deeds for the  people have ended in complaints being heard everywhere.    After hearing the speech made at the discussion by the mayor  of Kaiyuan city, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party  committee, said: This experience shows us that we no longer  need to do such things without [words indistinct]. He urged  leading personnel at all levels to make more efforts in the  future to study the affairs of markets, to establish markets,  and to do a good job in conducting market management. Efforts  should be made to reduce the blindness in the rural work and to  deal with in a down-to-earth manner, the problems encountered by  peasants who have already entered markets so as to enable  peasants to hold their ground in markets.    In discussing the issue of developing secondary and tertiary  industries during the provincial work conference, the  participating personnel from various counties and districts  generally professed a shortage of funds. (Zhang Hong),  secretary of the Dongming district party committee in Shenyang,  voiced his opinions during the discussion and said: The 80  percent of investments made in the secondary and tertiary  industries of Dongming district in 1993 come from funds raised  by peasants. Participants at the discussion were surprised by  continuously nodding their head. Many participating comrades  said: Developing secondary and tertiary industries at county  and district levels by depending on banks, loans, and [words  indistinct] is not a good long-term method. We should share  development with rural areas and develop systems of shareholding  and cooperation in rural areas with peasants who possess funds.    It was pointed out at the discussion that currently, the  slow  progress in purchasing grains was a prominent problem that will  result in large differences in grain prices. Turning the  contract for purchasing fixed-quota grains into an economic  contract for procuring grains will cause deep-rooted problems of  distrust between the government and peasants. In citing the  issue of how to establish a rational mechanism of grain purchase  and sale to foster the mechanism of the province's grain  markets, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  put forward the following three principles: 1) Efforts should  be made not only to take the state interests into consideration  but also to give more profits to peasants. 2) Attention should  be paid to building small cities that may serve as bridges to  the advance of rural areas into markets. 3) Efforts should be  made to regard changes in several rural policies as supportive,  keep up with the ideological education conducted among peasants,  make formal deals with peasants, and refrain from neglecting the  ideological education of peasants.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Violence tips Algiers toward compromise: Francis Ghiles on the political and economic turmoil which followed cancelled elections The Algerian government is ready to hold talks with Islamic opposition groups, but only if the violence sweeping the country is halted. 'If we have to talk with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), we will. The essential pre-condition is that the FIS must cease all violence. What is also essential is that the Algerian people take their destiny in their own hands,' said Mr Mokdad Sifi, Algerian prime minister, in an interview. The premier claimed the government was not responsible for the country's political and economic turmoil, or the causes which led to it. Economic improvements and a more hopeful political future are proving elusive in the climate of insecurity which has characterised Algeria since the FIS was denied victory by the cancellation of the 1992 election results which had seemed certain to sweep the Islamic party to power. Worsening violence is causing ever-greater damage to the nation's infrastructure, the death toll is rising remorselessly, while the benefits of a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 653m) loan agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund in April may only be felt slowly. The cost of damage to the country's infrastructure over the past two years is estimated at more than Dollars 1.3bn. Schools and universities have been increasingly targeted by the more extreme members of the Islamic Armed Group (GIA); more than 400 schools have been set on fire in the past 12 months. Two weeks ago the medical faculty in the eastern provincial capital of Constantine was reduced to ashes, and fierce fighting in the city left scores dead. Forest fires this summer, often started by the security forces to flush out Islamic groups, have caused extensive damage, especially to olive groves in eastern Algeria. No area of the country today is safe, violence having spread this summer to the Berber heartland of Kabylia. The cost in lives, now put at about 11,000, has also been growing. Not only are the fundamentalists pitted against the army-backed government, but confrontation is growing between the GIA, which is active around Algiers, and supporters of the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) which owes allegiance to the outlawed FIS. The GIA has sought to sabotage tentative steps towards a dialogue between General Liamine Zeroual, the head of state, and some senior FIS leaders. It has also threatened to 'burn or dynamite' all schools and universities which open their doors this autumn, and said 'severe sanctions' would be taken against students and teachers who attended classes. The deadly competition between the FIS and the GIA is leading to violent vendettas, and denunciations by elders of the FIS, such as Mr Abdelbaki Sahraoui, who claim the GIA is acting as an accomplice to the military. The GIA, which has claimed responsibility for the deaths of most of the 60 foreigners killed during the past 12 months, has repeatedly refused to contemplate negotiations with an 'un-pious state'. Gen Zeroual says he wants to start a dialogue, but seems unwilling or unable to release the leaders of the FIS held since June 1991. The FIS, which is finding it difficult to control its supporters, says it would like to begin talks but not until its leaders are released. It has condemned the killing of foreigners, the burning of schools and the threats to teachers and students. Against this background, most of the more promising conditions that Mr Sifi and his government are seeking to create are most likely to stem from the IMF agreement and the subsequent rescheduling of part of Algeria's Dollars 26.7bn foreign debt, thus reducing the cost of servicing this year from Dollars 9.4bn to Dollars 5.06bn. This should allow last year's 1.8 per cent decline in real gross domestic product to be reversed, and provide growth in 1994 of about 2 per cent. Capital goods investment in industry should rise from Dollars 7.99bn to just above Dollars 9bn and help boost activity in myriad state and private companies which have been starved of imports over the past two years as the debt service ratio has risen to absorb 86.4 per cent of total exports in 1993. Three factors explain why the quick benefits the IMF agreements were supposed to bring will materialise only slowly. First, the shortage of foreign currency alone is not the root cause of Algeria's economic crisis. In the words of one senior diplomat: 'Injecting cash into a semi-paralysed network of state companies will not turn them into athletes overnight.' Second, in critical areas such as the severe lack of housing it is unrealistic, according to one senior official, to expect more than 50,000 new units to be built this year, against the estimated requirement of some 1.2m units. Despite the fact that it takes, on average, eight years to complete an apartment block in Algiers, private builders remain hostile to importing pre-fabricated units. The increasing unwillingness of foreign governments and companies to send representatives to Algeria is also slowing decision-making in all fields. Third, this year's severe drought has cut farming output and will force Algeria to import more than 90 per cent of its cereal requirements, compared with a 70-75 per cent average in better years. Foreign embassies, meanwhile, are closing down or reducing their staff dramatically. The daring and precision of the GIA's attack on the French diplomatic compound at Ain Allah in early August, which cost the lives of three gendarmes and two consular officials, has sent shivers through the diplomatic community. Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Holland and Switzerland have now closed their embassies, albeit temporarily. More than at any time since the suspension of elections it appears that only some form of compromise between the army and the FIS will avert a fully fledged civil war.</p>

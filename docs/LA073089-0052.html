			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA SCHOOLS CHIEF TO RETIRE FROM DISTRICT POST  </P> <P> Phillip B. Jordan, who has been superintendent of the Pasadena Unified School  District since 1985, has announced he will retire in January.  </P> <P> Jordan said he will be 59 and will have spent 35 years in education by the  beginning of next year. His wife has already retired. She was a teacher in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The decision to retire seemed to catch the school board by surprise, Jordan  said, even though he had told board members when he was hired that he would not  stay more than four years. The board has not yet begun to discuss selection of  a successor.  </P> <P> Jordan said he plans to continue living in Pasadena and to spend more time with  his family, which includes six children and six grandchildren. Before he was  hired in Pasadena, Jordan was superintendent of one of eight administrative  regions in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Jordan said he might  consider working as an educational consultant after he has spent six months in  retirement.  </P></p>

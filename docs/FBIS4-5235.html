			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, beset by dogging corruption charges over his financial  deals and a Diet stalemate, said Friday [8 April] he will step  down to take "moral" responsibility for the political turmoil.    Hosokawa said he will bow out after only eight months in  office because personal affairs have stymied Diet business,  saying it is a problem concerning "morality of politics."    Hosokawa officially offered his resignation at an emergency  cabinet meeting after making a surprise announcement to a  hastily summoned meeting of leaders of the coalition partners,  coalition officials said.    He told a press conference that fresh revelations about  "legally suspicious" financial dealings involving his private  office prompted him to make the decision.    The new revelations came to his attention Thursday night,  the  premier said.    Hosokawa said the new allegations include receiving interest  on a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted  trucking business group, as political contributions and gaining  profits from dealings using political donations.    It is not yet decided when the cabinet will resign en bloc,  the officials said.    Hosokawa, who was swept to power last August with a vow to  cleanse the nation's political scene of corruption, has come  under attack over a controversial loan from Sagawa Kyubin and  another financial deal related with the purchase of shares in  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT).    The row over the dealings has led to a stalemate in  parliament, paralyzing deliberations on the budget for fiscal  1994, which started on April 1.    Hosokawa's public support, which was at over 70 percent  immediately after he took office, has been on a steady decline  in recent weeks.    Hosokawa's announcement has sent coalition leaders  scrambling  to find his successor and prompted some members of the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to utter interest in  taking part in the new cabinet.    Some coalition kingpins mentioned the name of Tsutomu Hata,  deputy prime minister and foreign minister, who heads Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party].    Hajime Funada, a Shinseito executive in charge of election  affairs, said he favors Hata as the person to succeed Hosokawa.    "It is a natural course for our party to seek Hata's  premiership," Funada said.    Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa also supported the  idea.    "I think Hata is acceptable (as the new premier)," he said.    Michio Watanabe of the opposition LDP, a former foreign  minister, hinted at a possible alliance with the ruling  coalition.    "Japan is in a crisis," he said. "We should join forces with  the people that have the same idea to surmount the crisis."    Koji Omi, another LDP policy-maker, said, "it is an  emergency. We should establish the conditions to cope with the  situation through nonpartisan efforts."    Hosokawa's bombshell announcement came only two days after  he  strongly denied news reports that he jokingly said he wanted to  quit.    The unabatable corruption charges concerning the two  financial deals have taken a heavy toll on his public support  and undermined his already-shaky leadership in the seven-party  coalition.    Hosokawa reiterated that he repaid the 100 million yen loan  in 1982 from Sagawa and dismissed any corruption charges over  the NTT share purchase, which he has claimed was conducted by  his late father-in-law.    The LDP has been boycotting debate in the House of  Representatives Budget Committee, demanding Diet testimony of  Hosokawa's former aide over the Sagawa loan issue. Hosokawa has  rejected the demand.    LDP President Yohei Kono said Hosokawa's responsibility for  the Diet stalemate is "heavy."    Some coalition members dismissed the possibility of linking  up with the LDP.    Shusei Tanaka, a senior policy maker of new party Sakigake  [Harbinger], said, "there is no chance that the coalition will  contribute to an LDP government or lend a hand to the LDP under  current conditions."    The Sagawa scandal helped topple the LDP from power after  nearly four decades of often corrupt rule, and paved the way for  Hosokawa's alliance of conservative LDP splinter groups and  traditional opposition parties like the Social Democratic Party  (SDP).    In pursuing his avowed goal of cleaning up Japan's political  system, Hosokawa pushed through a political reform package in  January that replaces multiseat districts with a combination of  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation seats  for the lower house.    But his political standing weakened markedly after he was  forced in February by strong opposition from within his own  coalition to withdraw his announced plan to introduce a new  value-added tax to replace the current consumption tax.    Recent corruption allegations came on top of the tax fiasco  and an aborted plan for a cabinet reshuffle, which widened the  hiatus between Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura.</p>

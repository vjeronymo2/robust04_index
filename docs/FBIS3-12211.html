He pointed out that the  world community has gotten used to Israeli massacres.    Ambassador 'Imran noted that this is not the first and will  not be the last massacre unless real international deterrent  measures are taken. He pointed out that the Israeli settlement  policy defies the Geneva Conventions and the UN Security Council  resolutions. He added that this policy was not made by settlers  but by the Israeli governments, which set up these settlements,  are responsible for arming the settlers to seize Arab  territories, and permitted them to use their weapons at their  personal discretion. This, he added, shows that the Israeli  authorities are responsible for writing the scenario of the  massacre.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Combat aircraft yesterday parachuted fuel, war  materiel, and foodstuffs for People's Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] units besieged in Cuito. Our  correspondent reports that the seven parachutes fell into Armed  Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] defense lines at  1500. FAPLA units and riot policemen tried in vain to retrieve  the parachutes, violating the glorious FALA forces' defense  lines, using intense fire backed by heavy and self-propelled  artillery pieces.    FALA forces had no option but to defend themselves. After an  intense 40-minute clash, Jose Eduardo dos Santos' adventurers  were forced to beat a hasty retreat [words indistinct]  abandoning large quantities of war materiel. The clashes took  place in (Cambulucuco) Ward and in the former Fermina school.  The incident occurred 48 hours after the FALA regional command  warned the Luanda troops not to violate UNITA's defense lines.  Our correspondent reports that the situation has returned to  normal.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> CELEBRITIES WAFT INTO FRAGRANCE FIELD  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Mikhail Baryshnikov makes his first personal appearance at Saks  Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills. Note the choreography: cocktails Monday night  for 300 -- Kevin Costner, Kim Basinger, like that -- in a $14-million penthouse  on Wilshire Boulevard. Caviar and California Chardonnay abound.  </P> <P> Next day at the store, an autographing session from 1 to 2, with models  spritzing perfume into the expected crowd of 1,000 and Baryshnikov signing his  name in indelible ink.  </P> <P> All this because the ballet star, whose stage leaps made him famous, is taking  yet another leap -- into the world of fragrance. He is lending his name and his  image to a $185-an-ounce perfume called Misha, his nickname.  </P> <P> His gala fragrance launch follows close behind one for screen star Jaclyn  Smith, whose California eau de cologne is a budget-conscious $17.50 per ounce.  Because she has not been able to make time for personal appearances on the West  Coast, K mart, Sav-on and JC Penney are promoting the scent in their stores by  replacing Smith with life-size, cardboard dolls. And they will continue to do  so until the real thing comes along. But her schedule doesn't allow for store  appearances anytime soon. For now, the dolls will be as close as fans get to  the former Charlie's Angel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sizzles and Fizzles  </P> <P> Smith's 2-D look-alike is a symbol of one of the major problems plaguing  celebrity fragrance sales. When stars are in stores meeting the public, scent  sales sizzle. When they're not, sales tend to fizzle. And lately, there's more  fizzle than sizzle.  </P> <P> But that hasn't stopped the push to get more eau-de-star on cosmetic counters.  Baryshnikov and Smith join a long list of media celebs who have endorsed a  fragrance.  </P> <P> Recently there have been Cher, Joan Collins, Priscilla Presley and Debbie  Gibson. Earlier, Elizabeth Taylor, Linda Evans, Catherine Deneuve, Dionne  Warwick, Marlo Thomas, Sophia Loren and Candice Bergen. And Baryshnikov is not  alone among men to introduce a fragance for women. Herb Alpert, Julio Iglesias  and Smokey Robinson are others.  </P> <P> The fact that none of these performers knew how to make or market a perfume was  inconsequential to executives in the fragrance industry. The stars draw crowds  and crowds mean dollars -- at least initially. Max Factor President Allan  Kurtzman predicts that Jaclyn Smith's California will generate about $50  million in sales its first year, of which the actress will get an undisclosed  percentage. With Smith on hand to smile and sign autographs during its  summertime "launch" week at Bloomingdale's in New York -- the only U.S.  department store to carry it -- 5,000 bottles were purchased. But like other  celebrity scents, with the star off premises, the fragrance became just another  of the more than 800 different brands available.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crowds Follow Cher  </P> <P> Cher's recent seven-city tour with Uninhibited made the $175-an-ounce scent a  hot seller during that time. She was able to draw huge crowds to department  stores wherever she appeared. But as her film schedule and private life became  more demanding, the personal appearances dwindled. Cher's scent proved to be  one that her fans bought out of reverence for her, and others bought for  curiosity's sake. But few came back for more.  </P> <P> Certainly the price tag keeps some fans from buying more than one bottle.  Smith's California cologne at $17.50 is uncharacteristically low. But even her  perfume, sold only at Bloomingdale's, is $200 per ounce. Others are priced as  high as $300, which doesn't make repeat business a sure thing.  </P> <P> "For some manufacturers, short-term sales are enough," explains Bill  Fitzgerald, a Washington-based economist who tracks fragrance sales for the  industry. "Whereas most major firms want to see sales of $50 million a year to  call a fragrance successful, some companies are happy with $10 million or $20  million a year in sales. Others are in and out fast -- they do a big business  during the launch period and then take the money and run."  </P> <P> Even sales of Elizabeth Taylor's Passion, considered by most industry observers  to be a major success, are tapering off. "Passion traded heavily on Taylor's  name and ads in the magazines," Fitzgerald says. "Now the company has  introduced bath products to generate more interest, but what they need is  Taylor out there stumping to keep up the excitement."  </P> <P> Sustaining that excitement is no easy feat, however. Loren's Sophia and  Bergen's Cie were introduced more than 10 years ago, the first celebrity  tie-ins in the perfume business. Today Cie is no longer available and "it takes  a magnifying glass to find Sophia," as one industry consultant put it.  </P> <P> So far only Passion, Deneuve and Evans' Krystal have been considered successful  fragrances by industry analysts. But even Deneuve was a relatively short-term  hit.  </P> <P> With expensive packaging that included bows hand-dyed in France, "Deneuve was  too expensive to produce," observes another industry source, who refused to be  identified. "It would need to be $300 a bottle to make any money. So when Cher  came along, everyone forgot about Deneuve."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deneuve Is Scarce  </P> <P> The French actress' $175 perfume can still be found in some department stores,  such as Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom.  </P> <P> Evans' high profile on the TV show "Dynasty," coupled with her commercial  endorsements of Crystal Light soft drinks and Clairol's Ultress hair-coloring  products, enhanced sales of her perfume. Now that "Dynasty" has been canceled,  sales of Krystal will be based on the consumers' response to the essence, the  true test of a fragrance's long-term success.  </P> <P> Like Smith's scent, Collins' Spectacular was launched at Bloomingdale's during  the store's recent California promotion. She drew fewer people to the store  than did Smith, and sales have been notably unspectacular. According to  Fitzgerald, who monitors actual consumer purchasing of name brands by  contacting the shoppers, Collins' fragrance has not yet registered on his  charts because of its very limited distribution. The fragrance is now available  in Los Angeles at the Broadway, where Collins will make a personal appearance  Nov. 9 (the Glendale Galleria store) and 10 (the South Coast Plaza store).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Men Bank on Charisma  </P> <P> Male stars, anxious to get in on the action, bank on their romantic charisma to  sell fragrances for women. The industry turns to sensitive male images,  including that of Baryshnikov, to attract fragrance-buying females.  </P> <P> Known for his soulful music, Smokey Robinson will sell his Smoke fragrance by  mail, promoting it via scent strips distributed at his concerts and in his  albums. The price is $29.50 for 1.7 ounces of eau de parfum, which is stronger  than a cologne. Robinson isn't offering a perfume at this time.  </P> <P> Madrid-born Iglesias, marketing specifically to Hispanic women, plays up the  romantic angle in publicity for his scent Only, when he intones, "For all that  women have given me, I wanted to give them something in return; something that  would speak intimately to each and every woman the world over." It will cost  them $200 per ounce.  </P> <P> Baryshnikov, on the other hand, is promoted as the consummate artist, and his  artistic sense is at the heart of the campaign: "Fragrance is like an  'internal' companion, the bridge connecting a woman's hidden emotional self  with the visual self . . . a kind of emotional dance."  </P> <P> Until recently, pop musician Herb Alpert's Listen was sold in too few stores to  make an appearance on Fitzgerald's national sales reports. Now, sold in 300  stores, enough to make a retail impact, its true popularity will be tested.  Alpert's personal-appearance schedule has been very limited.  </P> <P> While the French and Italians are accustomed to fragrances by celebrity fashion  designers, entertainment industry scents are an American anachronism. In Paris,  where perfume is as much a part of its heritage as wine, food or fashion, the  nose -- the man or woman who blends the fragrance -- is most often the media  star. For example, when the House of Guerlain launches its new perfume,  Samsara, this fall, nose Jean-Paul Guerlain will tour the world to discuss his  newest essence.  </P> <P> And when Annick Goutal, one of the few female noses to head a French perfume  company, began selling her exclusive collection at Bergdorf Goodman in New York  and I. Magnin here, it was she, not 15 fragrances, that was promoted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credit to Creator  </P> <P> "I could never create a perfume and then attach a celebrity's name to it," says  Goutal, who received substantial media attention when she sued Parfums  International, maker of Taylor's fragrance, for using the name Passion, which  she had trademarked and used for several years on one of her best-selling  perfumes. "The scent would be my interpretation of the star, not the star's  expression of herself. To put a movie star's name on a fragrance is a  vulgarization -- the credit belongs to the original creator."  </P> <P> In the United States, such "vulgarization" continues with no end in sight. But  the trend is not without limits.  </P> <P> So far there is no Rambo's Girl by Sylvester Stallone, or Terminator for Women  by Arnold Schwarzenegger, because the actors' images don't fit the sensitive,  romantic mold that has proven to be successful. Nor is there a Madonna perfume  in the works.  </P> <P> "Her personal life is too stormy," one industry source explains. "No  manufacturer is willing to take a chance that the public will want to smell  like her."  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television Both BBC networks are heavy on repeats. Between 7.30 and 1.10 in the morning the only non-repeats on BBC1 are Points Of View, the 10-minute letters programme; the Nine O'Clock News, and Today At Wimbledon (10.25). The only programme on commercial tv which attracts me is Athletics from Edinburgh, where Britain meets the USA. There is an hour on ITV from 8.00 and another hour on C4 from 8.55. Friday once again proves a good night for radio, and BBC radio has clearly discovered what those of us born in Scarborough have always known: that this, the world's first seaside resort, is the centre of the universe. At 8.05 Radio 4 broadcasts Any Questions? from Scarborough. At 9.50 Radio 3 offers Virtuoso Italian Baroque Chamber Music from the Spa Grand Hall. And at 10.00 the Radio 2 Arts Programme visits Scarborough to discuss Alan Ayckbourn and to interview Ian Carmichael about his role in the second series of 'Strathblair'. There is also the second of the Reith Lectures (9.20 Radio 3) by Edward Said and, from another seaside town, Reaping The Elements: The Art Of St Ives (10.45 Radio 3).</p>

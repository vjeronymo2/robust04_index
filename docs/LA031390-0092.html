			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY SUSPECTS NAMED IN CHIP THEFT RING  </P> <P> Two men who allegedly headed a major crime ring based in Little Saigon in  Orange County have been charged with stealing $3.7 million in computer chips,  according to an indictment to be unsealed today in Oklahoma.  </P> <P> The indictments of Dinh Huu Tran, 33, of Santa Ana, and Phat Viet Doan, 20, of  Garden Grove, stem from a 17-month interstate investigation by the Treasury  Department and the FBI.  </P> <P> The purported crime ring allegedly preyed on an American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, recruiting Vietnamese  employees there to steal hundreds of thousands of chips by putting the precious  parts in their pockets and in tubes that were hidden under their clothes.  </P> <P> The chips were then transported to the Orange County area by car and commercial  jet and fenced through at least 30 Vietnamese-owned computer stores, Treasury  special agent Paul Elledge alleged Monday.  </P> <P> "They did business throughout Orange County," he said.  </P> <P> The alleged AT&amp;T theft is the latest evidence of a network of Vietnamese  gangs -- many based in Orange County -- that have traveled around the nation  stealing microchips.  </P> <P> Some of the alleged thefts have been carried out like paramilitary operations.  Bandits allegedly struck some of Southern California's best-known computer  companies, binding and gagging employees and issuing death threats against  them.  </P> <P> "This thing is so massive now that federal agencies are finally looking  seriously at it," said Lee Roberts, a Santa Ana private investigator employed  by several computer giants.  </P> <P> The Oklahoma City indictment claims that the thefts at AT&amp;T occurred  between May, 1988, and January of last year.  </P> <P> The two Orange County men are named in the indictment as the leaders of the  crime ring, which Elledge said involved at least 16 people. Further indictments  are expected.  </P> <P> The U.S. Attorney's Office in Oklahoma City has scheduled a press conference  today to announce the indictments and explain the complicated scheme. The  indictments were originally filed last month but placed under seal to give  local law enforcement officials a chance to find the two men.  </P> <P> Tran, 33, and Doan, 20, are charged with conspiracy, interstate transportation  of stolen goods and multiple counts of money laundering. The two, who each face  135 years in jail if convicted, were last seen at Tet celebrations in Little  Saigon at the end of January and are considered fugitives, Elledge said.  </P> <P> Tran's attorney, Nolan Stringfield, refused to comment until he sees the  indictment.  </P> <P> "There isn't really much I can say at this point," he said.  </P> <P> The alleged crime ring was first suspected by Internal Revenue Service agents  in August, 1988, after they noticed that hundreds of thousands of dollars were  being moved between Oklahoma City and Orange County. They suspected an illegal  drug operation.  </P> <P> "We normally investigate major narcotics cases," said Elledge. "We attempt to  try and track the flow and movement of large amounts of currency. When we  initially started this investigation, we thought it was probably  narcotics-related because, based on our experience, the only thing we knew that  could generate such large amounts of money over a short period of time was  drugs. We were quite far into the investigation before we discovered it was, in  fact, microchips."  </P> <P> Federal authorities allege in the indictment that Doan and Tran started the  crime ring, using the fictitious business name C.D. Computer as a cover.  </P> <P> The address given for C.D. Computer on Westminster Avenue in Santa Ana "was in  fact a furniture store, which belonged to Dinh Huu Tran," Elledge said in an  affidavit that accompanies the indictment. "C.D. Computer did not have an  office location."  </P> <P> The indictment claims that Doan and Tran hired Oklahoma City resident Son Manh  Nguyen to persuade AT&amp;T employees to steal the chips. Nguyen is under  investigation in connection with the scheme, officials said.  </P> <P> Doan then allegedly brought the stolen chips "from Oklahoma to California for  distribution by the organization," according to the indictment. He allegedly  earned $5 per chip for transporting them to Orange County.  </P> <P> Tran and Doan allegedly sold the AT&amp;T chips to numerous electronics shops  in Little Saigon that police have said fence hot chips and are a key cog in a  vast international black market.  </P> <P> Microchips, which are used in everything from toasters to missiles, make good  booty because they are small but valuable. Just a handful can bring thousands  of dollars, and they are difficult to trace because few have serial numbers.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T has not recovered a single chip stolen from its Oklahoma City plant.  </P> <P> "This is better than moving dope," Elledge said. "If a cop stops you and you  have a trunkload of chips, so what?"  </P> <P> Tran opened six bank accounts in the Little Saigon area "for the purposes of  receiving and distributing the proceeds of the stolen computer chips, and to  obtain the needed currency to promote the carrying on of the unlawful  activity," the indictment alleges.  </P> <P> Bank records show that Tran was moving around hundreds of thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> "They had to generate large amounts of cash to purchase the chips," Elledge  said.  </P> <P> The crime ring allegedly bought microchips from AT&amp;T employees for  approximately $6 a piece and then sold them for as much as $35 a piece, Elledge  said. The Treasury Department caught 12 employees in the scheme as part of an  undercover operation that led to Doan and Tran.  </P></p>

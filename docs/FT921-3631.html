			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Leu Holding up strongly LEU HOLDING, parent of Bank Leu and other Swiss banks and property companies, has reported a 69 per cent surge in consolidated net income for 1991, to SFr91m (Dollars 61m), writes Ian Rodger. The increase was due largely to recovery from 1990, when Bank Leu's earnings were virtually eliminated by a huge internal fraud. The directors are recommending a rise in dividends, from SFr60 to SFr65 per SFr500 registered and bearer shares, and from SFr12 to SFr13 for SFr100 shares and participation certificates. They also proposed a restructuring of share capital, converting all other classes of shares and participation certificates into SFr100 bearer shares.</p>

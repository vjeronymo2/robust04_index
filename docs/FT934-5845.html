			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Taxman yields on relocation Employees who have been relocated since 1986 got some good news from the Inland Revenue this week, writes Peter Ashby*. Unless they had sold their old house or flat, the Revenue had been seeking to collect tax on relocation allowances given to them by their employers. Now, following an announcement on November 23, the Revenue will no longer pursue any individual taxpayers unless they have employers who will pay the tax for them under what are known as tax equalisation, or tax protection, arrangements. Even then, the Revenue will pursue only the employer. The story started in 1986 when the Revenue insisted that, from that point on, taxpayers had to sell their old homes to benefit from tax-free relocation expenses. Up to then, it had merely required an individual to move house. Strictly speaking, the expenses have been taxable for many years, but the Revenue had granted tax relief on an extra-statutory concession basis. The 1986 change was to affect all taxpayers, but the Revenue directed its attention mainly to major employers, who generally pay the tax on behalf of their staff. The employers and their advisers were not prepared to accept the change and heavy lobbying, led by my firm, paid off with the Revenue's announcement. It has now agreed to reduce the amount it will be collecting from employers as well as the number of people likely to be affected. The tax bills for employees could have been substantial. It is agreed generally that the new statutory limit (which applied from April 6 1993) of Pounds 8,000, above which relocation expenses are taxed, is inadequate. Therefore, an average employee with a relocation package of Pounds 15,000 could have had a tax bill of Pounds 6,000 to pay if he had sold his old home. In practice, amounts of Pounds 10,000 were commonplace and senior employees could have had bills very much higher. The present expatriate population in the UK is estimated at 250,000. Obviously, not all of these are eligible for these savings - but many will be. In addition, many relocations within the UK involve short-term moves. The oil industry, for one, has moved many people to the Aberdeen area of north-east Scotland. If employees knew they were being transferred temporarily, they would normally expect to return to their own home. Before the revenue's announcement, they would have had to pay tax on their relocation allowances; now, they will not. As far as paying UK taxes is concerned, staff without employer assistance will benefit only if they have protested and kept their position open. Any taxpayer who accepted the Revenue view, settled its position and paid his tax, probably will be unable to benefit. There are only two circumstances in which the tax is recoverable: If the assessment of the income which includes the relocation expenses has not been completed for some other reason, the employee can write to his inspector, have it finalised and the tax will be repaid. The matter might technically have been held open if inspector and taxpayer agreed to disagree, while the latter still paid the tax. Any repayment will not attract interest as it is being made on a concessionary, not a statutory, basis. But anyone who refused to pay will find his liability is now removed. *Peter Ashby is expatriate tax partner at Price Waterhouse, and chairman of the tax on relocation lobby group.</p>

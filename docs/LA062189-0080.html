			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VICTIM SLAMS DOOR IN GUNMAN'S FACE  </P> <P> An attempt by an armed robber in Lakewood to steal a man's car was foiled when  the victim slammed his door shut in the suspect's face, authorities said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The robber had knocked on the front door of a house on Hyter Avenue at 10:30  p.m. Monday and was answered by the resident, George Wilder, 50, Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Deputy Dan Cox said.  </P> <P> With the door open, the robber pointed a sawed-off shotgun at Wilder and  demanded the keys to his car, Cox said. Instead, Wilder slammed the door in the  robber's face. The robber fired a round through the door but missed Wilder, Cox  said.  </P> <P> Hubert Rouse, a California Highway Patrol officer who was off duty and lives  nearby, confronted the gunman and two alleged accomplices.  </P> <P> The three men fled after Rouse fired a shot, but deputies later captured the  alleged accomplices -- Troy Black, 27, of Lakewood, and Dana Smith, 21, of Los  Angeles, and booked them for investigation of robbery. The gunman was still at  large.  </P></p>

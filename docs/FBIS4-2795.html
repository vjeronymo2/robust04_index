			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Zengxiang (3769 1073 4382): "Heihe </F> Economic Television Station Begins Broadcasting"]    [Text] The Heihe Economic Television  Station--Heilongjiang's first economic television station  officially approved by the state--began broadcasting on 28 March.    Heihe is one of China's first group of border cities opened  to the outside world. Facing Russia's Blagoveshchensk across  Heilong Jiang, it is China's largest border trade outlet.  Aiming at promoting the economic and trade activities of China  and Russia by establishing ties with the south and opening to  the north, this television station carries programs, such as  "Heihe Economic Information," "Golden Bridge," and "Collection  of Border Trade Information," in Chinese and Russian languages  beamed at Heihe and Blagoveshchensk every evening from Monday  through Friday. The station applies enterprise management and  hires personnel publicly. It is responsible for its own profits  and deficits.</p>

After taking a neutral position in the conflict caused by  the national board's decision to veto the bloc's participation  in the constitutional review, Lula decided to support the  congressmen. During the meeting to be held with the national  board on 17 February, they will try to ensure their right to  autonomously choose the tactics they will use in the sessions in  which the constitutional reform will be discussed.    Since the congressional bloc is an important tool to  neutralize the radical arguments, the PT leadership believes  that by meeting the congressmen's demands in this regard it can  display the image of a less intransigent party and open the path  to a more flexible program.    One of Lula's friends said: "The leaders' inflexibility can  ruin everything."    The program drafted by radical PT members favors a  moratorium, or suspension of payments on the foreign debt;  compulsory rescheduling of the domestic debt; the end of  privatizations (and reviewing the situation of some companies  already privatized); and reactivation of military programs and  re-equipment of the Armed Forces.    Believing that it will be difficult to win a two-stage  election with this program, Lula thinks that it is fundamental  to strengthen the congressional bloc for the debates on the  government program. Regarding this program, however, the bloc is  not as united as it was during the impasse resulting from the  prohibition to participate in the constitutional review works.  Deputy Jose Dirceu (SP [Sao Paulo]), for example, supports the  idea of using the moratorium as a persuasive tool.    Dirceu, who is a member of the Articulation faction that  supports Lula, said: "I do not understand why the right is so  scandalized. Even Delfim Netto failed to comply with the  agreements signed with the IMF while he was [economy] minister  in the military regime. He then said that letters of intent were  written to be torn up afterward."    Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (SP), who also is a Articulation  faction member in addition to Lula's economic adviser, said a PT  administration must exert pressure on creditors to renegotiate  the debt, but he discarded the possibility of declaring a  moratorium.    Deputy Eduardo Jorge (SP), however, asserts that the program  proposals for the military cannot be supported by a party that  claims to be democratic because they imply accepting an  authoritarian concept "very typical of a leftist faction that  still preaches dictatorial attitudes by parties." Jorge is a  member of the Radical Democracy faction, known as the "PT right  wing."    Dirceu retorted: "These proposals have civilian goals and  cannot be mixed with the military regime programs. Only a person  like Eduardo Jorge can oppose them."    Deputy Jose Genoino (SP) believes the PT program's economic  nucleus is "too narrow." He also criticizes the program's  concept of creating an administration with socialist prospects.    He said: "A leftist party must fight to have socialist  values and ideals incorporated in the process and thus broaden  the concept of citizenship."</p>

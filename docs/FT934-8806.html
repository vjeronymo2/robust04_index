			<p>931113 FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: View polarises nuclear review Sir, It is a pity that Dieter Helm (Letters, November 4) seeks to polarise the nuclear review at its outset by branding us 'pro-nuclear' merely because we mention some of the advantages of nuclear power. He goes on to place himself firmly in the camp of the market-led 'dash for gas'. We suspect that readers of the FT will understand the advantages of a balanced energy supply portfolio in preference to a precarious dependence on gas-fired stations selected on a single, simplistic, short-term criterion.

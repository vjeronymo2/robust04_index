			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Air Canada seeks foreign equity finance Air Canada is seeking shareholder approval for a new class of non-voting common shares to be used to raise equity, mainly outside Canada. The company said it had no immediate plans to issue any of the new class A non-voting common shares but it was creating the flexibility to obtain foreign equity financing 'within the framework of the ownership restrictions existing under federal legislation'. At present, no individual can own more than 10 per cent of the voting shares. Foreigners are restricted to 25 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEGAMOUTH SHARK  </P> <P> Anyone who has ever desired the existence of sea monsters (and a keen desire  that is) must have rejoiced over the picture of the megamouth shark that ran on  Oct. 23. The appearance of this fantastic creature conveys the hopeful news  that our weary old world still has a few mysteries up its sleeve. I am  considerably bucked up.  </P> <P> P.B.

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: GM work fund runs out of cash UP TO 11,000 blue-collar workers at General Motors are expected to be indefinitely laid off next week as a fund, set up by the troubled car company to keep unneeded workers on full pay, runs out of money. The development had been widely expected, and the blow will be softened by the fact that the laid-off workers will continue to receive a proportion of their pay through a separate GM unemployment fund. However, the ending of the scheme will not help smooth relations between GM and the United Auto Workers union at a time when the company is seeking union co-operation in its massive restructuring programme and ahead of crucial talks next autumn on a new three-year labour contract. The job guarantee programme was established in 1990 under the labour agreement expiring this year. GM has begun notifying workers involved in the scheme that it is expected to run out of money next week. The UAW's agreement to the retirement programme last December was taken as a sign of improving relations between the union and the company after a series of autumn strikes, several of which appeared to be UAW warning shots over the company's restructuring plans.</p>

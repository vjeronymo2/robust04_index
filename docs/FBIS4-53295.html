			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maricris C. Carlos] </F>   [Text] Despite present problems dogging the industry, the  prospect of mining investments in the country remains the most  lucrative in the world, contends Mining and Geosciences Bureau  (MGB) Director Joel Muyco of the Department of Environment and  Natural Resources (DENR).    Mr. Muyco cited as proof the country's overall per area  mineral endowment, which places the Philippines second only to  South Africa. The Philippines, he noted, has one of the highest  mineral endowment ratio in the world.    The mineral endowment of a country serves as a measure of  the  extent of mineral distribution in a specific area. The ratio is  computed by dividing the country's total land area with its  confirmed mineral reserves.    According to DENR-MGB documents obtained by BUSINESS WORLD,  in terms of gold deposits, South Africa has the richest reserves  with a 15.80-ounce-per-square-kilometer mineral endowment ratio,  while the Philippines is second with four ounces/square  kilometer.    Papua New Guinea ranks third with 2.33 ounces/square  kilometer.    Mr. Muyco told BUSINESS WORLD, if only these mineral  reserves  can be tapped, the mining industry will surely propel the  Philippines to a newly industrialized status by the year 2000.    The reason the country has failed to truly industrialize is  because government do not see the potential of the mining  industry.    The mining sector is the key, he underscored. Unless  government realizes this and put in place the needed programs  and policies to relieve the pressure on the industry, the mining  sector will remain an ailing industry.    At present, a bill reducing the excise tax on the industry  is  pending in Congress.    The existing 5 percent excise tax on the industry is  considered as one of the biggest disincentives for investors.    The House of Representatives has already approved its  version  of the bill, which proposes to grant tax relief to the mining  industry for an indefinite period or until the sector has  recovered.    The Senate version of the bill, on the other hand, has just  been recently approved on second reading.    According to the Senate bill, excise tax on metallic  minerals  should be slashed on the first three years from the present 5  percent to just 2 percent for gold and 1 percent for copper; on  the fourth and fifth years, gold will be taxed at 2-1/2 percent  and copper at 1-1/2. On the sixth year, the 5 percent excise  tax is restored for all metallic minerals.    The country's mining operations have been experiencing  massive losses because of depressed metal prices and increasing  production costs.    As a result, the sector's share of the country's export  earnings had plunged, from 1973's 24.55 percent share to a  dismal 6.38 percent in 1992.    The country's top mining companies include Atlas  Consolidated  Mining and Development Corp. (Cebu), Maricalum Mining Corp.  (Negros Occidental), Marcopper Mining Corp. (Marinduque), Philex  Mining Corp. (Benguet), Lepanto Consolidated Mining Corp.  (Benguet), and Benguet Corp. (Dizon, Zambales).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At this moment the State Chamber Commission for  International Relations is examining our foreign affairs  activities. Due to sensitivity of the international problems, a  part of today's session was closed to the public. The  Commission first gave its consent to the ratification of various  agreements and initiatives, while the decision about associate  EU membership was partially discussed at the open part of the  session and partially at the closed part.    The members of the Commission also listened to a report by  President Milan Kucan on his visit to Croatia. Zvone Zorko  reports about the part of the session that was open to the  public:    [Begin Zorko recording] At the beginning of today's session,  several members of the Commission criticized the work of the  Foreign Ministry and especially Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle  in extremely sharp words, hinting that, in the fateful moments  of Slovenia's deteriorating international position, he seems to  be unaware of this fact, making misleading and sometimes  untruthful statements and concentrating his efforts on the  issues and spheres that are of minor importance for Slovenia.    In this sense, the Commission emphasized that the foreign  policy must be coordinated irrespective of party interests and  that we must prepare a strategy for our foreign policy in which  it must be clearly stated what our priorities are, where they  lay, and how we will try to realize them. There is, of course,  no doubt that our foreign policy must be present and active  primarily in Paris, Bonn, and Washington.    Regarding the signing of an agreement about Slovenia's  associate membership of the European Union, in the open part of  the session, the Commission concluded that the signing of this  agreement must be the first priority of the Slovene foreign  policy and that the main problems here are being created by  Italy and some European politicians who maintain that Slovenia  is still a Balkan state.    The conclusion was that we must first of all establish what  are the benefits and the shortcomings of EU membership for  Slovenia and decide about the national program in this light,  that the State Chamber should be the main one to decide about  this issue, and also that we must maintain contacts with the  European Parliament, intensify contacts with all EU members, and  try to accomplish that Italy, by its views, will not block the  signing of the EU associate membership agreement and its  ratification.

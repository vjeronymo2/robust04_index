			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): An unwieldy hybrid that guarantees cover in the future - Whole-of-life insurance / The policies are flexible and convertible. And once you have bought one, you are insurable for the rest of your life, without the need for further medical evidence WHOLE-OF-LIFE insurance policies may not sound gimmicky. But an array of extra attractions has been added to these basic life policies, in an attempt to save them from becoming misfits among insurance products. This has made the policies easier to sell, but an equal array of problems remains. Endowments, lasting a fixed term and with minimal life cover, offer stronger investment performance for those who need an investment. Meanwhile, term assurance, which insures against death within a specific period, provides cheaper protection. Whole-of-life, which offers life cover indefinitely and pays a surrender value if you want to discontinue the policy, is left as an unwieldy hybrid somewhere in the middle. It has undoubted uses in inheritance tax planning. You can take out a whole-of-life policy in trust, so that your heirs can use the eventual pay-out to meet their IHT liability. But this is far removed from the mainstream market for life assurance, which most people buy when they start a family. The role of whole-of-life in this situation is more dubious. These contracts are likely to be more expensive at the outset than term assurance. However, crucially, they can offer a surrender value. With term assurance, if you survive your term all the premiums you have paid remain in the pockets of the insurance company. This means that whole-of-life can, just about, prove to be a healthy long-term investment. But it makes little sense to buy whole-of-life as an investment in its own right. As Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe, puts it: 'As far as I'm concerned, if you want an investment you buy an investment. If you want life cover, you buy a life policy.' But there may be a case for whole-of-life instead of term as a pure protection policy. It costs more initially, but if cash-flow is not a problem, it may offer better value in the long term. You can choose the level of investment content. Three levels of life cover are normally quoted. These are: 'minimum', which puts the least into the protection and concentrates on investment; 'standard'; and 'maximum', which devotes the highest amount possible to life cover, rather than investment. Thus, a given level of 'maximum' cover is actually cheaper than 'standard' cover. If you opt for maximum cover, you give yourself the cheapest possible protection, but cut the chances of a decent surrender value. But 'minimum' cover seems pointless - you pay a lot for the protection, while the investment is still likely to be feeble compared with alternatives. Towry Law provides the following figures, assuming policies are taken out by a 29-year-old male non-smoker paying a constant Pounds 1,000 annual premium: After 10 years, the greatest death pay-out from the companies surveyed comes from Sun Life, which offers Pounds 638,000 on a maximum-cover basis. The surrender value, if you were still alive, would be Pounds 4,420. For standard cover, the pay-out would be Pounds 239,151, with a surrender value of Pounds 9,410. The figures for minimum cover show this is an option which can safely be ignored - the pay-out on death would be Pounds 34,500, while the surrender value would still only be Pounds 11,900. As you would have parted with a total of Pounds 10,000 in premiums, this is scarcely the hottest investment available. The strongest surrender value from any company surveyed by Towry Law was Pounds 13,300 from Prolific Life - still not the kind of investment to get Gordon Gekko reaching for his phone. So the argument for whole-of-life rests on the strength of protection offered. Term assurance, by definition, is temporary. If you have a heart attack, or some other serious illness, you could find yourself uninsurable at the end of the term. This is a serious problem. But once you have bought whole-of-life cover, you are guaranteed to be insurable for the rest of your life, without needing extra medical evidence. Premiums are reviewed every 10 years, so you do not lock yourself in at a permanently low rate. Whole-of-life policies are also more flexible, although the worth of many of the options which have been strapped on is open to question. And you pay for the flexibility. For example, you can convert the policies into critical-illness contracts, or add on permanent health insurance, or increase cover on specific named events, such as marriage or the birth of a child. Many companies offer link-ups to a range of different investment funds. Any of these options might be attractive, but it is pointless to buy them unless you need them. Also, beware of buying unnecessary extra cover - for example, if you already have permanent health insurance through your company, there is no point in paying for more via your own personal life policy. Young parents starting families should look seriously at whole-of-life policies. If you can afford them, they will relieve you of much anxiety. Otherwise, term assurance is the more obvious choice. A useful halfway house is 'convertible term' assurance, which allows you to buy the right to start a whole-of-life policy at the end of a fixed term. In this way, you keep your premiums to a minimum at a time when you are paying a lot for nappies, but still have the security of whole-of-life protection.  ------------------------------------------------------ HOW THE COSTS VARY (POUNDS PCM)  ------------------------------------------------------ Male, aged 40, non-smoker Pounds 100,000 sum assured 5-year renewable/convertible term        18 With increase option                     22 WoLA: maximum cover                      37 WoLA: standard cover                     86 Minimum-cost WoLA                        72 With-profits WoLA                       238  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Chamberlain de Broe  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION 89;  </P> <P> SKIRT LENGTH: PARIS HEMS AND HAWS;  </P> <P> MOST DESIGNERS BARE THE KNEE; LAGERFELD GOES LONGER  </P> <P> That troublesome skirt length question is still unresolved in the spring/summer  couture collections now under way here.  </P> <P> So far, Christian Lacroix, Marc Bohan at Dior and Emanuel Ungaro continue to  endorse just-above-the-knee lengths, while Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel (who  caused the whole controversy and confusion a year ago when he showed long mixed  with short) puts the emphasis on low calf lengths.  </P> <P> Lagerfeld has a handful of top-of-the-knee lengths, but he is obviously happier  with longer, pleated georgette or chiffon skirts teamed with elongated jackets.  When the skirts were in motion, the longer proportion looked great. Some of the  narrow versions looked frankly retrospective.  </P> <P> As if to indicate there was nothing old or aging about this proportion,  Lagerfeld sent the models hopping and skipping down the runway like so many  saucy little rich girls. Further emphasizing that jeune fille feeling: white  stockings, black patent leather flats and big hats wrapped with wide taffeta  bows.  </P> <P> Pants, the alternative to the length controversy in many ready-to-wear  collections, have been present but not emphasized at these custom shows. Only  two pairs showed up at Chanel and both were beauties: black satin, wide-leg  pants teamed with a black tunic-length wool jacket over a white satin blouse,  and a long, narrow cardigan jacket in black wool crepe above trousers in  matching fabric.  </P> <P> The turnout for the Lagerfeld show Tuesday at the Theatre des Champs Elysees,  home of the Orchestre de Paris, included everyone from the Begum Aga Khan and  Princess Caroline of Monaco to Americans Susan Gutfreund and Mrs. Charles  Wrightsman, not to mention Bernadette Chirac, wife of the mayor of Paris, Marie  Helene de Rothschild and Madame David Weil of the French banking family.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Flash of Color  </P> <P> While everyone else in Paris has collections filled with pretty pastels,  Lagerfeld put the emphasis on navy and white, with an occasional flash of vivid  color or a pastiche of delicate pastel.  </P> <P> The luxury in this collection was the hand-pleated chiffon dresses,  representing weeks of work in the couture studios. Over many of these "Daisy  Buchanan" wisps of garments were re-embroidered masses of huge "diamonds" with  the ubiquitous Chanel pearls wrapped around the throat and trailing practically  to the knees.  </P> <P> Again, as with Bohan's Dior collection shown Monday, there were pieces here  that would work with Chanels already in one's wardrobe, as well as evening  beauties that will surely wind up in a costume museum.  </P> <P> Before his show, Emanuel Ungaro said his inspiration was Katharine Hepburn.  </P> <P> "Looked more like Catherine the Great to me," an American observer commented  after the last of the 74-piece collection had come down the runway.  </P> <P> But couture is synonymous with luxury and luxury is what Ungaro gave his  customers. While couture houses rarely discuss price, everything here looked  megabucks: Think $25,000 to $30,000 for an outfit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back to Louis XVI  </P> <P> In this bicentenary of the French Revolution, the designer looked back to the  ancien regime of Louis XVI: exquisite brocades reembroidered with gold threads;  gold sequins and beads outlining necklines, lapels and pockets; hand woven lace  insets shaping bosoms on flounce-skirted dresses billowing over petticoats,  everything in the floral print mixes and fauve colors the designer loves.  </P> <P> There was definitely a new silhouette here, with Ungaro dropping his signature  drapings. Instead, fabrics were smocked or puckered from just below the bust to  the top of the hips and then flared on those masses of petticoats. New, too, is  his high, pulled-up and puffed shoulder which he used on all his jackets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Skirt Length  </P> <P> For day, when he wasn't showing pants, he clung to a skirt length that always  bared the knee, the shorter lengths stressed with shiny-surface tights and  sling-back high-heel satin pumps.  </P> <P> The background music, a trumpeter and organist playing selections from Purcell  and Handel somehow seemed more suitable to a society wedding or a Royal  Occasion than a fashion show but, never mind, it was all part of that unique  Ungaro ambiance.  </P> <P> Ditto the models' coiffures; hair swirled in a snail-shaped pompadour perched  on the forehead then caught back into a low chignon. Depending on the fabrics  and colors of an outfit, the models sometimes looked like Toulouse-Lautrec  can-can dancers, sometimes like 18th-Century royals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Few Standouts  </P> <P> There were a few simple standouts, however, especially the white satin  halter-top dresses, the top pleated on the bias and anchored through the  midriff with masses of silver and rhinestone beading.  </P> <P> The collections continue today with Yves Saint Laurent and, in the evening,  Gianni Versace's first couture collection at the Musee d'Orsay followed by a  sit-down dinner and a private visit of the museum.  </P></p>

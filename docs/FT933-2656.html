			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Dixons shares leap on plans to sell US chain SHARES in Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, leapt 27p to 260p yesterday as the company announced it was selling its loss-making US chain Silo to Fretter, another US electrical retailer. The City welcomed the move as the ideal solution for Dixons to the growing problems at Silo, which lost Pounds 22.4m in the year to May 1 and cost it Pounds 36.2m in closure costs. One analyst called it a 'tremendous deal. Pretty faultless'. The sale will result in a charge of Pounds 19.8m against Dixons' half-year profits to cover current-year US trading losses and an exceptional loss on disposal. A second charge of Pounds 191.1m, relating to goodwill previously written off to reserves, is a procedure required by new accounting standards and has no impact on shareholders' funds. The 185-store Silo chain is being sold to Fretter in return for a 30 per cent stake in the enlarged Fretter group, Dollars 30m of 5 per cent convertible preferred stock, and Dollars 15m of 6 per cent preferred stock. Fretter will change its name to YES] Your Electronics Superstore, given to three revamped Silo stores in Rochester, New York. The investment will be accounted for by Dixons as a related company. The 5 per cent preferred stock could be converted at any time into ordinary shares, giving Dixons a potential stake of 49 per cent. Dixons said it did not intend to convert the stock in the short term. Mr Robert Shrager, finance director, said trading at Silo had continued to improve in recent months, but it would take some years and further investment before Silo achieved adequate profits. Combining Fretter and Silo would create a group better able to compete in the US market, he added. There was also considerable potential for improving profits through cutting costs, by streamlining the distribution network and corporate offices, and closing poorly performing stores. Dixons future exposure to Silo is limited to the Dollars 50m carrying value of its investment in Fretter, together with a secured standby credit facility of Dollars 40m available for 13 months after completion. Fretter is a Michigan-based electrical retailer operating 101 stores in three different formats. For the year to January 31, it reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 8.7m on sales of Dollars 361.1m.

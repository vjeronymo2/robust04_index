			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Management: In search of female mandarins - Attempts to promote a women-friendly image Ten years ago Alice Perkins was trapped on a typical working woman's treadmill. As mother of two small children, she was holding down a high-flying civil service job - and spending, she says, 'every waking hour feeling completely exhausted'. Now, as one of the top three women in the Treasury, Perkins is a walking advertisement for management change. She is now working a four-day week, having recently moved to head of defence policy and materiel. Her story is rare in an institution still largely dominated by sober, workaholic men. But if Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, is to be believed, it could become more common. For after decades of being perceived as a bastion of male mandarins, the Treasury has embarked, as part of a wider management shake-up, on an initiative to promote a new 'women-friendly' image. The programme has already challenged some hallowed traditions. In an attempt to change the workaholic culture, the Treasury's 'sin list' that used to name officials who had failed to meet deadlines is fading from view; at another, the Treasury has joined the government's pro-women 'Opportunity 2000' programme and has drawn up targets to monitor the gender balance at different levels of the organisation. But the changes are also raising a broader question relevant outside the Treasury's walls - namely how far can an institution use a wider management shake-up to further the cause of the women in its ranks? The starting point of the Treasury's initiative is embarrassment over its own statistics. Women currently make up 43 per cent of the Treasury staff. But they hold only 9 per cent of the top 124 jobs. And though this percentage is growing, it remains far lower than the proportion of women entering the 'feeder' ranks below. Quite why women should be so under-represented is a matter of some dispute. As officials point out, the proportion is not dramatically worse than in most other civil service departments. Indeed, many believe that the real problem lies in the outside world and the low proportion of female students who study economics. Moira Wallace, a senior official in the general expenditure policy group, says: 'One problem is getting women to apply - people do tend to assume you need a degree in economics to work here which is not true.' But those women who have arrived - often from other civil service departments - admit the institution itself is also to blame. There is little sexual harassment or overt prejudice, they say - with the offices largely staffed by earnest men, the atmosphere has none of the aggressive banter that marks some City banks. But this British reserve conceals more subtle factors that have left some women uneasy. One practical problem has been the workaholic culture which can penalise women with child-care commitments. Another factor is the sheer atmosphere of a building dominated by long, gloomy corridors. Carol Scott, a personnel assistant, for example, arrived from an open plan office in the Department of Trade and Industry - and suffered a distinct culture shock. The Treasury, she found, was a world of closed office doors where 'no one ever said hello to anyone'. But although these gripes are widespread, finding a consensus about how to tackle them has not been easy. Although a women's network was set up last year, it initially provoked some unease. As one woman admits: 'Women are not keen to be seen sticking out their necks here.' After the network held a series of discussions with Sir Terry, the initiative generated more enthusiasm. Nevertheless most women remain adamant that it should not carry any 'women only' tag and that 'positive discrimination' in the form of, say, a quota system for office jobs should be avoided. 'We are not wanting to focus just on women's issues - this affects both men and women,' says Caroline Slocock, head of Treasury personnel policy. 'In the past men thought you had to work all hours to prove your commitment. Now that is being challenged. Families are not just about women but men too.' In practice, this means that targets for flexible working practices are to be introduced across the building. A new, friendlier office culture is to be promoted in special 'awareness' courses - although not compulsory they have been attended by 75 per cent of the male and female staff so far. And to ensure that the men do not feel excluded, they have been invited to selected meetings of the women's network - to discuss, among other things, the issue of 'image'. The acid test of these low-key tactics will be whether they actually result in any more female mandarins. But so far, at least, they appear to have defused any backlash. Mutterings persist about a few middle management 'dinosaurs'. Senior - male  -managers say publicly they are enthusiastic. But rank and file male officials appear to have responded in true Treasury style - with a polite, albeit cautious, nod.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / DTI uncovers insolvency breaches Nearly 9 per cent of insolvency practitioners inspected by the Department of Trade and Industry in the past year seriously breached their obligations under the law, a report said yesterday. Of 160 monitoring visits made in the 12 months to April, reports were produced on 14 which identified 'significant compliance problems'. The problems, all of which have been referred to the relevant professional bodies for regulatory action, included subcontracting of work without adequate controls and payments for the introduction of insolvency work. In addition, a further six practitioners were subject to 'detailed special inspections'. Eight practitioners were under inquiry at the end of the year; another has been charged with criminal offences and is awaiting trial. The details emerged, under the government's Next Steps programme, in the annual report of the Insolvency Service, an executive agency of the DTI. Other failures identified included poor financial records and failure to keep adequate administrative records, including the approval of remuneration. The compliance failures come in spite of initia-tives over the past few months by the insolvency profession to develop a self-regulatory regime as a result of pressure from the Insolvency Service. There were 1,961 licenced insolvency practitioners in the UK last year, down from 1,993 in 1992. They come under the control of seven professional bodies as well as some directly supervised by the DTI. Mr Peter Joyce, inspector-general and chief executive of the Insolvency Service, says in the report that it planned a further 'significant increase' in the volume of prosecutions and disqualifications this year. The comments follow a highly critical report last year by the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, into the relatively low volume of disqualifications. Mr Joyce says the service 'continued to struggle to achieve its targets' in the face of a backlog of 57,000 uncompleted case files of collapsed companies and bankrupt individuals being examined in the middle of last year.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Decline in business confidence reported CONFIDENCE among UK companies about the business outlook has fallen in the past three months, according to a survey published today, increasing concern about a possible further leg to the UK recession. The quarterly survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, found that six out of 10 companies saw no immediate improvement in the outlook for sales or new orders. Expectations were some way below the levels seen in July 1990, at the start of the economic decline. The study is more optimistic about the prospects for exports and profits, but its tone is likely to depress government ministers who - in the approach to the election - are looking for evidence that the economy is on the mend. Publication of the survey will do little to reassure currency investors about the prospects for sterling. Concern about the UK economy has been one of the facts pushing the pound close to its effective floor in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The survey, conducted last month among 1,800 managing directors, found that 41 per cent of companies expected sales in the first quarter of this year to be above those of a year ago, as against 34 per cent that thought turnover would go down. The balance of 7 per cent expecting an improvement compares with a balance of 11 per cent in September 1991. Even though the latest figure is more encouraging than the highly pessimistic soundings in the first nine months of last year, the result raises the possibility that the recession might linger. A similar picture emerges from the replies to questions about new orders, where the balance expecting an increase has declined to 7 per cent, from 13 per cent in September. Those indications about a weak economic outlook come after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, ended a weekend meeting with Treasury ministers and officials to discuss options for his Budget. There has been speculation that the Budget might contain measures such as tax cuts to improve confidence and boost the economy. This week Mr Lamont, who has admitted that his earlier growth forecasts for this year were over-optimistic, will review government figures that may provide clues about a possible upturn. The run of data starts today with consumer credit, which has been extremely weak recently. The government might face further turbulence affecting the pound, which closed at DM2.84 in London on Friday night, 11 pfennigs below its DM2.95 central rate in the ERM and only just above its effective floor set by the peseta, the strongest currency in the system. More positive news for the government from the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey came with a balance of 14 per cent of companies expecting that overseas demand would improve, against a balance of 1 per cent in September. The outlook for employment remains weak, although it has improved slightly since the September survey.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare April 11 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's President Robert  Mugabe has ordered an inquiry into circumstances surrounding  controversial farm lease agreements made under the tenant  resettlement scheme, Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said  in Harare on Monday [11 April]. Mr Dabengwa, who was responding  to questions at a sub-regional seminar on human rights, said as  far as he knew Mr Mugabe was "unaware of what was happening" and  had ordered an inquiry into the leasing of land, ZIANA news  agency reported.    So far 98 farms have been given to mostly senior government  officials and civil servants under the scheme.    The inquiry comes at a time when the ruling ZANU (PF)  [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] is reported as  having called upon the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Water  Development to cancel the farm lease agreements and distribute  the land under the resettlement scheme.    Party secretary Moven Mahachi was quoted as having told the  party's official news organ, THE PEOPLE'S VOICE, that: "The  position of the party is that the land belongs to the people and  not to a few individuals"; and, "the Ministry of Lands should  cancel all these leases and continue with the resettlement  exercise. State farms should not be allocated to a few black  elite. The party should make sure that position is maintained."    Mr Mahachi was quoted as saying while the party was not  against individuals acquiring their own farms, he did not  subscribe to the idea of a few black elite benefiting from land  bought by the state at the expense of the majority.</p>

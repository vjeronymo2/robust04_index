			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Properly Handle the Work on </F> Overseas Chinese Affairs--Warmly Congratulating the Triumphant  Close of the Fifth National Conference of Returned Overseas  Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese"]    [Text] Under the situation in which our country is  deepening reform, expanding opening up, and expediting socialist  modernization, the five-day Fifth National Conference of  Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese has  triumphantly ended. We warmly congratulate the success of the  conference.    Over the past five years since the last conference, our  country has experienced tremendous and profound changes in  various areas -- it has seen political stability, economic  development, national unity, and social progress. These  world-renowned achievements are the result of the thorough  implementation of the spirit of the 14th party congress and the  spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, as well as the result of hard struggle by people  throughout the country, including the broad masses of returned  Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese who have made  efforts on various fronts, and the broad masses of Overseas  Chinese who have given their support and concern. We sincerely  thank them for the valuable contributions they have made to the  prosperity and advancement of the Chinese nation.    The party and government have always attached importance to  returned Overseas Chinese work and have considered the broad  masses of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas  Chinese, and Overseas Chinese as an important force for China's  modernization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out many times  that the broad masses of Overseas Chinese hope to see a  prosperous and developed China, and he viewed giving play to the  active role of Overseas Chinese as an unique opportunity to  greatly develop our country. The All-China Federation of  Returned Overseas Chinese is a people's organization led by the  CPC for unity with returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of  Overseas Chinese of various circles; it is the bridge and link  through which the party and government foster ties with returned  Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas  Chinese. The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese  has already officially become a component of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, and has a larger and  unique role to play in political consultation and democratic  supervision.    Our country is currently facing a very important historical  period. The development of the situation is raising new and  higher demands on the federation of returned Overseas Chinese at  various levels, and these federations should, under the  leadership of the party and government, continue to develop a  patriotic spirit, do a good job in education on collectivism and  socialism, unite with the broad masses of returned Overseas  Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese, and arouse their  enthusiasm and eagerness to work diligently for the country's  prosperity, struggle hard, build the home towns of Overseas  Chinese, and build the motherland.    The "PRC Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of  Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese,"  implemented in 1991, has embodied the government's concern for  returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese and  has enabled returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas  Chinese to have a legal basis for the protection of their  legitimate rights and interests; the federations of returned  Overseas Chinese at various levels should help the government to  do a good job in implementing the "PRC Law on Protecting the  Rights and Interests of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives  of Overseas Chinese," and should do a good job in liaison  between the government and returned Overseas Chinese and  relatives of Overseas Chinese.    The federations of returned Overseas Chinese should go to  the  grass-roots levels and go deep into the realities of life in  order to foster close ties with the broad masses of returned  Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese, listen to  their opinions and reflect their opinions, care for their  sufferings, and properly serve them, really becoming the "close  friend" of the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and  relatives of Overseas Chinese.    The conference this time has commended nearly 1,000 advanced  units and individuals and 10 outstanding persons from the  circles of returned Overseas Chinese. They are the outstanding  elements among the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and  relatives of Overseas Chinese; we sincerely congratulate them,  and we hope to see more outstanding elements emerging.    One important task that the federations of returned Overseas  Chinese at various levels must do well this time is liaison with  Overseas Chinese. "Enable the returned Overseas Chinese to play  their role as a bridge." They should help the relevant  departments to vigorously develop economic, trade, scientific,  technological, and cultural exchanges and cooperation with  Overseas Chinese for the sake of reform, opening up, and  modernization. On one hand, this can help Overseas Chinese to  develop businesses and is conducive to the economic prosperity  of the countries in which they are residing; on the other, this  can promote the development of reform, opening up, and  modernization in our country.    In order to accomplish their important duties and meet the  needs arising from the development of the situation, the  federations of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels must  vigorously strengthen their own reform and construction efforts.  Perfecting organization, training and assigning cadres,  improving work style, and straightening out the management  system have already become urgent tasks.    As far as the future is concerned, by the end of this  century, our country will have initially built the socialist  market economic system, will have realized the second-step  development goal of reaching a comfortable living standard, and  will have pushed the country's comprehensive national strength  to a new level. In 1997 and 1999, our country will resume  sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao respectively and will  realize a smooth transition. This represents major progress in  accomplishing the great undertaking of peaceful reunification of  the motherland according to the principle of "one country, two  systems." It is particularly important to do a good job in  "Overseas Chinese" work at this critical time when the country  confidently strides toward the 21st century and unity,  prosperity, and civilization. It is hoped that the federations  of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels will shoulder the  important duties entrusted to them by the times, unite with the  broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of  Overseas Chinese, and, under the leadership of the party and  government, work together wholeheartedly to make a larger  contribution in the struggle for the motherland's peaceful  reunification and prosperity.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (12): Decisions based on expertise - Knowledge-based Systems THE knowledge-based system is an expert system by any other name. Such systems distill the knowledge of one human expert into a set of rules, to automate processes of judgement and decision-making which would otherwise rely on expensive and scarce human skills. The first commercial fruits of 'artificial intelligence,' AI, expert systems were predicted at one time to become a boom. The promise was that human efforts would be aided by computerised stored knowledge: experience would not be lost to the organisation, even if the expert staff left or retired. End-users were too cautious - or maybe too intelligent - to believe the hype. The wave of companies, products, and publications promoting expert systems has now subsided to leave an invisible tide-mark. As a result of this flop, end-users have been slow to adopt expert systems in applications where they might well have been appropriate. However, in a new, supposedly more trustworthy guise, 'knowledge-based' systems, they have become established as working tools in several specific markets. When academics started experiments with expert systems, the idea was to simulate human thought processes. This involved some 'understanding' of language by the systems, which proved to be largely a matter of establishing and recognising relationships. Early systems were too ambitious and unfocused, experimenting as much with logic and language as they did with 'knowledge.' But the UK's academic research in AI was virtually obliterated 20 years ago, following the Lighthill Report. Instead of killing the embryonic discipline, this demise encouraged its proponents to find commercial incentives to develop their ideas further. The breakthrough came with enormous leap in the capacity of computers. Knowledge-based systems demand a substantial amount of processing power. Where the human brain flashes in instant understanding, the knowledge-based system has to plod though every possibility, comparing and matching the problem with its stored 'experience.' When posed a problem, the knowledge-based system responds with a series of questions, comparing the response with its repository of 'knowledge,' and deducing the most likely answer. Some systems are also able to 'learn' dynamically, adding to their store of knowledge when encountering a new permutation of facts. Developers of knowledge-based systems use the term 'shell' to describe the software framework into which the experts feed their knowledge. The 'knowledge engineer' is a sort of middle man between the expert and the system, establishing the database and its relationships, in effect translating the expert's proffered observations into a structure which can be explored and used by anyone. This means unravelling the strands of logic which combine into human 'experience.' It is not always easy, even for an expert, to define exactly how they know something: it can be 'just a feeling.' The really difficult trick is to map this sort of sensitivity - which is what makes experts truly expert - and translate it into a structure which relies on logical relationships. The system 'learns' these, and in turn is able to teach those who use it, reducing the mystique of a subject into a set of rules. But like many human experts, knowledge-based systems are loth to deliver definite opinions and predictions. They deal in statistical likelihood. One of the first and most famous working knowledge-based systems was concerned with the diagnosis and prescription of drugs. Even so, it did no more than 'suggest' a solution, and was never used in anger. Knowledge-based systems work well in situations where there is finite range of possible answers. They have triumphed in such environments as banking, where they can be used to check credit rating. Here the outcome is limited to 'yes, we will lend', or 'no, we will not.' However, the number of questions to be addressed before the conclusion is reached make this a good candidate for streamlining the process with a knowledge-based system. Other enterprising experts have built systems for commercial use. For example, in the field of recruitment, head-hunters can now put the inexact science of psychometrics to work by putting the candidate in front of a knowledge-based system which cuts down the amount of interviewing time drastically. Computer systems, with their 'if-then-or else' logic, are better at dealing with definites than they are with shades of grey. Software developers often claim to have an element of 'expertise' built into their products. This usually means that there are a number of possible pathways for action, and the software will be pre-programmed to 'recognise' specific circumstances and make the appropriate choice, usually automatically. This differs from the true knowledge-based system, where the intervention of human decision-makers will always be needed to reach the final judgement. The system is a mere aid, a tool to save time and enable non-experts to trace their way through a process of deduction. Its output can only be as good as its programming, and ultimately its source of expertise. Perhaps the computer industry understands this better than those outside it. It is noticeable that those organisations using knowledge-based systems are generally steeped in information technology, and aware of its limitations as well as its potential.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 16 May (MENA) -- MENA has learned that the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations scheduled to be held in Cairo  tomorrow, Tuesday, have been postponed until after the 'Id  al-Adha holiday.    Diplomatic sources in Cairo said the talks were postponed  because of the Muslims' celebration of 'Id al-Adha next week,  which precludes continuing the talks. [passage omitted]</p>

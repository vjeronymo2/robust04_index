			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Acsis deficit cut in first half Acsis Group, the healthcare and interior contracting concern, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 285,000 for the first half of 1992. Mr Ephraim Barsam, chairman, said that during the period, NMS, the international healthcare company, operated profitably and increased the number of nurses working. However, the poor economic climate in California - one of the major markets - has slowed the rate of growth. The continuity sales division traded profitably and was successful in reducing stock levels. The interior contracting side incurred a loss, but won significant new contracts valued in excess of Pounds 2m which has improved its order book for the second half. Mr Barsam pointed out, however, that the group's performance was largely dependent upon exchange rates as a substantial part of its earnings and debt were denominated in US dollars. Turnover for the period dropped from Pounds 15.61m to Pounds 8.58m. Losses per share were 0.04p (0.7p) and there is again no interim dividend.</p>

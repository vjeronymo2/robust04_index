			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Motoring: High marks from the high heeled CARS ARE often categorised. A purple metallic Ford Escort or VW Golf cabriolet is a hairdresser's car; a Porsche 911 a yuppy's car (whatever happened to yuppies?); a Nissan 200SX a florist's car; a Volvo 340, Honda Civic, Nissan Sunny or Toyota Starlet a pensioner's car. Yes, it is unfair. But life is unfair, to motor manufacturers as it is to everyone else. The biggest category of all, though, into which many a car is dismissively consigned, is that of the woman's car. But what is a woman's car? Is there really such a thing? Or is it a mythical concept, put about by men fighting a rearguard action against what they perceive as a female assault on a male bastion? And I must make the point that those who use the term 'woman's car' pejoratively often reckon any car taking longer than eight seconds to hit 60 mph (96 kmh) from a standstill is a mechanised shopping trolley - and a fairly arthritic one at that. When I say I have been researching what makes an ideal woman's car, I really mean that I have asked my wife. She is not a typical woman motorist in that she drives more cars each year than most people do in a lifetime. But this, I would argue, makes her better qualified than the woman who has driven nothing but Minis since passing her test in one 30 years ago. (Yes, they really exist). So, what features would the thinking woman driver expect of a car? First comes reliability, because women have good reason to fear the danger as well as the inconvenience of a roadside breakdown. Next is safety. The car must feel and be strong. There must be good all-round visibility from the driving seat. Windscreen pillars must not be too obstructive. There should be see-through rear quarters. A rear window wipe/wash system is useful on a saloon, essential on an estate or hatchback. Ideally, the car will have anti-lock brakes and the ride will be fairly firm for confident handling. Power steering is essential, automatic transmission desirable. The turning circle should be small. Seats should be soft and cloth-trimmed and the outside mirrors adjustable from inside the car. Controls must be light with all the minor ones as near the steering wheel as possible. I am told a treadle-type accelerator pedal makes driving in high-heeled shoes much easier. Other female desirables are a good-sized lockable glove box, door panniers and net pockets for maps in the front seat backs. ('I cannot', says my wife, 'bear loose things moving around on the seats or floor'). The boot must be as large as possible, with a flat sill to make it easy to lift things into. Four wide-opening doors are preferred to only two. In any case, they must have strong stays to keep them open - 'I want to get in and out of a car parked on a steep camber without fear of having my legs amputated.' Nothing should reflect in the windscreen; there should be an interior release for tailgate and fuel filler flap and the filler cap must be easy to take off and replace. ('On some cars, they have been so stiff and awkward that only a gorilla could have managed them without a struggle'). The car must be nippy enough for quick, safe overtaking. Statistics promising neck-jerking standing-starts and licence-losing maximum speeds cut little ice with women drivers. Excess muscularity comes a poor second to perceived strength and safety - and the car must still have reasonable value at trade-in time. So what might be a typical 1992 woman's car? The latest Pounds 10,995 Daihatsu Applause 1.6GXi that my wife and I are now taking it in turns to use gets her approving nod on most counts. True, it does not have a treadle-type accelerator and the door stays could be stronger. But the 16-valve, 105 horsepower engine is lively, even if it becomes a bit buzzy when cruising on a motorway, and the five-speed gearbox and clutch are light. It has central locking, power-operated windows and door mirrors and - most unusually - front and rear seats that recline. Around 40 mpg (7.06 l/100 km) is achievable on a journey. Tailgate and fuel flap are released from the driving seat and the filler cap is as easy to manage as the top of an instant coffee jar. The seats are nice and squashy, the boot huge and low silled. Although it looks like a four-door saloon, the Applause is really a hatchback and, yes, the back window which lifts with the boot lid has a wash-wipe. It is about as exciting as a food processor, but just as useful. And it comes with a three-year unlimited mileage warranty.</p>

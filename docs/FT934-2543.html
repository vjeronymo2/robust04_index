			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Nigerian liquefied gas project to go ahead A controversial Nigerian liquefied natural gas project which has been beset by political and commercial uncertainty is to go ahead, according to one of its main backers. The multi-billion dollar project, one of the largest in the world under consideration, has been restructured to emphasise private sector involvement, according to Mr David Pearce, director of Shell International Gas. He told a Financial Times conference in Vienna yesterday that the shareholding of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in the project would fall by 11 percentage points to 49 per cent. Shell's share would rise by 4 percentage points, while that of Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil company, would increase by 5 points. The International Finance Corporation, the private sector finance arm of the World Bank, would take a 2 per cent stake. Agip, the Italian oil company, was also a partner. Mr Pearce said a significant amount of the planned equity in the project would be placed in an escrow account to 'establish financial confidence' among potential lenders. Shell is also assuming a larger role in the management of the development. The need to re-bid contracts for the project next year means it will not be completed before well into 1999. The growing world demand for gas which has encouraged companies to embark on projects such as that proposed for Nigeria was a recurrent theme among speakers at yesterday's conference. Shell, for example, predicted a 50 per cent increase in demand by 2010, excluding the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Most agreed that the strongest growth was likely to come in Asia. Mr Fritz Voight of Exxon suggested that gas would remain the fastest growing fuel there until 2010. The optimism over steadily rising long-term demand was tempered, however, with concerns over future prices, especially if oil prices remained low. Many speakers noted that gas prices would have to rise substantially if remote reserves were to be developed. But a rise in prices to the levels needed to sustain such projects might undercut the competitiveness of gas or lead to the abandonment of high volume, low value industrial markets.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Grim litany of pension faults The pilot study of the way in which pensions were sold to people transferring out of employers' schemes, published this week by the Securities and Investments Board, makes grim reading. It shows a disturbingly widespread failure by advisers and sales agents to get enough information - particularly about the employers' schemes - to be able to give good advice. Overall, the report found fault with nine out of 10 pension transfers. KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm which carried out the study, found just one in 20 files to be satisfactory in cases dealt with before regulators issued guidance about how to conduct the business properly. The guidance, issued by different regulators between July 1992 and March this year, did lead to some slight improvement. Even so, the fact that four-fifths of cases still failed to meet regulatory standards underlines the scale of the problem. This does not mean that four-fifths of the 500,000 pension transfers carried out over the past five years or so came from bad advice: in some of these cases, at least, the right advice could well have been given - even though there is no sign now that proper information was sought on which to base it. Since the extent of the problem became clear, the SIB has been urging people who transferred out of employers' pension schemes not to panic. Chairman Andrew Large said many people had been in touch with the regulators and emphasised that an urgent review was under way. All those who had lost out because of bad advice would be compensated fully. Large added: 'Unless people particularly wish to do so, there is no need to take any action now. If you do feel anxious and wish to take some action, you can write to the compliance officer of the firm from which you bought the pension transfer, or the adviser who arranged it, stating your complaint.' While it could well take a couple of years to review all the cases where people may have been advised wrongly, all should be sorted out well before most retired. The SIB's action is also directed at preventing such abuse in future. But in the couple of months or so before new rules and standards are in place, sales agents and advisers can continue to carry out pension transfer business if they want to - and, more to the point, if anyone wants to buy.</p>

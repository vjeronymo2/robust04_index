			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: ABSA turns in earnings of R491m in first full year ABSA, South Africa's largest banking group, reported attributable earnings of R491.4m (Dollars 174m) in the year to March, the first full year of the group's existence. ABSA was formed in early 1991 from the merger of the United Building Society, Allied, Volkskas and part of the Sage group. A further merger, early in 1992, with the Bankorp group, confirmed ABSA's status as South Africa's largest banking group in terms of assets. The effects of this second merger, which is still being carried out, are not reflected in the current results. The timing of the first merger invalidates comparison with earlier results. The net interest margin was R2.3bn, but set against this was a very large provision of R451m for bad and doubtful debts. Other operating income was R974.5m, leaving total operating income of R2.85bn. Operating expenditure was R2.2bn. Total assets of ABSA rose by 8.5 per cent to R56.2m - in line with the industry, but a 6 per cent drop in real terms. Mortgage loans represent 33 per cent of total assets, reflecting United and Allied's roots as building societies. Total advances in the group came to R42bn. Commenting on the rationalisation, Mr Herc Hefer, chairman, said the group had exceeded expectations by achieving net cost savings of R98m. These arose mainly from the integration of the support services of Allied, United and Volkskas. There were three main phases to the rationalisation which included consolidating the group's insurance interests and related financial services, and integrating support and technical services. Mr Piet Badenhorst, chief executive, said the bad debt figure reflected the fact that the level of provisions in the group had been upgraded to the standard maintained at United. Slightly more than half of the provisions relate to Volkskas. He said the group's exposure to the agricultural sector - currently in the grips of a severe drought - was in line with that of its competitors. Earnings per share rose by 15.2 per cent to 107.6 cents and the dividend was lifted to 39.5 cents from 36 cents. The policy is that the dividend cover, now up to 2.7, should reach 3. Mr Hefer said despite the poor operating climate, further rationalisation savings should help lift profits in the coming year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Staffan Dahllof: "Nordic Superconductor in Two </F> Years"--first two paragraphs are NY TEKNIK introduction]    [Text] In two years seven centimeters of Danish  superconducting wire will have grown to 100 meters of usable  electric cable. A Nordic industrial project is aimed at  resistance-free electricity transmission in 1995.    "It looks promising," said Ove Albertsson of ABB Corporate  Research.    The 7-centimeter long superconducting fragment is found at  the research center of the NKT (Nordic Cable and Wire) company  in Copenhagen. The wire handles a current density of 70,000  amperes (A) per square centimeter, 70 times more than an  ordinary copper cable.    According to the creators this is a world record. There are  longer superconducting cables in Japan, it is true, but there  the current density is only 10 times greater than it is in  traditional electric cables.    Sometime in 1995 NKT promises to demonstrate 100 meters of  superconducting cable that can transmit 50,000 A/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  without loss.    "We will see various application possibilities emerge in  time, but direct current transmission over short distances may  be one of the first applications," said project leader Torsten  Freltoft.    The joint development project is backed by not only NKT but  also ABB, Norsk Hydro, Chalmers Institute of Technology and the  technical institutes in Copenhagen, Tammerfors and Trondheim.    Ove Albertsson of ABB's research division said that  nitrogen-cooled superconductors can be used in many electric  power contexts.    "It will probably involve more than simply replacing copper  cables. Superconductors will also give us entirely new  properties. But we will not know what these may be until we have  the cables."    "ABB's official position has been that Japanese and American  companies are in the lead. But I have become increasingly  convinced that NKT is in the top echelon. Their work looks  promising," he said.    The development of ceramic superconductors accelerated in  the  mid-1980s. They came to be called high-temperature conductors  where high means warmer than absolute zero and preferably over  -196&deg;C., the limit for using liquid nitrogen as a cooling  medium. Although a number of different alloys have proved to be  superconductive the industrial breakthrough has been a long time  coming.    The alloy that the Nordic cable developers are working with  consists of bismuth, lead, strontium, calcium and copper oxide.  The production process is called the powder in tube method.  Powder is packed into a silver tube with a diameter of 5-7 mm.  The tube is stretched to a thread and rolled out to a 0.1-mm  thick band that is then sintered in an oven.    "Now and then there are reports of new usable alloys in the  literature. We test them too, but we expect to continue working  with the method and the material we have now," Freltoft said.    The Nordic industrial project, based in Copenhagen, has a  budget of around 40 million kronor, half of which is supplied by  industry. The Nordic industrial fund contributes 15 percent. The  rest is financed with various national grants.</p>

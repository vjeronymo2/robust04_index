			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORBES FETE: BIRTHDAY FIT FOR A SULTAN  </P> <P> The invitations, printed on Forbes stationery, began: "Our father is not in  heaven yet, and as he also still signs our paychecks we are anxious to make his  seventieth birthday a memorable one . . . "  </P> <P> Indeed, the five children of Malcolm Stevenson Forbes have made sure that when  their father, the chairman and editor in chief of Forbes magazine, turns the  big seven-O on Saturday he won't feel too ancient.  </P> <P> Early this morning, limousines began pulling up to Hangar 14 at the John F.  Kennedy International Airport in New York, where some 600 friends and business  associates, including California Gov. George Deukmejian and his wife Gloria,  boarded three chartered planes. Destination: Tangier, Morocco, for a  48-hour-long birthday celebration fit for a sultan. The weekend will be capped  with a black-tie bash at Forbes' private Tangier palace, Palais Mendoub, on  Saturday night.  </P> <P> Titans of big business and even the most jaded social types are ga-ga.  </P> <P> "It's inconceivable," said Barry Kaye, president of Barry Kaye Associates, a  life insurance agency in Century City, who is a guest along with his wife,  Carole.  </P> <P> "This is Malcolm's style," allowed advice columnist Abigail Van Buren, who is  attending with her husband Mort Phillips.  </P> <P> Granted, the guest list alone reads something like, well, the Forbes 400.  Included are the chairmen and chief executive officers of dozens of major  corporations, including Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chrysler Corporation,  Compaq Computer Corp. and Computerland Corp. -- and those are just some of the  Cs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Famous Faces  </P> <P> There are famous faces, including Elizabeth Taylor (Forbes' date), Henry  Kissinger, Walter Cronkite, William F. Buckley, Barbara Walters and her husband  Merv Adelson. There are headline makers, such as Wall Street star Henry Kravis  and his wife, designer Carolyne Roehm. There are media tycoons, such as John  Kluge, Rupert Murdoch, Katherine Graham and Mort Zuckerman. There are fashion  designers Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Arnold Scaasi. There are the  governors of New Jersey and Rhode Island. Even Robin Leach, the host of  television's "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," made the list.  </P> <P> The small Southern California contingent includes Betsy Bloomingdale, Leonard  and Caroline Firestone, and Daniel Tellep, chairman and chief executive officer  of Lockheed Corp.  </P> <P> Another 200 or so Moroccan guests will join the party, including King Hassan  II, who is hosting a luncheon for the entire group Sunday before their  departure.  </P> <P> The guest list illustrates how Forbes has refined the art of mixing business  with pleasure. Barry Kaye says that once he began advertising in the magazine  last October, "all of a sudden we were invited for a couple lunches and a ride  on the yacht. This is the way he develops his business. He's written about it.  He just develops a wonderful relationship with you."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deukmejian on List  </P> <P> Apparently, Gov. Deukmejian made the list not for his advertising budget but  because he appeared on the magazine's cover February 27, 1984, and subsequently  met twice with the Forbes editorial staff.  </P> <P> Has he ever previously attended a Forbes party? "Not to my knowledge," says a  spokesman in Sacramento. "This would be the first one."  </P> <P> For early calendar entry, invitations were first mailed out in March and signed  by Forbes' children Malcolm Jr. (Steve), Robert (Bob), Christopher (Kip),  Timothy (Tim) and Moira Forbes Mumma. Since then "Ali-Dada" (as his children  call Forbes in the invitation) updates began arriving, including the latest,  sent by Federal Express to the California contingent at least, which arrived  Monday and included a map to Hangar 14 at JFK and an airport pass.  </P> <P> A few feathers flew when it was learned that three planes would be flying: a  DC8, a 747 and Concorde. Those not earmarked for the faster-flying Concorde  feared that a caste system was in operation. But Don Garson, director of  corporate communications at Forbes, says that the decision was purely  democratic. "Anybody who came a distance to get to New York will be on the  Concorde," he said. Van Buren (and presumably the rest of the West Coast  contingent) is assigned to Concorde.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tangier Itinerary  </P> <P> The itinerary in Tangier begins with dinner upon arrival tonight at the Solazur  Hotel, and the opportunity to shop or sightsee Saturday. The birthday bash  unfolds Saturday night at Forbes' dazzling Palais Mendoub with dinner, dancing  and fireworks. Dress code: Black tie, ball gowns, turbans and tiaras are all in  order. "Scheherazade," as the invitation pointed out, "took 1,001 nights to  keep her old man happy -- we're counting on one night in a thousand in a  Moroccan palace to keep The Chairman smiling."  </P> <P> Forbes purchased Palais Mendoub to serve as headquarters for the magazine in  1970, around the time of the international oil crisis, so that he could publish  an Arabic Forbes, beginning in 1972. The Arabic edition disbanded five or six  years later.  </P> <P> In his new book, "More Than I Dreamed," to be published in October by Simon  &amp; Schuster, Forbes describes his first reaction to seeing the palace  perched on a cliff. "The physical setting was breathtaking. To your right you  can see Gibraltar. Straight ahead is Algeciras, the southernmost tip of Europe,  only 20 minutes away. And to your left, the site of the battle of Trafalgar,  and at the same time you can see every ship that enters or leaves the  Mediterranean." No one will say how much the party is costing, or who is  footing the bill, or for that matter, whether the whole thing will be written  off on Forbes' taxes. A previously published estimate of a $2-million cost for  the party was neither confirmed nor denied by Forbes' press office. "We don't  know where that number comes from," said a spokesperson. "We never release  numbers."  </P></p>

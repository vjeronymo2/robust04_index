The  report, portions of which were printed in Caracas newspapers, said the 14 were  shot in the back and the back of the head, many at close range, "which makes it  presumable the deaths . . . (were) not the product of a confrontation." The  military originally reported the incident as a gun battle with guerrillas, but  two survivors later testified that it was a massacre of civilians.  </P></p>

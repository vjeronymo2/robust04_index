			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: CASH IN CLASS A: NOT CHIPPER WITH CLIPPERS  </P> <P> If you're a fan of the Batavia, N.Y., Clippers, the Philadelphia Phillies'  Class A team in the New York-Penn League, you already know that former manager  Dave Cash has been reassigned to his previous position as a roving minor league  infield instructor. The Phillies' former All-Star second baseman was the  Clippers' manager for less than a month.  </P> <P> Stuff happens. But how?  </P> <P> During a game with Oneonta last Monday night, the view of the field for Cash's  wife, Pamela, was blocked by the team's mascot, Chipper the Clipper, a  blue-feathered, yellow-beaked Big Bird sort of creature.  </P> <P> She said she asked Chipper to move, then tapped him on the shoulder.  </P> <P> "He shook his behind in my face in front of my two young children," Pamela Cash  said. "I thought that kind of behavior by a mascot at what's supposed to be a  family-oriented place was totally uncalled for. This wasn't the first time he  shook his butt in my face."  </P> <P> She said she then got into a fight about the incident with a club official.  </P> <P> Cash commented on his brief tenure as manager: "From my perspective, we  experienced a lot of rudeness. It's best that we no longer are in this  situation."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Which NFL quarterback attempted the most passes in 1989?  </P> <P> Postponed, darkness: Thursday, nine months after an earthquake measuring 7.1 on  the Richter scale hit the Bay Area, Seton Medical Center in San Francisco  reported a 25% increase in births.  </P> <P> "We can only surmise that the two must be connected," said Dr. Gwen Marcus,  director of nurseries at the hospital.  </P> <P> Stay tuned for the birth statistics nine months after the resumption of the  Giants-A's World Series.  </P> <P> Sartorial supremacy: An item in Saturday's Morning Briefing noted that Inside  Sports has rated UCLA's home uniforms third best in college football.  </P> <P> The magazine's top two: "1. Florida State. The combination of garnet and gold  is macho but not macabre, and the helmet design is one of the most distinctive  around. 2. Michigan. Really now -- is there a more discernible symbol in  college football than the maize-and-blue's winged headgear?"  </P> <P> Wait a minute: Memo to Inside Sports' fact-checkers: Wolverines have wings?  </P> <P> Perfect agreement: National League umpire Eric Gregg, interviewed Friday on  National Public Radio's "Fresh Air," recounted a time he called a Dodger  baserunner out at second in front of a sellout crowd at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> The play wasn't close, Gregg said, but when he looked up he saw manager Tom  Lasorda charging out of the dugout.  </P> <P> Gregg: "Lasorda says to me, 'Are we on national TV?' I said, 'No.' He said,  'OK, let's go.' "  </P> <P> Add Gregg: Asked how he calls a play at first base, he said that he watches the  runner's foot touch the bag and listens for the sound of the ball in the first  baseman's mitt.  </P> <P> Could he remember when this technique failed him?  </P> <P> "One time I blinked," Gregg said. "You pick one. You can't tell if it's right  or wrong. 'Uh-oh. Here they come . . . No one comes . . . I guess I got that  one right.' "  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Green Bay's Don Majkowski, 599.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Jose Canseco, when asked to describe his ideal personal bodyguard:  "A black belt who knows how to use an Uzi."

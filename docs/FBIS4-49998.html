			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Sun Chengbin (1327 2110 </F> 2430): "Work Together in Building a Broad Way Leading to Hong  Kong's Return -- Writing at a Time When Preliminary Working  Committee Members From Interior China Are Leaving Hong Kong for  Beijing"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 10 May (XINHUA) -- After successfully  completing their agenda in Hong Kong, all 16 Chinese members of  the Administrative and Economic Subcommittees of the Preliminary  Working Committee [PWC] for the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region [HKSAR] Preparatory Committee have left Hong Kong for  Beijing today. This was the first time the PWC held  subcommittee meetings in Hong Kong since the PWC was founded in  July last year; and it was also the first time that PWC members  from interior China visited Hong Kong. People in Hong Kong  universally welcomed the meetings and the visit because they  fully reflected the sincerity which PWC members demonstrated in  establishing widespread contacts with the Hong Kong people, in  listening to their heartfelt wishes, and in strengthening ties  with them; and also because they also reflected PWC members'  open-mindedness, democratic and pragmatic workstyle, and  earnestness.    During the short eight-day period, the PWC's administrative  and economic subcommittees respectively held their seventh  meetings -- each of which lasted two days -- to examine the work  in the past six months; and they reached common understanding on  certain issues, including the principles for forming the first  legislative council in the HKSAR, and coordination between Hong  Kong and interior China on capital construction projects. These  were the major successes that members of the two subcommittees  achieved during their stay in Hong Kong.    The convening of the PWC meetings in Hong Kong has enormous  and far-reaching significance and influence because, on the one  hand, it enabled members from interior China to examine Hong  Kong's social, political, and economic life themselves so that  they could understand Hong Kong more specifically and more  directly, and so that PWC operations will occur more in line  with the true state of affairs in Hong Kong. On the other hand,  it helped the vast number of Hong Kong people acquire a deeper  understanding of PWC operations, and it also strengthened the  ties and communications between the PWC and Hong Kong people,  thus providing a concrete guarantee for successful PWC  operations and for a smooth transition in Hong Kong.    Aside from the tightly scheduled meetings, PWC members from  interior China also took advantage of the precious opportunity  to meet with members of 30 grass-roots organizations and  political groups in Hong Kong to hear their views and  suggestions on Hong Kong and PWC affairs during the transitional  period; to inspect Hong Kong's consolidated exchange, citizens'  public housing village, and container wharf; and to discuss  important transition matters with National People's Congress  deputies, members of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as Hong Kong  and district affairs advisors who were in Hong Kong. Speaking  at luncheons hosted by five chambers of commerce, including the  Hong Kong China Chamber of Commerce, Lu Ping, PWC vice chairman  and secretary general, profoundly and specifically elaborated on  the origin and contents of the "one country, two systems" policy  as well as China's general and specific policies for Hong Kong.  The widespread contacts which the PWC members from interior  China established with Hong Kong's grass roots, their many  contacts with mass organizations, the many subject matters they  discussed, and the depth of the discussions all show the  sincerity of PWC members from interior China toward establishing  a genuine dialogue with the vast number of Hong Kong people, the  importance they attached to Hong Kong people's heartfelt wishes,  and their open-mindedness and democratic work style. All this  has strengthened the understanding and mutual trust between the  PWC and Hong Kong people and built the foundation for more  effective PWC operations in the future.    Affairs closely related to Hong Kong people's vital  interests  have always been the PWC's focus of attention since its  founding. The PWC Economic Subcommittee has also set up research  panels to study several issues of concern by people in Hong  Kong. During their stay in Hong Kong, PWC members from interior  China also extensively listened to the views and suggestions of  people of all strata and various groups about "high land prices,  high rents, and high housing prices" as well as retirees'  security and stabilization of civil servants' ranks -- issues  which all people in Hong Kong have been following with great  interest. This shows that the PWC attaches great importance to  the interests of people in Hong Kong and that it holds itself  responsible to the people in Hong Kong.    The PWC's main task is to work to facilitate preparations  for  the HKSAR so that the policies of "one country, two systems" and  the "administration of Hong Kong by people in Hong Kong" can be  implemented, Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-range  prosperity and stability can be ensured, and people in Hong Kong  can live and work in contentment after 1997 and can work  together to create an even more prosperous Hong Kong. The  extensive contacts and communications between the PWC members  from interior China and people in Hong Kong show that PWC  operations require the active involvement of Hong Kong's people,  that people in Hong Kong are glad to be involved, and that  communications, understanding, and cooperation between the PWC  and people in Hong Kong are entirely possible.    People are pleased to note that when people of all strata in  Hong Kong contacted the PWC, they could act with candor, say all  they wanted to say, and could present their many enlightening  and constructive views and proposals. Some even came forward  with detailed, comprehensive, thoroughly investigated, and  earnestly researched proposals on certain issues. All this has  fully demonstrated the Hong Kong people's sense of  responsibility as masters of Hong Kong -- a sense exemplified by  their readiness to cooperate closely with the PWC as well as  their patriotism and love for Hong Kong. Their views and  proposals, which are important for the PWC to take into account  in its future operations, constitute one of the biggest rewards  PWC members from interior China acquired during their stay in  Hong Kong.    People of all walks of life in Hong Kong followed closely  the  visit which PWC members from interior China paid in Hong Kong,  and all media in Hong Kong reported the members' activities and  the meetings' progress. Many scholars, experts, and celebrities  expressed their views and suggestions on PWC operations and Hong  Kong's future in newspaper and magazine articles. The PWC has  become a thread connecting the vast number of people in Hong  Kong. It has rallied more and more people in Hong Kong to work  hard together to achieve the historical tasks of achieving "one  country, two systems" and the "administration of Hong Kong by  Hong Kong people," ensuring Hong Kong's smooth transition, and  maintaining its prosperity and stability.    "One country, two systems" is a great, broadminded, and  creative concept, and the materialization of this great concept  as well as the actual work involved also require the same  broadmindedness and the spirit that we can achieve anything if  we are united. While the PWC members from interior China have  now left Hong Kong for Beijing, we hope that the ties and  communications between the PWC and people in Hong Kong will  continue to strengthen. The many grass-roots organizations and  celebrities in Hong Kong who are willing to work hard for Hong  Kong's future have already built a strong and unimpeded avenue  of communications between the PWC and people in Hong Kong.    It has been the aspiration of countrymen in Hong Kong for  several generations over the past 150 years or so to completely  remove the humiliation of colonial rule, return to the embrace  of the motherland, and enjoy again the dignity and pride of a  great nation. Today, history has bequeathed on us the great task  of accomplishing this historical mission. Our motherland, which  is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, will provide the  strong support for accomplishing this mission. Hong Kong's  brilliant tomorrow has already been outlined in the blueprint of  "one country, two systems." While working hard for Hong Kong's  future, the PWC members and the vast number of people in Hong  Kong are also working on the project of building a broad way  leading to a bright future with Hong Kong's return to the  motherland. We are fully convinced that, with the involvement  and support of the vast number of people in Hong Kong, all  preliminary work facilitating the preparations for the HKSAR  will be accomplished on time, and the "Pearl of the Orient"  under the five-star red flag will shine with even greater  brilliance!</p>

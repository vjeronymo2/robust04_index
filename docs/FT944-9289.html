			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Growing companies The Stock Exchange's plan for a junior stock market risks being undercut by a rival scheme unveiled yesterday by the European Association of Securities Dealers. The main difference is that the EASD plan is commercially motivated. Since its backers will be required to risk their own capital, it will be marketed vigorously. EASD is already targeting entrepreneurial groups across Europe. The Stock Exchange plan for an Alternative Investment Market, by contrast, was a response to the outcry when it decided to close the Unlisted Securities Market. So far AIM has no clear focus, beyond being a home for companies unsuitable for the exchange's main market. There may, of course, be room for both markets. But the bigger question is whether there is room for either. EASD has shown that companies want to raise capital through such a market. Now it must convince shareholders to invest through it.</p>

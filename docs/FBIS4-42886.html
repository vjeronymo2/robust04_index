			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Flemming Behrendt: "Helveg Petersen: </F> Flexibility Creates Jobs" -- from the ERHVERV section]    [Text] Paris -- On the first day of their meeting  yesterday, the ministers from the OECD countries were able to  reach agreement that worldwide competition, technical progress,  and long-term structural changes are in the interest of member  nations. From this, it follows that protectionism,  old-fashioned production structures, and social rigidity -- to  say nothing of stubbornness -- are to be condemned.    In his speech, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen  (Radical Liberal Party) warned especially against state support  which can harm competition -- a pointed message to the host  country, among others. And the minister was able to voice  particular thanks for the OECD's contribution to the  normalization of the competition in the shipyard sector.    The meeting of ministers was able to give its backing to the  OECD's major analysis of unemployment and job creation. On the  subject of Denmark's modest position in the overall job creation  picture in the 1980's, Helveg Petersen told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE:    ``The report clearly shows that there is a need to do more  on  the labor market side than we have done hitherto in the way of  labor market reforms and the cuts in income tax which have been  an important Danish structural problem.    ``But we have a good tradition in Denmark and it is that it  is the two sides of industry which not only have the right to  fix, but also the responsibility for the consequences of wage  and working conditions. This is something that we will not  change.    ``We must not start fixing minimum wages or other working  conditions in law. A more flexible system would be an  advantage.''    [Behrendt] The meeting of ministers has spoken of the  "inadequate and apathetic adjustment" of member nations'  economies to the rapid changes resulting from technological  progress, competition, and "globalization."    [Helveg Petersen] The two sides of industry would be very  wise to study this material in detail and be inspired by what  the wise people here have been sitting discussing.    But I remain very firm that this is their -- the two sides  of  industry -- problem. It is they who have to work to make  adjustments and keep up the good tradition in order to create a  more flexible system.    [Behrendt] Does the high level of social support in Denmark  have a role to play?    [Helveg Petersen] I do not think we can attack the problem  that way and immediately create a more satisfactory level of  employment by changing the rules we already have.    [Behrendt] What can the Danish Government do in order to  avoid the same defeat over proposals for lower wages for those  entering the labor market as suffered by the French Government  here this spring?    [Helveg Petersen] We can only emphasize to the two sides of  industry that because of their great influence they have a joint  responsibility for the employment situation.    They have to accept part of the "blame" for those things  which go wrong. [Helveg Petersen ends]    Helveg Petersen was unwilling to speculate about which of  the  many recommendations in the OECD report will determine Denmark's  profile when the secretariat comes to report on national  profiles in the fall.    "But on the training and education side in particular, we  have a big job to do."</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Fear of increased issuance in Japan - Capital &amp; Credit Although it has not been hit as hard as other countries, Japan has not been spared during this year's worldwide tumble in bond prices. Signs of economic recovery, currency volatility, heavy supply of new bonds and political uncertainty have combined to push bond yields up by about 1.5 points since January to a high of 4.6 per cent last week. Evidence that the recession is at last coming to an end - the Bank of Japan's latest tankan survey showed the first upturn in business confidence for five years, and gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 - has triggered fears of rising inflation. But with most analysts expecting inflation to fall during the remainder of 1994 and growth expected to be less than  1/2 per cent in the year, the fears are hard to justify. What investors in the Japanese bond market really fear is that economic recovery will be so strong that short-term interest rates are unlikely to fall much further and, more importantly, that the recovery will increase the supply of bonds from the corporate sector. 'It is clear from the level of bond yields that the financial markets are pricing in a sharp recovery, while the economic data only suggests a bottoming out,' says Mr Eric Fishwick, analyst at IBJ Research. 'They are expecting this recovery to follow previous recoveries, which have been quick and largely investment-led,' he says. 'So for them, bottoming-out is synonymous with recovery and will mean a surge in demand for capital.' Fears of an oversupply of bonds have also been fuelled by Japan's political troubles. The resignation of Prime Minister Hata has led to a new socialist-led coalition government less committed to controlling the budget deficit. It has pledged a further cut in income taxes to boost the economy, while postponing a planned offsetting rise in consumption taxes. The markets have taken this to mean the government will have to increase bond issuance to finance the deficit. It is these concerns which have prompted bond dealers to mark prices down to such an extent, and hedge funds and foreign investors to sell JGBs. Overseas investors have also been tempted by the strength in the yen to sell Japanese bonds and take profits. Equities have been one of the main beneficiaries of the sell-off in bonds, with investors attracted by the prospect of economic recovery. 'Throughout the bond market decline, however, Japanese investors have been buying their own bond market. They are cash-rich and with so much currency volatility they really have to stay with assets denominated in yen,' says Mr Sanjay Joshi, chief economist at Daiwa Europe. The recent rise of the yen should, in theory, offset some of these sources of weakness in the bond market. Its strength should repress inflation and is likely to hold back the fragile recovery, and so reduce the likelihood of a rise in interest rates. If the yen remains strong the Bank of Japan will come under increasing pressure to relax monetary policy. 'There is usually a strong correlation between the strength of the yen and rises in the JGB market,' said Mr Joshi. This time, however, that relationship seems to have been broken. 'After the recent appreciation there was no reaction from bonds, which means they are now vulnerable to any downward correction in the currency,' he said. The reason for this, analysts say, is that investors think the current level of the yen is unsustainable so they prefer to liquidate their holdings of bonds and take profits now before the yen falls back again. Views about the outlook for JGBs are divided. Some analysts believe yields have risen too far and that as it becomes increasingly evident that a strong recovery is not imminent, a correction is inevitable. Mr Jim Vestal, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, predicts the benchmark yield will fall below 4 per cent during the next two months. Other analysts think the market may stabilise as more domestic institutional investors are attracted by high long-term yields. Some Y440bn of public pensions and welfare funds are expected to be allocated to fund managers in the next few weeks. Yet others believe the markets have been expecting an imminent, strong recovery for so long they are not about to change their view now. Mr Fishwick sees yields rising as high as 6 per cent by the beginning of next year. Meanwhile, the bond market will be cheered if the G7 countries move to support the dollar by raising US and lowering Japanese interest rates. Whether the Japanese bond market recovers will depend on a number of factors, not least the pace of economic recovery and international sentiment. Worries about oversupply and the credibility of the new government's fiscal programme are likely to continue to depress the market and in the longer term, the strength of the yen will probably dominate. But as long as Japan's politics remain uncertain and the yen volatile, its bond market is unlikely to settle.</p>

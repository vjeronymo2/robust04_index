			<p>BFN     [Text] The idea for an inter-Balkan conference for  cooperation between the countries of the region after peace is  established in the former Yugoslavia took up most of the time in  today's talks between Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and new  Yugoslavia Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. Following the  meeting which lasted for three and a half hours, Papoulias said  that Greece, together with Bulgaria and Romania, and with the  support of Hungary and Ukraine, will issue a joint declaration  to the United Nations calling for the lifting of the embargo  against the former Yugoslavia.    Other issues examined in the Papoulias-Jovanovic meeting  included the latest air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Greece's role within the framework of the European Union.  Replying to correspondents' questions, Papoulias said that he  will relay the ideas and thoughts discussed in today's meeting  to Washington, and he stressed that Greece wishes to expand the  efforts toward finding a solution to the Bosnian problem.    From his side, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jovanovic thanked  the Greek people for their support for the Serbs, and stressed  that Greece is an important factor of stability in the region  and that Greece's presidency of the European Union gives more  importance to this issue. Asked about the message he wants  Papoulias to relay to Washington, Jovanovic stressed that the  Serbs ask from those who can exert influence that they deal with  them as equals to the others because his people favor peace. He  said that under the pressure of air strikes no one can discuss  anything. In addition, Jovanovic said that the situation in  Krajina is proceeding positively and stressed that he is against  the phenomenon of [word indistinct] of military operations.</p>

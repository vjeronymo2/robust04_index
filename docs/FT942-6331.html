			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Pensions With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that two long-term trends supported the equity market in the 1980s. The steady rise in dividend payout ratios, recently highlighted by the government, helped support share valuations. The steady drift of UK pension funds out of bonds and into equities underpinned liquidity. Whether or not the government moves to reverse the first trend, pension funds may start to drift back in favour of bonds. At the start of the 1980s, the average scheme belonging to the National Association of Pension Funds had 2.5 active members for every pensioner. By the end of last year, that ratio had fallen to almost one to one. Industrial restructuring and the wave of early retirements doubtless accelerated this process. While there is no reason to expect a further sudden shift in the balance, the assets of many pension funds are already a poor match for their liabilities. Exactly what proportion of funds' liabilities now relate to pensions in payment is difficult to judge. For the average scheme, though, the figure is likely to be around one third. While such liabilities would normally be matched by investing in bonds, pension funds have on average only 11 per cent of assets held in fixed-interest and index-linked bonds. Large surpluses built up during the 1980s allowed trustees to ignore the problem. But with surpluses falling - the reduction in gross funds' tax credit on dividends contributed to the erosion - the mismatch of assets and liabilities is more difficult to defend.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA) -- Bilateral relations between  the Republic of China [ROC] and Indonesia may be on the verge of  a major breakthrough with the forthcoming private visit by  President Li Teng-hui to the Southeast Asian country.    According to foreign wire service reports, Li is scheduled  to  visit the tourist island of Bali this week. During his  three-day stay, Li will meet with Indonesian President Suharto  and Minister of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie.    Indonesia is one of the major targets in Taipei's "southern  strategy" launched late last year to promote bilateral  cooperation with Southeast Asia. Other countries targeted by  the plan include Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.    During his visit to Indonesia, Li is expected to raise the  question of Taiwan's planned US$10 billion investment on the  island of Batam, 20 kilometers southeast of Singapore.    Taipei is attaching even greater importance to Indonesia  these days because Indonesia is the current chairman country of  the non- aligned movement and the host of the 1994 Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meetings.    Taiwan, with 56 investments worth more than US$1.056  billion,  was the biggest investor country in Indonesia in 1991, according  to Indonesian Government statistics.    In 1993, Taiwan investments dropped to 21 projects worth  US$131 million. And by the beginning of this year, Taiwan's  ranking slid to fourth place, behind Japan, Hong Kong and the  Netherlands.    Local economic analysts attributed the decrease in Taiwan  investments in Indonesia to increasing Taiwan investments in  Mainland China and Vietnam.    Indonesia, however, is expected to become the best choice  for  Taiwan investors in 1994, rather than Vietnam, according to Liu  Tai-ying, chairman of the Taiwan Institute for Research.    With its Five-Year National Economic Development Plan  reaching maturity, Indonesia is expected to record 7 percent  economic growth this year, Liu said.    Taiwan investors will succeed in Indonesia if they choose  the  right businesses with right partners, he added.    Economics Minister P.K. Chiang, who visited Indonesia twice  recently, said Taiwan Sugar Corp.'s plan to set up a sugar  refinery in Indonesia will be a good beginning for Taiwan's  state-run enterprises to explore the rich raw materials resource  and cheap labor force in that country.    Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinatrust Commercial Bank  which  has established business links with Indonesia and other  Southeast Asian countries, said Taiwan should emulate the  Japanese formula by locating Taiwan banks in Indonesia where the  banks can directly serve Taiwan investors.    Koo added that peripheral industries, including service  industry, to help with investment are difficult to find in  Indonesia. He suggested that potential investors should form  their own investment army, including up-mid- and down-stream  operations.</p>

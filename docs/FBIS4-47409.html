Pshenichnov  [deceased], Virology Center, Scientific Research Institute of  Microbiology, Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, Sergiyev  Posad; UDC 615.371:578.832.26.012]    [Abstract] It has been shown that Macaca rhesus monkeys  injected with the Mozambique virus, which is closely related to  the Lassa virus in terms of antigens, are protected against  subsequent infection with a virulent strain of the Lassa virus.  Owing to the fact that Mozambique virus is not pathogenic to man  or monkeys, some researchers feel that Mozambique virus is a  candidate for use in the preparation of a live vaccine designed  to prevent Lassa fever. Before that can be done, however,  convincing evidence must be produced to the effect that the  virus is definitely not pathogenic to man, and it must be  certain that the virus would not persist in the human body. Data  published in the late 1980s reported testing of a recombinant  Lassa vaccine on guinea pigs and monkeys, all of whom survived a  lethal dose of Lassa virus after being vaccinated with the  recombinant vaccine. Protection was not total, however, as they  developed short-term fever and virusemia. That prompted the  researchers here to study an inactivated vaccine against Lassa  fever. The vaccine they tested protected Papio hamadryas monkeys  against intramuscular infection of Lassa virus after both two  immunizations and one immunization in doses of 1.1-2.1 mg and  0.5-1.1 mg. The percentage of those protected dropped to 50  percent when infection was via the aerogenic route and  immunization was performed only once, in a dose of 1.1 mg. The  protective effect was observed against the backdrop of an  absence of specific virus-neutralizing antibodies. References  13: 4 Russian, 9 Western.</p>

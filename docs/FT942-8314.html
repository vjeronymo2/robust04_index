			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (5): Soaring volumes strain the stock exchange system / Investigating the impact of electronic trading When electronic trading was introduced on the Athens stock exchange two years ago, brokers complained that their day's work would be over in less than an hour. Now the system threatens to collapse under the strain of soaring volumes and a stream of new listings. The growth in volume underlines how much interest institutional investors have been taking in Greece. The daily average rose from around Dr1.3bn in 1992 to Dr5.8bn in the final quarter of last year, increasing to Dr8bn on days of heavy trading. A shortage of large share packages meant that Athens benefited less than other emerging markets from last year's buying spree by US institutions. However, overseas investors drove the market to a two-year high in January and are still thought to account for more than 30 per cent of the free float. Market capitalisation at the end of the first quarter totalled Dr3,377bn, equivalent to 17 per cent of Greece's gross domestic product. The screen-based trading system is now being upgraded, but the pace of new listings will slow for most of this year. More than 30 flotations are planned, together with another 25 rights issues. The lack of an efficient settlement system also frustrates foreign investors. The surge in activity means that settlement can take up to a week rather than the statutory three days. 'The market's development is being held back by the absence of paperless settlement. You can work around the limitations of the trading system, but overseas clients need proper settlement procedures,' says Mr Dimitris Verriopoulos of Alpha Brokerage. The wave of new listings indicates how attitudes have changed as Greek companies plan strategies for staying competitive in the European market and expanding into eastern Europe. Many large Greek companies remain family-owned and managed. Some older generation managers still claim that the benefits of going public are outweighed by the disadvantages of becoming accountable to shareholders and assuming a higher profile for the tax authorities. But high interest rates make the stock market an attractive proposition, while family owners need not lose control: the minimum capital increase required for a listing is 25 per cent. Construction companies started to take the plunge last year, in preparation for bidding for infrastructure projects being co-financed by the European Union. Other new entrants this year will include the first passenger shipping line to be listed, Greece's largest electronic media group, several software manufacturers and textile concerns, a restaurant chain and a fish farm. If the construction company example holds good, several more companies in each of the other sectors will follow suit. 'The business environment is changing so fast that once a market leader in one sector is floated, others must follow in order to safeguard competitiveness. This is widening and deepening the market at an unprecedented rate,' says Mr John Markopoulos, chairman of Sigma Securities. On the other hand, the market's development is constrained by the absence of Greek institutional investors. Although pension funds have large shareholdings, mainly in state-controlled banks, administrative restrictions mean they are rarely traded. While private pension funds invest in mutual funds, they have not yet taken full advantage of deregulation to set up active management operations. According to some estimates, over Dr300bn would become available for trading if the pension funds decided to become active in the market. However, there appears to be no shortage of liquidity, despite high interest rates on tax-free government bonds. Some Dr60bn was raised on the stock market in the first quarter, of which rights issues by listed companies accounted for Dr51bn. The construction company offerings, averaging around Dr3bn each, have been hugely oversubscribed. Bankers involved in underwriting issues say that, given the depth of liquidity, the stock exchange authorities are over-cautious about the size and price of offerings. Only a few companies seek to raise more than Dr5bn, which leaves little margin for placing shares with foreign investors. Under a new regulation, companies will be restricted to one rights issue a year. But a handful of blue chip companies have won approval without difficulty for much larger issues, mostly including an international tranche of 20-25 per cent. Credit Bank, Greece's largest private bank, recently raised Dr31bn through a rights issue, of which 25 per cent was placed with institutional investors abroad. Ionian Bank, a state-controlled bank, also plans a Dr30bn rights issue. Intracom, the telecoms equipment manufacturer, intends to raise about Dr20bn through a rights issue. However, the structuring of Greek issues, where the price is fixed well ahead of a subscription period lasting several weeks, means there is little flexibility on pricing for an international tranche. 'The way it works at present, buyers can't get access to their holdings for several weeks. This raises problems for institutional investors,' says Mr Mario Sophroniou of Barings, which placed the Credit Bank international tranche. But even large Greek offerings pale beside the partial flotation of OTE (the Greek state telecoms monopoly), planned for October. The government intends to sell some 30 per cent of the company through the Athens bourse, although up to half the issue will be offered to buyers abroad. It is hoped to raise at least Dr250bn from the flotation. Advisers at the economy ministry dismiss brokers' fears that the issue might swamp the market, while admitting that it will pose a challenge to local underwriters. If successful, the OTE flotation may be followed by listings of other public utilities such as oil refineries or the public power and gas corporations.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: SKr10bn state guarantees for Gota THE SWEDISH government yesterday said it would provide SKr10bn (Dollars 1.37bn) in guarantees to the troubled Gota Bank to cover part of the bank's anticipated credit losses in 1992 and 1993. It said it was making the move because Gota, Sweden's fourth-largest bank, needed new support immediately to continue operating. The bank would otherwise have fallen well below the 8 per cent minimum international capital adequacy requirement. The guarantee is a temporary measure until the state has been able to complete an orderly reconstruction of the bank. This reconstruction has been facilitated following the state's acquisition of Gota Bank's shares last month after Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, which acquired them as collateral against a loan to the bank's collapsed holding group Gota AB, decided they were worthless. Gota Bank estimated last September that credit losses for the whole of 1992 would amount to some SKr8bn, although it is believed there has been a further deterioration in its position since. One estimate suggests the bank's total 1992 credit losses may amount to SKr10bn-SKr12bn. As a result of the guarantee, Gota Bank's capital adequacy ratio amounts to some 8 per cent. Last month the state was compelled to provide further support for Nordbanken as part of its continuing efforts to prop up Sweden's ailing financial system.</p>

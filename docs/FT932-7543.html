			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / How To Spend It: Loafing in your car THERE are those for whom Gucci is still the cobbler par excellence. For them Gucci in London has just received stocks of what it calls 'the ultimate soft shoe for summer shuffling' - the shoe for chaps to wear on the beach, in the jeep, for loafing around and above all for driving. It looks much like a classic Gucci moccasin, with the distinctive snaffle bar, but the soft stitched leather sole is reinforced with rubber on the ball of the foot and the heel so that it does not slip on the brake or accelerator. The shoes are tan with black soles or black with tan soles and cost Pounds 100 a pair. Gucci shops are at 32-33 Old Bond Street, London W1X and 17-18 Sloane Street, London SW1. ***** Malcolm Levene of 13-15 Chiltern Street, London W1 runs one of those small personalised shops that customers, once they find it, tend to go back to again and again. He is adept at helping chaps put a look together, whether for work or play, and he clothes some of the snappiest dressers around. In the course of trying to keep his customers well-dressed he has discovered that there is a gap between the traditional bespoke service and straight ready-to-wear. 'Many of the men who come in are not standard sizes but they don't have the patience or want to pay the prices for a complete bespoke service,' he said. He has therefore developed a customised service. It works like this - if you fall in love with a suit or jacket but find there isn't one that fits you perfectly, you can order the same style in any of the fabrics on offer (there is masses of choice) and in your own size. Three weeks later the garment is ready, though occasionally a few extra adjustments, such as shortening trousers or sleeves may be necessary. The price for this extra service is just 10 per cent to 15 per cent more than the standard retail price which means suits on average work out at just under Pounds 500, jackets or blazers at about Pounds 325. ***** The City &amp; Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, south London will hold its Graduate Diploma Show on July 2-5. It offers a chance not just to buy a wide selection of decorative objects, all the work of graduating students, but also to spot budding talent. Almost all the students are eager to take on commissions so if you have something to celebrate this could be a splendid way of finding something original. Objects include tables, screens, wall hangings, doors and mirrors to bowls, lacquer and metal work, cabinets, paintings and sculpture.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Books: A novel imperialist - JDF Jones discusses the life and genius of Rider Haggard RIDER HAGGARD AND THE LOST EMPIRE by Tom Pocock Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 263 pages IN 1885 a young Norfolk barrister called Rider Haggard, who had an adventurous spell in South Africa already behind him, took a bet from his brother that he could not match a new best-seller called Treasure Island. In the two years that followed, in a well-nigh unbelievable burst of creative and imaginative energy, Haggard wrote and published King Solomon's Mines, Allan Quatermain, Jess and She. After that, it is hardly surprising that the remaining 38 years can sound anti-climactic, although they were undeniably distinguished, successful and lucrative. Tom Pocock, who is a veteran Fleet Street journalist and an experienced biographer, has produced a brusque, no-nonsense, no-padding life story of a fascinating man in which he acknowledges that his aim has been to concentrate not so much on the novelist as on the public servant, above all on the visionary of the British Empire. This is the first biography for over ten years and it tells a fairly familiar tale to good effect. The boy was denied a gentleman's education by his Norfolk squire father and sent off to South Africa in 1875, in time to hoist the Union Jack over Pretoria in the British annexation of the Transvaal - and also to meet a certain Umslopagaas and fall for the Zulus. He became the youngest Registrar of the High Court, farmed ostriches in the middle of the first Anglo-Boer War, and came home to the boredom of barristers' chambers where he found rapid fame and fortune with his Africa-inspired fantasies. After some years of this, Mr Pocock claims, Haggard realised he had perfected a novelist's formula which was a licence to print money, and for the rest of his life he churned out the fiction - he wrote 58 novels, most of which are utterly forgotten today - while getting on with his real interests. He was passionately concerned about agricultural reform, land settlement, and the future of the Empire. He was no blimp and certainly not a conventional Tory. But he believed in 'the divine right of a great civilising people'; he wrote, 'on only one condition . . . have we the right to take the black man's land, and that is that we provide them with an equal and just Government, and allow no maltreatment of them . . . but on the contrary do our best to elevate them and wean them from savage customs. Otherwise the practice is surely indefensible.' His imperialism linked logically with his concern for the health of British agriculture, which was central to the empire's economy. His particular concern was to promote the (white) peopling of the Empire - 'the great house with the empty rooms', as he once put it in a vivid phrase  -and he served, unpaid, on a long sequence of royal commissions and the like, travelling the world to promote policies which were almost all rejected by Westminster. After the death of his beloved nine-year-old son, his life was gloomy: Pocock is good on the pessimism, in the post-1918 years, of upper-class imperialists like Haggard and his great friend Kipling. Meanwhile Haggard supported Lily, the First Great Love so often glimpsed in his novels, in a house in Aldeburgh (later to be occupied by Britten and Pears) as she disintegrated, Ayesha-like, from the syphilis her husband, Haggard's rival, had given her. All of this is well enough done, but Mr Pocock must have realised that he is in danger of having written Hamlet without the Prince. The truth is that Haggard is principally interesting because he wrote a sequence of remarkable fictions which, a hundred years later, continue to haunt our imagination (Pocock's title, with its echo of Haggard's influence on present-day dramas like Indiana Jones, suggests that he admits this). See Pocock's glancing reference to She, where he merely footnotes a reference to the book's later interest for Jungians and Freudians and then skidaddles away: this really won't do, we deserve to be told just a little more. To ignore the books, without whose existence we would not be reading this biography, becomes perverse: I cannot believe that Haggard was so uninvolved in these tales which he dictated every day, and I begin to doubt whether Mr Pocock has actually read many of the novels he lists - but that, I am sure, is an unworthy thought. Let us remind ourselves, then, that Haggard was a popular novelist of genius who also happened to be a Norfolk farmer and a man of public affairs. In that order. Let's remember the best of his novels are unforgettable because their resonances and references belong to the world of universal myth. As CS Lewis once wrote, 'Haggard's best work will survive because . . . a great myth is relevant as long as the predicament of humanity lasts.' Less elegantly, VS Pritchett has written of Haggard letting down a suction pump into the Unconscious. It would be good to read more about this and less about Sir Rider's activities for the Royal Colonial Institute in 1916.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL PARK ATTEMPT TO EXAMINE OVERDUE PREGNANT ELEPHANT FAILS  </P> <P> The San Diego Wild Animal Park made a third but unsuccessful attempt on Friday  to examine Jean the pregnant elephant, who is more than 60 days overdue.  </P> <P> "We had hoped to have seen the fetus," said Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the  park. "But we were unable to ascertain anything."  </P> <P> For weeks, Jean's keepers have been concerned that the fetus may be dead and  that Jean may be developing an infection.  </P> <P> This week, they began treating the 19-year-old elephant with hormones to help  her begin dilating, as well as some antibiotics.  </P> <P> Normal gestation for an elephant takes 615 to 668 days. As of Friday, Jean has  been carrying the fetus about 730 days.  </P> <P> Hanscom has said that, if the elephant cannot give birth to the baby, a  Cesarean section will be considered as the last, drastic option.  </P> <P> "In large mammals, we always expect some small complications in a first  pregnancy," he said.  </P> <P> "But, if she becomes infected from within, there will be very little we can do  for her."  </P></p>

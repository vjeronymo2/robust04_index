			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on vulnerable post-election peseta Attention in financial markets will focus on Spain this week with analysts anxious to see how the beleaguered peseta reacts to the outcome of yesterday's general election and whether the authorities will be able to cut interest rates further, writes Gillian Tett. There are fears that the peseta, which has undergone a cumulative 20 per cent devaluation over the last 10 months, could come under renewed pressure. 'Whoever wins the election, the peseta will be very vulnerable to speculative attack,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, economist at UBS in London. With Spanish unemployment running at 21.7 per cent during the first quarter of this year, the new government 'will face enormous pressure for a swift reduction in interest rates', said Mr Persaud. Some analysts fear that any strife for the peseta could undermine the lira in Italy, which has regional elections this week. After the dollar's 3-pfennig rise against the D-Mark in Friday's trading, the markets will be watching both currencies closely this week, to see whether their faith in the US economic recovery - and their fears about the slowdown in Germany - are justified. The US producer price index figures for May, due on Friday and expected to show a 0.2 per cent increase on the month, should give reassurance that inflationary pressures are under control after last week's strong US employment data. Meanwhile, in spite of the recent softening of the D-Mark, and the refusal of the Bundesbank to reduce rates last week, there is growing expectation that the Bundesbank might finally cut its repurchase rate this week.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX-NG report: "Gentlemen's Quarrel"] </F>   [Text] State Duma Deputy Andrey Makarov (from the "12  December" Liberal Democratic Union faction) assaulted Captain  Second Rank Mikhail Ivanov, adviser to Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia [LDPR] chief Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, on Wednesday. The  victim said that he was trying to hand over the seventh and  eighth chapters of the global concept of public security in  Russia he had drawn up to Yuliy Gusman, his colleague in the  deputy corps. In response to Gusman's flat refusal to  familiarize himself with the paper, Captain Ivanov himself  acknowledged, he said imprudently: "If you don't read it you  will end up like Makarov." Hearing his name is so dubious a  context, Andrey Makarov hit the LDPR adviser with a case,  smashed his lip, tore off a pocket from his uniform, and tried  to tear his shoulder boards.</p>

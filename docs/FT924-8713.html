			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / What future for coal?: Australia sees market chance in pit closures THE upheaval in the British coal industry comes as little surprise to Australia which, as the world's leading coal exporter, has long seen the rationalisation of much of Europe's coal production as inevitable. Australia's industry could scarcely contrast more strongly with its British counterpart. Australian producers see themselves as leading the world coal industry with modern and expanding operations based on private ownership. Mr Rod Charlton, manager, coal marketing services for Australia's MIM Holdings, says his industry is targeting the UK for growth in sales of steaming coal - largely used for power generation. 'Many Australian steaming coal brands have been successfully tested in the UK and pit closures give us the chance to pick up business,' he says. 'We're not looking to the closures as a huge boost to our sales, but they will reduce the excess thermal coal supply on world markets. In combination with new power station building programmes in the Asia-Pacific region and the probable closure of some German mines, the outlook over the next five years is for steady improvement in the supply demand balance.' Such an improvement would be welcome for the Australian industry which is grappling with spot prices for thermal coal - used for steam raising - which are about 25 per cent below contract rates. These spot prices are largely unprofitable to Australian producers, even in Asia where they have a strong freight advantage. If UK electricity authorities were to seek replacement tonnage for British Coal supplies through spot tenders, Australian producers would be unlikely to feature as significant bidders. A freight disadvantage of about USDollars 6 a tonne against South African and US competitors would render UK spot business unprofitable for almost all Australian suppliers. The Australian industry's awareness of likely trends in the UK coal industry was evident in a survey of world coal markets commissioned in May, 1991, from Sydney-based consultants, Barlow Jonker. The survey forecast continuing mine closures in Britain, leading to an increased reliance on imported coal, though this was likely to be offset by increased use of gas for power generation. Like its UK counterpart, the Australian coal industry has not avoided closures in recent years. The difference has been that most Australian closures have been related to expansion of more efficient facilities which have more than offset production cuts. The result has been continuing overall growth in Australian coal production, while productivity has more than doubled in the past decade to stand at 6,150 tonnes of saleable output per employee per year in 1991-92. Much of this improvement reflects capital spending on modern plant and the Barlow Jonker survey indicated the industry would need to spend a further Dollars A3bn (Pounds 1.36bn) by 1995 to keep pace with expected Asian demand growth. But these expenditure plans come against a background of falling prices for export coal. Latest earnings statistics from the Australian Coal Association showed that almost half the coal companies in New South Wales incurred losses in the latest period. Queensland, the other main coal exporting state, does not release figures, but the ratio there is likely to have been worse.</p>

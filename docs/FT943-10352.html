			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Pitting Serb against Serb The Yugoslav government's announcement that it is severing all ties with the Bosnian Serbs, after their refusal to accept the international peace plan, has an uncanny air of deja vu. In May 1993 President Slobodan Milosevic made a similar announcement after the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the Vance-Owen peace plan. At that time the Russian foreign minister was lobbying hard in favour of the plan, and Lord Owen, one of its co-authors, hoped that President Bill Clinton would persuade President Boris Yeltsin to agree to the use of Nato air power to prevent supplies reaching the Bosnian Serbs. In the event, the Vance-Owen plan was allowed to die, and - not surprisingly  -Serbia's proclaimed sanctions against its Bosnian kinsmen were never applied. Perhaps Mr Milosevic never had any serious intention of applying them, and perhaps he has no such intention now. But this time his bluff must be called. Even if he is completely insincere, the announcement at least shows how anxious he is to get the international sanctions on Serbia lifted, by disclaiming responsibility for the Bosnian Serbs' intransigence. It suggests he is worried by the decision to tighten those sanctions taken by the 'contact group' of foreign ministers in Geneva last weekend. Having got so far, the contact group must insist that Serbia and Montenegro prove beyond any doubt, before there can be any question of relaxing the sanctions against them, that they are really co-operating in the complete isolation of the Bosnian Serbs. This means they must be prepared to accept the deployment of UN monitors all along their borders with Bosnia, and must give those monitors every assistance in verifying that no supplies other than food and medicine are going in. If the UN identifies significant breaches of the embargo and the Yugoslav government either denies them or claims to be unable to stop them, it must be told that Nato air power will be used to try and interdict them. As long as this strategy is being seriously applied and seems to have any chance of success, it probably makes sense to hold back on lifting the embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian government. This remains deeply divisive within the contact group, and its short-term military effects would be at best uncertain. That does not mean that any further Serb encroachments on the areas of Bosnia declared as 'safe havens' under United Nations protection should be tolerated. Existing UN resolutions authorise the use of air power to defend them, and the UN should not allow those resolutions to be violated with impunity. Moreover, it must be understood that the logic of cutting off supplies to the Bosnian Serbs is that, if they persist in rejecting the peace plan, they face military defeat. That means that the international community must keep open the option of lifting the embargo and giving active assistance to the Bosnian government if all else fails.</p>

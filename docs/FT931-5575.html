			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo moves on EC aid MR MICHAEL Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday appeared to clear the way for Britain's regions to receive up to Pounds 1bn in aid from the European Community. He told the Commons that the Treasury was ready to match the regional development funds provided from Brussels, which is a condition under EC law for the funds being distributed. Mr Portillo said he had no reason to believe that there would be any difficulty in ensuring 'public expenditure cover' for the regional development funds allocated to Britain. He envisaged that Sir John Kerr, Britain's permanent representative in Brussels, would be writing to Mr Bruce Millan, regional policy commissioner, 'in the near future'. A senior EC regional policy official last night welcomed the statement but said the Commission would require 'a clear and precise answer' to its concern that the government has not been matching the EC funds, in spite of previous commitments to do so. 'With the experience we've had in the past, we can not prejudge. We need to see where the beef is,' the official said. Mr David Hanson (Lab, Delyn) protested at question time that the government had been responsible for delaying EC grants worth millions of pounds which were badly needed for investment in training and in industry. Mr Millan warned last week that it risked losing 'large' sums of community aid for depressed regions unless it conformed to rules obliging member states to match EC funds. He wrote to the government seeking urgent talks following complaints from local authorities in the nine UK regions eligible for regional aid grants. Senior commission officials confirmed that up to Pounds 1bn earmarked for the UK had still to be disbursed - and could be lost if not committed to regional development schemes by the end of the current year. 'If they (the British government) don't want to lose the money they will have to do something about it,' Mr Millan said, though he added that: 'Nobody is suggesting that they're going to lose everything.' The department of trade and industry sought to play down the row saying that funds would be matched - although final details have still to be agreed.</p>

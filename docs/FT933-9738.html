			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Probate values ON JULY 10, you published a response explaining how subsequent sale proceeds could substitute for probate value. My question is: Does a further probate valuation count in the same way as a sale? My wife inherited some stock from her mother and died just under one year later, in which period the market had declined. Can the probate value of the stock for my wife's estate replace the figure used for the stock in her mother's probate value? If so, would all items of stock need to be considered, or could a substitution be made of just those shares that declined in value in the period? The legislation which provides for the revision of probate values applies only where the shares are sold. A sale would not include the devolution of the shares under your wife's will, or intestacy. Unfortunately, therefore, you cannot revalue the shares in your mother-in-law's estate just because they have fallen in value and have been included in your wife's estate at that lower value.

All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

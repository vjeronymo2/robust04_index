Foreign policy also focuses on creation of an international  environment conducive to national reunification and peace on the  Korean peninsula, increased cooperation with Asia-Pacific  nations and expansion of economic diplomacy to help industries  cope with the globalization trend of world trade.    To achieve these goals, the ministry will be reorganized,  with stress on diplomacy in trade and environment affairs.    Han said the expansion of economic diplomacy would include  increased trade diplomacy to prepare the country for the new  world trade order to be established by the projected world trade  organization.    In addition, preparations for admission to the OECD  (Organization of Economic Construction and Development) will be  stepped up, along with efforts to increase cooperation with the  group of seven advanced economies.    For increased cooperation with Asia-Pacific nations, summit  diplomacy will be promoted, including summit meetings with  Southeast Asian nations, in addition to the Asia-Pacific  economic cooperation summit slated for November in Indonesia,  Han said.    A multilateral security forum in Northeast Asia will be  promoted, and the government will participate in the foreign  ministers conference and security forum of the associations of  Southeast Asian nations.    Increased cooperation with the international community,  especially with the United States, will be sought to solve the  North Korean nuclear issue in such a manner as to guarantee  North Korea's nuclear transparency and promote inter-Korean  coexistence and cooperation.</p>

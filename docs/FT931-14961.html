			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / AEEU recruiting at Nissan suppliers THE AEEU engineering and electrical union has launched a campaign to recruit members among suppliers to Nissan in north-east England, Chris Tighe writes. The AEEU is the only union recognised by the management at Nissan's Sunderland car plant, and its growth in membership there - to about 2,000 out of 4,600 employees - has helped to maintain its Tyneside numbers against a declining national trend. The union hopes that by recruiting members at Nissan suppliers it will strengthen its request for recognition by managements, many of which rebuffed formal AEEU approaches when they moved into the area. At Nissan's Sunderland plant the works council, not the union, negotiates pay and conditions, although some elected representatives are AEEU members.</p>

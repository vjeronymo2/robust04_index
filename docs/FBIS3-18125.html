CSU leader Waigel called on the FDP yesterday to make  a statement in favor of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/CSU  before presidential elections on 23 May. He threatened that,  otherwise, he will wage an election campaign against the FDP.    FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer stressed that his party  will only make a binding statement a few weeks prior to the  Bundestag elections scheduled for 16 October. Waigel replied:  "The FDP cannot afford an ambiguous policy on this issue." So  far, its experiences with statements in favor of a coalition  with the CDU/CSU were good. "Should the Liberals continue to  hesitate, we will adopt a tough position and try to win over  every supporter of the coalition in the election campaign."  Waigel predicted that, in that case, "the FDP will have  problems entering the Bundestag again."    GDR Secretary General Hoyer told Waigel in Bonn not to rack  the brains of the FDP. "We alone and nobody else will make a  decision concerning the time and the contents of a statement  about a possible coalition."</p>

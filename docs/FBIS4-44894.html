			<p>CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Joint Operation by Industry, Government and Academia </H5>   In 1990, Japan's Ultra-High Temperature Materials Research  Center (UHTMC) was established as the third sector with the  investments by the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO),  local public organizations, and private corporations. The Center  was to operate its business at two locations: Ube City,  Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Tajimi City, Gifu Prefecture. The  establishment of the Center was based on the philosophy that  Japan must "aggressively promote creative technology development  because technological progress is the moving force an economic  society needs," although Japan continued to have a dismal  economic environment after the bubble burst. Furthermore, the  Ultra-High Materials Research Institute was also established at  the same time, in the manner usually taken by the private  sector, in order to effectively utilize the Center's facilities  and efficiently promote material development. The Institute was  to support the Center's business and carry out consigned tests,  research projects, and various exchange projects through the use  of the Center's facilities. It was July 1992, when all the  facilities were completely installed and both Center and  Institute began their operation. Thus, in January 1994, one year  and seven months have passed since then.  <H5>  Core of Chubu R&amp;D Circle </H5>   The Gifu Center, located on a quiet hill on the east side of  Tajimi City, occupies a section of Tono Research Academic New  Cities Initiative that is being promoted by Gifu Prefectural and  local governments. Thus, the Gifu Center is expected to become  an active, central research facility along with the Nuclear  Fusion Science Research Institute and the Microgravity  Laboratory of Japan. In March 1993, the Tono Research Academic  New Cities Initiative was approved by the government as a  promotion center regional basic initiative based on the  multi-polar land decentralization promotion law. Since then, the  Initiative has been in the process of realizing its long-range  plan to build a research/academic city that Japan will be proud  to show the world.    The city represents an excellent research environment ready  for the 21st century with its world-level research facilities  pursuing pressing environment-related topics, including  ultra-high temperature, ultra-high pressure, superconductivity  and microgravity.    Under these circumstances, UHTMC is expected to produce  epoch-making breakthroughs in advanced technology fields through  the development and implementation of new materials, and the  breakthroughs are expected to produce broad propagative effects.  In particular, successful development is anticipated for  advanced materials that can withstand an ultra-high temperature  environment of approximately 2,000C, i.e., ultra-high  temperature materials. Specifically, considered quite promising  are metal, ceramic and carbon-based materials, as well as their  composites. When developed, these ultra-high temperature  materials are expected to be applied in wide-ranging advanced  technological fields such as aerospace, energy, transportation,  material-development processes, and environment. Thus, the  propagative effects of the materials will be felt by all  industries.  <H5>  Equipped With Newest Test Facilities </H5>   UHTMC is equipped with facilities for creating ultra-high  temperature materials and evaluating the properties and  functions of these materials at ultra-high temperatures. These  facilities are so advanced, sophisticated, and high-tech that it  would be difficult for a private corporation to install them.  The facilities include research devices such as an ultra-high  temperature material tester, an ultra-high temperature fatigue  tester, and a creep tester. In the second half of FY91, the  business section of UHTMC began operation, and in July 1992, the  full center began operation.  <H5>  Also An International Exchange Center </H5>   Three prefectures -- Aichi, Mie, and Gifu -- in Chubu  District are creating Tono -- in Gifu, and Suzuka, in Mie  Research Academic Cities -- whose basic concept is to carry out  government, industrial, and academic joint national research  projects; industrial and academic joint research projects; and  private sector joint research projects. These cities also are to  function as the centers for international exchange of knowledge  among the most advanced scientists and engineers of the world  and are the bases for disseminating technological information.  Situated between the Tsukuba (on the east) and Kansai (on the  west) Research New Cities, these Chubu District Research New  Cities are also growing under an ambitious plan.</p>

Sen. John Rockefeller IV said in a meeting with Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa that the U.S. Congress will focus its  attention on a meeting between President Bill Clinton and  Hosokawa scheduled for February 11 as a "checkpoint" of  bilateral trade ties, the official said.    The Democratic senator elected from West Virginia also  reportedly said the U.S. legislature hopes the two leaders can  chart a new future course for U.S.-Japanese trade relations at  the planned talks.    The statement apparently means the U.S. Congress wants some  progress in trade negotiations between Washington and Tokyo,  which are being held under the bilateral trade framework  agreement reached last July.    While acknowledging the importance of progress in the trade  negotiations, Hosokawa touched on the need for efforts from both  sides, the official said.    Calling Clinton and Hosokawa reform-oriented leaders,  Rockefeller said he is pleased with Hosokawa's emergence as a  new leader in Japanese politics and that he wants to be a friend  of the premier, according to the officials.    Rockefeller told reporters after the meeting that his talks  with the premier were "just a private conversation."</p>

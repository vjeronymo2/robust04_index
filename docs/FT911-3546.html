			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / De Klerk urges UK business to back economic launch pad PRESIDENT F W de Klerk yesterday offered South Africa's opposition parties 'a voice' in decision-making during the transition to a new constitution and urged British businessman to help South Africa become an economic 'launching pad' for the region. In two keynote speeches Mr de Klerk vigorously proclaimed the emergence of a 'new South Africa', called for an end to economic sanctions, painted a vision of a prosperous post-apartheid southern Africa, and defended his efforts to end political violence in the country. Mr de Klerk made clear in a speech at the Royal Institute for International Affairs that the ruling National Party envisaged an important post-apartheid role for itself. 'My government is committed to the sharing of power,' he said, but added: 'and wholly opposed to surrendering it unconditionally.' Earlier in the day he also firmly rejected the African National Congress's call for an interim government. He went part of the way towards meeting their demand, however, when he said: 'We are prepared to consider certain transitional arrangements at both the legislative and the executive levels in order to give the leaders of the various negotiating parties a voice in the formulation of important policy decisions.' At a press conference at the start of the day, Mr de Klerk argued that political reform had to be be underpinned by a vibrant economy that would in part depend on the lifting of sanctions and new investment capital from abroad. 'We are now positioned for . . . an economic take-off provided that the necessary investment is made and the necessary industrialisation takes place,' he said. 'We don't ask for handouts, we don't ask for donations,' he continued: 'We ask that all impediments be removed and then we have no doubt that we will get the flow of private sector investment because of the opportunities that our economy . . . offers to them.' Mr de Klerk's economic message was taken up again later in the day during an address to the Institute of Directors. After calling for a restoration of sporting links with Britain, he spoke of the potential of southern Africa. He warned that 'economic growth and constitutional reform must be mutually reinforcing' saying that 'unless the pressing problems of poverty and the unemployed are addressed, elegant constitutional models will be of little avail.' Mr de Klerk met for the first time Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour Party leader, who afterwards said it was still too soon to lift sanctions. Observer, Page 18</p>

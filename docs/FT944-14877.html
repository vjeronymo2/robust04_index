			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Kantor plea to Japan on cars US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is seeking an initiative by Japanese carmakers in order to resolve the US-Japan trade dispute on vehicles. Mr Kantor said Japan's car industry could help break a deadlock in stalled bilateral trade talks by outlining a new multi-year programme to buy more foreign-made car parts. 'I believe both (the US and Japanese) industries are perfectly capable of working this out between themselves, if encouraged by both governments,' he said. Mr Kantor said Washington will start a probe into Japan's car spare parts market under Section 301 of US trade law soon, the financial daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. Under the bilateral economic framework talks, the two nations have not yet agreed on ways to open Japan's car and car parts market. The US has demanded that a yardstick be created to measure future results of market-opening steps, while Japan has opposed such a plan, saying the government cannot control the flow of private sector trade.</p>

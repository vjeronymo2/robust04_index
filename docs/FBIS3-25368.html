			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo by </F> Monique Mas; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Ngendahago] For the sake of the security of our  citizens, we agreed to open up the cabinet a bit more widely  than we had envisaged to enable all Burundians to live in  security. I think the first aim that we in the government are  following is to stop the massacres so that all Burundians can  feel safe. Afterward, we will see.    [Mas] Nevertheless the result of opening up is that Uprona  [Unity for National Progress], the former sole party, has got  what would elsewhere be called the Ministry of the Interior--in  other words, questions of internal security--and, furthermore,  we are seeing the entry of people who were behind the recent  bloody events in Bujumbura. Some people are talking of  capitulation by the Frodebu [Burundi Democratic Front], the  party in power.    [Ngendahayo] Uprona hasn't got the interior portfolio. There  is a minister of the interior in the government team. What it  is is territorial administration. That is a nuance that should  be added.    Then there has not been any capitulation. Rather we have  opened up as was necessary, in a strategic move, to enable there  to be an all round relaxation of tension. If for the safety of  our citizens we have to deal even with parties who have no  representation at all in the National Assembly, but with whom,  for everyone's safety, we have to discuss and cooperate, why  not? We are quite open to discussion and to power sharing, if  it is for the good of the country and its citizens.    [Mas] What weight did the Army have in this choice? In this  opening up?    [Ngendahayo] Officially, the Army did not play any role.  Now, at the level of realpolitik there are certainly  negotiations going on in this same direction, because you have  to face up to reality: if there have been problems in Burundi,  it started on the night of 20 to 21 October, and everything  started off at certain military camps. So we are bearing all  these parameters in mind.    [Mas] The night of 20 to 21 was the night of the attempted  coup, which led to the death of the elected president, Melchior  Ndadaye. In the end this coup seems to have benefited certain  members of Burundi political circles?    [Ngendahayo] After the death of the head of state, and after  the death of some very highly placed state officials, we had to  reconstruct the government, which had completely collapsed. To  emerge from our places of hiding, we had to have discussions  with our political partners, who had not suffered reprisals, and  to try now to find a new way of governing the country, bearing  in mind all the problems we have just experienced.    This is why you are seeing a repetition of what President  Ndadaye, in his great magnanimity, did, and what we are doing in  our great sense of realism.    [Mas] In specific terms, what might the program of this new  government be?    [Ngendahayo] I think there is basically to be a continuation  of the program that arose from the June elections. This cannot  be refused, and, more importantly, it is inevitable. But at  first, before reaching the point where this program can be  followed, there has to be a period where we will work first of  all to restore peace, to restore trust between citizens, and for  national reconstruction. These are extremely important things.  And in this context we have to bring back the refugees,  numbering nearly 1,000,000, who have swarmed into Rwanda, and  who are in Zaire and in Tanzania.    [Mas] In this do you still need foreign support, of a  military nature, in particular the kind the OAU envisaged?    [Ngendahayo] Yes indeed, in as far as when you talk to the  refugees, they say: We want a successor to Ndadaye -- and they  have got that -- but they add: We want his successor to be  protected and have his physical person guaranteed. We don't  want the same causes to produce the same effects, they say. And  so there is a very important effect from a psychological point  of view, that the OAU mission should be there in military form,  to contribute to the security of the head of state, and of  certain dignitaries, so that the country's own forces of law and  order can gradually take over.    [Mas] How do you envisage the political future of Burundi?    [Ngendahayo] I think the political future of our country  depends on the goodwill of politicians in Burundi. Therefore I  think there is an appeal that has to be made, namely to make  politicians realize that they have to keep in their minds the  fact that the most important thing is not so much obtaining  ministries as preserving peace. Second, we must not conceal the  true values of democracy, or forget that we, in Frodebu, are in  power thanks to elections that came out of a quite proper and  decent political process, which was the pride of the whole of  Africa. Seen like this, the achievements of June 1993 are  something very important, which we have to bear in mind for the  future.</p>

The (4) impoundment is about 2 miles long, having a surface area of about 75 AC, a gross storage capacity of 467 AF, and a usable storage capacity of 432 AF, and a normal pool headwater elevation range of 465.66 to 473.66 feet msl. The (5) power tunnel conveys water from the intake structure at the impoundment via a 12.5-foot-diameter, 1,514-foot-long concrete and brick-lined horseshoe shaped tunnel that leads to the powerhouse forebay. The (6) powerhouse contains three horizontal Francis hydroelectric units with a nameplate capacity of 1,600 kW each, and a hydraulic capacity of 1,490 cfs. The powerhouse also contains appurtenant facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Deerfield No. 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Deerfield No. 3 Dam is composed of (1) a concrete gravity spillway about 15 feet high and 475 feet long with a crest elevation of 396.66 feet msl, topped with 6-foot-high wooden flashboards; (2) 2 sluice gates and a (3) power tunnel intake located in the south abutment. The power tunnel exiting the gated intake is a 677-foot-long, 17-foot-wide by 12.5-foot-high concrete conduit. The (4) impoundment is about 1.3 miles long, having a surface area of about 42 AC, a gross storage capacity of 221 AF, a usable storage capacity of 200 AF and a normal pool headwater elevation range of 396.66 to 402.66 feet msl. The (5) Deerfield No. 3 powerhouse contains three horizontal Francis hydroelectric units with a nameplate capacity of 1,600 kW each and a hydraulic capacity of 1,490 cfs. The (6) switchyard is located within the powerhouse and contains appurtenant facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Deerfield No. 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Deerfield No. 2 facility contains a (1) concrete gravity spillway about 70 feet high and 447 feet long, with a top elevation of 284.66 feet msl, topped with 6-foot-high wooden flashboards and four sluice gates. The (2) impoundment is about 1.5 miles long, with a surface area of about 63.5 AC, a gross storage capacity of 350 AF, a usable storage capacity of 300 AF, and a normal pool headwater elevation range of 284.66 to 290.66 feet msl. The (3) powerhouse is located adjacent to the Deerfield No. 2 Dam, thus there are no canals, conduits, or tunnels required at this development. The powerhouse contains three horizontal Francis hydroelectric units with a nameplate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity of 1,600 kW each and a hydraulic capacity of 1,450 cfs. The (4) switchyard is located within the powerhouse and contains appurtenant facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing project would also be subject to Federal takeover under Sections 14 and 15 of the Federal Power Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> m.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose of Project:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the project is to generate electric energy to meet New England Power Company's peak energy demand and provide electric system operating reserves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> n.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This Notice Also Consists of the Following Standard Paragraphs:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A4 and D9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> o.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Available Location of Application:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A copy of the application, as amended and supplemented, is available for inspection and reproduction at the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch, located at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., room 3104, Washington, DC 20426, or by calling (202) 208&hyph;1371.

The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis will be given.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> q.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Request for Scoping Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal, state, and local resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; Indian tribes; other interested groups and individuals, are requested to forward to the Commission any information that they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental effects of the proposed licensing activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested to provide information related to the following items:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Information, data, maps or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical and temporal scope of the analysis and identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant environmental issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identification of and information from any other EIS or similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant to the proposed licensing activities in the subject river basin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Existing information and any data that would aid in describing the past and present effects of the project(s) and other developmental activities on the physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic environments. For example, fish stocking/management histories in the subject river, historic water quality data and the reasons for improvement or degradation of the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to develop land and water resources within the basin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identification of any federal, state or local resource plans and future project proposals that encompass the subject river or basin. For example, proposals to construct or operate water treatment facilities, recreation areas, or implement fishery management programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Documentation that would support a conclusion that the project(s) does not contribute, or does contribute to adverse and beneficial cumulative effects on resources and therefore should be excluded for further study or excluded from further consideration of cumulative impacts within the river basin. Documentation should include, but not be limited to: how the project(s) interact with other projects within the river basin or other developmental activities; results from studies; resource management policies; and, reports from federal, state, and local agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments concerning the scope of the environmental document should be filed by the deadline date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Type of Application:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Projects Nos.:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2404&hyph;017 and 2419&hyph;007. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date Filed:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> December 30, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicant:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thunder Bay Power Company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Name of Project:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thunder Bay and Hillman Hydro Project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the Thunder Bay River in Alpena, Alcona, and Montmorency Counties, Michigan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

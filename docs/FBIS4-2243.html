			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By So Lai-fun in Beijing and Chan Wai-fong] </F>   [Excerpt] Chinese Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen  yesterday denied they had played a role in determining the  outcome of the Xi Yang case. They were quoted by Vincent Lo  Hong-sui, head of the Business and Professional Federation, as  saying during meetings in Beijing that, as executive officials,  they would not interfere with the Judiciary.    Mr Zhu, also head of the People's Bank of China, denied  reports that he had ordered a stiff sentence for Hong Kong  reporter Xi, who was accused of stealing financial secrets. The  Politburo Standing Committee did not discuss legal cases, he  said.    The comments came as Beijing rejected calls to release more  details on the conviction of Xi who was sentenced to 12 years'  jail. [passage omitted]</p>

Beklemisheva, Eastern  Scientific Research Institute of Refractories; UDC  669.002.68:666.762]    [Abstract] Results were presented from a technical and  economic assessment of using various types of metallurgical  waste in the production of refractory materials.  Magnesia-silicate slags from the Serov ferroalloy plant were  used to produce periclase- spinellid-forsterite linings for the  anode furnace of the Kyshtym electrolytic plant. These linings  were comparable in durability to chromite-periclase linings.  Forsterite-spinel heating furnace bottoms for the Chelyabinsk  forging press and forsterite-spinellid teeming vessels for the  Chelyabinsk metallurgical combine were made from high-carbon  ferrochromium slag at the Magnesite plant. The furnace bottoms  were 2-4 times more durable than those made with conventional  raw materials, and the teeming vessels were as durable as  periclase-graphite vessels. Use of these slags is calculated to  save 2.1 million rubles per annum in raw materials costs and 157  thousand rubles per year in savings from reduced environmental  damage. Savings from transporting and storing these wastes is  expected to be 96.5 thousand rubles annually. The formulas used  to arrive at these figures are presented, and other examples of  refractories produced using metallurgical wastes are discussed.  Tables 1; references 5: Russian.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN GUILTY IN SEX ASSAULT ON WOMAN WITH 46 IDENTITIES  </P> <P> A man was convicted Thursday of sexually assaulting a woman who doctors say has  46 personalities after he testified that she consented to sex and he learned  only later that she was mentally ill.  </P> <P> Mark A. Peterson was convicted of second-degree sexual assault and could be  sentenced to 10 years in prison.  </P> <P> He remained free on $5,000 bond. Sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 10 and he  said he will appeal.  </P> <P> Jurors heard psychiatrists disagree over the 27-year-old woman's contention  that she was unaware that one of her personalities -- described as a fun-loving  20-year-old woman -- was having sex. She said she learned of it from another  personality, a girl the age of 6.  </P> <P> The woman had testified Wednesday that Peterson, 29, manipulated the  personality prevalent at the time to have intercourse.  </P> <P> She summoned six different personalities to the witness stand. Four of them  were sworn in individually.  </P> <P> Under Wisconsin law, it is a crime to have sex with people known to suffer from  a mental illness that makes them incapable of understanding their conduct.  </P></p>

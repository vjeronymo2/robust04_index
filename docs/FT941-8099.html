			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Oman fund to invest in Muscat exchange The foreign investment drive into emerging stock markets has begun to focus on the oil-rich region of the Gulf with the launch next month of a Dollars 45m Oman fund which will invest in the Muscat stock market. The Oryx Fund will be jointly managed by London-based Blakeney Management and the Oman National Insurance Company in Muscat. The fund will be registered in Oman and stock market listings are being sought in both London and Muscat. Initially, 51 per cent of the capital will be raised in Oman and the balance internationally - in line with Omani foreign investment law. Al Ahlia Portfolio Company in Muscat will manage the Omani issue and Baring Securities the foreign portion. The fund will have exclusive access to the Muscat stock exchange, as the only fund with foreign shareholders, for a minimum of six months. 'The fund will be the first vehicle for non-Arab investors to enter any of the Gulf stock markets,' says Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Consultants. Of the six member states of the Gulf Co-operation Council, only Oman and, to a limited extent, Bahrain permit foreign investors to participate in local equity trading. Other Arab bourses allowing non-Arab participants are Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and nominally Egypt. Mr Morland said that the Oryx Fund will eventually expand to include other emerging markets in the Arab world. Last year the Muscat stock exchange had a turnover of around Dollars 200m. It has 62 listed stocks and is capitalised at around Dollars 1.5bn. This compares with a capitalisation of Dollars 10bn for the United Arab Emirates stock market and Dollars 50bn for Saudi Arabia, both of which are closed to foreign investors. Oman is going through a period of rapid economic change. The government is diversifying the economy away from the oil sector and promoting non-oil commercial activities. A widespread programme of privatisation of state holdings and an opening-up of the economy to outside investment also aim to boost private sector activities. Oman's trading links with Iran and good political relations with other neighbouring countries, including Iraq, place Muscat in an ideal position for rapid growth. 'It is a classic emerging market story,' says Mr Morland.</p>

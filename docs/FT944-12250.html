			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at Peter Storm Peter Storm Group, the Nottingham-based leisure wear manufacturer, has called in the receivers after three years of losses. Mr Philip Baldwin, a partner at Price Waterhouse in Birmingham, said he was reasonably optimistic about being able to find a buyer for the group, famous for its brightly coloured all-weather clothing. Its brands include Peter Storm, Noel Bibby, Clare Morris (UK) and Keighley Special Finishers. 'We are now opening up the books and advertising to see if there is any interest,' he said. 'By the end of November we should have a better idea of the situation.' He said that in recent years the company had been hit by imports from east Asia. Despite an expanding market, sales had been static at between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m. 'This is not a large company. In fact the name is probably bigger than the company,' Mr Baldwin said. He added that Peter Storm might have to become more sales driven to make the best use of the brand.</p>

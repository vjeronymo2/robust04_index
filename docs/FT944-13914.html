			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Higher card revenues lift American Express After-tax profits from the continuing businesses of American Express climbed 18 per cent in the third quarter, due to higher revenues in its cards and travel businesses and lower costs at IDS, its financial services subsidiary. Net income of Dollars 369m, or 71 cents a share, compared with income on continuing businesses of Dollars 313m, or 61 cents a share, a year ago. Including profits from the Shearson broking firm, which has since been sold, and Lehman Brothers, the investment bank spun off earlier this year, overall net income in the 1993 third quarter was Dollars 420m, or 83 cents a share. Revenues in American Express's core travel-related services area rose nearly 10 per cent, to Dollars 2.36bn. About half the increase stemmed from an 11 per cent jump in discount revenues from merchants, which reflected higher spending on the company's cards. An increase in the company's travel business, resulting partly from acquisitions, accounted for the rest of the revenue growth. Overall, the travel-related services businesses reported net income of Dollars 264m, up 13 per cent. IDS had after-tax profits of Dollars 114m, up from Dollars 96m, on broadly flat revenues of Dollars 822m. The earnings advance was partly attributable to a Dollars 35m fall in operating costs, which the company said was due to an absence of one-time factors which affected the 1993 period.</p>

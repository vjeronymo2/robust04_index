			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and French Foreign Minister  Allain Juppe met here today to discuss ways to promote relations  between the two countries.    Both sides described the meeting as "positive and  constructive" and Qian said China hopes bilateral relations will  continue to develop steadily.    During the meeting, the French foreign minister said that  "France is pleased to see that the two governments have resumed  their traditional friendly relations by following the policies  set by (former French President) General Charles de Gaulle in  1964."    He said Qian's current visit to France demonstrates the  normalization of relations between the two countries and that  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's forthcoming visit to  China will be a major milestone in bilateral relations.    The French prime minister is expected to arrive in China on  January 27, marking the 30th anniversary of the establishment of  Sino-French relations.    Juppe also expressed satisfaction over the signing earlier  this month of a joint Sino-French communique on promoting  bilateral relations, saying that France will adhere to and  implement the principles set out in the communique.    He expressed the hope that French enterprises will be able  to  participate in the economic construction of China, and said the  two countries should strengthen exchanges and cooperation in  cultural, scientific-technological, and other fields.    The Chinese foreign minister said the signing of the joint  communique, and his meeting with French President Francois  Mitterrand earlier in the day, show that a new page has been  turned in bilateral relations after a difficult period.    Qian said China agrees with the proposal that the foreign  ministers of the two countries hold regular political  consultations, and that his meeting with Juppe served as a good  beginning to such consultations.    The French prime minister's forthcoming visit to China will  be a major event, and will help bring exchanges between the two  countries to a new level.    Foreign Minister Juppe also accepted Qian's invitation to  visit China.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (33): Chrysler accelerates as GM changes gear - The table of top US companies graphically underlines the way in which different companies have responded to the technological and competitive challenges reshaping the business landscape / United States Just two years ago the largest American company, ranked by market capitalisation, was that long-time bellwether of US stock market sentiment, International Business Machines. Today, IBM ranks a mere 25th in the FT's table of top US companies, and its market capitalisation has more than halved from 1990's Dollars 62bn to today's Dollars 24bn, following a plunge in the company's share price in 1992 and early 1993. Behind the plunge lay a sudden realisation that IBM was facing serious structural problems, notably shrinking demand for mainframe computers - a sector it dominates - and fierce competition from low-cost rivals in the personal computer market, which has snatched much of the mainframe's business. IBM now ranks behind Intel, the world's largest computer chip manufacturer, which is 17th in the FT table. Ironically, Intel owes its lofty position in no small measure to IBM, thanks to the company's decision in 1980 to use one of Intel's microprocessors at the heart of its first personal computer. The design went on to become an industry standard. Similarly, Microsoft, the leading American computer software manufacturer, which ranks 27th, got its big break when IBM chose the then tiny company to provide the operating software for its first PC. IBM's decline is one of the most dramatic examples of changing corporate fortune in the FT's table of top American corporations. The table - the first American rankings published by the paper as part of its annual FT500 survey - graphically underlines the way in which different US companies have responded to the technological and competitive challenges which have been reshaping the American business landscape. Part of IBM's problem has been a complacent, inward-looking corporate culture - the result of its industrial dominance in the 1960s and 1970s - which prevented it from seeing just how rapidly the computer sector's micro-processor revolution was undermining its competitiveness. A similar complacency characterised General Motors, America's largest industrial employer, for many years, allowing Japanese competitors to cut deep into its share of the US car market. After several years of heavy losses, it is now in the throes of a difficult restructuring aimed at cutting its costs to match its much reduced market position. Its problems, which will take years to solve, are reflected in its modest 16th place in the FT rankings, giving it a market capitalisation of Dollars 30bn. It ranks just six places ahead of the substantially smaller Ford Motor, capitalised at Dollars 27bn, which moved much earlier to cut its US costs and improve plant productivity. Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three, ranks 46th, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 17bn, which represents a huge improvement for a company that in 1990 appeared in danger of financial crisis, facing the start of a US recession with a tired product line. At that time, its market capitalisation was just Dollars 4bn and it ranked around 150th among leading companies. However, over the past two years Chrysler has staged a remarkable recovery, both in profitability and share price performance, as it has introduced a succession of excitingly styled, well-selling new models. General Electric owes its position as America's largest company to the success of its top management, notably Mr Jack Welch, the chairman, in preventing a spirit of complacency spreading within an organisation which has long been one of the nation's industrial giants. When Mr Welch took over as GE chairman in the early 1980s, he realised that, despite the organisation's apparent success, its hodge-podge of businesses was ill-equipped to compete in a world of intensifying global competition. He slashed staff, bought and sold divisions, and transformed the group's business culture, with the aim of giving the organisation the attitudes of a small, nimble, entrepreneurial company. The result has been strong productivity and earnings growth for much of the past decade. The leading US oil companies have long enjoyed a prominent position among America's largest companies, with their precise positions depending in considerable measure on the fluctuations in the price of crude oil and gasoline. The weak global oil market has recently held back the earnings of the US majors, though their share price performance appears to have been bolstered over the past year by their high dividend yields, against a background of falling interest rates. Exxon, long the largest of the group, is ranked second in the FT table, with Mobil following in ninth position, Chevron 11th and Amoco 19th. One of the most dramatic industrial developments in the US over the past year has been a spate of takeover bids in the telecommunications and media businesses, as companies jockey for position ahead of the much-heralded multimedia information technology revolution. A leading participant in this unheaval is American Telephone and Telegraph, the long-distance telecommunications and computer company, which is by far the largest US company in the sector, ranking third in the FT table, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 79bn. The next largest in the sector is GTE, the telecommunications company that serves markets scattered across the US. It ranks seventh, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 36bn, ahead of the largest 'Baby Bell' local phone company, BellSouth, which is capitalised at Dollars 30bn and ranks 15th. The 'Baby Bells' are so-called because they were spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984. Among retailing companies, Wal-Mart Stores, the discount chain based in Arkansas, continues to consolidate its position as the biggest powerhouse in the sector, expanding its square footage across the US with its successful formula of low prices, good customer relations and efficient back-office operations. It ranks fourth in the FT table, with a market capitalisation of nearly Dollars 57bn, up from around Dollars 27bn in 1990, when it was about the 10th largest company in the nation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A-Z list of the US top 100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A                                     RANK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbott Laboratories                     28 Albertson's Inc                         64 AlliedSignal Inc                        82 Allstate Corp                           57 American Express                        44 American Home Products Corp             37 American International Group            13 American Tele &amp;

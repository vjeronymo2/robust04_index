			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> BYRD SLOWED BY ANKLE INJURY  </P> <P> Cornerback Gill Byrd said there was no reason for him to be listed on the  team's weekly injury report as questionable with a groin pull.  </P> <P> "Now it's an ankle," Byrd said after suffering a sprain in Thursday's practice.  "I don't know how bad it is, but it's real sore now."  </P> <P> Byrd finished Thursday's practice, but after standing on the sideline while the  offense went through its drills, he said it started aching and becoming harder  to walk on.  </P> <P> "I don't know how severe it is," Byrd said. "I think it's going to be a  day-to-day thing. We run practice on the turf (today), so that's not going to  help it any, so we'll just have to wait and see."  </P> <P> Byrd leads the AFC with five interceptions.  </P> <P> The Chargers have not listed starting right offensive tackle Broderick Thompson  on their injury report, although he has been unable to practice this week  because of an ankle injury.  </P> <P> "He should be on there, definitely should be on there," Coach Dan Henning said.  "He's questionable. I think the likelihood is pretty good (he'll be playing  Sunday)."  </P> <P> Tackle Joel Patten took Thompson's place on the right side in practice  Thursday.  </P> <P> Safeties Vencie Glenn (hamstring) and Martin Bayless (calf) also are listed as  questionable, but both practiced without difficulty Thursday.  </P> <P> Linebacker Billy Ray Smith, although acknowledging that his replacement, Henry  Rolling, has been playing well in his absence, said he's ready to compete again  for playing time.  </P> <P> "Years with the team may do you a little bit of good, but in the end they are  going to go with the guy who can get the job done," Smith said. "It's all up to  the coaches."  </P> <P> Smith said he was in on about 25% of the plays in practice Thursday. "It feels  fine," Smith said. "I'm not running out there going 'stomach, stomach,  stomach.' If it doesn't bother me I really don't think about it." T.J. SIMERS  </P></p>

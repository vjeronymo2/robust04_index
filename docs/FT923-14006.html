			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Amnesty extends its area of interest AMNESTY International, the human rights organisation, will concern itself with arbitrary killings and hostage-taking committed by armed opposition groups, such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Northern Ireland, as well as with abuses by governments, according to the group's annual report published yesterday. The policy shift results from an expansion of Amnesty's traditional remit of campaigning for prisoners of conscience, decided at its biennial international council meeting, held in Yokohama last September. Other new areas of work include the defence of 'selective' conscientious objectors, such as soldiers imprisoned in the US and UK for refusing to serve in the Gulf war. In the past governments criticised by Amnesty have often retorted that it does not apply the same standards to their opponents. As the report says, states often 'seek to justify violations of fundamental human rights by their own forces by referring to atrocities committed by their opponents, as if this helped any of the victims'. The new policy clearly aims to pre-empt that response. Its object, the report says, is to influence opposition groups on behalf of victims, and so 'to protect individuals in the face of abuses by armed political groups when governments fail to do so'. Killings and hostage-taking by such groups occurred in most regions of the world in 1991, the year covered by the report, which refers to many of them, although it does not yet reflect the full range of the new policy. In particular it mentions the bombing by the IRA of the military wing of a hospital in November 1991, which killed two soldiers and wounded 10, as well as killings by Protestant paramilitary groups, the Basque separatist organisation ETA in Spain, the Kurdish Workers' party (PKK) in Turkey, Kurdish opposition forces in Iraq, armed militias in Lebanon, and Palestinians in Israel-occupied territories. The report opens with the observation that 'the abuse of power continues unabated', referring to the torture, killings, 'disappearances', arbitrary detention and other gross human rights violations which it describes in no less than 142 countries. Amnesty, the report explains, takes no position on sentences to be passed on those convicted of human rights crimes (except that it opposes the death penalty in all circumstances). Nor does it oppose pardons after conviction, in the interests of national reconciliation. But it believes that thorough investigations are vital, to determine individual and collective responsibility and provide the victims with a full account of the truth; that those responsible must be brought to justice, and their trials concluded with a clear verdict of guilt or innocence; and that amnesty laws which prevent the emergence of the truth and accountability before the law are not acceptable. The report does contain some heartening news, particularly from central and eastern Europe where in 1989 Amnesty had no members, only 'a few, scattered, courageous subscribers to its newsletter', themselves subject to official harassment. By the beginning of this year it had more than 1,500 international members in that region, receiving information and writing letters on behalf of prisoners in other countries.</p>

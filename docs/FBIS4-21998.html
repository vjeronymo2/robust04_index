			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Here is a report just in: There was an  explosion on a bus in the Hadera central bus station. Our  correspondent Yo'av Aviv is on the line with more details:    The explosion occurred in the back part of the bus, near the  rear exit door. We know that there were fatalities -- apparently  one or two people were killed in the blast. I must stress that  this is an initial report, and the details may not be final.  There are wounded too, and they are being evacuated by  ambulances to the Hilel Yafe Hospital in Hadera.    Police have cordoned off the area and have already collected  eye witnesses' testimonies about Arabs they had seen on that  bus. Those who placed the explosive charge may have gotten off  earlier. Searches are in progress.    To repeat, an explosive charge went off aboard bus No. 820  from 'Afula to Tel Aviv. The charge went off when the bus got  to Hadera. [passage omitted]</p>

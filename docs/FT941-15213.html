			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Two-speed recovery for Europe as Germany lags France, Spain and Italy will join the UK in economic recovery this year but Germany will remain mired in recession, according to Oxford Economic Forecasting, John Griffith writes. This picture of a two-speed Europe is painted in OEF's latest assessment of the prospects for the world economy.* It forecasts growth for the OECD states as a whole of 2.1 per cent this year, compared with 1 per cent in 1993, but stresses the uneven distribution of growth. It predicts 3.2 per cent GDP increase for the US but warns that this probably represents a peak, with minor declines to follow up to 1996. Stagnation is also forecast for Japan, but with a resumption of growth of 2.4 per cent in 1995, accelerating to 3.2 per cent a year later. The forecasts show the UK continuing to lead the Europeans out of recession, with growth of 2.7 per cent this year being broadly sustained through to the end of 1996. However, it concludes that Italy and Spain are now set to benefit from increased competitiveness arising from devaluations against the D-Mark. *World Economic Prospects: Winter 1993/4.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "M.G.": "In Search of High Technology -- </F> China: Hebei Authorities Courting French Firms"]    [Text] A large delegation from Hebei province (the region  surrounding Beijing) is currently in France to entice French  firms with investment proposals.    As an automatic result of improved relations between Beijing  and Paris, numerous Chinese delegations are once again finding  their way to France. Only a few days after the visit by  Beijing's mayor, during which several French groups announced  they had achieved their goal, a large delegation from Hebei  province has come to court French firms. With its 60 million  citizens, the province is to Beijing what the Ile-de-France  region is to Paris. Glad to "meet with his old friends again,"  Hebei Deputy Governor Chen Liyou presented a number of projects  during a meeting jointly sponsored by the Paris Chamber of  Commerce and Industry and the France-China Committee.    The deputy governor explained that the projects pertain to  transportation (motorways) and electricity generation (power  plants), and also tometallurgical industry, automobile,  pharmacy, and mechanical engineering. "We have a few large  projects, but also a number of initiatives that may be of  interest to small- and medium-sized businesses," the vice  governor explained. Like all other Chinese provinces, Hebei has  been looking for foreign technology to modernize its industrial  fabric. In the last few years, provincial authorities spent  $1.2 billion on foreign technology.    However, out of this figure, "France's share was a mere $.06  billion," the governor pointed out. "Many French firms come and  see us, but we think there are not enough of them," said Chen  Liyou, who urged those firms present at the meeting to attend  the international investment forum scheduled to take place in  Shijiazhuang, the capital, in early September.</p>

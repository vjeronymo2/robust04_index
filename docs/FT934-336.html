			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Faulty assumptions about Turkey's attitudes Sir, David Gardner may be right in his assessment of Theodoros Pangalos and the Pasok government in Greece (The FT Interview, December 22). But when he crosses the border into Turkey, he makes assumptions which are either untrue or out of date. The latter is certainly the case where he talks of Turkey aspiring to membership of the European Union. Turkey is now ambivalent in its attitude to the Union, not only because of its growing role in central Asia but also because the EU is in many ways doing more for Turkey by way of apology for keeping Turkey out than it would if it allowed Turkey in. As for 'historic Greek-Turkish enmity', there is no such thing - in Turkey. Many a traveller has commented on the absence of any anti-Greek sentiment in Turkey, and contrasted it with the outpourings of anti-Turkish bile in Greece.

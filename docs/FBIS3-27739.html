Following is our radio comment on the issue:    BBC Radio last weekend described the radio service as the  plan belonging to right-wing Americans who [word indistinct] or  to popularize American ideal and way of life.    The spokesman for the Chinese Government declared that the  decision trampled upon the principle of international relations  and interfered in the internal affairs of China and other Asian  countries. China demanded that the decision be reversed. The  People's Democratic Republic of Korea or North Korea and Myanmar  [Burma] also voiced disagreement, and some Americans also  rejected the move of the U.S. Senate.    It is believed that the establishment of the radio is the  form of the old cold war, and it is not useful and appreciable  especially when economic ties between the U.S. and Asia are  developing.    A spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said: The  American radio service harms not only socioeconomic development  of Asian countries but also relations between the United States  and these countries.    The decision to set up Radio Free Asia is rejected in Asia  and by some American people. After the cold war, the situation  in the world and in Asia has changed. Asia has become a more  peaceful, stable, developing, and dynamic zone in comparision  with other regions. Therefore, all countries in the region wish  to broaden multilateral and diversify cooperation relations in  order to defend peace and security. Many other countries in the  world and the U.S.A. welcome and respect this intention. As a  result, the establishment of Radio Free Asia will run counter to  this trend and will worsen positive development between U.S.A.  and Asian countries.</p>

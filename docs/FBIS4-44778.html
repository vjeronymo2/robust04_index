			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Emmanuel Jullien: "To Make High-Strength </F> Cylindrical Parts: A 50/50 Aluminum/Ceramic Composite"--first  paragraph is INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES introduction]    [Text] The method developed by Industrial Bronzes, a  small to mid-size industry [PMI], yields aluminum-based  composites with a very high wear resistance.    When it manufactures metallic rings and cylinders by  centrifugation, the PMI Industrial Bronzes kills two birds with  one stone. Actually, it uses centrifugal force to achieve  concentrations of up to 50 percent of silicon carbide particles  in its aluminum parts, over a thickness of its choice, and in  parts ranging from 80 mm to 2 m in diameter. This is an original  way of exceeding the 20-percent rate, above which the alloy  becomes too viscous to be cast.    "When silicon carbide concentrations reach 30 percent, the  aluminum-matrix composite becomes practically insensitive to  friction, its mechanical performance improves, and it can  withstand temperatures as high as 300C," Luc Lajoye, the  technical manager, explained. This means a tenfold increase of  the application range of light-alloy cylinders. Aerospatiale  already placed a test order for space applications. Sollac also  decided to subject the alloy to severe testing, using it for an  electric collector ring immersed in water heated to over  100C.    It was after the completion of the Euram BRITE [Basic  Research in Industrial Technologies for Europe] project,  completed jointly with the Grenoble National Polytechnic  Institute (INPG) at a cost of 12 million French francs [Fr] over  three years, that the PMI developed this knowhow. The  manufacturer makes an aluminum alloy containing 10 percent of  silicon carbide, and centrifuges this alloy to mold it into a  cylinder. Being heavier than aluminum, silicon carbide then  migrates toward the outer perimeter. There, it accumulates in  concentrations of 30, 40 and even 50 percent. "By varying the  temperature and centrifugation rate, we manage to control the  concentration and thickness of the solidified zone. But we also  vary the particle size (from 10 to 100 fm) to modify the  mechanical strength and wear resistance," Luc Lajoye added.  Another distinctive characteristic is that the parts are  strengthened both at the surface and throughout their thickness.  Witness the tests carried out on engine cylinder liners, causing  silicon carbide to migrate and accumulate in a 5-mm thick  homogeneous peripheral zone containing 35-percent silicon  carbide. After the cylinder has cooled, its inside must be  machined to remove about 10 mm and get down to the strengthened  zone. "Compared with the `Nicasil' surface treatment (using  nickel and silicon carbide), the price is divided by two," Luc  Lajoye assured.</p>

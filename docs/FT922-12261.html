			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (7): Sniping now looks like sour grapes - Yamazaki Machinery THERE WILL be mixed feelings in Europe's machine tool industry about the export award for Yamazaki Machinery UK, the Worcester-based subsidiary of Japan's Yamazaki Mazak. For Yamazaki, the world's largest producer of computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools, the award is an important accolade, and is particularly welcome in the midst of a recession in the machine tool industry. Coming a year after Komatsu, the Japanese construction equipment group, won an export award for its UK subsidiary near Newcastle, it indicates the growing importance for the big Japanese mechanical engineering groups of a pan-European approach to UK manufacturing. 'The company considers Europe is its market, not the UK plus exports,' says Yamazaki. However, Yamazaki's presence in the UK remains controversial, at least for some machine tool rivals. The Worcester plant began manufacturing in 1987, but has never really been accepted by the UK machine tool establishment. And machine tool builders on both sides of the Channel still remember the Pounds 5.2m of British government money received by Yamazaki in the mid-1980s aid for the Worcester plant. The Pounds 5.2m was criticised, erroneously, as launch aid, when in reality it was an 'FMS grant' available to any company introducing flexible manufacturing systems into UK manufacturing. Winning the award might make some of the sniping look like sour grapes, and makes a mockery of charges in the mid-1980s that machine tool jobs were being created in the UK at the expense of hundreds more in Europe. Yamazaki is now the biggest machine tool producer in the UK - and the largest Japanese machine tool manufacturer in Europe. Its export achievement is undeniable. From a standing start in 1987, exports have risen to around 85-90 per cent of turnover, which reached Pounds 63m in fiscal 1991. Most of the exports are for the European market - the rationale for the plant, after all, was to establish a manufacturing plant in the European Community, well ahead of the Single Market. But some exports go to the US and, especially in the plant's early days before the product range grew, even to Japan. In 1987, the plant began producing two models, but five years later the product range has been expanded to 12 basic models of machining centres and turning centres. Two new models, a vertical machining centre and the Super Quick Turn range of machines, were introduced last year. Employment at Yamazaki Machinery has risen to around 300 from 35 in 1986, and has fallen only marginally in the current recession. This is an achievement of which few UK machine tool builders could boast, and partly reflects the inbuilt Japanese resistance to making redundancies. The cuts were made mainly through natural wastage, although last month the company did part company with Mr Stephen LeBeau, its sales director, in a move that surprised industry observers. But the relatively minimal job cuts are also due to a level of manufacturing technology and organisation that allows the plant to operate at 50 per cent of capacity and still be profitable. Yamazaki, along with all machine tool builders, is suffering from the recession, but stresses that production levels have not fallen that far. Although the effects of Yamazaki's UK manufacturing are hard to quantify, the company reckons that its presence probably directly gives employment to about one-and-a-half times as many people as it employs itself. It has also provided work for, and helped raised product quality at, a number of UK and continental European component suppliers, in line with local content agreements. The head of one north Midlands foundry company recalls knocking on Yamazaki's door many times in the mid-1980s in the hope of finding work. But having won a contract to supply Worcester, he now also exports castings to Yamazaki in the US, and has benefited from Yamazaki's collaborative approach to boosting product quality at suppliers. Yamazaki's presence at Worcester has also contributed to an emerging trend of investment by Japanese components suppliers. Last year, Kitagawa, the world's largest producer of power chucks for machine tools and a big supplier to Yamazaki, joined forces with Mr Tertius Threipland, a British entrepreneur, to begin manufacturing chucks at Salisbury, Wilts. Exports at Yamazaki are likely to remain at their current level in percentage terms, but the emphasis may switch from producing smaller machines in high volume for the European market to larger machines in low volumes for the world market. The export award is the second recent accolade for Yamazaki Machinery. In October it was selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences to take part in a 'Best in the World' study of manufacturing productivity.</p>

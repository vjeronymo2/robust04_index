Electronic Payment Services, Inc., Civ. No. 94&hyph;208, D. Del. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Gentlemen: Money Station, Inc. (Money Station) submits this comment pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Sections 16(b), (d), on the proposed Final Judgment in United States vs. Electronic Payment Services, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  published on May 12, 1994, at 59 Fed. Reg. 24711  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Competitive Impact Statement published along with the proposed Final Judgment, Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (EPS) has maintained a ``tying arrangement that is per se unlawful'' by foreclosing independent third-party ATM processors (id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  at 24718) as ``has maintained a monopoly in regional ATM network access'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) in numerous states, including ``substantial portions of the state of Ohio'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ). The proposed Final Judgment is intended to advance the public interest in both a direct and an indirect way. The intended direct benefit is to increase competition in the market for ATM processing services by eliminating the tying arrangement. The intended indirect benefit is to increase competition in the market for regional ATM access by making it possible for banks to join multiple ATM networks through third-party ATM processors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Money Station operates an ATM network principally located in Ohio, but which also has participants located in Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia (where EPS is also alleged to have monopoly power) with ATM machines that bear the Money Station trademark and are linked to the Money Station network. Money Station represents exactly the kind of potential and actual competition that the Government looks to as a means of making the market for regional ATM access more competitive in the geographic areas where MAC is currently the ubiquitous network with market power. Consequently, Money Station has reviewed the proposed Final Judgment carefully. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Money Station agrees with the Government that elimination of the tying arrangement, if effectively implemented, will open up competition for ATM processing services. Money Station, however, has far less confidence that competition in ATM processing services can overcome the ``collective action program,'' referred to in the Competitive Impact Statement, in the market for regional ATM access. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  at 24720.) There are genuine economic costs associated with joining more than one regional network ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  card issuance costs, signage costs). Unless multiple banks act simultaneously to join one or more competing networks in addition to the ubiquitous network, no benefits can accrue to the individual bank that joins one or more such competing networks. In other words, no bank will incur the costs to join network B in addition to the ubiquitous network A unless network B provides sufficient ATMs and cards that the bank's transaction volume flowing through network B generates enough income (or savings) to justify the costs associated with joining network B. That transaction volume depends on the actions of other banks. This ``collective action'' problem is exacerbated if the ubiquitous network with market power is able to establish any disincentives (whether technical or economic) against joining other networks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, Money Station recognizes that elimination of the tying arrangement challenged in the complaint in this case, if effectively implemented, does open up competition for ATM processing services and is thus in the public interest. Money Station further recognizes that elimination of the tying arrangement, again if effectively implemented, is a necessary first step, even if not a totally sufficient step, in opening up the market for regional ATM access and so, again, is in the public interest. Money Station therefore supports the proposed Final Judgment as a general matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure, however, the effectiveness of the proposed Final Judgment, Money Station recommends that several issues be addressed before the proposed Final Judgment is approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

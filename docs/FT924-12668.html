			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / IMF warns of errors in capital flow statistics ECONOMIC policymakers could be making the wrong decisions because of large and growing errors in the balance of payments statistics they are using, the International Monetary Fund has warned. After a three-year study of international data on capital flows the IMF found the global capital account, which should reach zero because net outflows from one country should be offset by net inflows in another, showed an apparent surplus averaging Dollars 40bn (Pounds 23.20bn) a year. The discrepancy has climbed by more than 50 per cent a year to reach Dollars 65.8bn in 1989, an IMF working party found. Actual errors could be even larger as some positive errors cancel out negative errors. IMF officials said inadequate statistics on capital flows 'call into question the data on the basis of which decisions are taken and potentially, at least, impair the appropriateness of those decisions'. Bad data could, for example, affect the view of a country's national saving levels or alter the management of sovereign debt problems. The abolition of exchange controls in many countries, coupled with the internationalisation of stock and bond investments, has made it more difficult for countries to keep track of capital flows. But the IMF found further errors arising from offshore financial centres, multinational corporations, Dutch financial institutions and a 'deplorable deterioration' in reporting by international organisations. The working party was able to identify some gaps and make adjustments averaging Dollars 23.4bn a year, but called on the leading industrial countries to make an effort to improve their national balance of payments statistics.</p>

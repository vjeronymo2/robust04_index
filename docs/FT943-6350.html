			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Bit of a mess over waste - Disappointment for the EU packaging industry and environmentalists The failure of the European Environment Council to approve the proposed Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive this June was a disappointment for environmentalists and the packaging industry alike. With the directive now consigned to the unfamiliar conciliation procedure established under the Maastricht treaty, its future seems in doubt, leaving member states free to pursue their own, disparate management systems. The directive, adopted by the European Commission in July 1992 and amended in September 1993, was intended to control the hazard presented by packaging waste, and to overcome the threat posed by individual national schemes to the single market. But, although a harmonised approach to packaging control is generally welcomed by member states, it was blocked in the council in March by Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, which believed the target waste-recovery and recycling rates were not sufficiently stringent. Targets outlined in the directive are much lower than those originally proposed and have some flexibility. For the first five years after the implementation of the directive, targets would be 50-65 per cent for packaging waste recovery and 25-45 per cent for recycling, averaged across all packaging materials, with a minimum of 15 per cent for each kind of waste material. Targets for the ensuing 10-year period, intended to be higher, would be established under a review procedure. Some friction over the issue was avoided through provisions that would allow upward derogation from targets for member states wishing to exceed them - provided their measures did not distort the single market, damage the environment or hinder other member states' compliance with the directive. Downward derogation would also be permitted for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, prompting criticism that the directive falls some way short of harmonisation. So why did the directive fail? Several issues led to the impasse. Some member states opposed not only flexibility of targets, but also the management hierarchy of waste control. Under the directive, methods such as recycling, re-use and recovery, including incineration with energy recovery, are considered equally acceptable until environmental impact studies prove otherwise. While the European Parliament's proposal that an article specifically calling for prevention of waste was accepted, its suggestion that methods be listed in order of preference was not. Economic instruments such as a tax on waste or landfill levies also proved controversial. 'Some countries were loath to hand over tax-making power to the Council,' explains Ms Suzanne Clabon, of UK law firm Clifford Chance. But it was Belgium, fearing the provision could threaten the future of its planned eco taxes, that dealt a death blow to the directive in June by forming a blocking majority. Ironically, while the EU prevaricates on the directive, various member states have addressed the subject, and diverse national measures have now intensified the need for harmonisation. The treaty base of the directive remains Article 100a, with its objective of protecting the single market, but currently, says Ms Clabon, 'the number and nature of national management systems could well be a threat to the single market'. Mr James Devereux of Incpen, an independent UK industry body, agrees. 'They certainly don't help create a level playing field and some are viewed as thinly disguised trade barriers.' National regimes vary considerably. France's legislation introduced in 1992 addresses household packaging waste, which producers must take back or pass on to a state-approved organisation under a scheme administered by local authorities. Incineration and recycling are permitted. Currently, rules are being developed for commercial waste. So far the UK has avoided legislation and opted for a system of self-regulation. Plans of the Producer Responsibility Industry Group, an independent body formed by private industry on government prompting, propose a scheme to achieve a recovery level of 58 per cent of packaging waste by 2000 and the establishment of an organisation to raise necessary revenues. But the group and many in the industry still support the idea of legislation to enforce compliance with the system. The most controversial regulation is the German Packaging Ordinance of 1991, the most ambitious of the national schemes. To comply with the ordinance, many in German industry now subscribe to the Duales System Deutschland (DSD), which operates a collection and reprocessing system. Subscribers pay a levy to belong to the system under which their products are marked with an identifying symbol. Exporters of goods to Germany have little choice but to join the system. Such is the success of the ordinance, which prevents incineration and landfills, that Germany is unable to recycle all the waste collected and has been forced to export some - particularly plastics that are difficult to recycle. Problems have resulted for environmental controllers in recipient countries, and the difficulties may intensify when the targets for recovery increase to 80 per cent across the board in 1995. 'The German system is the most comprehensive, but also has problems,' confirms Mr Bernd Meyer-Witting of Clifford Chance's Frankfurt office. 'As well as the problems with plastics, there is some confusion generated among consumers as to segregation of waste. But there are also cartel issues - with organisations such as the DSD, are you setting up a national monopoly which can set prices?' Even if the directive proceeds, problems with national schemes may persist. Provisions regarding methods of achieving targets are general, leaving member states free to develop their own management schemes, although proposals for national schemes must be submitted to the Council before adoption. The directive now lies in limbo, with talks on its future due to start in September. 'The matter will be procedurally complicated,' says Ms Clabon. Post-Maastricht, some directives failing to gain Council approval at this stage are subject to the 'co-decision' procedure, under Article 189B of the treaty, between the Council and the European Parliament. 'The concern is that the Council and Parliamentary representatives may not just consider the contentious issues but may reopen debate on the entire directive,' she says. Parliament in this procedure ultimately has a power of veto over the directive. 'Parliament is traditionally stronger on environmental issues and the newly elected Parliament may want to flex its muscles,' says Ms Clabon.</p>

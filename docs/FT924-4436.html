			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Fyffes directors sell shares to repay IPounds 10m of debt TWO TOP directors of Fyffes, the UK and Irish fruit and vegetable wholesaler, have sold a quarter of their holding in the company, raising IPounds 10m (Pounds 10.1m) to repay borrowings. Mr Neil McCann, chairman, and Mr Carl McCann, group finance director, have sold a total of 11m ordinary shares at 64p each, and a further IPounds 3m in preference shares, which were held by Balkan Investment Co, the investment vehicle of the McCann family. The sale reduces the family holding in Fyffes to 9.3 per cent of the ordinary share capital, down from 13.3 per cent. Mr Carl McCann, said that the shares were sold to repay loans which had been taken out to build a stake in Fyffes during earlier share placings. He said: 'That was fine when interest rates were normal, but with the current rates it created a situation we were not willing to continue with.' One-month money market rates on the Dublin market are in the 40-60 per cent range. The sale took place at a four-year low in the Fyffes share price. 'It was not very pleasant to be selling at that price, but . . . it was either now or wait until next February,' he said. Under Stock Exchange rules, directors are not permitted to make share transactions in their own companies within two months before the release of annual financial results. Ordinary shares formerly held by Balkan, worth 7.7m, have been sold to the Development Capital Corporation (DCC), a Dublin-based industrial and financial holding company, which is 20 per cent owned by the Bank of Ireland. DCC has increased its stake in Fyffes through the purchase from 8.2 per cent to 11 per cent. DCC began as a venture capital company in 1976, and has been a strong supporter of the McCanns, helping to bring their FII company to the Stock Exchange in 1981. Mr Jim Flavin, the chairman and chief executive of DCC said yesterday: 'We have no further intentions . . . to increase our holding. Fyffes is a very cash-rich company, and it just seemed like a very good opportunity to buy.'</p>

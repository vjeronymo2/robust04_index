			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / World Trade News: S Korea urged to liberalise trade policies SOUTH Korea owes much of its remarkable economic success over the past 30 years to the open world trading system. It should therefore now reciprocate with further trade liberalisation, some of its trading partners told Gatt's governing council yesterday. The council discussed a report on South Korea's trade policies by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) which pointed out that it was now the world's fifth biggest trader (counting the European Community as one). Since 1962, gross domestic product (GDP) had grown at an average 9 per cent a year, transforming South Korea from a poor agrarian country to a nascent industrialised economy. The report said South Korea's success had been based on an outward-oriented, high investment strategy, supported by continuous access to foreign markets. But South Korea now had a responsibility to promote the successful functioning of the multilateral trading system, by reducing high trade barriers in several areas, notably agriculture. The report said Korea had made considerable strides in liberalising trade, especially in manufacturing. Average tariffs had fallen from almost 24 per cent in 1982 to 10 per cent today. But 'further market opening on a secure multilateral basis by Korea, which has become a significant trading partner for many countries, would also facilitate the continuation of its own successful growth performance', the report said. High agricultural tariffs, a de facto ban on imports of rice and barley, and expensive domestic price support schemes cost Korea about 7 per cent of GDP in 1990, Gatt estimated, almost equivalent to the sector's contribution to the national income. This had led to a lopsided incentive structure which was now impairing industrial competitiveness, the report warned. The economy was showing signs of overheating and resource constraints, with current account deficits recorded in 1990 and 1991. South Korea has been attacked by trading partners in the current round of global trade negotiations for refusing to consider opening its rice market. Mr Park Soo Gil, Seoul's ambassador to Gatt, told the Gatt council that liberalisation of the rice market raised 'serious social, economic and political concerns related to food security and to the family-based structure of Korean agriculture'. The report also pinpointed South Korea's tendency to prefer managed trade arrangements. About 20 per cent of South Korean exports were covered by selective restraints, some negotiated bilaterally, some resulting from anti-dumping measures in importing countries but some imposed unilaterally by South Korea in an attempt to head off action by trading partners.</p>

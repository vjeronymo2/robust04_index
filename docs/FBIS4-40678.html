			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Instead of Zone of Conflict--Zone of </F> Trust"]    [Text] In keeping with a prior agreement, a meeting of  Armenian and Nakhichevan delegations, headed by David  Shakhnazaryan, the Republic of Armenia president's special envoy  and chief of the Republic of Armenia state directorate for  national security, and the chairman of the Nakhichevan Council,  Namik Gasanov, met on 14 June in the border area of Eraskhevan.    Participating in the meeting were the Republic of Armenia  chief border commissioner Gegam Arutyunyan and representatives  of military units and executive authority of Ararat and Sadarak  Rayons.    As we were told at the press center of the Republic of  Armenia Ministry of Defense, the Nakhichevan side once again  admitted that its military units were at fault in the incident  that took place on 27 May on the border of Ereskh.    With the purpose of averting such border incidents, the  Armenian delegation proposed to turn the border zone between  Armenia and Nakhichevan into a zone of trust, and as the first  practical step in this direction to set up border trade points  here.    The Nakhichevan side promised to present this proposal to  the  Azerbaijani leadership for consideration.</p>

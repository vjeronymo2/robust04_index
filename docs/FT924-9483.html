			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Japan sees jump in trade surplus JAPAN'S current account surplus increased by 50 per cent in the first six months of the financial year to stand at Dollars 57.6bn, (Pounds 35.3bn) according to figures published yesterday by the finance ministry. Japanese government officials argue that the sharp rise in the value of the surplus is mainly accounted for by price rises reflecting the strengthening of the yen and manufacturers shifting to more up-market products. However, they remain concerned that the rapid growth of the current account surplus could generate political pressure in Europe and the US to curb Japanese export growth. The trade balance for the six months to September rose by 29 per cent to Dollars 66.2bn compared to the first half of last year, with a 10 per cent growth in exports to Dollars 163.9bn far outstripping a 0.2 per cent growth in imports to Dollars 97.6bn. There was also a sharp turnround in Japan's net exports of capital. In the first half of last year there was a net inflow of long-term capital into Japan of Dollars 23.7bn, as Japan's banks retrenched from international commitments. However, in the six months to this September there was a net long-term capital outflow of Dollars 22bn. Japan's current account surplus in September expanded by 34 per cent from the year before to Dollars 12bn, with exports up 14.3 per cent at Dollars 30bn and imports 7.1 per cent higher at Dollars 17bn.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Two new drama serials and two odd movies. We are warned that The Good Guys (9.00 ITV) 'was specially created for Nigel Havers and Keith Barron because they particularly wanted to work together, and was made by the production company set up by Havers and his agent'. Sounds like a formula for disaster, but the proof of the puddding ... They both play characters named Guy who share a flat and the most encouraging factor is that the writer is John Fortune. The other new series, Love Hurts (9.30 BBC1), is written by Maurice Gran and Laurence Marks who were responsible for 'Birds Of A Feather' and 'Shine On Harvey Moon'. This time we are warned that the star Adam Faith 'came before the story' because, according to Marks 'we've wanted to work with him for a long time'. Marks promises us 'smiles and tears' which sounds like post feminist code for what ad men used to call 'a woman's story'. The Navigator (9.00 BBC2) is not Buster Keaton's wonderful comedy but a 1988 New Zealand film fable about a psychic child in Cumbria at the time of the black death. Rope (10.40 ITV) is one of Hitchcock's oddities: he shot the whole thing in 10-minute takes.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Calls to delay Togo poll brushed aside THE president of Togo's electoral commission told foreign observers yesterday that presidential elections had to go ahead on Wednesday, Reuter reports from Lome. The date of August 25 was 'unalterable', Mr Gaba Sipohon Koue told election observers. Incumbent President Gnassingbe Eyadema said earlier, at an election rally in the south of Togo, that he had no intention of changing the election date. The four opposition nominees on the electoral commission have suspended their participation, but the four nominated by President Eyadema's party and the president still form a working majority. Mr Koue's remarks were an apparent climbdown from the committee's request on Saturday to have the vote postponed by four days. The opposition members of the committee withdrew after two main opposition candidates stopped campaigning, saying they wanted the vote put off to give time for electoral lists to be revised and new voting cards issued.</p>

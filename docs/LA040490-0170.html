			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PHILADELPHIAN TO CONSOLIDATE GATHERS' CASES  </P> <P> A Philadelphia attorney was appointed today to serve as a temporary  administrator in California of the estate of the late college basketball star  Hank Gathers.  </P> <P> A legal battle surrounding the death of the Loyola Marymount star erupted  earlier this week with attorneys representing Gathers' son fighting to be  appointed to administrate the estate, which at this time has little value.  </P> <P> Gathers, one of the nation's leading collegiate players and a top professional  prospect, collapsed during a game March 4 at Loyola's Gersten Pavilion and died  shortly after.  </P> <P> He had been diagnosed earlier in the season as having heart problems but was  given medication and cleared to play.  </P> <P> Terence Nunan, a lawyer representing Gathers' brother, Derrick, argued that a  neutral party should be appointed administrator, contending that the  Philadelphia attorney, Martin Krimsky, has ties to Gathers' son, who is a  potential heir, thereby creating a possible conflict of interest.  </P> <P> But Superior Court Commissioner Robert Blaylock said he found Krimsky "to be a  man of integrity and good and impartial judgment."  </P> <P> Blaylock added it would be less confusing to have Krimsky administer the estate  temporarily because he already was appointed administrator of Gathers' estate  by a court in Philadelphia, Gathers' home city.  </P></p>

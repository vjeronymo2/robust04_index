			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Books: From Hangover to drunk PATRICK HAMILTON: A LIFE by Sean French Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 20, 327 pages The financial anxiety that dogs most young writers of fiction ceased for Patrick Hamilton in his mid-twenties when he wrote those two spine-chilling plays, Rope and Gaslight. But in spite of this great popular success before the second world war, Hamilton was often in a distressed state, and the conditioned worsened as he grew older. He came from an eccentric family most of whose members were writers. He inherited a history of alcoholism and instability, and he succumbed like his father to excessive drinking, half-ruining a brilliant career. Happily the royalties from his plays continued to flow for the whole of his life, and still do. He died in 1962. The plays were ideal for filming by Hitchcock. The director rejected Gaslight when it was offered him by Selznick who had bought the rights but he eventually made Rope in 1948 with James Stewart. As an experiment he filmed it exclusively in one interior set with no jump-cuts, curiously weakening the macabre tension of the play. Sean French regards the film as a transitional work in the Hitchcock canon, preparing the way for Strangers on a Train made from a book by a novelist who rivals Hamilton in her portrayals of plausible con men, Patricia Highsmith. Like the Victorian novelist Geoge Gissing whom he admired, Hamilton penetrated both the genteel and nether worlds of class-ridden Britain depicting the unclassed individuals, those torn between the two, he found there. In The Siege of Pleasure (part two of Hamilton's London trilogy, Twenty Thousand Streets under the Sky) he showed how easily a respectable, exceptionally pretty servant girl might become a hardened prostitute. Hamilton's fascination with street-walkers provided him with several narratives but, unlike Gissing, he stopped short at marrying one. His first wife Lois came like him from the cultivated middle-class and his second from the minor nobility. She too wrote novels. Hamilton was a curious case of someone who since his boyhood in Hove, observed the world of drunks and psychopaths with clinical detachment, and reproduced it to perfection in his fiction; his masterpiece Hangover Square, a murder story, is largely set in a seedy pub in Earls Court during the period of Munich and appeasement whose mood it captures exactly. In his maturity, to the horror of his friends, Hamilton grew to resemble a saloon bar drunk in one of his early novels. Sean French does not offer any particular explanation for Hamilton's personal decline. He focuses instead on the good work that Hamilton was able to do after he had undergone electric shock treatment and other forms of therapy. Finally French points to one surviving document that he considers may have effectively ended Hamilton's writing career. This was a letter in 1952 from Michael Sadleir, the head of Hamilton's publisher, Constable, giving his reaction to the novel later published as Mr Stimpson and Mr Gorse. It must be one of the most wounding letters any novelist has ever received on submission of a manuscript, and it certainly toppled Hamilton's always shaky self-confidence. French rates the book when read today as 'a masterpiece of comedy', a significant advance on its predecessor, The West Pier, set in blowsy Brighton like much of Hamilton's fiction, and he suggests that Sadleir, then in his mid-sixties was unable to see the merits of a novel 'which struck so forcibly at his own social prejudices'. Along with Bill Linnitt, the theatrical impresario, Sadleir had up to that point been one of Hamilton's greatest friends. The biography traces the course of his relations with these two men. Male friendship was a source of strength to Hamilton throughout his life. Other friends included Arthur Calder-Marshall and John Davenport. His relations with women were always punctuated by catastrophe. After the death of his father, a preposterous old tyrant, Hamilton continued to remain closely in touch with the other members of his family especially his brother Bruce, for many years a teacher in Barbados. Bruce published his own life of his brother The Light Went Out (1972), and preserved a family archive. French has burrowed in it fruitfully and also read all of Bruce's novels. He shows how Patrick would occasionally borrow an idea from one for a plot. French does not stimulate any great desire in the reader to sample one of Bruce's novels but he makes a strong case for Patrick as a writer who needs to be placed firmly alongside Orwell and Greene in his accounts of the horrors of suburbia between the wars. The only work of Hamilton's in which this sympathetic critic finds no merit at all is his dystopian fantasy, Impromptu in Moribundia. It was published in 1939 when the writer was at the height of his fame and a marxist. A photograph by Bill Brandt shows him a few years later in his smart flat in Albany, W1 with Terence Rattigan for a neighbour. But even then when Hamilton seemed to hold all the glittering prizes in his grasp, there were seeds of disquiet germinating in his mind; he was like that character in The Heart of the Matter by another Albany neighbour and admirer. The man who 'felt the loyalty we all feel to unhappiness, the sense that that is where we really belong.'</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OTHERS' OBITUARIES COMMEMORATE LIFE  </P> <P> Marti Parker's letter of April 9 is correct. The media shouldn't intrude on a  family's grief.  </P> <P> I have the story about Nadia Puente's funeral and others like it. I have kept  them for a special reason. Last year, a friend died. I never got to say goodby.  That wasn't a word in the vocabulary of this friend's family. Words of hope and  cheer were, although we all knew what the outcome would be when the disease ran  its course.  </P> <P> After my friend's death, there was no obituary, no funeral, no burial, no  memorial. That is why I collect obituaries and articles on death and dying. I  keep a scrapbook with the obits and articles on death and dying. I keep a  scrapbook with the obits and stories of funerals and memorial services for the  friend who had none of these.  </P> <P> To some, this may seem odd, but I've never before faced such a thing. Deaths,  yes. Funerals, yes. But never such silence and never such aloneness. There may  be grief groups for parents who lose children, families whose loss was through  violence, for widows and widowers, but there is no group for people who lose  friends. Or is there?  </P> <P> PATRICIA A. BAYLEY  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

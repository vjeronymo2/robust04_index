			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, March 7 (AFP) -- Norway and Spain  maintained their inflexible stand here Monday [7 March] in a  dispute over fish which is blocking Norway's entry into the  European Union [EU], EU officials said here Monday.    They added that there was also little progress in an  internal  EU row over voting procedures which is threatening to wreck the  chances of Austria, Finland and Sweden entering the Union along  with Norway on January 1.    But Oslo and the European Union moved closer to a deal in a  related dispute, with Norway indicating it might accept limits  on its fish exports to the Union if it were allowed temporary  protection for its food processing industry.    The officials were speaking after a negotiating session  between delegations of EU and Norwegian ministers in the margins  of an EU foreign ministers meeting.    They said the January 1 deadline for enlarging the European  Union would almost certainly be missed if the two disputes were  not solved by Wednesday or Thursday at the latest.    Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said Monday: "We  remain firm. There is no room for manoeuvre. We hope reason  will prevail."    On the other extreme, Norwegian Trade Minister Grete Knudsen  reiterated Norway's refusal to grant extra catch quotas to EU  fishing fleets as demanded by Spain.    She reported "substantial progress" in other aspects of  negotiations with the European Union, notably concerning  agriculture, customs duties and restrictions on the purchase of  holiday homes by foreigners.    Knudsen also indicated that Norway might accept temporary EU  limits on imports of cheap Norwegian fish when Oslo joins the  Union, if it could offer similar protection to its own food  processing industry.    The trade-off would have no effect on Spain, which wants the  European Union given extra catch quotas of 18,000 tonnes of fish  in Norwegian waters.    This is less than one percent of Norway's total catch and  the  Spanish want 14,000 tonnes of it for themselves.    But Knudsen said during Monday's early negotiations that  Norway was not prepared to relax its efficient management of  fish resources by allowing the European Union to take any more  fish than they do by existing accords.    The two sides were due to hold more negotiations later in  the  day. The Greek president of the EU Council of Ministers,  Theodoros Pangalos, said he hoped for a package deal with Norway  by late Tuesday.    "The issue must be wrapped up this week. The first one to  blink loses," an EU official said.    The EU foreign ministers were also scheduled to hold a  top-secret internal negotiating session later in the day on the  row over voting procedures when the applicants join the European  Union.    Britain and Spain are trying to retain the current voting  system in the European Union's Council of Ministers -- its main  decision-making organ -- where two large countries and one small  one can block decisions.    Other EU countries maintain that this rule should be relaxed  to take account of the Union's enlargement, so that the entry of  four more members does not make decision-making more difficult.    Under the current system of weighted voting where big  countries have more influence than small ones, 23 votes out of  76 -- 30 percent -- are sufficient to constitute a blocking  majority.    With the entry of the four newcomers, the blocking ratio  should logically change to 27 out of 90. One small and two big  countries would no longer be enough to block decisions.    For Britain, this means that a free trade block of Germany,  Britain and Denmark would no longer be able to hold up such  restrictions on trade as anti-dumping measures.    And Spain, Italy and Portugal would no longer be assured of  protecting their Mediterrannean agricultural interests. Spain  and Britain gave no signs on Monday that they were prepared to  yield.</p>

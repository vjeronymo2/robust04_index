			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Gatt clash over US tax is defused A row over potential US tax discrimination against foreign companies, which for three weeks has threatened agreement over the Uruguay Round of talks on international trade reform, was settled in Geneva yesterday. After a full week of negotiation, headed on the US side by Mr Les Samuels, US assistant secretary for tax affairs at the Treasury, the US has agreed to abandon threats to exempt itself in the Uruguay Round deal from a commitment to treat foreign and local companies in a non-discriminatory way in so far as tax policies affect trade. The Uruguay Round text to which the US had objected has been amended to the satisfaction of all 116 countries involved in negotiating the round. The commitment to 'national treatment' - treating foreign companies exactly the same as local companies - is a founding principle of the multilateral trading principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The US threat to exempt itself from the obligation to provide national treatment for tax purposes provoked a storm among Gatt negotiators just three weeks ago. Alongside US threats to offer full most favoured nation treatment in financial services to just 20-or-so trading partners, the row over tax was seen by many negotiators as bringing into question US commitment to international trade rules. This breakthrough reduces the list of potential 'round-breaking' disputes. Those remaining include the financial services issue, US demands that anti-dumping rules be changed, and a US-EU row over access to Europe's film and television sectors. Negotiators conceded yesterday that existing bilateral tax agreements allow governments to treat local and foreign companies differently for tax purposes. New Gatt rules would only challenge this right if the rules were seen to be used for protectionist purposes. US concerns that the new Gatt rules were not clear enough, and that they raised the danger of Gatt panels being used as 'courts of appeal' against domestic tax rulings, have been resolved over the week's negotiations. Similarly, tax issues falling outside the scope of an existing tax treaty - and therefore potentially subject to arbitration in the Gatt - will be immunised against Gatt interference. Only future tax treaties face the prospect of being subject to the new Gatt powers - except if treaties are specifically drafted to prevent this.</p>

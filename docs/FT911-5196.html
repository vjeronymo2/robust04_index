			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / TV-am to discuss links with Sky news operation TV-AM, THE breakfast television company, plans to explore links with Sky News, the 24-hour satellite news channel, when the current franchise bids finish. There have already been talks between Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am managing director, and Mr Sam Chisholm, managing director of British Sky Broadcasting, on potential co-operation. Both are directors of the Channel 9 television network in Australia and see opportunities for economies of scale in their UK television news operations. For example, although TV-am broadcasts just under 3 1/2 hours a day, its news operation has to be staffed round the clock. Mr Gyngell is concentrating on regaining the breakfast franchise and will bid on the existing structure of news provision, but he clearly believes that co-operation with Sky and the resulting savings could avoid affecting the station's programme obligations. That could enable TV-am to bid higher in the competitive tenders that will decide the franchises. A link with TV-am might help BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, to cut the costs of its news service. In spite of the cost, senior management at BSkyB see Sky News as an integral part of its five-channel service. TV-am is likely to face two well-funded rivals for its franchise.</p>

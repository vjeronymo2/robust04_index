			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (20): Lloyd's re-awakens to trade credit risk - Private market export credit insurance / A move back into direct commercial export credit risk underwriting by Lloyd's of London is part of a continuing trend towards a broader market for export credit insurance New facilities for direct commercial export credit risk underwriting at Lloyd's will complement the services offered in the UK by mainstream short-term credit insurers. These services are led by NCM and Trade Indemnity, but additionally include the specialist departments of a number of other insurers, including, for example, Sun Alliance and Commercial Union. Despite difficult worldwide trading conditions in recent years, there has often been a marked reluctance by exporters to make use of export credit insurance. The lack of appropriate insurance cover for markets outside OECD countries has arguably been partly responsible; but many exporters have also been unwilling to pay premium costs which they regard in some cases as too high. Premium costs have to some extent been dictated by high claim levels resulting from company failures during the recession. However, another influential factor has been developments at Lloyd's, where the cost of reinsuring commercial risk has been affected by a reduction in available capacity. Lloyd's internal wranglings aside, this reflected the market's overall difficult claims experience across a broad range of core insurance sectors, such as marine indemnity. Other smaller sectors were also affected, including political risk cover for export deals. The latter offers exporters insurance against, for example, an act of government preventing a buyer making payment and, since the early 1920s, has been the only form of trade export credit cover directly available from the market. Against this background, the private insurance market is generally seeking to provide a broader range of cover options which cost-effectively meet exporters' requirements. This move is particularly important given the global privatisation trend which is creating a vast number of private sector foreign buyers which do not have the secure, direct support of government. The private insurance market is deemed by many to be particularly suited to analysing risk perceptions and subsequently meeting exporters' needs in this key area. The launch in early September of Lloyd's International Trade Credit Insurance Facility led by Hiscox Syndicate 33, with the backing of other syndicates, is an integral part of this trend. This facility will provide commercial, or buyer, risk associated with the provision of export credits. Although Lloyd's syndicates have been active in providing political risk cover, they had previously been excluded from commercial underwriting since the 1920s due to difficulties the market experienced with this form of cover. 'This facility will ensure that London is at the centre of the trade credit insurance world,' says Charles Berry of the co-ordinating broker for the facility, Berry, Palmer &amp; Lyle, (BPL). Under the terms of this new facility, exporters will be able to insure individual commercial risks to an upper limit of around Dollars 5m. Participating syndicates will not be allowed to receive more than 2 per cent of premium income from this new business. The facility is expected to concentrate on areas of risk outside the domain of mainstream trade credit insurance - 'very generally, we are not looking to compete head-to-head for business already written well by NCM, France's Coface and Germany's Hermes,' says Mr Berry. A strength of the market is that it can transcend national boundaries - 'we are just as interested in a Mexican company selling to the UK as a UK company selling to Mexico. The whole market is very under-developed, although UK and OECD exporters are relatively well-served,' he says. Meanwhile, there is also considerable potential for exporters to access insurance outside the Lloyd's market, from established companies such as American International Group (AIG), or newer insurers such as the Paris-based Unistrat Assurances or the Bermuda-registered Exporters Insurance Company, (EIC). For companies able to sustain an initial Dollars 100,000 outlay, the 'group captive' framework available from EIC may prove an effective vehicle to insure export credits. EIC may be in a position to assist companies whose credit insurance requirements cannot be adequately met on the open market, according to Maurice Drage, EIC's UK consultant and representative. Qualification for membership of a 'group captive' involves the exporter in the purchase of a shareholding. In the case of EIC, this is worth 5 per cent of the deal they are negotiating. The minimum shareholding of Dollars 100,000 provides a new member with immediate access to Dollars 2m worth of cover. EIC will cover individual deals up to a maximum of Dollars 6.6m. EIC cover is particularly suited to exporters selling to the larger newly industrialised countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, but can also cover deals in niche markets such as international metals shipments in eastern European and CIS countries. 'We are not the entire solution to insurance in this area - but a supplement to capacity elsewhere,' says Mark Reynolds, EIC's New York-based vice-president.</p>

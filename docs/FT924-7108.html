			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Time for a purge THE LATEST revelations of South Africa's commission of inquiry into political violence represent the gravest challenge yet to the integrity of President F W de Klerk and the negotiation process itself. Allegations of government complicity in political violence have never been in short supply; but hard evidence has so far proved scarce. In the past it has been possible to accept President de Klerk's repeated denials of state involvement in the so-called 'third force'. This murky group of right-wing extremists is conducting a campaign of assassination and sabotage to weaken the African National Congress and inflame its already tense relations with the rival Inkatha Freedom Party. Credulity has become increasingly strained, however, as more information surfaces. It ranges from allegations linking a serving senior military officer with the assassination in 1985 of Mr Matthew Goniwe, a leading government opponent, to the discovery in London earlier this year of two members of South African intelligence, apparently set on silencing a whistle-blowing colleague. Yesterday credulity vanished. Judge Goldstone's latest disclosures do not - so far - involve murder. But they do reveal at the very least a sordid dirty tricks campaign against the ANC. It is not the work of one or two rogue elements in the security services - the excuse which Mr de Klerk continues to offer, despite evidence from the commission of top-level sanction for the plot. The campaign was the responsibility of what the commission describes as a large operations unit of military intelligence. Among its employees was a former police officer with two convictions for murder, apparently selected on the recommendation of Mr de Klerk's chief of staff for intelligence. Greater involvement It remains hard to accept that Mr de Klerk personally sanctioned these tactics. But in the light of the latest information, he must now acknowledge high level involvement. Unless he acts, he will imperil the negotiating process he initiated. As Judge Goldstone made clear on Monday, 'no successful and constructive multiparty negotiations are likely to be held in the present climate of mutual suspicion and distrust . . . No investment will take place until a democratic and peaceful climate has been created.' If Mr de Klerk is to restore his credibility, he should first acknowledge that state involvement in political violence is greater than he realised. He must then give greater powers and more support to the commission, which lacks the resources for its task. The UN secretary general was so persuaded of the centrality of the issue of violence that he recommended to the Security Council in August that the Goldstone commission investigate the army and police, as well as Umkhonto we Sizwe (the ANC's military wing) and other political armies in South Africa. The secretary general urged Pretoria to provide finance for such inquiries, and government agreed in principle that they should take place. Speedy response Resources have not been forthcoming. Hundreds of files discovered during the recent raid cannot be investigated for lack of funds. Judge Goldstone also complains that he has not had sufficient co-operation from the parties concerned to do his job properly. The international community can at least assist with resources. British legal experts and police officers have already played an important role in the investigation of Boipatong. Judge Goldstone's appeal for further help deserves a speedy response. Armed with the evidence, Mr de Klerk should initiate a purge of the security forces. No one underestimates the scale of this task. The extent and influence of the right-wing in the services is far from clear. There is no certainty that, should it reach the stage of confrontation between reformers and conservatives in the military ranks, the latter will be defeated. Mr de Klerk's resolve should be stiffened by the realisation that there is no alternative. Unless he purges the rotten elements in the security forces, they will destroy the transition to democracy which he himself launched some three years ago.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLUS FOR NEGATIVE  </P> <P> While Kass' explanation of a lower start rate and actual higher interest rate  being charged was correct, the additional features and benfits of this type of  loan were omitted.  </P> <P> With negative amortization, the borrower can pay the lower initial monthly  payment based on let's say 7 1/2% or 8 1/2%, but has the option to pay the  difference if the rate being charged is higher, to use the article's example  "10% or 11%."  </P> <P> This allows homeowners to meet the needs of their monthly cash-flow  expenditures.  </P> <P> Additionally, this type of a loan offers many payment options, another one  being paying a loan off in full, that was originally written for 40 years in 15  years. Furthermore, this type of loan may have a built-in feature to access  equity in the future.  </P> <P> And last, but certainly not least, principle reduction of an adjustable-rate  loan can also afford a lower payment. Unlike fixed-rate loans, where the  payment remains the same. If a borrower were to make a lump sum payment on  their loan, let's say $5,000 or $10,000, when the loan is re-amortized, the  payment will be based on only the remaining principle.  </P> <P> MARIA SKELLIE  </P> <P> Regional manager,  </P> <P> American Savings Bank  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

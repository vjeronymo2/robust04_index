			<p>CSO     [Text] Seoul (NAEWOE) -- Having established three laws  including "The Foreigners' Investment Law" last October, North  Korea, which has recently been actively pursuing economic  cooperation with foreign countries, established three more laws  including "The Foreign Exchange Control Law" last February to  complement the system related to investment. But it appears to  have failed to realize the anticipated results, as usual, due to  the poor investment climate and imperfect laws.    More than one year after the laws related to foreigners'  investments were established, the economic trade group of Nampo  City, North Korea, visited the Korean Autonomous Government of  Yanbian on the 11th of the month, calling for economic trade and  joint ventures. Even last July, Pak Hwa-ryong, Vice-Chairman of  Administrative Economic Committee of North Hamkyong Province is  said to have visited here to explain the construction of the  Chongjin-Najin and Chongjin-Hoeryong Expressways. This means  North Korea devotes all its energies to expanding the social  overhead capital to invite foreign investment. In addition, it  concluded with China an "Economic Trade Cooperation Protocol"  the gist of which is to activate border trade, etc., and an  "Agreement to Construct Railroads and Harbors on the Tumen," and  made a contract for the development of the Najin-Sonbong area  which will cost $100 million and involve 21 Russian enterprises,  they say.    Since the Cooperation Law was established in 1984, North  Korea has been said to explain the inactivity of foreign  investment as due not only to the poor infrastructure but also  to the imperfect investment system. Accordingly, as measures  following the three Laws, the "Foreigners' Investment Law,"  "Joint Venture Law," and "Foreigners' Enterprise Law," which  were established last year, North Korea established the  "Foreigners' Investment Enterprise and Foreigners' Tax Law,"  "Foreign Exchange Control Law," and "Free Economic Trade Zone  Law" last February to invite foreign investment, they say. But  North Korea's laws on foreign investment are abstract and  mutually inconsistent--possibly the general trend of socialist  states' laws. The three laws established at the beginning of  this year are also seen as more logically complemented and  followed by additional legislative measures.    Foreigners' Investment Enterprise and Foreigners' Tax Law  (Chapter 8, Article 57). This is a basic law related to taxes  which should be paid by foreigners' investment enterprises or  foreigners performing economic activities within the North  Korean territory. It prescribes income-, property-,  inheritance-, sales-, and local taxes, as well as related  sanctions and exemptions. Because this law has many points  conflicting with established cooperation companies' and  foreigners' income tax laws and their detailed rules, some  provisions of the law seem to lose their validity on the  principle of the priority of the new law.    The causes of inactivity are inconsistent laws and poor  infrastructure. North Korea levies graduated income tax rates on  foreign enterprises -- 25% (general area) and 14%  (free  economic trade zone) of the settled rate of interest. It is  known that the law levies lower tax rates than those (30%  and  15%) of China, which it views as a rival. And it  prescribes  that foreigners staying more than one year pay personal income  tax on income from outside as well as inside the territory  (Article 17). Although North Korea has more favorable tax rates  on enterprises than does China, it levies more unfavorable  income tax rates on private persons. This seems to negatively  influence foreign investment plans.    Property tax is levied on buildings, ships and aircraft in  North Korea (Article 25). Inheritance tax is levied not only  inside but outside of North Korea (Article 31). This seems to be  a step to confiscate assets that residents repatriate from Japan  and those of Japanese wives residing in North Korea who inherit  from their families in Japan. But as the provisions of the law  apply to "Korean residents residing outside the territory of the  Republic who perform economic activities within its territory,"  questions are raised as to whether the provisions apply to South  Korean enterprises. Because North Korea has thus far insisted  politically on the concept of "One Korea," the territory of the  "Republic" as the whole Korean peninsula, some say that South  Korea is included in the territory of the "Republic." In the  Cooperation Law, the first law related to foreign investment,  its application is to be limited to "foreign enterprises and  individuals" and "Korean residents abroad including Korean  merchants and industrialists in Japan," clearly eliminating  South Korean enterprises from participation. But in the laws on  foreigners' investments established after last year, the subject  of application, unlike the Cooperation Law, is prescribed to be  "Korean residents residing outside of the territory of the  Republic." Accordingly, a dominant opinion is that it allows  South Korean enterprises (and individuals) to participate. A  noticeable problem is how North Korea interprets this in  connection with the idea of "One Korea."    In addition, even if South Korean enterprises are subject to  the laws in the same way as foreign enterprises, a question is  raised as to which of the two, the North-South Fundamental  Agreement or these laws, is applied to South Korean enterprises  when the North levies taxes. It is prescribed in the laws that  foreign enterprises and individuals should observe the agreement  concluded by their government and North Korea's government on  taxes when the agreement is different from the laws (Article  17). In relation to this provision, when the North-South Joint  Economic Cooperation Committee concludes agreements on dual  taxation prevention and investment promotion, will such an  exception in the laws be applied even to South Korean  enterprises?    Because the North-South Fundamental Agreement is applicable,  the North and South are in "a special relationship which is not  one between nations." If South Korean enterprises are not  subject to the exceptional provision (Article 17) of the law due  to the special relationship, they may have more unfavorable  liability to taxation than other countries.    Free Economic Trade Zone Law (Chapter 7, Article 43). This  is  a basic law that regulates foreign investment in the  Najin-Sonbong area, which is called a small golden triangle, and  another free economic trade zone which will be designated in the  future. The law prescribes the authority and duties of an agency  to manage the area, maintenance of circumstances for economic  activities, tariffs, currency, finance, security and preference,  and settlement of disputes, etc. The law reflects North Korea's  intentions to make good use of the free economic trade zone as a  window for opening their economy by bestowing tax privileges on  business activities and opening up foreign exchange markets to  foreigners within the zone. The law stipulates that the  organizations which develop and manage the zone are the Foreign  Economic Committee of the central government and the local  authorities. By the suggestion that the central government is  one organization which controls and leads the open-economy  policy, it has been made clear what organization takes charge of  the policy.    Because the law mandates that foreign enterprises should,  even in the zone, employ and dismiss manpower on contracts made  with North Korean manpower supply organizations, inflexibility  of labor management has been raised as a major potential  problem. And every account must settled in Korean "Won" or  convertible foreign currency. This will mean North Korea will  aim at collecting foreign currency.    Foreign Exchange Control Law (Chapter 4, Article 31). This  law outlines the general rules and system of foreign currency  transactions, foreign securities issues, movement of foreign  currency in and out of the country, securities and precious  metals, etc.    Carrying foreign currency into the country is not limited.  But approval by the foreign currency management agency is  required for its removal, except for currency reported when  entering the country and foreign currency within the free  economic trade zone. This seems to be aimed at increasing  foreign exchange reserves.    Foreign investment enterprises are strictly required to keep  accounts with the Trade Bank or banks designated by the foreign  currency management agency and report their foreign exchange  situation to the agency quarterly and annually. This system  means that foreign enterprises should raise their necessary  foreign exchange by exporting or borrowing from foreign  countries, and they cannot systematically convert Korean Won  profit made in the domestic market to hard currency.    Even in the three laws established this year, there appears  the intention of North Korea to carry forward only "an open-door  policy under strict control," under the closed and rigid  structure as usual. Even if the laws related to foreign  investment are improved, as long as the economic structure and  system are not reformed, the investment climate will not  materialize, and accordingly, the success of an open-economy  policy cannot be expected.</p>

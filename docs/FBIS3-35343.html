The police on Saturday launched sweeps targeting Abu-Nidal's  banned Fatah-Revolutionary Council movement, arresting fifteen  persons and closing a trade office, the source told AFP.    The crackdown was decided after the Lebanese authorities had  proved that Abu-Nidal's group was behind the killing of Jordan's  embassy first secretary in Beirut, Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, on  January 29, the sources added.    Documents and propaganda leaflets were found in the trade  office, located in the al-'Abdali neighborhood of the capital  Amman.    Investigations are underway to determine if there is enough  evidence to put the 15 on trial, the source said.    Most of the suspects have had already spent time in prison  in  the 1970s for their links to Abu-Nidal's group.    King Husayn on Feb 13 accused an Arab country of having  ordered an extremist group whose leader lives in that country to  carry out the murder. The king did not name the country but a  Jordanian source said he was referring to Libya.    Tripoli has denied these accusations.</p>

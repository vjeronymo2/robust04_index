			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Voters exact revenge for 'betrayal': Philip Stephens explains the swing from the Tories in Christchurch IT WAS lost before it started. The seething discontent which cost Mr John Major his party's 15th-safest seat in the early hours of this morning was obvious from the outset of the Christchurch by-election campaign. Two thirds of the electors of the sleepy seaside constituency in east Dorset voted Conservative at the general election only 15 months ago. This week these once-loyal footsoldiers of southern Toryism were set on one thing above all else - to exact revenge on a government that had broken its promises. The word heard most frequently on the doorsteps of the neat suburban bungalows and the grander middle-class villas strung across the constituency was 'betrayal'. The prime minister had promised them that their support on April 9 1992 would bring economic recovery on April 10. Instead the recession had dragged for another year. Even now they were suspicious of the evidence that the upturn is at last a reality. They had been told that Mr Major, like his predecessor, would cut their taxes. Instead he had put them up - and done so in a way that which penalised those on modest if not low incomes. Pace Mr Norman Lamont, the imposition of value added tax on domestic heating may yet be destined to find a place in the history books as one of the biggest political blunders of modern times. Those two betrayals might not have been enough of themselves to overturn the 23,000 majority bequeathed by the charming individualist, the late Robert Adley. But overlaying them was widespread disaffection at all the government's policies. Mr Major was perceived as weak, his party as divided and self-indulgent. Rising crime rates have infuriated a population with more than its fair share of the vulnerable elderly. Even Mr Major's promise of another burst of privatisation and deregulation raised hackles. The voters of Christchurch do not want their local stores driven out of business by Sunday-opening hypermarkets, their sub-post offices sacrificed on the altar of free-market efficiency, their rail services privatised. The message from ministers this morning will be that this was a mid-term protest. Governments rarely win by-elections - and never at the tail-end of a recession. Downing Street has already rehearsed its response. Ministers will insist that the outcome reflected the past rather than the future. Mr Major has put behind him the civil war over Maastricht which so gravely damaged his political authority. The sunlit uplands of economic recovery beckon. To an extent they are right. Few expect Mrs Diana Maddock, the studiously dull Liberal Democrat MP, to hold the seat beyond the next general election. Look, after all, at what happened to the victors in the last parliament of Eastbourne, Ribble Valley, and Kincardine and Deeside. There were special circumstances also. The peculiar make-up of the constituency - about a third of the population are above pensionable age - proved particularly fertile ground for opposition 'scare stories' about plans for new NHS prescription charges and hotel fees for hospital stays. The retired and near-retired of Christchurch - not rich but sufficiently well-off not to qualify for state benefits - will suffer more than most the impact of high domestic fuel charges. But Mr Major should beware of believing his own excuses. The campaign in Christchurch has shown how detached the government has become from its own traditional supporters among the lower middle classes. The prime minister is perceived as weak and ineffective even by paid-up members of his own party. These greying classes are represent one of the most powerful interest groups in the southern, and particularly south-western, English constituencies that the Conservatives must win to remain in government. In the county council elections and in the Newbury by-election in May, and again yesterday, they defected to the Liberal Democrats in huge numbers. Mr Paddy Ashdown's party remains one of local rather than national politics. But it is beginning to put down roots across a swathe of territory vital to the Conservatives. If he is to survive, Mr Major will have to listen to the electors of Christchurch.</p>

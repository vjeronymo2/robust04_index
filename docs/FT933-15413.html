			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / G7 agrees Dollars 3bn Russian fund: Compromise package aims to help privatisation and support reform THE WORLD'S leading industrialised nations yesterday provisionally agreed a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) fund to help Russian privatisation as President Boris Yeltsin arrived in Tokyo for the end of their summit. The fund, to be disbursed over the next 18 months, was put together under US leadership by Group of Seven finance ministers from a mixture of new funds and money already committed to other programmes. It represents a compromise between the original Dollars 4bn proposed by the US and calls by Japan and the European Community for more modest initial help. The fund was proposed by President Bill Clinton at the US-Russian summit in Vancouver in April as an addition to a Dollars 43bn package of aid, loans and debt rescheduling. The package, intended to help privatise Russia's large communist-era state companies, is an attempt to demonstrate support for Russian reforms without digging too deeply into western pockets. Most G7 countries are pleading recession and budget constraints of their own. The Dollars 3bn includes Dollars 1bn in western credits for Russian enterprises to import western capital equipment, Dollars 500m in technical assistance from G7 countries, and a further Dollars 500m from the World Bank for aiding areas which have been particularly dependent on state-owned enterprises for public services. A further Dollars 1bn will come from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank and its private investment arm, the International Finance Corporation. Mr Clinton last night called the package 'a real success' and complimented European willingness to 'come forward'. Mr Larry Summers, the US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs and a strong backer of the fund, called it a 'shot in the arm' for Russia's mass privatisation programme. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, warned that ways would be sought to tie the assistance to progress with economic reform. But he said there was little point in strengthening the Russian private sector unless the country gained better access to western markets - an issue which Mr Yeltsin intends to raise when he meets G7 leaders today. In response to western and Russian complaints that aid is not being delivered efficiently, the G7 countries plan to set up a system for co-ordinating it through representatives of their embassies in Moscow. The new fund gives the embattled Russian leader a tangible result to take home, despite the rejection of his request to sign the political communique issued by the G7 leaders yesterday. In a letter sent to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, a week before the summit, Mr Yeltsin said issuing the statement with Russia's signature would be 'an important testimony that the co-operative relationship between Russia and the G7 was not stalemated but qualitatively developed'.

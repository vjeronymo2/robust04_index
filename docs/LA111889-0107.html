			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TASK FORCE ON ALTERNATE FREEWAY ROUTES URGED  </P> <P> South Pasadena officials have asked the state Department of Transportation to  establish an independent task force to consider alternatives to building the  last link of the Long Beach Freeway.  </P> <P> The City Council, with the support of the National Trust for Historic  Preservation, made the request in a letter sent this week to Robert Best,  director of the department. A Caltrans spokesman said Friday that the letter  had not yet arrived.  </P> <P> The council criticized Caltrans for not extensively considering options such as  light rail and partial completion of the freeway gap that exists between the  San Bernardino and Foothill freeways.  </P> <P> Under the city's proposal, the study of the freeway expansion -- which would  cut through Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra and Los Angeles' El Sereno  neighborhood -- would be conducted by experts from outside the state.  </P></p>

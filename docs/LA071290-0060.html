			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: JUST THE RECIPE FOR DRESSING UP PICNICS  </P> <P> Those who prefer meatless meals have a tough time adapting summer barbecue  menus to their taste. Most commercial soy dogs are full of fat, and the old  picnic standby -- avocado, cheese and sprout sandwich -- just isn't fun enough.  Here's an option -- a menu built around burger-shaped falafel that can be  cooked over coals or in a conventional oven.  </P> <P>  MENU  </P> <P> Cool Cantaloupe Soup  </P> <P> Grilled Falafel  </P> <P> Pita Pockets or Whole-Wheat Burger Buns  </P> <P> Mixed Green Salad  </P> <P> Spinach Raita Fresh Fruit  </P> <P> GRILLED FALAFEL  </P> <P> 2 new potatoes, cooked and peeled  </P> <P> 2 cups cooked garbanzo beans  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons tahini  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon yogurt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup soft whole-wheat bread crumbs  </P> <P> 1 red onion, finely chopped  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, grated  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon ground cumin  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon paprika  </P> <P> Dash cayenne pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup minced cilantro leaves  </P> <P> 6 pita pockets or whole-wheat hamburger buns  </P> <P> Cumin Sauce  </P> <P> Alfalfa sprouts  </P> <P> Mash together potatoes, garbanzo beans, tahini, yogurt, bread crumbs, onion,  garlic, cumin, paprika, cayenne and cilantro.

Bake at 375 degrees 10 minutes on 1 side, then turn and  bake 5 minutes on other side. Or, grill on fine mesh over electric barbecue or  hot coals, about 10 minutes, turning to brown both sides.

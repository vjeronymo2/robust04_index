			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Now it's time to stop and think - The ascent has been dramatic and the analysts are bullish, but . . . / Equities THE CHART says it all. From Mexico to Germany, not a negative mark in sight in terms of total sterling return for the first quarter of the year. Equities have been humming right across the world, with some quite exceptional performances in many markets, not least Hong Kong, Singapore and Sweden, each showing a return of more than 30 per cent. The world investment market, excluding the United Kingdom, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Index, showed a January-March sterling return of more than 22 per cent. The UK itself produced a 17 per cent return. Suddenly, it seems, spring has come to the investment air. The suggestion in this space in the last Review, that good bargains were to be had in many markets, but notably in the UK, Spain, France, Germany and Japan, has been proved right, with gains ranging from a relatively modest (given the cost and problems of creating a single country) 5 per cent for Germany to almost 28 per cent in Spain. The advance continued into the first trading days of the present quarter. London, as measured by the Footsie index, had new highs on three successive days earlier this month. A number of major markets hit a 1991 high in the first week of April, including France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and Austria. The global stock-market advance took many fund managers and individual investors by surprise, and was certainly more rapid than expected. Markets continued to show their preference for declining inflation, and may even continue to rise in the face of somewhat disappointing corporate-earnings prospects. Caution says that the sharp rise in the 1991 first quarter must lead to a pause, and a number of uncertainties do remain - not least the political situation in the Soviet Union, which is seen as having a particular influence on the German market. Yet Goldman Sachs is almost lyrical in its World Investment Strategy Highlights for April. 'We remain of the view that global equity markets are at the 'beginning of the matter'. The 20 per cent advance from their lows marks what we believe to be the beginning of a global equity bull market. The move, coming as it does at a time of historically low and declining inflation and interest rates, is wholly consistent with prior bull-market advances.' The herd instinct is in full bull-run, and this is always a time for some hesitation. Most analysts are suddenly pointing towards an investment nirvana - so it may be the moment to check that the lifeboats are available if needed, or at least to test the waters selectively. To expect the first quarter's global gains of more than 20 per cent to continue throughout the year seems a risky forecast.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MILITARY HELD RELUCTANT TO ACT ON PANAMA INCIDENTS  </P> <P> U.S. troops in Panama have been subjected to abductions and beatings, but U.S.  military officials reportedly are reluctant to respond to avoid confrontation  with Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, a military newspaper said Sunday.  </P> <P> The Army Times, an independent weekly, said U.S. military personnel in Panama  have been involved in hundreds of incidents with Panamanian troops over the  last year, ranging from detentions without charge and beatings to treaty  violations and intrusions on U.S. installations.  </P> <P> Quoting current and former officials, the newspaper said that "despite an  escalating pattern of harassment against U.S. military personnel and their  families, high-ranking military officials have sought to downplay the extent of  the incidents in order to avoid a new confrontation" with Noriega.  </P> <P> Noriega, under indictment in the United States on drug-trafficking charges,  withstood the Reagan Administration's effort last year to force him from  office.  </P> <P> The Army Times quoted Elliott Abrams, who was President Ronald Reagan's chief  Central American policy-maker in the State Department, as saying that Joint  Chiefs Chairman William J. Crowe Jr. has tried to "bury the incidents to  achieve a business-as-usual relationship with Noriega."  </P> <P> A Crowe spokesman, Col. William Smullen, told the newspaper that "the chairman  has chosen to deal with it in a more private way."  </P> <P> The newspaper said one of the most recent and violent incidents involved Navy  petty officer Mike Nieves, who told the newspaper he was detained, beaten and  threatened with death.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAL STOCK OFF $56; WOLF TRIES TO REVISE BID  </P> <P> UAL Corp. shares plunged more than $56 Monday as the airline's pilots and  managers worked to revise their failed $6.75-billion offer for the parent of  United Airlines.  </P> <P> The steep drop in UAL's shares followed the announcement Friday that the  employee group, led by UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, had not been able to raise  the $4.2 billion needed to buy the company. The news triggered a sharp decline  in the stock market Friday, and UAL's shares fell $5.50 that day before trading  was halted. UAL shares closed Monday at $222.88.  </P> <P> Airline industry analysts and professional stock speculators said in interviews  Monday that they expected the Wolf group to make a new offer for the company.  Some said they anticipated that the new offer would be a combination of cash  and securities worth about $240 a share.  </P> <P> Wall Street traders said they believed that a new offer would emerge because  Wolf and other top UAL officers stand to make huge profits in a takeover. The  employee group had offered $300 a share for the company, and Wolf's UAL stock  and options were worth around $76 million at that price. "I can't see Wolf give  up all that profit," one trader said.  </P> <P> News reports from Tokyo early this morning said several large Japanese banks  are willing to finance the UAL transaction on new terms. The report in Nihon  Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese business journal, said Citibank had presented eight  large Japanese banks a revised offer that involved a lower purchase price for  UAL shares and larger fees for the banks.  </P> <P> Many banks in the United States and Japan balked at the terms for the failed  UAL deal because they included skimpy fees for the banks and involved loading  too much debt on the airline. At a lower price, UAL would be able to take on  less debt to complete the transaction. Citibank and Chase Manhattan are acting  as lead banks on the UAL deal.  </P> <P> According to the report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Citibank said the Wolf group  would lower its bid to $250 a share, reducing the amount it would need to  borrow to $6.1 billion from $7.2 billion. The report also said the banks could  raise the interest rate on the loan to 2.5% above the rate that banks charge  each other, known as LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate. Originally, the  rate was to be 2% above LIBOR.  </P> <P> Citibank refused to comment on the report, and an adviser to United's pilots  said there was no new deal. "If Citibank is doing that, they are feeling out  the Japanese banks to see what is acceptable to them," said Stuart I. Oran, a  lawyer with the New York firm of Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.  "There is no revised deal."  </P> <P> Oran said United's pilots and management had discussed various changes in the  transaction, but he would not describe them. Oran said that the Wolf group is  not looking for another partner. "That is one thing we have not discussed," he  said.  </P> <P> Some airline industry analysts speculated that the Wolf group might look for  another equity investor to make the transaction more acceptable to possible  lenders. British Airways was to supply $750 million, more than three-quarters  of the equity.  </P> <P> Daniel Hersch, an analyst with the Los Angeles investment firm of Bateman  Eichler, Hill Richards, said it is possible that the United employees might  recruit a partner and reduce their ownership stake to 30% from 75%. However,  under such a scenario, United's employees would no longer control the airline,  and "that might be an issue for United's management," Hersch said.  </P> <P> Mentioned as possible investors in the UAL deal were Los Angeles investor  Marvin Davis and Morgan Stanley, the New York investment house. Davis triggered  the bidding for UAL in August by offering $240 a share. Davis was studying the  situation Monday.  </P> <P> Analysts said a lower bid by the Wolf group would probably mean that British  Air could reduce its contribution. British Air said Monday that it was  "reviewing its position" regarding the UAL bid "together with the other  participants."  </P> <P> In an interview Monday, an officer with Chase Manhattan said the $300-a-share  bid for UAL fell apart because of concerns from lenders about the fees and  doubts about United's financial projections. Thomas G. Labreque, president and  chief operating officer for Chase Manhattan, defended the deal. "The cash flows  in this deal were quite good," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Bates in Washington contributed to this story.  </P></p>

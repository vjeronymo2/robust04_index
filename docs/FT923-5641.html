			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Crashing the money gears THE DESIGNERS of Europe's monetary engine insist that everything is working as usual. It is not. The links to the rest of the world are changing chaotically; the ride is uncomfortable; and ambitious plans for the future are apparently being questioned by the French passengers. Change may be on the way. Exchange rates convert nominal values in one currency into their equivalents in another. A fixed exchange rate is like a fixed gear. Economies that are credibly linked via a fixed exchange rate must share a single rate of monetary acceleration or deceleration. When an exchange rate floats, the gear constantly changes. Economies linked by a floating exchange rate can have independent monetary policy, as the US and Germany show today. For 20 years exchange rates among the three largest market economies - the US, Japan and Germany - have floated. At times the float has been almost completely free. At times it has been managed. But there has been nothing similar to the fixed rate regime established at Bretton Woods or, more recently, by the European Monetary System. Floating exchange rates have allowed a US obsessed with the need for recovery, unconcerned about inflation and weighed down by debt to co-exist with a Germany in the turmoil of unification and suffering from serious conflicts between the government and the Bundesbank. A 3 per cent discount rate in the US can co-exist with a 9 3/4 per cent Lombard rate in Germany. Disappointment that the US economy is not growing fast enough can co-exist with German disappointment that inflation is not falling quickly enough. But something must adjust. The something has been the exchange rate, down to a low of DM 1.40 this week. Since the US and Germany will not agree to the same monetary policy, currency adjustment is inevitable. For both sides, that adjustment has even been desirable: expansionary for the US and disinflationary for the Germans. But this does not mean that they have both shifted back to the benign neglect of the Reagan years. In the last resort, intervention will be backed up by willingness to modify monetary policy. When that becomes obvious, intervention is likely to be successful. Co-operation unlikely Nevertheless, it is most unlikely that either the US or the Germans will be willing to return to the close co-ordination seen between 1985 and 1987, at least in the near future. The plight of what is fundamentally the world's strongest economy, Japan, shows how right they are to be cautious. In the second half of the 1980s Japan subordinated its monetary policy to exchange rate stability more completely than either the US or Germany. The severity of the subsequent domestic destabilisation is revealed by the rise in the stock market to its peak of 38,916 in January 1990 and subsequent fall to a low of 14,309 last week. The latest and the most significant official response has been this week's emergency plan. Investors are encouraged, with the index jumping back to 17,971 by yesterday's close. The divergence between the US and Germany has put other European currencies under severe pressure, notably the Italian lira and the pound sterling, the former at its floor yesterday and the latter less than one pfennig above it. Lack of credibility European countries have fixed their monetary gears. True, the ERM bands provide a small amount of flexibility. More important in creating policy divergence has been the lack of credibility of the ERM linkage. But weak credibility is not helpful. It means that monetary policy must be even tighter than Germany's. With its discount rate already at 13 1/4 per cent, the Italians know the problem well. The Swedes, forced to raise interest rates by 3 percentage points this week, have learned the same thing, even though they are merely shadowing the D-Mark while still outside the ERM. The UK may also be forced to raise interest rates above the German level. A currency linked to the D-Mark must have the same monetary policy as the Bundesbank. One way out is to break the link. But for Mr Lamont and his European colleagues, this remains unthinkable. Another is for the G7 to co-ordinate monetary policies more closely, but neither the US nor the Germans are in a hugely co-operative mood. Yet another is for the markets to change their minds, something markets are prone to do. Last but not least, as weak currencies reach their limits, ERM rules could force the Bundesbank to intervene too. But this would also undermine German monetary policy. The question is whether the German government would back the Bundesbank in its preference for a realignment or other European governments in their desire for a laxer German monetary policy. Either way, there could be an almighty row. With the French referendum looking more likely to be unfavourable to European union, Europe's monetary machine is under stress, perhaps to breaking point.</p>

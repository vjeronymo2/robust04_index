			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Observer: Striking out Life begins at 60 - and for no one more so than George Mitchell. Consider the cornucopia of job opportunities now on offer to the 60-year-old Democrat from Maine, the Senate majority leader whose decision not to seek certain re-election this year caused many in Washington to believe he had gone nuts. Bill Clinton clearly wants him to serve on the Supreme Court, where there is an immediate vacancy and for which, as a politician and former federal judge, he is eminently qualified. Whether or not he passes up on the opportunity this time round, he could still be the next chief justice, if William Rehnquist hangs up his robe before the next election. He could also easily be the next secretary of state whenever Warren Christopher moves on, especially now that the once-heir apparent Strobe Talbott has a bit of a blotted copybook. This would neatly square a circle, since in 1980 Mitchell took over the Senate seat of his Maine mentor, Ed Muskie, who replaced Cy Vance at Foggy Bottom. Baseball wants him to be its commissioner, another vacant slot. An ardent fan, Mitchell is tempted, but points out that managing 30 megalomaniac team-owners might be harder work than managing 99 megalomaniac senators. With these prospects, it must come as a relief to Messrs Lubbers, Brittan et al that Mitchell has not yet expressed an interest in a certain position in Brussels.</p>

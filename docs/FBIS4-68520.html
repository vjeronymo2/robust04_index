			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Hajji Akbar Turadzhonzoda by Dododzhoni </F> Atovullo: "Leader of the Tajik Opposition on an Official Visit"]    [Text] Hajji Akbar Turadzhonzoda, a leader of the  Tajik opposition, arrived in Moscow from Pakistan on 17 April.  He granted NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA an interview right at the  airport.    [Atovullo] Esteemed Turadzhonzoda, you were elected head of  the official Tajik opposition delegation at the negotiations  with the Dushanbe leadership. The intensive negotiations are  into their third week now, but you have only just arrived in  Moscow....    [Turadzhonzoda] I would have been the first in Moscow had it  not been for the sly conduct of the Dushanbe leadership, which  did everything possible to put off the negotiations or to stymie  them altogether. And it was only thanks to the efforts of the  United Nations and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that  the negotiations began. But even here Dushanbe thought up a  dodge, sending to Moscow a representative of an inappropriate  level.    [Atovullo] You mean the representative nature of the  delegation?    [Turadzhonzoda] Of course. It is stupid negotiating with  those who do not represent a real political force in the  Dushanbe leadership. Or does the minister of labor, who is the  head of the delegation, have influence on the republic's  military formations?    [Atovullo] Nonetheless, the negotiations are under way. At  an  inappropriate level, but they are under way. You are undoubtedly  informed as to what is happening in Moscow. How do you evaluate  the progress of the negotiations.    [Turadzhonzoda] I would not want to evaluate the  negotiations  until they are completed: each day could produce both positive  and negative results. But merely the fact that the negotiations  have come about is an undoubted achievement. Hope, albeit  fragile, has appeared for the Tajik people. I have to say that  the opposition was insisting on negotiations for a year (NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA wrote about this repeatedly, incidentally).  Fruitlessly. And now, when the negotiations have become a  reality, I have to mention the fact that ALL the demands of the  opposition, which were made at the end of last year even, are  part of the agenda. I believe that this points to the  constructive nature of our position.    [Atovullo] What does your visit signify? Will you take part  in the negotiations?    [Turadzhonzoda] The main purpose of my coming here is to  meet  with politicians of Russia. It is very important for us to  explain our positions and plans in a direct dialogue. I believe  that we will succeed in personal discussions altering somewhat  the "face of the opposition" which exists in the consciousness  of Moscow.    A solution of the Tajik question is the key to a settlement  of the conflict situation in Central Asia. This means the lives  of hundreds of thousands of people. We recognize Russia's great  role in a solution of this question and are sure that its  geopolitical interests are directed at the restoration of peace  and stability in the region. The opposition--and this means, it  has to be said, a large part of the population of  Tajikistan--wishes to have good-neighbor relations with Russia.    As far as the negotiations are concerned, one thing is  clear:  If the top persons of the government of Dushanbe come to Moscow,  we will be prepared to take part in them.    [Atovullo] The conflicts on the Tajik-Afghan border have  been  incessant and the shelling of the Russian border posts have  continued in the course of the negotiations. Dushanbe officials  explain this by the fact that the opposition is endeavoring in  this way to frustrate the negotiations. How do you see this  situation?    [Turadzhonzoda] I will say at once that we have always been  for not a single shot being heard on Tajik land.    Now about the clashes on the border. Yes, I have heard  Dushanbe's version. I have heard also that some people are  maliciously whispering: What's the point of negotiating with  them if they cannot control their field commanders.    But, first, why are Dushanbe officials looking only at the  border? Far more people are dying in the streets of the towns  and villages. The official authorities not only do not control  the armed forces but are even encouraging their punitive  functions.    As far as the opposition is concerned, it fully controls all  armed formations, which, you will agree, is very, very  difficult. And it is not only a question of distances and the  lack of dependable communications. The main thing is the  hopelessness. People who have lost hope of returning to the  homeland are uncontrollable. Hungry, sick, mourning dead  brothers and fathers.    But give them just an ounce of hope! I am sure that after an  agreement on national reconciliation and a mutual cease-fire  agreement have been signed, not a single shot will be heard on  the part of the opposition.    [Atovullo] In the opinion of many analysts, part of the  leadership of Dushanbe is decidedly against any negotiations  with the opposition. Could this matter be settled without  negotiations, in your view?    [Turadzhonzoda] Negotiations are not a theatrical  performance, in which the participants show off their costumes  and subtlety of intellect or lack of it.    Negotiations are an exchange of thoughts, they are  concessions and compromise, but, what is most important, all  negotiations lead to a "change of seats." Understandably, if  they are successful, many people will face a sad parting with  their chairs. This is why these many people are attempting to  stymie the negotiations and turn them into a theatrical  performance. Only they are forgetting that the "spectators" of  this performance are the hungry and sick, are being shot at and  bombed....    Dushanbe officials, of course, are presenting the  negotiations as the result of their wise and peace-loving  policy. With a single hope: The negotiations will pass, and the  authorities will remain as they were before. They simply cannot  understand that the negotiations are already a political  reality. You cannot be a little bit pregnant, as the Dushanbe  authorities are hoping. There will either be the child of peace,  whom everyone is awaiting. Or surgical intervention will be  necessary--and this will once again mean blood....    I believe that difficult times have come for both parties.  We  have to fight against ourselves, our ambitions and illusions.  For the sake of our people. For the sake of peace.    We have a chance. No one would ever forgive us were we to  let  it slip. There is no alternative to the negotiations.</p>

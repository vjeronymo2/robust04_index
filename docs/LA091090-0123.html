			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLACK STATES TO REVIEW S. AFRICA ATHLETIC STATUS  </P> <P> Representatives from the black African states are to meet next month to discuss  the readmission of South Africa to the world of international athletics, an  IAAF official said today.  </P> <P> Speaking after a two-day weekend meeting of the International Amateur Athletic  Federation Council, the official said South Africa's readmission to the  federation will be discussed at a meeting after the African championships in  Cairo in October.  </P> <P> "If African countries say 'yes,' we have no problem," he said. "But we are not  going to interfere. We just support the meeting."  </P> <P> An IAAF spokesman in London said the Cairo meeting would be followed "as soon  as possible" by talks at the IAAF's African headquarters in Senegal, to which  the South Africans would also be invited.  </P> <P> South Africa was excluded from the IAAF in 1976, part of the almost total  sporting isolation of the country for its apartheid policies.  </P> <P> International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch said last week  that South Africa will be readmitted to the Olympics for the 1996 Games -- and  could even return in time for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Moscow, the Lithuanian soccer team Zalgiris was been ordered not  to tour South Africa in accordance with an international ban on sports ties  with the racially segregated nation.  </P> <P> Vytautas Dirmeikis, secretary of the Lithuanian soccer union, announced the  decision.  </P> <P> "The Zalgiris team will not go to the South African tour," he said. "The final  decision to ban its trip was made by the Lithuanian Soccer Union, the  Lithuanian National Olympic Committee and the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry on  Monday."  </P></p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Total cost of caesarean births in UK is unnecessarily high Sir, Three cheers for Joe Rogaly ('Birth rights and wrongs', September 14). The costs to the taxpayer of unnecessary caesareans is huge. In 1989, a caesarean cost Pounds 1,123, compared with Pounds 363 for a normal delivery (House of Commons Health Committee, Maternity Services, vol 3). Leading research shows little improvement in outcome with a caesarean rate over 7 per cent (Enkin Keirse &amp; Chambers, A Guide to Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth). As some 650,000 women give birth in the UK each year, my guess is that a national caesarean rate of 13 per cent in 1992 may have increased public expenditure by some Pounds 30m. Judging by the evidence heard by the health committee, the medical profession engages in serious anti-competitive practices, in obstructing women's access to midwives. GPs rarely inform women of their right to a home birth with a midwife, referring them straight to hospital and an obstetrician. Some obstetricians threatened women wanting home births with detention under the Mental Health Act unless they agreed to a hospital birth. Others told women that they 'needed' caesareans and had to go into hospital. There, the need for surgery vanished: they delivered normally. The Royal College of Obstetricians gave evidence that its practice was to withhold information on risks of hospital births (though not of home births]) from women.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Liliya Kuznetsova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- "The wave of strikes, which  hit Russia in the first quarter of 1994, began to subside in the  second half of April, when social tension in the work  collectives of most of enterprises, organisations and  institutions of the Russian Federation began to ease," ITAR-TASS  was told by Vladimir Petrov, head of the labour conflicts  service under the Russian Ministry of Labour.    However, according to data released by the foregoing  service,  a pre-strike situation is still in force at separate enterprises  of the petroleum refining and defence industries, in the  agroindustrial complex, and in the mining and metallurgical  industries.    According to Petrov, the miners of Perm region, for  instance,  have still not received the 1.5 billion roubles owed to them by  the state for unpaid wages. The agro-industrial complex of  Orenburg region has not received wages, amounting to 29 billion  roubles, by the beginning of April 1994. Workers of the Dukat  beneficiation [as received] combine, Magadan region, have not  been paid wages for three months running.    As noted by the head of the labour disputes service, the  question of financing defence enterprises is particularly acute  today. According to the Russian State Defence Industry  Committee, the workers of this sector of the economy had  received wages only once in four months, and the state still  owes some such enterprises the wages they should have received  in 1993. Along with demands to pay the owed wages and to  increase their overall earnings, the work collectives of this  sector of the national economy call for the solution of problems  linked with the size of the defence order, with the sale of  military hardware abroad, with the easy crediting of defence  enterprises and their switch-over to the production of civilian  goods.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / A Year of Corruption: Corruption has become so pervasive the practice carries no stigma Italy Anti-corruption investigations have decapitated Italy's post-war political elite and discredited hundreds of businessmen and civil servants. Yet after almost three years of investigations spearheaded by Milan magistrates, the impetus is beginning to wane and public interest to decline. The magistrates' battle to stamp out the worst aspects of corruption is also degenerating into a conflict between the judiciary and the executive branch of government. The most spectacular instance of this conflict is the move by Milan magistrates to incriminate Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the outgoing prime minister, for permitting corrupt practices in his Fininvest business empire. Mr Berlusconi's government countered by sending inspectors from the justice ministry to check on the activities of the Milan magistrature. Mr Berlusconi claims he is the victim of a judicial vendetta and says he has done no wrong. He moreover defends his younger brother, Paolo, who has admitted paying L330bn (Pounds 128m) in bribes to the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to ensure favourable inspections of Fininvest accounts. In one sense Mr Berlusconi is right about the vendetta. Milan magistrates have picked upon him: as owner of Italy's second largest private company, they want to make an example of him in what might be called the second phase of the anti-corruption investigations. The first phase ended with the collapse of the old political parties and the success of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement in the March 1994 general elections. That phase was intended to expose the incestuous and corrupt relationship between business and politics. Businesses funded the political parties with illicit contributions to individuals, internal movements and party secretaries. How much of this money was used for political activities as opposed to lining individual pockets is still a mystery. People have only admitted to what has been proven against them and most of the money was channelled outside the Italian banking system (mostly to Switzerland, Monaco and Luxembourg). In return the businesses were allowed access to state subsidies, were awarded rigged contracts and were protected from external competition. The most detailed expose has concerned the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group which spent more than L150bn (Pounds 58m) between 1989 and 1992 in ensuring political protection. However, the Ferruzzi family and former top executives insist their pay-offs were involuntary - a defence raised by every business involved in corruption scandals. In other words businessmen were the corrupted not the corruptors. The second phase of investigations is intended to demonstrate that the distinction between corruptors and corrupted is spurious. The core proof is emerging from an investigation into the Guardia di Finanza. This involves 50 members of this force plus many prominent business names. The Guardia di Finanza are accused of taking bribes to turn a blind eye to poor or dishonest accounting and in return for low tax assessments. In Italy it is common knowledge most companies keep two sets of books and that tax evasion is widespread. Pervasive corruption is encouraged by large sums of 'grey' money that escape the tax net. If companies pay large bribes they can be dressed up as fake consultancy fees but more simply they are never registered in the formal books. This lack of transparency is encouraged by the existence of a huge criminal world, which has enjoyed a degree of political protection and which needs to launder money on a vast scale and by the fact that the bulk of 'legitimate' business is carried out by very small family concerns which are not easy to monitor. Businesses claim it is simpler to bribe the Guardia than face difficulties. The Milan magistrates argue the businesses have put themselves in a position where they have things they wish to keep quiet and are therefore willing to pay. The magistrates are out to break this relationship and demonstrate that bribing a public servant - one in uniform who polices the most sensitive aspects of the nation's finances  - is a serious crime and not something 'that everyone does'. The Guardia inquiry has shown public servants and businessmen brazenly continuing corrupt activities, even when the nation has been convulsed by corruption scandals. In part this is because corruption has become so pervasive the practice carries no stigma. But people are also encouraged to feel immune from prosecution by judges who have proved corruptible and by a judicial system that can be tied in knots by a jungle of contradictory laws. The issue has perversely become not how to stop the practice but how far the magistrates should be allowed to go in their investigations. The investigative process - let alone the passage through the courts - could last well into the next century. Politically such an open-ended timetable is highly destabilising. Yet any government that seeks to find a political solution risks being accused of letting the thieves go free and undermining any subsequent attempt to impose new moral standards on society.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Airbreak Leisure loses CAA licence as shares are suspended AIRBREAK LEISURE, the tour operator, yesterday had its licence revoked by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority. The company is expected to be placed in administration this morning. Airbreak said last night that Mr David Buchler of Buchler Philips was negotiating with several interested parties and hoped to conclude the sale of the majority of the business this weekend. Airbreak said it was covered by a Pounds 3.97m CAA bond and the 12,000 holiday-makers currently abroad, mostly in Greece and Cyprus, could continue their holidays. It said of those who had booked and paid for future holidays, some would be able to go as planned while others would receive a refund. All Airbreak customers due to leave the UK last night were told to report for their flights as normal. However, 50 customers due to fly to Tenerife from London's Gatwick Airport were last night able to board their flights after paying an additional Pounds 189 each. Airbreak, whose brands include Next Island, Peter Pan Travel and Suntan Tours, specialises in holidays to Greece, Cyprus and the Canary Islands. It is licenced to carry up to 111,626 passengers annually. Airbreak's shares, traded since August 1991 on the Unlisted Securities Market, were suspended yesterday at 3 1/2 p. On September 15, Airbreak reported interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.92m and warned about the full-year outcome. Mr David Lewis, chairman, blamed discounting in the tour market and 'unexpected problems' in Sunsail International, bought for up to Pounds 8m in January and now for sale. He tendered his resignation this month, a move he described the next day as a 'gesture' which was not accepted by the board. Sunsail International, which charters yachts in the Mediterranean, the Caribbean and Thailand, had a separate CAA bond and was not affected by the withdrawal of the Airbreak licence Airbreak came to the USM soon after the collapse of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group, which resulted in a sharp rise in business for other tour operators. Scott's Greys Travel, a coach tour operator based in Darlington, County Durham, has ceased trading and steps are being taken to place it in liquidation. It specialised in short breaks to Euro Disney, Amsterdam and other continental and UK destinations. Mrs Sue Constable, a fair trading officer with Durham County Council, said yesterday the company was not a member of the Association of British Travel Agents, so clients faced losing their money.</p>

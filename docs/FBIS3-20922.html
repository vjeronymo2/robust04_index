The two companies said the alliance was "the result  of an in-depth dialogue, during which both operators have gained  a new vision of their long-standing partnership in a  fast-growing market."    According to the MoU signed by the two operators, each will  hold equal shares of the new company, as yet unnamed.  Initially, the joint venture will build from activities  transferred from existing entities of the two carriers such as  Transpac and its European subsidiaries, and Datex-P in Germany.  Other France Telecom entities, including some units of France  Cables et Radio, and DBT units as well as EUNETCOM, the France  Telecom/DBT value-added services joint venture, will also be  transferred to the joint company.    The company will provide services to multinational  companies.  These will include X.25 switched data, frame relay and Internet  Protocol (IP) services, as well as virtual private data network  services, international end-to-end digital circuits, VSAT  [very-small-aperture terminal] services, international virtual  private voice networks, and other voice value-added services.  These services will use a single backbone network and have  common network management systems.    The company is scheduled to become operational in early 1995  when it will offer competitively-priced services, centralised  billing, one-stop shopping, and global customer support.  Products and services will be marketed under a joint brand name.    The new company will be headquartered in Brussels, with  corporate offices and central operational units in France and  Germany.    During its first year of operation, DBT and France Telecom  expect the new venture to generate revenues of around ECU1.5  billion and to have some 4,000 employees.    The two operators said they viewed the alliance as a "major  undertaking to provide a range of competitive, innovative,  high-value services on a worldwide basis," and said that "access  to the North American and Asia-Pacific markets may be achieved  through cooperation with other partners." Negotiations are  believed to be ongoing with AT&amp;T of the United States.    Formal details of the new global alliance will now be  examined by the European Commission which has yet to decide  whether it falls under its jurisdiction. Most recently, the  Commission said that it could not examine the proposed joint  venture between BT and the United States operator, MCI, under  its 1990 merger regulations because the deal was too small and  instead would examine it under wider European anti-trust rules.    BT's Chairman, Iain Vallance, recently voiced his  disapproval  of the France Telecom/DBT merger. He believes that effective  liberalisation and a regulatory regime which encourages European  companies to develop new technologies to the best advantage can  best be accelerated by a total freedom to compete for  telecommunications services and customers across Europe and is  dismayed that implementation of a European Commission directive  insisting on full telecommunications liberalisation has been  delayed until 1998, with exclusion clauses for some countries.    It is in this context that he disapproves of the prospect of  the merger of DBT's and France Telecom's operations. If such a  merger was allowed to take place before the full liberalisation  across Europe, then it would simply constitute a firmly  entrenched pan-European telecommunications monopoly that is  totally at odds with the European vision of open competition in  a single market, he said.    Announcing the alliance, the two operators said that all the  activities of the new company are in sectors fully opened to  competition and not subject to monopoly control. Furthermore,  these activities will be pursued in total conformity with the  rules of competition defined by the European Commission. They  added that the arrangements would not compromise any existing  bilateral correspondent agreements already established with all  other international carriers.    DBT and France Telecom hope to receive EC Commission  approval  for the merger before the end of March next year.    Prior to the announcement confirming the alliance, the  German  Postal Minister, Wolfgang Boetsch, and Industry Minister Gerard  Longuet of France, welcomed the European operator's plans and  said that they did not infringe upon European competition rules.    In a statement, the German Postal Ministry said: "The plans  should be seen against the backdrop of an alliance and  partnership which could lead to a capital swap as soon as the  legal status of the two firms allows it."    A date for the privatisation of France Telecom has not yet  been decided, while the privatisation of DBT is scheduled to  begin in 1995.    Announcement of the alliance came as European ministers were  meeting in Brussels to discuss the European Commission's  proposals for the liberalisation of the European  telecommunications sector.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks rises to Pounds 8m but cuts pay-out NEWMAN TONKS, the biggest manufacturer in Europe of architectural hardware, hailed a sharp improvement in its US business as the main factor behind an increase in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993. For the period to June 30 1993, compared with the six months ended April 30 1992, turnover rose to Pounds 128.7m (Pounds 109.4m) and the profit came out at Pounds 8.11m (Pounds 6.62m). Earnings per share were 3.73p (3.5p). However, the company is cutting its interim dividend by about one-third from 3.8p to 2.53p and warned that the final would be reduced by a similar amount (last year 5.5p was paid). It explained that the poor market conditions in Britain, where 63 per cent of turnover was earned, meant it could not maintain dividend levels. 'Continuation of the present level of dividend payments, and the consequent burden of irrevocable ACT, would have a detrimental effect on cash flow. Rebasing the dividend at a more affordable level will enable the group to grow at a faster rate.' Operating profits in the US, where two subsidiaries manufacture locks and a third makes timber columns, more than doubled to Pounds 1.97m (Pounds 897,000). Mr Geoff Gahan, chief executive, said stronger sales overseas had helped turnover grow. The improvement had been boosted by currency fluctuations and the devaluation of sterling, he added, citing the success of Tesa, the partly-owned subsidiary in Spain, where the weak peseta had enabled it to export 60 per cent of its output to the US. The strong performance in the US and steady growth in UK operating profit, up to Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.37m), was the result of a two year rationalisation programme in which the workforce had been cut by 18 per cent since 1990 and a number of smaller businesses closed. Although the rationalisation was now complete Mr Gahan said: 'We will not hesitate to cut costs further if necessary.' Net bank borrowings, meanwhile, increased to Pounds 30.5m (Pounds 16.2m). This mainly reflected the final dividend payment for 1992 totalling Pounds 9m, a Pounds 900,000 acquisition in New Zealand and capital expenditure of more than Pounds 5m.</p>

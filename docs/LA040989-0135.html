			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENDA, TIMETABLE SET FOR TALKS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE  </P> <P> Negotiators from 96 countries, including the United States, reached formal  agreement Saturday in Geneva on a detailed agenda and timetable for the most  sweeping set of global trade liberalization talks in history -- with plans to  begin the talks as early as this week.  </P> <P> The accord, which sets the terms for 21 months of hard bargaining over key  trade issues, paves the way for extending international trade rules to 15 new  subject areas, from agriculture and services to investment and intellectual  property, such as patents.  </P> <P> The consensus on the negotiating mandate -- worked out under the aegis of the  Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 96-country compact  that sets and enforces global trading rules -- came after agreement was reached  late Friday on parameters for talks on agricultural trade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Work Into Morning  </P> <P> The negotiators worked into Saturday morning to complete negotiating agendas  covering talks in two other areas -- trade in textiles and limits on temporary  protection to industries that are seriously injured by an unexpected surge of  imports.  </P> <P> The agreement on the negotiating outline clears the way for trade officials to  begin serious bargaining on the substantive issues in the talks. The  negotiations, known formally as the Uruguay Round, are scheduled to come to a  close in December, 1990.  </P> <P> U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills said Saturday in Washington that  the negotiators will "go to work immediately" in Geneva this week to launch the  discussions on key issues. Hills is expected to make several appearances before  Congress this week to explain the process.  </P> <P> Saturday's agreement broke an impasse that has plagued the GATT talks for  months. The negotiators were supposed to have finished the agenda at a  ministerial meeting in Montreal in December, but they broke up in disarray then  because of a stalemate over the farm trade issue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Extend Rules  </P> <P> The United States proposed the broad-scale trade talks in 1982 as a way of  invigorating the world trading system and extending current global rules on  trade practices to cover areas such as agriculture and services, which have not  previously been included.  </P> <P> Under the plan on which participants agreed in 1986, when the Uruguay Round was  launched, the first two years of talks were designed to hammer out the terms of  the negotiations that would take place in 1989 and 1990. That is the phase the  negotiators have completed now.  </P> <P> Hills cautioned Saturday that eliminating more trade barriers, as the  negotiators have pledged to do, would not in itself reduce the United States'  huge trade deficit, but she said it would help bring about a "correction" by  providing "a context of trade expansion."  </P> <P> Hills reiterated that the negotiating countries have put all of their trade  barriers "on the table" for the new trade talks. The United States "is  dedicated to reducing . . . distortions across-the-board if our trading  partners do the same," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Motive to Succeed  </P> <P> She also dismissed suggestions that the trade talks might fail. "There is  enough at stake to cause all parties in the world to want to succeed," she said  at a press conference.  </P> <P> Besides writing new rules for areas such as trade in services, the negotiators  also hope to hammer out a new dispute-settlement procedure in the GATT to help  resolve trade frictions between two or more members. Washington has complained  recently that current rules are too weak.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subsidies, Tariffs Included  </P> <P> Along with trade in agriculture, services, investment and intellectual  property, the talks also are expected to deal with excessive government  subsidies, further reductions in tariffs, and trade in tropical products, which  are grown mainly by developing countries.  </P> <P> The language on talks over trade in agriculture calls for negotiating "a  substantial, progressive reduction" in government farm subsidies over several  years, and for an immediate freeze -- and some rollbacks, where possible -- of  current farm trade barriers.  </P> <P> Although the wording fell somewhat short of the total elimination of  agricultural trade barriers that the United States had wanted to make U.S. farm  products more competitive overseas, Hills said Washington was pleased with the  outcome because it pointed the talks in the direction that the Administration  wants.  </P> <P> "I don't think that we have to stop short" of the U.S. goal in the talks, she  said. "If you have a 'substantial, progressive reduction' of agricultural  subsidies and trade barriers, as the agreement says, there's no way you can't  get down to zero," she asserted.  </P></p>

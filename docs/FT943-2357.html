			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Labour calls for shake-up of City regulation Labour yesterday called for an overhaul of the UK's financial regulatory system following the decision by the European Commission of Human Rights to refer the case of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman, to the Human Rights Court. Mr Saunders was jailed for his role in the Guinness takeover of Distillers. The European Commission has supported his claim that the government's handling of the inquiry was a breach of his human rights. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, said: 'The European ruling on the Saunders' case gives rise to general concern that this is just the latest of a long line of problems which has called into question the ability of the UK to police City crime.' He also said the revelations in the Financial Times concerning Lord Archer's dealing in Anglia Television shares - which have been the subject of a Department of Trade and Industry investigation - 'undermines the system for dealing with insider dealing'. Directors of Anglia were warned in writing almost two years ago that neither they nor their spouses should deal in the company's shares in January or February, which is when Lord Archer subsequently placed the share orders. Labour is calling on the government to introduce new legislation in this parliamentary session. Mr Darling has outlined four demands: A reformed and strengthened Securities and Investments Board along the lines of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing regulators to investigate allegations of insider dealing and prevent wrongdoers from trading. An examination of the way City fraud cases are prosecuted, including the role of the Serious Fraud Office. The publication of DTI investigations into politicians and the establishment of an impartial body to decide whether to proceed with prosecution. An end to self-regulation to restore confidence in direct regulation under the SIB. Mr Darling said: 'At the moment there is little chance of City crime being detected, even less chance of prosecution, and those convicted have a good chance of walking free from court.'</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Increase in business failures continues BUSINESS failures continued to increase in the first three months of this year, according to figures published yesterday by Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance group, Bethan Hutton writes. The group warned that any significant improvement in the rate of failures would lag well behind any upturn in the economy. Failures notified to the group rose to 2,074 in the first quarter, up 10 per cent from the last quarter of last year. The north was worst hit, with a 33 per cent rise in the first quarter. Also badly affected were the south-west, the Yorkshire and Humberside area, and the west Midlands. The rate of increase in failures is slackening in some areas, notably Scotland, where the number of failures fell compared with the previous three months.</p>

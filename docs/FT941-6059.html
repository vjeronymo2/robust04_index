			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Crunch time looms for the motor crowd: Richard Lapper examines UK insurers' shift towards direct sales No sooner have UK insurers enjoyed the fruits of premium increases in their much-improved 1993 profits, than the threat of heavy price competition looms in a crowded corner of the market. Premium rates are already starting to fall in some areas of the fragmented Pounds 6bn-a-year motor market, and many observers predict an acceleration. This week's launch of Guardian Royal Exchange's telephone-based subsidiary Guardian Direct highlights an inexorable trend in motor insurance - and to a lesser extent in home cover - towards direct sales and away from the broker as an independent intermediary. Direct writers - which can enjoy cost advantages over rivals dependent on traditional broker outlets - are increasing their market share at an impressive pace. Last year, for example, Direct Line - a company formed only in 1985 - became the biggest motor insurer in the country, increasing policyholders from 771,000 at the end of 1992 to 1.4m. Churchill, owned by the Swiss insurer Winterthur, is the second biggest direct writer with 470,000 policyholders. Mr Oliver Steel, an analyst with securities house Kleinwort Benson, estimates that direct sellers increased their market share from 17 to 22 per cent in 1993. This was driven by the telephone-based players which now cover roughly 3m of the UK's 18.5m insured drivers. Most of the shift has been at the expense of high street brokers. Mr Steel expects direct writers to account for 40 per cent of all personal lines business by the end of the decade, while some observers believe the final figure could be as high as 80 per cent. 'Brokers appear to have most to lose . . . In the main they will find larger portions of their business disappearing down the telephone and by the end of the century, we forecast this source of business to account for less than 20 per cent (of the total),' Kleinwort Benson concludes. These changes are already stretching the resources of managements who have put their faith in broker-based distribution. Companies, such as Sun Alliance, have invested heavily in acquiring chains of high street brokers only to find the ground shifting from beneath their feet. In the view of many observers, the big high street chains - Swinton, AA Insurance Services and Safeguard - enjoyed their heyday in the early 1980s and face further decline. 'The market is clearly in trauma. The composites are losing a major distribution mechanism,' says one senior broker. So far the impact of these changes on the price of motor insurance has been unclear. With the help of more technically sophisticated techniques, insurers have begun to change the way they price their risks. This is illustrated by the higher rates charged to high-risk drivers, such as younger motorists or those with fast cars. Mr John Carter, chief executive of Commercial Union, says: 'Some rates will go down and others up'. Many insurers have increased the 'excess' - the amount of a claim a policyholder pays - to encourage drivers to become more safety and security conscious, making it more difficult to make a direct comparison of year-on-year premium rates. Mr Keith Lugton, head of corporate relations at Guardian, draws attention to another trend which has complicated matters. Guardian increased motor rates by 8-10 per cent last year, following rises of 25 per cent in both 1991 and 1992. However comprehensive policy rates fell by an average of 1 per cent. The bulk of the increased charges, with rises averaging 20 per cent, affected non-comprehensive policies covering third party liability. It has become less attractive to underwrite such policies because of the virtual disappearance of the 'knock for knock' arrangement, designed to reduce legal costs and simplify the payment of claims. Under 'knock for knock', insurers agreed to pay claims presented by their policyholders irrespective of their responsibility for the accident. Most major insurers have now withdrawn from the scheme. They argue that drivers with third party insurance are responsible for disproportionately more accidents, and so the 'knock for knock' system involves underwriters of comprehensive policies subsidising their less 'risk-averse' competitors. Despite the complicated picture, few doubt that competitive pressures are increasing. According to Mr Steven Bird, an analyst with Smith New Court, the securities house, rates for comprehensive policies could fall by as much as 15 per cent. The downward pressure on prices could be fed by the efforts of smaller direct writers to build up market share to offset their heavy investment in technology and marketing. 'They'll inevitably concentrate on price. They will maybe budget to lose money for their first three years,' suggests the senior broker. Traditional brokers are also joining in, with a number launching telephone-based operations recently. The implication is that private customers should enjoy cheaper and better insurance, but some companies may not be around to offer it. 'There could well be one or two players pulling out of the market or converting themselves into niche companies,' says Mr Bird. Or as Mr Peter Wood, the chief executive of Direct line, puts it: 'It is a big money business - peanut players cannot survive.'</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE ARE THE SPOILS OF PEACE?;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: PEOPLE ARE TAKING TO THE STREETS TO DEMAND ECONOMIC RELIEF, NOT TO  BRING BACK THE SANDINISTAS.  </P> <P> During this month's strikes in Nicaragua, the paving-stone barricades, the  handkerchief masks and the gunshots all looked like a reprise of the 1979  Sandinista insurrection that overthrew the Somoza dictatorship. But this was  not a Sandinista attempt against the coalition government elected earlier this  year. It was merely a logical expression of frustration that the government,  chosen in an election that was conducted under the shadow of U.S. power, has  not addressed major national problems.  </P> <P> The American people, their Congress and the Nicaraguan people were all affected  by the Reagan Administration policy, a puerile anti-communism whose roots  reached deep into an illegal, subterranean world. Then the Bush Administration  converted the 10 years of military and economic punishment into a bribe: The  United States would ease up on the war and end the economic embargo if  Washington's preferred candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, won the  election. The Sandinistas had agreed to call the election earlier than required  by Nicaragua's constitution, believing that the Contras would be demobilized  before the voting, as the Central American presidents' agreement had  stipulated. But, with the Administration's support, the Contras did not  demobilize, which made it difficult for the Sandinistas to campaign on ending  the draft.  </P> <P> When the voters rejected the Sandinistas, they were seeking -- and expecting --  relief from the economic hardships they suffered as well as an end to the  U.S.-sponsored Contra war. President Chamorro's devotion to reconciliation,  with United Nations help, has brought the war to a close. But, instead of the  jobs and economic reactivation she promised, the population has seen austerity,  "structural adjustment," "privatization," currency devaluation and other  measures that leave the poor worse off while new government bureaucrats collect  fat salaries, reportedly paid in dollars.  </P> <P> The recent disturbances challenged neo-liberal policies that will indefinitely  postpone long awaited relief. Although Sandinista-organized, the strikes tapped  such profound discontent that the Sandinista leadership began urging an end to  the barricades and seizures of buildings. The military and police, still  largely Sandinista, performed professionally during the strikes and obeyed  presidential orders, Politically, the Sandinistas' complaint is not with the  election's outcome, but with their historic contribution's being erased by the  schemers behind Violeta's throne, like Vice President Virgilio Godoy's  supporters who called for U.S. intervention.  </P> <P> Given the Bush Administration's emphasis on democracy, the Nicaraguan election  outcome should be hailed as a great success. A peaceful transition, a  depoliticized civilian-controlled army, (in strong contrast to El Salvador's),  multiparty pluralism, vigorous civic-interest groups -- these have all been  applauded in Eastern Europe. But, having achieved "democracy" in Nicaragua  after the election, the U.S. agenda is far from complete; it hasn't achieved  public acceptance of a private-sector-driven, "trickle down" development model.  Achieving this seems less likely than ever in light of the widespread strikes  and other protests. Washington's options have dangerously narrowed. Will  another U.S. invasion be necessary to seal the Nicaraguan election of 1990?  </P> <P> Perhaps the strongest voice against intervention was that of Chamorro. While it  may get her in trouble with Washington, she has made it clear that she will  deal with the Sandinistas realistically and seek to reach a negotiated modus  vivendi with them. The reaction of the Godoy faction during the strikes also  suggests that it's not in the Sandinistas' interests to destabilize the  Chamorro government and give an opening to the interventionists.  </P> <P> Thus, the recent events, chaotic as they may seem to us, are an effort to  create rules of the game that reflect the post-election realities.  </P> <P> If this process is allowed to continue, a far more solid and meaningful  national consensus may emerge. It could serve as a bellwether for other Central  American countries, particularly El Salvador, where, despite several elections,  national tensions may be resolved only through the present round of  U.N.-mediated negotiations.  </P> <P> Negotiations -- in the street or around the bargaining table -- are crucial for  the groups battered by years of war and repression. Failure to support this  process will lead to more war and intervention. Many wonder if Washington is  finally able to appreciate this.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A'S CAN ONLY WATCH AS THE ANGELS' HARVEY UNLEASHES HIS FORKBALL  </P> <P> It was the best situation the 44,548 fans in the Oakland Coliseum could have  hoped for Monday night.  </P> <P> Jose Canseco was at bat. Their team trailed the Angels by just a run, 5-4, in  the bottom of the ninth inning. And Bryan Harvey, the Angels' often brilliant,  but lately erratic relief pitcher, was on the mound.  </P> <P> Canseco had missed 88 games, the entire first half of the season, with an  injured left wrist. But he was now in sound shape. After all, he came into the  game having hit home runs in three consecutive games and had five in his first  nine since returning to the lineup.  </P> <P> Moreover, Harvey appeared to be in yet another shaky mode. His first three  pitches to Canseco sailed wide. This was shades of a recent stretch where  Harvey walked at least one batter in eight of nine outings.  </P> <P> Harvey's long, slow strolls around the mound seemed to signal a sense of  impending doom for the Angels.  </P> <P> They had forged ahead on solo home runs by Chili Davis in the seventh and Jack  Howell in the eighth. They had seen their 5-3 lead cut to 5-4 on an RBI single  by Mark McGwire in the eighth.  </P> <P> And now the Angels were counting on Harvey, who had come in to get the final  out in the eighth, to put the clamps on Oakland's hitters in the ninth.  </P> <P> Harvey battled back, to force a three-two count. And he froze Canseco with a  wicked forkball that danced inside. Strike three.  </P> <P> Canseco looked at six Harvey pitches without swinging and there was one out.  </P> <P> But Harvey was not out of trouble yet. Terry Steinbach, hitting .317, stepped  up next. And Harvey walked him on four pitches.  </P> <P> Next came Tony Phillips and Harvey struck out the second baseman with a  forkball for the second out.  </P> <P> Oakland Manager Tony La Russa then sent Ron Hassey up to pinch-hit for Mike  Gallego. It was an interesting move because Gallego had a single and a double  that went in-and-out of right fielder Tony Armas' glove, the A's only  extra-base hit.  </P> <P> The right-handed Harvey struck out Hassey with yet another forkball. Like the  others, Hassey took it. Unlike the others, Hassey actually swung at a pitch,  managing to foul two off.  </P> <P> In the ninth, Harvey faced four batters and got three strikeouts. Three  called-looking strikeouts. And all with the forkball, a tough pitch to get over  for a strike as Harvey well knows.  </P> <P> "It was the best forkball I had all season right there," Harvey said. "It was  working well."  </P> <P> Harvey picked up his 13th save of the season, preserving a 5-4 victory in Game  1 of an important three-game series with Oakland.  </P> <P> With his other pitches floating out of the strike zone, Harvey and catcher  Lance Parrish stuck with the forkball.  </P> <P> They were counting on Canseco to look for a fastball with a three-two count.  </P> <P> "I tricked him a little bit and luckily it worked," Harvey said. "With a guy  like Canseco, he's looking for a fastball. He can change the game with one  swing of the bat."  </P> <P> "Tonight, I felt comfortable with the forkball," Harvey said. "I was keeping it  down and throwing it for strikes."  </P> <P> The other pitches weren't working, so why not stick with the forkball?  </P> <P> "Everything's not going to be perfect," Manager Doug Rader said. "Bryan got the  four outs we needed in the ninth (including the last out in the eighth). So he  got three balls on a few people and walked a guy. That's just Bryan."  </P></p>

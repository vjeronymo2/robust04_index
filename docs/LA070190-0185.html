			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA'S PARALYZED PARAMEDICS;  </P> <P> EMERGENCY TEAMS BECOME 'DOCTORS OF LAST RESORT' FOR POOR  </P> <P> He was a big man, sprawled limply across a bed in a tiny back bedroom on  Mentone Avenue. He just couldn't seem to stand up, he said. "When I lay down  and tried to get up again, I couldn't," he said.  </P> <P> The man looked at the two paramedics with bewilderment. Someone had pulled his  T-shirt up over his stomach and loosened his belt, and his beefy arms lay  lifelessly at his sides. "I can't move my legs," he said.  </P> <P> Matt Thompson, a 15-year veteran of Pasadena's corps of paramedics, bent over  the man, peering into his face like a detective searching for clues. Thompson's  partner, Todd Witt, slapped some adhesive patches onto the man's chest.  One-two-three-four-five, each patch was connected to a wire.  </P> <P> "We're going to check your heart now," Witt said. He switched on the Lifepak, a  portable life-support machine. It began to beep regularly, and a graph of the  patient's heartbeat began to unroll on a little screen.  </P> <P> It was a fairly routine case, in the middle of the paramedics' hectic Wednesday  shift. "We get many, many cases like it every week," Witt said, shortly after  the ambulance had taken the man to a hospital.  </P> <P> By 8 Thursday morning, the end of their 24-hour shift, the two paramedics had  handled 11 cases, charging along city streets in Rescue Ambulance 36, siren  wailing and lights flashing, all over Northwest Pasadena. They had treated and  transported, among others, two police officers hurt in a traffic accident, a  man with a knife wound to the scalp, a child trapped in the chimney of a brick  barbecue pit and a man knocked off his bicycle by a passing car.  </P> <P> The Mentone Avenue patient was 64, had had three heart attacks and a stroke  since 1972, and appeared to have lost some motor function on his left side.  </P> <P> "It's probably some sort of stroke," said Witt. "Maybe his pressure built up so  high he burst a blood vessel in his head."  </P> <P> Until recent years, paramedics were considered the city's heart attack team,  equipped with hypodermics and portable defibrillators, racing to revive people  in cardiac arrest.  </P> <P> "When I started with the city in 1975, the only thing we were expected to do  was go out and take care of acute myocardial infarctions," said Thompson.  </P> <P> Nowadays, paramedics handle almost any medical problem imaginable, including a  lot of nuisance calls -- all of which they must hastily respond to.  </P> <P> Last year, the city's three rescue ambulances, each staffed 24 hours a day by  two paramedics, responded to almost 9,500 calls for help. That was about 700  more than Glendale's privately contracted paramedic service, which has one more  ambulance than Pasadena.  </P> <P> So fast and furious has become the pace of trauma and illness in Pasadena that,  on an average of once a day, dispatchers must scour the region for private  ambulances to answer calls because all three city paramedic units are tied up.  </P> <P> Private ambulances aren't always immediately available, said Fire Chief Kaya  Pekerol, whose department has been in charge of paramedics for five years. And  when private ambulances do respond, they're not necessarily staffed by  paramedics, who are trained to administer intravenous medicines or to operate  such sophisticated equipment as the Lifepak.  </P> <P> "It's like going back to the old scoop-and-run," said Pekerol, referring to a  time when ambulances just picked up patients and raced them to emergency room  physicians.  </P> <P> The city's Board of Directors this month will consider a Fire Department  request for a fourth rescue ambulance. In a year when budget demands appear to  be outpacing revenue, the board must consider whether to find an extra $300,000  to $500,000 to staff the ambulance or risk further overburdening the city's 30  paramedics. Three-quarters of the calls to the Fire Department for assistance  are medical calls, a department spokesman said.  </P> <P> But ambulance service is fast becoming one of the city's biggest uncollected  bills. Last year, the city billed patients for almost $2 million worth of  paramedic services but collected less than half of that amount.  </P> <P> The problem is that, as are other cities, Pasadena is feeling the effects of a  gradual breakdown of the nation's health care system, said Director Rick Cole.  "There's been a wave, a crushing wave, of people with no health insurance or  inadequate health insurance showing up in hospital emergency rooms," he said.  </P> <P> Paramedics no longer just provide emergency treatment, Cole added. They are now  "the doctors of last resort" for a medically neglected segment of the  population, he said.  </P> <P> Rescue Ambulance 36, a red-and-white 1987 Chevrolet Silverado with 110,000  miles on its odometer, operates out of a down-at-the-heels fire station on  North Raymond Avenue. "Ft. Raymond," firefighters call the station, because of  its isolation on the wild and woolly side of Pasadena.  </P> <P> The ambulance is a marvel of modern medical technology, equipped with all of  the latest life saving devices: defibrillator, laryngoscope, an array of heart  medications and painkillers, and a radio to keep the paramedics in contact with  doctors at Huntington Memorial Hospital emergency room.  </P> <P> Paramedics complain that the ambulance is often used just to take mildly ill  people to hospitals. "Some people just see it as a red and white taxi with  lights on it," said paramedic Mike Barilla, who staffed the ambulance on a  recent Monday along with his partner Myron Cooper and trainee Robert Culhane.  </P> <P> During their shift, an unusually tranquil one, the trio responded to a call for  assistance to a woman with a "head injury." The paramedics found she had fallen  in the hallway of her apartment building, bruising her knee. She elected not to  go to the hospital after the paramedics examined her.  </P> <P> Then they raced to a "stabbing" victim, a woman who had been jabbed in the arm  with a table fork by her sister. They cleansed her small puncture wounds and  returned to the station house.  </P> <P> Such calls could represent an abuse of the system, Fire Capt. Lloyd Wade said.  "Ten years ago, if a child broke his arm, his mother put him in the car and  drove him to the hospital," Wade said. "Now, people call an ambulance."  </P> <P> All paramedics have tales of wasted trips, which they can't refuse because of  the possibility of exposing the city to lawsuits.  </P> <P> "There's a report of someone with difficulty breathing," said Wade. "You get to  the place and there's a guy sitting on the edge of his bed, smoking a  cigarette. You may have tied up two paramedics and three or four men from an  engine company. Meanwhile, you've got an accident on the freeway or a shooting  somewhere, and you've lost valuable time."  </P> <P> Barilla told of responding to a "difficulty breathing" call recently and  finding a woman with a head cold. "She said: 'Yeah, I have trouble. When I try  to breathe through my nose, I have trouble breathing.' "  </P> <P> But the life-and-death calls come frequently enough. Culhane, on just the third  of 20 round-the-clock shifts he must complete to qualify as a paramedic,  delivered a baby. Later, he and the two paramedics revived an elderly woman  whose heart had stopped while she was being bathed in a nursing home.  </P> <P> "That's when you really feel good," said Barilla, describing the incident.  </P> <P> Thompson and Witt felt similar gratification after they delivered the stroke  victim to St. Luke Medical Center. It was one of those cases that had been  mined with unpredictables.  </P> <P> Unable to get their gurney into the patient's house, the two paramedics had to  carry the man, a bulky 270-pounder, to the front yard. Thompson, who prides  himself on being able to insert a hypodermic intravenously on a bumpy street at  40 m.p.h., couldn't find a vein in the man's fleshy arm. Then, as Witt drove  around a sharp curve, Thompson almost went sprawling across the patient.  </P> <P> When the patient was safely in the care of emergency room physicians, the two  paramedics headed back to the relative tranquillity of the fire station. When  would they get the next in that endless succession of emergency calls?  </P> <P> "The rule of thumb," Witt said cheerfully, "is that you expect it to come  during lunch, during dinner or sometime after midnight."  </P></p>

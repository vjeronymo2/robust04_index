			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Klockner plan puts Brussels through mill: Debt write-off delayed by legal and industry support problems TECHNICAL and legal difficulties are holding up formal European Commission approval of a 40 per cent debt write-off at Klockner-Werke, the German steel group. The Commission has decided in principle to forgive part of the EC's DM175m (Pounds 71m) loan to Klockner, which has filed for protection from its creditors. But it wants cast-iron guarantees from the German company that it will reduce capacity. Approval by Brussels would allow a debt rescheduling deal to go ahead at Klockner, involving the write-off of loans worth a total of DM1.4bn. But the Commission has run up against German rules which prevent creditors imposing legally binding conditions on such debt rescheduling plans. The Commission is also in the difficult position of trying to fit its decision on Klockner into an overall plan to support the whole EC steel industry. On the one hand, Brussels has come under attack for granting a reprieve to the German steel group at a time when the rest of the industry is suffering from overcapacity. In particular, publicly-owned Italian or Spanish steel producers - which are being asked to sacrifice capacity if they want to receive state aid - say Klockner is getting off lightly. On the other hand, German steelworkers blame the problems at Klockner and the collapse last month of Saarstahl, a French-owned steelmaker in the depressed German Saarland, on the EC's failure to get tough with Italy and Spain. Commission officials say an inflexible approach to the Klockner case - demanding the recovery of the entire DM175m loan - could have provoked outright bankruptcy. The Commission would have failed in its duty to recover the Community taxpayers' loan to the company and another producer could then have bought the company for a pittance and returned it to full production, free of debt. By contrast, officials say, the deal now awaiting the Commission's rubber-stamp leaves the German company with a tolerable level of debt, and is tied to legally-binding, irreversible capacity cuts. Both factors ought to prevent Klockner from exploiting its narrow escape from bankruptcy and upsetting the delicately balanced overall steel restructuring plan. The survival of Klockner may even prompt further rationalisation. Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's largest steel producers, want to take over Klockner's cold rolling mill in Bremen together with a consortium of European steelmakers. The Commission and its potential partners from the private-sector have an interest in nudging Klockner towards wider-ranging restructuring which might involve the break-up of the company and possible closure of some hot-rolling capacity. Hot-rolled products account for 80 per cent of Klockner's production, but this is the sector where EC overcapacity is at its worst. Officials say it is 'totally ridiculous' to compare Klockner's debt write-off with state aid plans by Rome and Madrid. In fact, a rough comparison between the total debt write-off at Klockner, and the estimated state aid at Ilva, the Italian steelmaker, indicates that the trade-off between cash and cuts is similar. But the Commission is clearly worried that any hint of leniency in the Klockner or Saarstahl cases could be latched on to by Italy and Spain at a special meeting of industry ministers next month in an attempt to force EC approval of their sensitive steel aid-and-restructuring plans. Indeed, the Commission already seems resigned to losing its DM100m loan to Saarstahl, rather than allow the Saarland regional government to prop the company up with subsidies. 'One point is absolutely clear,' says one Brussels official. 'The Commission will be extremely reluctant to envisage any sort of public aid in this case.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (CNS) -- Conditions are not mature  enough for foreign-funded banks to run renminbi business at the  present stage considering that the commercial banking system had  not yet been set up, the Deputy Director of the Securities  Committee under the State Council and Vice Chairman of the  Securities Supervisory Commission Mr. Tong Zengyin said.    With China now engaged in restructuring of the banking  system, it will take time for the state-owned professional banks  to switch to state-owned commercial ones. Unfair competition  would result from letting foreign-funded banks undertake the  renminbi business at a time when the commercial banking system  had not yet been established. The way in which foreign-funded  banks ran their business and the taxation rate for these banks  were different from those for domestic banks at the present  stage.    Mr. Tong said that the opening of banking business to  foreign- funded banks had to be in line with the national  situation. China employed the practice of letting  foreign-funded banks undertake foreign currency business first  and then went step by step to have them involved in the renminbi  business. He added that there would not be an overall opening  in such sector. Some areas including Shenzhen and Xiamen can  take the lead in opening themselves to the outside world. The  number of state-owned medium- and large-sized enterprises is  relatively small in these places where the market economy system  plays a dominant role and most banks operating there are  commercial ones. They are therefore qualified for opening the  banking business to the outside world to a greater extent. The  time, however, is not ripe for the running of the renminbi  business by foreign-funded banks at the present stage until the  banking system is well established.</p>

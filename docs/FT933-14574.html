			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Boutros Ghali warns on unpaid bills THE United Nations faces a financial crisis of unprecedented dimensions because member states have not paid peacekeeping bills, notably in the former Yugoslav republics and Somalia, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary general, said yesterday, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent, in New York. With arrears on regular budget and peacekeeping accounts already exceeding Dollars 2.3bn, he warned of the high probability that the UN soon would be unable to meet its day-to-day obligations. Evidently alluding to the US and Russia, Mr Boutros Ghali said two-thirds of the amount was owed by permanent members of the Security Council, the UN's primary peacekeeping authority. By May 31, only 10 member states had paid peacekeeping assessments in full and only eight had paid their regular dues. He noted that in only one year in the last 10 had regular budget collections exceeded assessments and only once had the total outstanding balance been lower at the end of the year than at its beginning. As the UN placed more and more troops in the field, peacekeeping assessments since last September, totalling Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn), exceeded the entire 1993 regular budget. Calling the outlook 'bleak', Mr Boutros Ghali said he had already had to meet shortfalls from a newly established peacekeeping reserve fund, although that was not its purpose. Countries that provided troops were having to wait for reimbursement. Officials said this was one reason why the UN was experiencing serious difficulties in assembling peacekeepers.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Double strike well in sight: Is the UK about to achieve steady growth without a balance of payments crisis Nobody in the City is shouting it yet. But this year's narrowing in the UK trade deficit has raised hopes that Britain is on the threshold of a rare feat in its recent economic history - steady growth without a deepening trade deficit and balance of payments crisis. Exports are growing fast, according to the Central Statistical Office. Figures published last week showed a rise in export volumes of 10 per cent in the three months to July compared with a year ago. Oil and gas accounted for about a tenth of this rise, but most manufacturing sectors enjoyed expansion. At the same time, imports have remained relatively flat, in contrast to the 1980s. Then, imports were sucked in to meet rising domestic demand, contributing to a rapid deterioration in the trade deficit. Between May and July this year, however, import volumes fell by 2 per cent compared with the previous three months, and were only 4 per cent higher than in the same period last year. Rising exports and flat imports have reduced the trade deficit to Pounds 2.5bn, a level seen only briefly since the mid-1980s. As a result of this - and investment flows into the UK - the current account deficit on the UK's balance of payments fell to Pounds 0.7bn in the second quarter, its lowest level for seven years. The figures have cheered economists in the City of London. Though many last year predicted a current account deficit of Pounds 15bn in 1994, most now expect it to be nearer Pounds 5bn, below the government's Budget forecast of Pounds 9.5bn. A few, including Midland Global Markets, even predict a surplus next year. The question now dividing economists is whether the turnabout represents a broad change in the UK's economic base, or a temporary phenomenon based on rising world demand. Mr Geoffrey Dicks, chief UK economist at National Westminster Bank, is one of the optimists. He says the 1992 devaluation of sterling has been the catalyst for a broader shake-up among manufacturers, leaving industry more competitive. 'We are winning export markets and winning back our home markets too,' he says. Mr John Mayo, finance director of Zeneca, the bioscience group, believes that the devaluation 'obviously helped' the company's exports, which grew by almost 20 per cent last year. 'Our view is not that sterling is now super-competitive, but that it was overvalued before,' he says. Vosper Thorneycroft, the shipbuilder, is another company with rising exports  -up 35 per cent last year, primarily to the Middle East. Mr Martin Jay, managing director, says devaluation has helped against German competitors, but improvements in efficiency have also been important. 'In the last five years our productivity for steel ships has risen by 50 per cent,' he says. Businesses such as his say that rising productivity, competitive labour costs and a greater awareness of markets such as the Far East are contributing to export growth. 'The improvement in the export volume has been going on for some time,' says Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. 'The long decline in the UK's market share of world trade which goes back to the war was halted and even reversed in the mid-1980s.' There is also evidence that UK companies are winning back customers in the domestic market. Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the Engineering Employers' Federation, says that recent trade figures suggest that, 'at first sight', some companies are now resorting to import substitution. Engineering company Powerscreen, for instance, will next month extend its factory in Wales to produce goods previously sourced from Asia and South Africa. 'When sterling devalued, we had two choices - to push up prices or use import substitution. We've raised prices a bit, but now we are trying to make the things ourselves,' says Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive. The car industry is also seeking to source more components from the UK, says the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. And retailers such as Safeway have increased their share of goods from the UK. Many in the City, however, remain unconvinced that the improvement in the UK trade figures reflects fundamental change in British manufacturing competitiveness. The growth in exports, for example, has accompanied the pick-up in world demand, particularly in the US. Other exporting countries are experiencing similar upturns: exports from Spain and Italy, which also devalued their currencies in 1992, grew by 15.4 per cent and 9.8 per cent respectively last year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As for the fall in imports, there is only limited evidence of UK manufacturers switching to domestic suppliers. Companies such as Casket, the UK's second largest bicycle manufacturer, find that buying their components in the UK is not a viable option. 'South-east Asia produces them so cheaply it would be difficult for a UK manufacturer to compete,' says Mr Joe Smith, Casket's chief executive. Nor are many companies reporting sharp increases in domestic market share over foreign competitors. British Steel, which has seen export demand rise to the point where it has now closed its export order books for steel construction units for the year, reports little change in its home market share. Some economists suspect that the new system for recording European Union trade is understating imports. But more significant may be the nature of the UK recovery. Consumer demand led the recovery last year, but has since slowed, partly as a result of this year's tax rises. Imports of consumer goods - which represent about 15 per cent of total imports - have fallen sharply as a result. Meanwhile, corporate investment has barely picked up, leaving imports of investment goods and components - which account for about 30 per cent of total imports - flat. A time-lag between recession and investment growth is not unusual, but the delay seems to have been longer this time. If investment rises sharply next year as capacity constraints start to bite and business confidence rises, this could push imports up again. Some economists, such as Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland, warn that further economic growth will herald a return to problems with Britain's trade balance. Mr Martin argues that the UK's manufacturing base is too narrow to meet demand. Others say that exports may slow as growth falters in markets such as the US. However, the City Cassandras appear to be a minority. 'It is difficult to be concerned about rising imports if they are being used to invest to expand capacity to export,' says Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets. And with growth in industrial output forecast to exceed consumer spending growth next year, exports are likely to become increasingly important in the recovery. Annualised growth in manufacturing output was running at more than 4 per cent in August, says the CSO, while the annualised growth in consumer expenditure in the second quarter, the most recent figure, was about 3 per cent. Meanwhile, imports of consumer goods may grow little if - as many banks predict - private consumption increases by less than 2 per cent next year. A balance of payments surplus may still be a distant prospect. But the possibility of an export-driven recovery is enough to make most economists smile. They are certainly taking the scenario seriously.</p>

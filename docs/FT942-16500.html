			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Personal pensions - the facts - What potential buyers ought to know Over the past two months, the Weekend FT has taken a close look at personal pension plans and the most important features to consider when selecting a provider. These are complex products and, with more than 100 plans on offer, it is all-important to seek professional independent advice to ensure that the provider you select offers the best value for money. To make an informed choice, you and your partner should consider the following points in detail: The financial strength of the provider. The charges deducted by the provider from your premiums before investment. The cost of advice, if not included in the provider's charges. The investment performance, focusing on consistency of returns over five to 10 years and the stability of the investment team. Flexibility of the contract; in particular, that there are no penalties for stopping or reducing premiums. The two critical factors that affect the success of any investment are the performance of the fund and the amount deducted in charges before your money is invested. What consumers should be seeking is good, consistent performance over the long term combined with low, flexible charges. A plan that imposes high charges would have to achieve an outstanding performance to offer good value. Life office charges are notoriously complicated and it is near-impossible to work out how much you are paying. To make matters worse, the law says life offices cannot use their own charges to illustrate what your investment would be worth in, say, 20 years. Instead, they must use figures provided by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) which bear little or no resemblance to real charges. Adding to the confusion, the illustration can use only two annual growth rates: 6 and 12 per cent. Consumers cannot put any faith in these figures which would turn them alternatively into paupers or millionaires. While it is impossible to predict future performance accurately, it is possible to use the provider's real charges in these illustrations (although it is necessary first to seek Lautro's permission; otherwise, the exercise would be illegal). The two tables show illustrations that assume the commission paid to the adviser is stripped out, leaving just the life offices' own charges in place. The results can be compared with the 'no charge' figure at the top of both tables. It is important to remember that you still must pay for the advice, whether in the form of a separate fee or as commission deducted from your premiums. The exception in our table is Equitable Life; its figures include the cost of the advice if you buy through its direct sales force. The Prudential did not provide figures since nil-commission terms are not available through its direct sales force, which sells 97 per cent of the company's personal pensions. The figures in brackets show the three top providers in terms of lowest charges, while the final figure in each table shows the difference between the highest and lowest chargers. By January 1995, life office illustrations will have to show the impact of real charges; this will help considerably in the selection process. As the table shows, the difference between the best and worst providers on charges alone can run to thousands of pounds on a long-term investment. The providers examined in the tables include some of the best but not the worst. To identify these, you must refer to comprehensive industry surveys, such as the FT Personal Pensions 1994 handbook and Money Management's March 1994 survey. These reveal the providers with sky-high charges and second-rate fund performance. Most do not deal through independent advisers but sell instead through company representatives who do not have to point out high chargesand/or poor fund performance. For the record, here they are. Worst performers with profits plans: Britannia Life, Royal Life, Guardian Assurance, National Provident and Scottish Mutual. Worst performers unit-linked: Laurentian Life, Scottish Life and Scottish Mutual. Highest chargers on regular premium plans: Eurolife, British Life Office, Providence Capitol, Combined Insurance, Refuge, Royal London, Merchant Investors, Liberty Life, Acuma, Gartmore. Highest chargers on single premium plans: Colonial Mutual, Royal London, Hambro Guardian, Gartmore, GA Life, Windsor Life, Acuma, Cornhill, Pearl, Century Life. One final point on how you pay for your advice. The Weekend FT has argued consistently that investment advice should not be linked to the sale of a product - yet, most advisers are remunerated only by a commission payment from the provider when they make a sale. Unfortunately, the taxation of advice in the UK looks set to perpetuate this system because it is cheaper to pay for advice through commission rather than fees. Under the commission system, the provider deducts the adviser's payment out of your premiums, which benefit from full tax relief. Moreover, there is no VAT on the payment of commission by a provider to an adviser on the sale of an insurance-based personal pension. But Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, a private client banking and asset management group, says: 'If a pensions specialist charges for his advice and recommends that a private client takes no action or that a non-insurance personal pension is more appropriate, then his fee is not allowable for income tax relief. 'What is more, his fee is subject to VAT at 17.5 per cent which the client cannot reclaim. This double taxation prejudices the availability of good, independent fee-based advice on pensions. It encourages the continuance of the commission-driven system.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------- THE EFFECT OF CHARGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Provider                                      6%         12%                                             growth      growth                                            (Pounds)    (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly premium Pounds 200 after 20 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------- No charges                                  91,129      183,971 Equitable Life                              82,016      164,254 National Mutual                             82,271      165,600 Norwich Union                               80,225      160,393 Professional Life                           85,408(1)   171,747(1) Provident Life                              83,276(3)   166,977(3) Rothschild Rothschild                                  80,677      161,490 Scottish Widows                             81,621      161,635 Standard Life                               79,201      158,711 Sun Life                                    85,172(2)   167,572(2) Difference best and worst                               6,207       13,036  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Single premium Pounds 10,000 after 20 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------- No charges                                  32,071       96,493 Equitable Life                              28,739(2)    86,441(2) National Mutual                             29,313(1)    88,489(1) Norwich Union                               26,846       81,469 Professional Life                           27,391       84,990 Provident Life                              28,448(3)    86,001(3) Rothschild Ast Mgt                                     26,268       79,817 Scottish Widows                             27,896       83,772 Standard Life                               25,805       79,610 Sun Life                                    26,769       81,341 Difference best and worst                          3,50827,89        8,879  ----------------------------------------------------------------- In previous weeks This article concludes the Insurance for Life series.

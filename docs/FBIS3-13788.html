			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed political analysis from the "Spotlight on </F> News" program]    [Text] What is the meaning of the serious split that  occurred in the Security Council three and a half years after a  blockade was imposed on Iraq; what is the meaning of the three  no's that Russia, France, and the PRC brandished against U.S.  and British allegations; and what is the meaning of the  majority's support for Iraq's position and their insistence on  praising that position?    Three days of debate by the Security Council raised many  questions, and the Security Council refrained, for the first  time, from issuing its traditional statement on extending the  blockade. Instead, it just satisfied itself with a shy extension  of the unjust embargo on Iraq.    Replies can be provided for these questions to clarify  matters regarding what happened and what is expected to happen.  The first reply is that the international community has begun  to understand that the continuation of the blockade is  unjustified, that insistence on it has become meaningless and  has made the security Council a subject of accusations, and that  the insistence of the United States and its British satellite is  illogic because it seeks to achieve wicked goals that have  nothing to do with legitimacy or international law.    The second reply is that Iraq has been using its goodwill in  handling the premeditated resolutions that have bad goals and  that it has met its obligations in accordance with Security  Council wishes and mechanism, the latest of which is its  approval of the permanent weapons monitoring. But the Security  Council has not met its obligations, its position is viewed as  ill-intentioned and indifferent, and it has resorted to  procrastination and the take- and-demand formula without  offering Iraq any of its rights. This has awaken several  Security Council member states, since the unjustified extension  of the blockade is not a plaything as it means a continued war  of annihilation against a nation that fights, suffers, and is  hurt every day.    The third reply is related to international changes that  show  a refusal to endorse U.S. decisions and dictates. The  international community has begun to reject and criticize the  U.S. Administration and its policies, and even U.S. political  circles follow suit. This has encouraged many states to behave  as they wish and in light of their interests and policies and  not in the American way. An example of this is the Japan's  rejection of the U.S. economic trusteeship, as well as Russia's  firm stand on its espionage crisis with Washington.    These replies, as well as the firmness, the patience, and  the  steadfastness Iraq has demonstrated over the past years in its  conflict with the tyrant, explain to us the reasons for the  current absence of consensus on U.S. options. Therefore, the  first signs of the dissolution of the anti-Iraq alliance  mobilized by the United States have begun to emerge.    What took place in the Security Council means that the  future  is in favor of Iraq, and that the key to the solution is  approaching to the gate of the blockade to open it and to end  the ugliest crime in history. This is because the current  situation is being shaped by the will of a growing majority  opposed to the will of an isolated minority that lacks the  weapon of logic. Iraq's strong will and its clear and bold  demand for its rights will certainly decide the issue and will  enable Iraq to have the final say in the future of the blockade.  Pending that historic moment, we, the Iraqis, have to be  patient and to remain highly vigilant.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Steen Vogt report: "Swedes Put on Their Thinking Caps"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday morning the Swedish Environment Ministry  finally received the latest calculations of the blocking effect  the Oresund link will have on the water flowing through the  Oresund into the Baltic Sea.    And now, according to press secretary Reidar Karlsson, the  ministry will spend the "next few days" going through the  documents from the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) and the  Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The  calculations show that the blocking effect of the link is  between 0.32 and 0.52 percent, with a 0.2 percent margin of  error. As a result the desired zero solution can be achieved  through the compensatory dredging of 2.3 million cubic meters  from the bottom of the Oresund.    It has not yet been decided whether the ministry will then  be  able to make any direct recommendations to the Swedish  Government in a few days' time or whether it needs to call in  one or more experts from outside to evaluate the calculations.    "The ministry's experts will now go through these documents,  but it is too early to say whether they have the necessary  competence to carry out a final evaluation of them. But this  will be decided within the next few days," Reidar Karlsson said.    According to RITZAUS BUREAU, the report from the Denmark's  DHI contains mild "criticism" of the Swedish Water Rights Court  which last Friday gave the thumbs-down to the calculations  produced so far by the Oresund Bridge Consortium.    "Our first report to the Water Rights Court which was based  on varying current conditions showed that the bridge did not  have a blocking effect of more than 0.5 percent," DHI department  chief Jacob Steen Moller said.    According to Steen Moller, it was unnecessary, after the  first report, for the Water Rights Court to demand new  calculations regarding south-flowing currents in the Baltic Sea.</p>

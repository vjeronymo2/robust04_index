			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / How to Spend it: Lucky dip of crafts IF YOU are in the commissioning mood and fancy entering into a creative adventure with a craftsman of your choice you should visit Chelsea Crafts Fair, which starts next Tuesday. Regular readers may remember that is something of an annual celebration, a happy way of dipping into the best, most creative work in a whole range of crafts. The fair has become so sought-after that these days it is divided into two different weeks with a different set of exhibits and exhibitors taking over in the second week. Those who want to see them all, therefore, need to make sure they go twice] Many of those who make the annual pilgrimage to Chelsea Old Town Hall in the King's Road use it as a splendid opportunity to buy their Christmas presents early; others see it as a chance to identify the craftspeople whose work they most like and commission something special, whether it be a hand-knitted sweater, a fantastical mirror, a refined piece of furniture, some quirky jewellery or an individually carved toy. There will, overall, be some 810 different makers with exhibits on sale and a quarter of these will be people whose wares have not been seen at the fair before. There is an admission charge of Pounds 6 which entitles the visitor to one visit on each of the weeks, or a single visit costs Pounds 4. The first week runs from October 12-17, the second from October 19-24. It is closed on Monday October 18. Hours of opening are 10-8 pm from Tuesday to Friday and from 10-6 pm on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

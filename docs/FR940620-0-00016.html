This amendment is prompted by results of a safety review, which revealed that in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser could result in a significant reduction in the controllability of the airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective July 20, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

That action proposed to require tests of the thrust reverser system, and repair, if necessary; installation of a modification that would terminate those tests; and repetitive operational checks of that installation, and repair, if necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters question the requirement for periodic operational checks of the sync-lock following its installation, as specified in paragraph (c) of the proposal: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, states that, while ATA members are not opposed to accomplishing the proposed checks as part of their maintenance programs, these members are opposed to accomplishing the checks as part of the requirements of an AD. The commenters believe that the requirement for operational checks is equivalent to issuing a Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMR) item by means of an AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA adds that, if the FAA finds sufficient justification to include the requirement for operational checks in the AD, an alternative to accomplishment of the checks should be provided in the final rule. ATA reasons that an alternative is justified because no data exist to show that repetitive checks of a modified thrust reverser cannot be handled adequately through an operator's maintenance program. The suggested alternative follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing the sync-lock installation, revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program to include an operational check of the sync-lock. The initial check would be accomplished within 1,000 hours time-in-service after modification. The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that have acceptably revised the maintenance program. Operators choosing this alternative could use an alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 91.417 or 121.380. The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing this alternative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. One commenter, Boeing, requests that the proposed requirement for operational checks be removed from the AD until the FAA reviews the ``more comprehensive'' scheduled maintenance recommendations developed by the Model 757/767 Thrust Reverser Working Group, which will be recommended in the next revision to the Maintenance Review Board (MRB) report. Boeing believes that adoption of the maintenance recommendations contained in that forthcoming revision will ensure that an adequate level of safety (with regard to the sync-lock installation) will be maintained by all operators of Model 757 series airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. One commenter states that these checks should not be required because failures of the sync-lock would not be hidden. The commenter states that normal operation of the thrust reverser will indicate if the sync-lock system is active, and whenever the sync-lock system is not available, either the unlock indicator on the external surface of the engine cowling will indicate this condition or the thrust reverser will not deploy on request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

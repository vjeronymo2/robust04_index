			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Arts: Driven to abstraction - The work of Fiona Rae Fiona Rae is that now rare creature, a young painter of some interest sent out into the unforgiving world by the much-vaunted fine-art school of the Goldsmiths' College. She graduated in 1987, since when her work has been included in major exhibitions at home and abroad, notably the third British Art Show, and the Aperto for young artists at the Venice Biennale of 1990. She has had solo exhibitions in Glasgow, London and Basle, and her work is represented in public collections such as that of the Tate and the Arts Council. In 1991 she was nominated for the Turner Prize. She is still barely 30 years old. Her paintings are large, bright and abstract, with any particular reference either veiled or incidental, cut off from any source in experience of the real world. The pictorial space is ambiguous and disrupted, the colour-ground laid on as an impersonal, uninflected, often hard-edged area of paint. Should it be blue, as it so often is, it carries with it the immediate connotation of an infinite, cosmic space: any other colour, and it becomes a solid screen that closes down the space, close and parallel to the picture-plane. Within this pictorial arena, moving across and against this theatrical backdrop, the more loosely graphic and expressive gestures and motifs make their way, from incident to incident. Rae carries all this off with considerable technical sophistication and aplomb. Here is painting at its most knowing and self-regarding, in terms both of imagery and practice, in the constant reference to the history of modern painting, and in the sheer variety of mark and texture in the application of the paint. Dribbles, scrawls, drags and splodges, all are here, most lovingly noted and prettily expressed, even though the mark or effect may be anything but pretty. Indeed it takes a clever hand and knowing eye together to achieve passages of paint as awkward and ugly as so often these are. But to what end? The brief, anonymous apologetic in the introductory leaflet, entitled 'Rehearsing the Spontaneous', rather gives the game away. 'The history of painting in the past 150 years', it tells us, 'has been one of attack from outside, and strenuous development from within . . . Easel painting fitted too easily into museums and the homes of the rich to be a tool for challenging established social and aesthetic order . . . . . . Fiona Rae is conscious of the accumulated weight of painting's history, the old argument that nothing new can be done. Yet she has found a way of synthesising a myriad of painting's 20th century languages, creating her own edgy amalgam. The effect is one of eclecticism run riot . . . . Rae's paintings are about the profusion, excess and profligacy of late 20th century visual and material culture . . . Rae's work raises complex issues of authenticity, as certain passages become themselves representations of paint, or the history of painting. This is a post-modern, knowing element in the work, constructed as a response to a crisis of originality . . .' Leaving aside the point that Miss Rae's own paintings hang in museums and hardly come cheap, it is seems that her work qualifies her for the success she has so rapidly achieved not by being what it is - which is competent and fairly lively abstraction - but by what it is about. There we have it, the litany of excuses that masquerades as explanation, the suggestion that painting in our time must be some sort of socio-political engagement or it is nothing, the unquestioning acceptance that the only true subject of art is art itself. We are further told that 'while Rae uses objects from the real world as a source, she is at pains to remove any figurative elements from the work, believing that there are other ways of understanding or constructing the world than those of conventional representation.' But what are these other ways? And why are both writer and painter at such pains to disavow 'conventional representation', as though it were the deadliest of corruptions? Why the evident fear that we might think Miss Rae the least bit interested in responding simply and directly to the world about her? Might it not be that to look out at the natural world, at the figure or the landscape, is to set oneself a task somewhat harder to resolve than eclectic pastiche of the work of other artists? Who can say whether it was by luck or misfortune that the young Rae, keen to be an artist, fetched up at Goldsmiths' from her foundation course. Whichever the case, we may reasonably doubt that she ever worked directly from nature again. Did she ever? She at least accepts the great precept by which her distinguished alma mater has made its modern reputation - the world does not matter: it is the idea that counts. * The landscapes and still-lifes of Diana Armfield, now in their last few days at Browse &amp; Darby, might give her pause. Here is work that will never sniff a Turner nomination or British Council tour abroad, yet it represents the steady, modest, cumulated experience of a long career spent coming to terms with what the eye can see and the hand resolve into paint on a flat surface. It is what Chardin too, if we are to be art-historical about it, spent a lifetime doing, and what was true for him still holds true for us, if only we think of it. There is nothing necessarily more profound in its potential, nor more worthy of the artist's attention, than a flower in a pot. Two of Miss Armfield's small studies, of flowers on a Welsh window-sill and, in particular, of a bunch of wild roses in a jam-jar, are as fine and delicate in their working, and as true and beautiful in themselves, as anything of their kind I have seen by a living artist in too long a time. Fiona Rae: New paintings; Institute of Contemporary Art, The Mall, SW1 until Feb 6. Diana Armfield, Browse &amp; Darby, 19 Cork St, W1 until Dec 23.</p>

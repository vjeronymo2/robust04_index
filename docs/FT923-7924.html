			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Finnish bank offers maximum FM950m convertible bond THE Union Bank of Finland (Unitas) yesterday issued a maximum FM950m offering of convertible bonds, in order to strengthen its capital base. Mr Vesa Vainio, the bank's president said the additional capital would strengthen the bank's lending ability by FM10bn. 'The issue will give investors a good yield but will also be profitable for Unitas since this will be equity-ranked capital,' he explained. The issue has a maturity of 50 years. The bank's share capital may increase as a result of the conversion of bonds by a maximum of FM285m. Each bond with a nominal value of FM10,000 may be converted into 300 A shares each with a nominal value of FM10. The conversion right comes into force on January 4 next year. The subscription period will be from August 17-28. Yesterday the bank said it would report a substantially larger loss in its results for 1992 than the FM128m deficit of last year. 'The banking sector's problems will continue at least throughout next year and possibly longer,' said Mr Ahti Hirvonen, Unitas chief executive. 'Credit write-offs are likely to increase in relative terms towards the end of this year.' However, he pointed to a number of positive factors for the bank. Its capital adequacy ratio has risen to 10.7 per cent as risk-weighted assets have declined while its core capital ratio is 7.4 per cent. Mr Hirvonen added that the group's structural reorganisation announced at the end of June was going ahead as planned.</p>

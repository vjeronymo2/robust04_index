			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- China has made major  breakthroughs in reforming the state's pension, unemployment and  injury insurance system and has broadly extended its coverage.    According to the China Labor Development Bulletin issued  here  jointly today by the Labor Ministry and the Statistics Bureau,  some 600 cities and counties nationwide had by the end of last  year taken up reform of the pension calculation system,  involving a total of 25 million workers.    Some 13 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities  have  put their pensions under a unified provincial plan, in which the  pensions are shared on the provincial scale.    Township enterprises in 1,900 cities and counties across the  country have introduced unified social management of retirement  pay, which better protects the interests of the retired workers.    To lighten the burden of enterprises, over 1,000 cities and  counties now distribute pensions through banks or social  insurance institutions, a practice common internationally.    According to the bulletin, the reform of the industrial  injury insurance system, focusing on centralized administration  and socialized management, is drawing nearer completion. The  reform has covered over 500 cities and counties in 19 provinces  and autonomous regions, involving 11 million people.    Labor Ministry Spokesman Liu Guanxue told reporters today  that the vigorous reform of the unemployment insurance system  has produced good results. A total of 530,000 enterprises and  79 million working staff have benefited from the reform.    According to Liu, China had collected 1.63 billion yuan for  the insurance fund by the end of 1993. Some 930 million yuan  had been used on the unemployed. A total of 1.03 million  jobless people had received unemployment relief aid from various  labor departments.    According to the release, some 5.5 million women workers  from  300 cities and counties have been placed under the protection of  the maternity insurance which effectively boosted the employment  of women.</p>

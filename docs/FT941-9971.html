			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BP makes second large oil discovery off Shetland Hours before British Petroleum unveiled its results yesterday, the group confirmed recent speculation that it had made a second significant discovery off the Shetland Islands. The find is only about 15km from an existing discovery and has estimated recoverable reserves of between 250m and 500m barrels of oil. BP said it intended to develop the discovery in a phased programme to ensure that it remained 'robust at a low oil price'. The company said it was proposing an early-production schedule which could produce up to 100,000 barrels a day within a few years. BP holds a 50 per cent interest in the field, with the balance owned by Royal Dutch/Shell. The companies jointly own 10 blocks covering 1,500 sq km and intend to drill up to six wells in the area this year. Confirmation of the field's potential on the day of BP's results may have been a calculated move aimed at reassuring shareholders that the company remained committed to investing in longer term opportunities, in spite of the squeeze on capital investment. Mr David Simon, chief executive, was at pains to stress yesterday that lower capital expenditure did not necessarily mean fewer projects. The group's drive towards efficiency meant that many projects were running substantially below budget. 'We are getting more bang for the buck in most of the projects coming forward,' he said. This year capital spending is targeted at between Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) and Dollars 4.5bn. The results were widely greeted by analysts as a substantial achievement in a difficult climate. 'These were storming figures given the external conditions,' said one. However, the question remained of whether such performance could be sustained at a substantially lower oil price. Mr Simon stressed the group's focus on margin improvement to help survive volatile price fluctuations. Year on year the company had made savings of about Pounds 500m through rationalisation, disposals and restructuring. BP beat its target for disposal proceeds by raising Pounds 2.1bn in the year, compared with Pounds 1.1bn. Mr Simon said he expected a further Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn to be raised from asset sales in the current year. Debt at the end of the year was Dollars 12.4bn, a fall of Dollars 4bn from its peak in 1992. The year-end figure represented 85 per cent of shareholders' funds. BP benefited from a stronger dollar which contributed exchange rate gains of Dollars 200m and gained a further Dollars 135m as a result of revisions in petroleum revenue tax.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerhard Bitzan: "Klestil Disappointed With </F> Syria's Middle East Position]    [Excerpts] The Austrian blue helmets on the Golan Heights  and Syria's role in the Middle East process: These topics  dominated President Thomas Klestil's state visit to Damascus  during the weekend.    After his talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, Klestil  indicated that he was disappointed with his position on the  peace process. "While I was optimistic after my last visit to  Cairo and the talks there with Mubarak, 'Arafat, and Peres, this  has since changed." Al-Asad is a realist and he does not expect  a breakthrough in Israel's peace negotiations with the PLO, he  said.    The return of the Golan Heights is indispensable for Syria;  at the same time, Damascus strictly opposes secret negotiations  with Israel and distrusts its desire for peace, Klestil  reported. He also quoted the Syrians' wish that Austria  continue the tradition of Kreisky and Waldheim and commit itself  more in the Middle East.    Foreign Minister Mock, who accompanied the president,  stressed that Austria still plays an important role for the  region: For example, Vienna was asked in connection with the  secret negotiations between the PLO and Israel, but finally Oslo  was chosen as the place for the talks. "Our newspapers would  immediately have reported on it," Klestil said with a smile.    Al-Asad paid tribute to the role of the Austrian blue  helmets. Should an agreement be achieved between Israel and  Syria after all, Austria could provide additional troops to  monitor a demilitarized zone, Klestil suggested. The Austrians  are experienced in the region, so he can also envisage that the  government in Vienna would agree to it, he said.    On Sunday Klestil was able to satisfy himself of the present  situation on Golan. [passage omitted]    About 460 Austrian blue helmets, who received the visitor  enthusiastically, are currently stationed in Syria. [passage  omitted]    Despite all the benevolence that was shown to Austria in  Damascus, economic relations are not developing as desired.  There are several projects, above all in the sectors of energy  and medicine, but many have not been concluded because of  unclear financial questions. Experts in tourism were also part  of the small economic delegation as there is increasing demand  for Syria as a tourist destination, but the infrastructure is  not yet developed well.    Today, Monday, the president will travel to Jordan for his  next state visit. Foreign Minister Mock returned to Vienna on  Sunday. [passage omitted]</p>

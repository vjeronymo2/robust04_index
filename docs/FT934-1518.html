			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Sir Robert Reid: tough insider at British Rail who rose to the top - Obituary Sir Robert Reid, former chairman of British Rail and a lifelong railwayman, has died aged 72. Although he was not the government's first choice to become BR chairman in 1983, he is credited with the modernisation of its management. He put in place many of the building blocks for the planned privatisation and break-up of BR, in spite of his distaste for the process. His death comes within a few weeks of parliament approving the privatisation bill. Robert Reid was born in February 1921. His education at Brasenose College, Oxford, was interrupted by the second world war. He was commissioned in the Royal Tank Regiment and spent more than three years in a German prisoner-of-war camp. He returned to Oxford and in 1947 opted for a graduate traineeship with the London and North Eastern Railway at Pounds 399 a year. He started as a traffic apprentice and became BR chief executive in 1980 and chairman in 1983. The government had sought strenuously to find a tough outsider to shake up the railway but ended up with an equally tough insider. In spite of his long career with the railways he did not hold a romantic view of its traditions or its role. He broke up the established hierarchy and split BR into five sectors - freight, InterCity, provincial services, London and the south-east, and parcels. He closed the network of regional offices with the loss of 6,000 jobs and presided over a halving of the government subsidy. Unlike his flamboyant predecessor, Sir Peter Parker, Sir Robert was soft spoken and adopted a low profile. Few among the travelling public would have recognised his hawk-nosed profile. In office he took care not to become embroiled in the political discussions of BR's future, but when pressed would question the value to customers and employees of privatising BR. When privatisation appeared inevitable he declared himself in favour of retaining BR as a single operation rather than allowing it to become 'a broken-up railway with lots of little companies'. A few months before his retirement as chairman in March 1990 he made a public plea for more government investment in rail to maintain London's role as an important European transport centre. Towards the end of his period in office his efficiency improvements were somewhat overshadowed by three fatal train crashes and a damaging dispute with the rail unions. A member of Business in the Community, he was also on the council of the Prince's Youth Business Trust and a member of the Confederation of British Industry president's committee. He was also a companion of the British Institute of Management. Sir Robert, knighted in June 1985, listed golf, sailing, shooting, fishing and mountaineering as his hobbies. He was a widower since 1976 and leaves a son and daughter.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STIRLING WON'T DELAY MOVE TO COURT TO SAVE ELECTION COSTS  </P> <P> If he would postpone his resignation until November, state Sen. Larry Stirling  (R-San Diego) could save county taxpayers as much as $600,000. That action  would allow a race to choose his successor to be scheduled with next June's  primary instead of requiring a special election.  </P> <P> However, Stirling, who long has billed himself as a fiscal conservative -- and  has a voting record to prove it -- said Thursday that, in keeping with a pledge  he made to Gov. George Deukmejian, he intends to resign from the Legislature to  join the San Diego Municipal Court next week. As a result, the vacancy in his  39th District will be filled in a costly special election, probably in  December, with a possible runoff in February.  </P> <P> The timing of the election also will have political ramifications. Special  elections usually draw small voter turnouts, a pattern that would probably give  an edge to Republicans, who historically turn out in larger numbers than  Democrats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Free Shot' at Seat  </P> <P> Moreover, a special election would give two of the major potential contenders  for Stirling's seat -- Assemblywomen Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon) and Lucy Killea  (D-San Diego) -- a "free shot" in the Senate race without jeopardizing their  Assembly posts. If the Senate race were consolidated with next June's primary,  the two would have to give up their Assembly seats to run for Stirling's Senate  slot.  </P> <P> But Stirling said in an interview Thursday that any conjecture about election  costs and the timing of his move from the state Senate to the judgeship is  moot, because he has no intention of agreeing to a two-month delay in his plan  to step down from the Senate next Friday.  </P> <P> Stirling repeated that message Thursday to county Supervisor Susan Golding.  Golding, as chairman of the Board of Supervisors, the body that will have to  fund the election, asked Stirling to consider delaying his resignation so that  the election could be consolidated with next June's primary. The county faces  severe budget constraints, and a special election will reduce the board's  already lean contingency fund.  </P> <P> "We're talking about possibly saving hundreds of thousands of dollars . . . but  he said he wasn't going to do it," said Golding, who herself has been mentioned  as a contender for Stirling's seat. "He said this is what the governor wanted  him to do."  </P> <P> Though sympathetic with the county's plight, Stirling said there is the need  for him to join the Municipal Court bench as quickly as possible to help  relieve the logjam of cases in local courts.  </P> <P> "There's a fiscal consideration for the county -- I understand that," said  Stirling, whose annual salary will more than double, from $40,800 to $82,000,  when he becomes a judge. "But there's also a big backlog at the courthouse, and  the governor has been criticized by the county for not filling those vacancies  quickly enough. So I'm eager to get over there to help reduce that workload."  </P> <P> Tom Beermann, Deukmejian's deputy press secretary, offered a similar  explanation, saying that the governor's motive in asking Stirling to make the  move quickly is "the dire need for additional judgeships" in San Diego.  </P> <P> Stirling's resignation will set in motion a complex formula under which  Deukmejian will schedule a special election to select his replacement. Under  the most likely timetable, the primary -- in which all candidates of all  parties will appear on a single ballot -- would be held in mid-December, county  Registrar of Voters Conny McCormack said.  </P> <P> If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, a runoff between the top  Republican and Democratic vote-getters, as well as those of any minor parties  in the primary, would occur in mid-February, McCormack said.  </P> <P> Although a special primary and runoff would cost about $300,000 each, there  would be no added expense if the race were put on the ballot in next June's  countywide primary, the registrar said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Law Covering Vacancies  </P> <P> Normally, special elections to fill legislative vacancies are, by law, held  from 112 to 119 days after the openings occur. However, the law also specifies  that, if a regularly scheduled election falls within 180 days of the vacancy,  the race to fill the opening can be consolidated with that election. If  Stirling were to delay his resignation until at least Nov. 27, local election  officials said, the election could be held in June.  </P> <P> Other candidates weighing the possibility of seeking Stirling's seat include  former San Diego City Councilmen Bill Cleator and Mike Gotch, El Cajon Mayor  John Reber, El Cajon Councilwoman Beverly Miller, Santee Councilman Jim  Bartell, El Cajon lawyer Sam Hornreich and Dianne Jacob, a member of the  Jamul-Dulzura Union school board.  </P></p>

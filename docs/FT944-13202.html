			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Derivatives broking takes G&amp;N to Pounds 14m Gerrard &amp; National Holdings, the financial group that owns a discount house, yesterday demonstrated the success of its diversification into stockbroking and derivatives with a 38 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 14.4m for the six months to September 30. The rise comes despite difficult trading conditions in fixed interest markets, which form the core of the traditional discount house activities. Earnings per share were 16.8p, against 14.6p, reflecting the equity increase following the May acquisition of GNI Holdings. The company also announced the first increase in its interim dividend - from 6p to 8p - since 1990. There were no implications for the size of the final dividend, it said. G&amp;N's shares rose 16p to close at 454p, with analysts saying the profits were somewhat better than expected. For the first time, the company has produced its profits on a segmented basis and analysts said they had not expected the sharp increase from the derivatives broking and fund management division. Pre-tax profits from the operation jumped from Pounds 4.44m to Pounds 10.6m. 'This is a very major and very successful diversification, particularly into derivatives broking,' said Mr Philip Gibbs at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The sharp rise reflects increased turnover on domestic and foreign futures exchanges, as well as the relatively high level of performance-related fees that derivatives fund managers such as GNI are able to achieve. However, G&amp;N's discount house activities, where it deals as principal, fell 69 per cent from Pounds 4.09m to Pounds 1.27m.</p>

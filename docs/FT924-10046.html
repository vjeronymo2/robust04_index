			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Trade News: German-US air truce likely today A TEMPORARY truce in the transatlantic German-US air war is expected to be signed today or shortly, transport officials in Bonn say. The deal, due to last a year, should dissuade Germany from unilaterally abrogating its present air transport accord. Recent months have seen a dramatic decline in Lufthansa's share of routes between Germany and the US, in a price-cutting war with the big US carriers. The US transportation department confirmed talks had made 'considerable progress', indicating finalisation of a new agreement likely within a fortnight. The temporary deal will freeze the present capacity of US carriers on transatlantic air routes, and offer Lufthansa, the German state airline, more destinations in the US, aviation industry officials say. But it falls far short of the demand for a substantial cut in capacity of the US carriers on routes to Germany, which is what Lufthansa and the German government are seeking. The existing bilateral pact goes back over four decades. Lufthansa was given the right to serve 12 US cities. In 1978, with subsequent additions. The agreement, meanwhile, gives US airlines fairly widespread access to German airports. Last year, Delta Air Lines, one of the big three US carriers, acquired the former Pan Am assets in continental Europe, presenting Lufthansa with a tougher competitor in its own backyard. Aviation relations seemed to deteriorate in the spring, with the German authorities threatening to limit capacity US carriers could provide between the two countries. Officials said Chancellor Helmut Kohl had written to President George Bush recently, warning that failure to reach agreement might force Germany to terminate the existing pact. The Germans say US carriers are exploiting transatlantic over-capacity to slice their fares, to ensure passengers for their internal US services, where European carriers cannot compete.</p>

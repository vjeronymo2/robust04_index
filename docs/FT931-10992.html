			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Call for public funds to aid stocks JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party yesterday called for more public funds to be used to support stock prices, reflecting widespread concern that the Tokyo market will fall sharply before the close of the fiscal year next month. An LDP committee on economic policy said yesterday only Y1,000bn (Pounds 5.3bn) of a maximum of Y2,820bn in public funds made available last year has flowed into the stock market, and requested an urgent injection of fresh funds. Under an emergency economic package announced last August, managers of postal and other public funds were given more freedom to invest in stocks, up to the Y2,820bn level, but some managers are believed to have chosen other, safer investments. The Ministry of Finance has also attempted to prop up the Tokyo market by urging banks and other financial institutions not to sell stocks before the close of the fiscal year. In the final weeks of a fiscal year, Japanese institutions generally sell stocks to realise profits and bolster their accounts. Members of the LDP committee plan to visit the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which control most of the public funds, and request that the investments be made as soon as possible. However, the ministries have received many complaints from depositors and pension fund members, who fear their money is being used in a risky share support exercise. The ministries say the funds will play a limited role in reviving the market, which will recover only when there is genuine investor demand for stocks. 'People get the wrong idea about the sort of influence we have. If we invest money at the right moment, we can have a limited impact on stock prices, but we can't support the market indefinitely,' the Postal Ministry said. But LDP officials will insist that the two ministries invest the full Y2,820bn in shares by April, and they would like further public funds to be set aside to ensure the longer-term health of the market. The LDP, under pressure from the financial industry, has also begun studying a plan to use public funds to assist the banking industry. There is concern in the party that the banks' own Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company will be unable to cope with the pile of non-performing property loans.</p>

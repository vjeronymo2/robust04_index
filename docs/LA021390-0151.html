			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FAA WANTS BOEING 737 CHANGE  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration today tentatively ordered changes in the  control panels of Boeing 737s to prevent a rudder control problem that is one  focus of an accident hearing under way in New York.  </P> <P> The changes would make it less likely that pilots or cockpit visitors might  accidentally move a rudder trim control knob that could reduce the pilot's  ability to control the plane or force an aborted takeoff, the FAA said.  </P> <P> The work would be relatively simple and cost about $820 per plane, the FAA said  in issuing a proposed airworthiness directive. The directive would become final  after a 60-day period for comment.  </P> <P> The order came as the National Transportation Safety Board opened a four-day  hearing in New York City into the Sept. 20 crash of USAir Flight 5050 that  killed two people. The plane skidded off the end of the LaGuardia Airport  runway into the East River and broke into several pieces in an aborted takeoff,  and investigators are examining a possible rudder control problem.  </P></p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (6): Little steps in self-assertion - Foreign Policy IT was once argued by some Lebanese that the country's strength lay in its weakness: that because it did not have an army, navy or airforce which could possibly pose a threat to anyone, it would be left alone. As a miscalculation it ranges alongside those committed by Saddam Hussein of Iraq during the past dozen years. From the moment that Palestinian fighters, evicted from Jordan by King Hussein, descended on Lebanon in 1970, the country became part of a conflict from which it had successfully stood aloof during successive Middle East wars. Once drawn in, Lebanon became the battleground on which others pursued their own agendas. Not only did it lack the strength to resist, but its own communities willingly became allied to whichever external power offered political and material assistance. Thus, at different moments during the extended crisis, the Maronites welcomed assistance first from the Syrians, then the Israelis and the US, and finally from Iraq. Their involvement fuelled and extended the battle, so that today the future stability of Lebanon rests more than ever on a successful outcome to the Middle East peace process launched in Madrid more than 18 months ago. Lebanon's capacity to influence that outcome is severely limited. The principal result of 17 years of fighting has been to leave Syria as the dominant external force. The regularity with which ministers travel to Damascus illustrates the extent to which important decisions depend on the approval of Syria. Whether Damascus views Lebanon as part of a greater Syria, or principally as a strategic buffer against Israeli attack, makes little difference. The one clear, consistent aim of Syria under President Hafez al-Assad has been to ensure that no other external force exercises greater influence in Beirut. It has succeeded, to the chagrin of many Lebanese. But many more have come to accept the necessity of accommodating Syria, as the lesser of many evils. In the longer term, however, the desire of most Lebanese is for Syria to withdraw its troops in conjunction with an Israeli pullback from the southern strip in the south which it has held since 1978. Mr Rafik Hariri believes that once the security situation in the country is assured Syria itself will not wish to remain. The key difference between the two foreign presences is that there is a UN Security Council resolution (425) demanding the withdrawal of Israel, but there are agreements signed by the Beirut government accepting the Syrian presence. These are enshrined in the 1989 Taif agreement and the subsequent 1991 Treaty of Brotherhood, Co-operation and Co-ordination. The latter document sets out a scheme for extensive political, economic and military links between the two countries, including the creation of a supreme council on which the presidents of the two countries would sit. The council, which has yet to be officially formed, is supplemented by a series of sub-committees covering issues such as foreign relations, defence and the economy that would meet every two months, together with a general secretariat to follow up the implementation of agreements. The third, rather more indirect presence in Lebanon, is that of Iran. Through its funding of Hizbollah, the regime in Tehran can influence developments, at least for so long as Israel's troops and its local allies remain in a southern strip of Lebanese territory. The arrangement currently suits Syria, insofar as it is linked to the Middle East peace process. Syria was also the only Arab country to ally itself with Iran during Tehran's eight year war with Iraq, a policy largely dictated by Hafez al-Assad's fierce rivalry with Saddam Hussein. However, Syria has been careful to ensure that it remains the only conduit between Iran and its Lebanese allies. Despite the return of many international airlines to Beirut, there seems to be little possibility of Iran being allowed to reopen direct flights to Lebanon. The assumption among many diplomats in Beirut is that there will be no significant diminution of Hizbollah military activity while the peace talks show little sign of progress. Equally, Syria will not pull its forces out of Beirut for fear it would be seen as a concession to Israel. Any changes in this intricate network of Middle East relations are bound to have an impact on Lebanon which the government in Beirut is largely powerless to influence. It will be watching with particular concern the evolution of American Middle East policy in the wake of the missile attack on Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad. The US determination to respond vigorously to Iraqi provocation, while also urging its allies 'to contain' Iran - which it describes as foremost sponsor of international terrorism - seems likely to increase tension between those countries and the regional governments they identify as American supporters. While the US is making a modest contribution to rebuilding the Lebanese army and the civil administration, it is maintaining its ban on Americans travelling to the country without the express permission of the State Department. It argues that those responsible for the earlier devastating attacks on US personnel and facilities are still alive and well, and living in Lebanon. Mr Hariri's immediate refusal last December to accept the 415 Palestinians expelled by Israel from the West Bank and Gaza offered the first indication in years that Beirut had the confidence to act unilaterally. But for it ever to adopt a more consistently independent foreign policy will require a lasting solution of the region's most durable conflicts.</p>

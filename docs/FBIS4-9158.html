			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Lezhe KOHA JONE in Albanian on 20 April  on pages one and two carries three 500-word correspondents'  reports from Tirana, Korce, and Gjirokaster under the general  headline "Greek Minority Leaders Detained by the Police." Bari  GAZETA SHQIPTARE in Albanian on 20 April carries a 300-word "Fa.  Ba." report from Sarande entitled "`Omonia' Activists From the  South Detained." Tirana RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE and ZERI I  POPULLIT in Albanian on 20 April make no mention of the  detention of Greek minority leaders.    T. Cela writes in KOHA JONE, "According to information  reaching our editorial office late in the evening of 18 April as  well as yesterday morning, the main leaders of Omonia and the  Human Rights Defense Party (PDNJ), which is represented in  parliament, have been detained by the police in some southern  districts and in Tirana."    Cela later continues, "It seems that interstate tensions  have  this time not spared these two organizations, whose leaders have  taken up the defense of the Greek minority in Albania. Only a  few days ago, in one of the zigzags that have characterized the  Albanian official attitude, President Berisha stated that the  deterioration of relations between the two neighbors would not  influence the Albanian Government's attitude to the Greek  minority."    Interviewed by Cela, PDNJ Chairman Vasil Melo is reported as  declaring, "I cannot say anything or give any explanation of  what has happened. I have been told on the phone from  Gjirokaster about some detentions. I know that Mr. Andrea  Marto, deputy chairman of Omonia in Tirana, was detained on  Monday [18 April] evening, and that documentation was taken from  the Omonia offices."    Reporting from Korce under the headline "Omonia Chairman  Detained by the Police," Z. Dule writes:    "The homes of the leaders of Omonia in the districts of  Devoll, Pogradec, and Kolonje have been searched. Mrs Ermioni  Andrea, Omonia chairwoman in Korce; Jani Mulas, Omonia deputy  chairman; Kostandina Tushi, Omonia secretary; Niko Mongoleci,  chairman of the Albanian-Greek Friendship Association; Gjerkji  Leka, chairman of the PDNJ; and Stefan Papa, member of the PDNJ  Presidium, all became the targets of a large scale operation by  the ShIK [National Intelligence Service] and the police in the  early hours of the night of 18-19 April. It was 2200 on Monday  evening when a group of ShIK agents and policemen knocked at Mrs  Ermioni Andrea's door. `After we opened the door, seven people  -- five civilians and two policemen -- came in,' Mr. Sotiraq  Andrea, husband of the chairwoman of Omonia in Korce, explained  to KOHA JONE, 'After identifying themselves, they started  searching the apartment, ransacking everything. They took with  them books, magazines, and dictionaries in Greek. When they  left, the ShIK agents also took Mrs Ermione Andrea, on the  pretext that they wanted to search the Omonia office.' On  Tuesday Mr. Andrea learned of his wife's fate when he asked the  police. `They told me that they had set off for Tirana at 1400,  having found compromising material in the office,' Mr. Andrea  said, not excluding the possibility that the ShIK itself might  have planted material with anticonstitutional contents in the  office. The apartment of Mr. Niko Mungoleci, chairman of the  Albanian-Greek friendship Association, was searched, and he was  also detained. Searches were also carried out of the family of  Mr. Jani Mula, deputy chairman of Omonia; in the family of  Omonia secretary Kostandina Tusha, wife of the well-known  painter Vangjush Tusha; in the homes of PDNJ Chairman Gjergji  Leka and PDNJ Presidium member Stefan Papa, etc. `We are  worried about our father,' Mr. Stefan Papa's son told KOHA JONE.  When the search was carried out on the night of 18 April, he was  in Salonika. He reported to the police on the morning of 19  April. Besides this, the Omonia chairmen in Devoli, Kolonje, and  Pogradec have been subjected to searches and taken in for  questioning. We did not succeed in obtaining any official  confirmation because the operation is still continuing. Nor is  the exact number of those detained known, because it is still  unknown whether they will be arrested following their detention  and accused of anticonstitutional activities."    An unnamed KOHA JONE correspondent in Gjirokaster writes,  "The police made a series of detentions in some homes of Omonia  leaders in Gjirokaster late on 18 April. We have learned that  Theodori Bezhani, Omonia chairman for Gjirokaster District;  Kosta Oirjako, resident of the village of Dervican; Irakli  Sirmo, and others have been detained. We have also learned that  there have been detentions of Greek-minority Albanian citizens  in Tepelene and Sarande. On Tuesday, police officials arrived  from Tirana and took the detainees to the capital. Trying to  find out more about this operation and the reason behind these  detentions, a police officer involved in this lightning  operation confirmed to us, `A U.S.-type rifle and a considerable  number of hunting cartridges were found in Mr. Behani's house,  and it is not known whether he possessed a permit.' We have  also learned that his home contained a considerable amount of  literature covered by the Law on Anticonstitutional Activity.  This literature included calendars showing maps of the  so-called Vorio-Epiros of 1914, and maps showing this area's  borders as mentioned in the aforementioned literature. A few  bullets and anticonstitutional literature were also found in  Kosta Qirjako's house. Nevertheless, the police have still not  confirmed the precise reason for these citizens' detention.  Similarly, nothing is known about the detentions of the  Greek-minority citizens in Tepelene and Sarabde except that they  are connected with the work of the Greek-minority political  organization in Albania. News of these detentions was followed  with very great interest in Greece yesterday. All the  television stations and daily papers gave reports, without  explaining the charges behind these detentions. Nor have the  Omonia leaders issued any statement about the reasons for the  detentions, despite our correspondent's insistence."</p>

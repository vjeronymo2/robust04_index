Special research  conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs shows that there  are now approximately 400,000 users of narcotics in the state.    Over the past year staffers of the West Ukrainian Internal  Affairs Transport Administration alone, who serve the Lvov  Railroad, have exposed 874 cases of the acquisition, keeping,  and transportation of narcotics and have instituted criminal  proceedings against 656 people and administrative proceedings  against 160. Of the 7.5 tonnes of raw drugs confiscated on  Ukraine's railroads, the Lvov main line has accounted for almost  three tonnes. Operational workers have established 30 sources  of drug sales.    More than one tonne of poppy straw has already been  confiscated in 1994, and many possessors of raw drugs have been  exposed and arrested. "Carpathian poppies" are brought mainly  into Ukraine's Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kherson, Nikolayev, and  Lugansk Oblasts and also into the Caucasus.    Great anxiety is occasioned by the fact that drug dealers  have started working according to the "team method." More than  70 such groups have already been arrested. The  arrestees--mainly unemployed young people under the age of  35--include over 100 with previous convictions and also 92 who  are citizens of other states.</p>

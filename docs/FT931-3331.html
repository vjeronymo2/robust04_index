			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Olivetti Olivetti's rights issue has the look of a company sticking its finger in the dyke. The L900bn raised has to be set against a declared loss last year of L650bn and provisions for restructuring over the last three years of L700bn. While the issue will wipe out net debt, computer prices are still falling, so further cost-cutting will surely be necessary. Even Olivetti has tacitly accepted that investors may not be keen by pitching the issue at the deepest discount legally allowed. Larger and more august companies than Olivetti have been humbled by the collapse in computer manufacturing margins. While further price falls may be limited as worldwide capacity is cut, it is hard to see European companies becoming the lowest cost producers against Far Eastern competition. And with most of the value being added at the chip level by US firms, assemblers such as Olivetti will struggle. The future of European production is thus far from certain. Even Olivetti's alliance with DEC may not give it much muscle in the expanding Risc chip market. DEC, meanwhile, can contemplate its purchase of a 4 per cent stake last summer at L8,000 per share, which it can now add to by taking up its rights at L1,000 each.</p>

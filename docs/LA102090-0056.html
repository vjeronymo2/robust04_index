			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON PARTY ACTS TO GAIN SPOT ON BALLOT;  </P> <P> POLITICS: GROUP NAMED AFTER CHICAGO'S FIRST BLACK MAYOR HAS DEMOCRATS WORRIED  IT MAY HELP GOP AT POLLS.  </P> <P> Harold Washington died almost three years ago, but in the raucous world of  Chicago politics his name -- if not, perhaps, his spirit -- lives on in the  form of a now-you-see-it-now-you-don't political party that could cause major  problems for Chicago Democrats.  </P> <P> The all-black Harold Washington Party, named after the city's first black  mayor, was formed last year by Alderman Timothy C. Evans, a Washington protege  who waged an unsuccessful mayoral campaign as an independent. In its current  incarnation, the party is trying to get a countywide slate of candidates on the  Nov. 6 ballot.  </P> <P> What has Cook County Democrats worried is the possibility that the party will  help Republicans get elected -- perchance from the governorship on down -- by  siphoning black voters away from the Democrats. Increasing the concern is the  fact that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Neil Hartigan is running no better  than neck-and-neck with Republican Jim Edgar.  </P> <P> The Illinois Supreme Court took the Washington Party off the ballot last week,  upholding a lower court ruling that the party did not collect enough signatures  on its petitions in suburban areas.  </P> <P> But party organizers, bitterly decrying what they call the mistreatment of  blacks by the Democratic organization, vowed to fight down to the wire and take  the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary to get on the ballot.  </P> <P> Sometimes it seems that damaging the Democratic Party is the Washington Party's  primary goal, so strong is the anger party organizers hold toward regular  Democrats, whom they accuse of mistreating and neglecting the black community.  </P> <P> Blatant racial appeals are nothing new to Chicago. In 1987, white mayoral  candidate Thomas C. Hynes formed a white-based third party in reaction to the  Democrats' renomination of Washington as the party's candidate.  </P> <P> It is a truism here that whites vote for white candidates and blacks for black  candidates. But R. Eugene Pincham, a former Illinois appellate judge and the  titular head of the Washington Party, argues in a lengthy treatise, entitled  "Why the Harold Washington Party," that the organization was formed because the  truism actually is false.  </P> <P> Historically, blacks, who make up about half of the city's population, voted  overwhelmingly for the Democratic-endorsed candidates even though the vast  majority of those candidates were white and did little for the black community  once they were elected, he says.  </P> <P> "The attitude, perception and reality that African-Americans have no  alternative -- no place to go -- must be eliminated, completely and  permanently," Pincham argues.  </P> <P> Creation of the Harold Washington Party has drawn criticism from Democratic  politicians, white and black, who say inclusiveness, not isolation, was the  lesson of Washington's election as Chicago's first black mayor.  </P> <P> But antipathy toward the Democratic Party has grown so strong in some quarters  of the black community that the Washington Party at times has resembled nothing  less than a kamikaze assault on the Democrats.  </P> <P> If the party does not succeed in getting on the ballot, party officials hint  that they will urge supporters to vote Republican or for write-in candidates.  </P> <P> "I won't kowtow to a party that's trying to destroy this community," Pincham  said at a press conference.  </P></p>

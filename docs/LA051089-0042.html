			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 SCRIPPS CLINIC RESEARCHERS ARE SEEN AIDING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Two biochemists with key expertise in the field of drug design have accepted  positions at the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, a development that will  strengthen the scientific center's effort to turn its basic research into  commercially marketable products.  </P> <P> In addition, the scientists could augment the institution's continuing work to  create and produce man-made enzymes that Scripps researchers hope could  revolutionize industrial processes worldwide.  </P> <P> The two researchers, who are to assume positions as full faculty members -- the  equivalent of full professorships in academia -- are:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shapes of Proteins  </P> <P> * Jeffrey Skolnick, 35, a professor of chemistry at Washington University in  St. Louis and a specialist in protein structure. Skolnick uses computers to  determine the specific shapes into which proteins fold themselves to do the  work they perform inside a cell.  </P> <P> This structural work is considered essential to finding useful new drugs by  designing them rationally, rather than by the conventional method of randomly  testing promising chemicals. It also could lead to the design of "better"  proteins, such as enzymes that would function outside the normal biological  range of temperature and acidity.  </P> <P> * Chi-Huey Wong, 40, a biochemist and professor at Texas A &amp; M University.  Wong specializes in using enzymes, the molecules that are the cell's natural  chemistry factory, to make peptides, proteins and carbohydrates necessary  </P> <P> for life.  </P> <P> Both are expected to establish labs, complete with postdoctoral researchers and  doctoral students they will bring with them, at Scripps in June. A shortage of  lab space will require some other researchers to set up labs in rented space at  a nearby biotechnology company, Gen-Probe, said William H. Beers, associate  director of the research institute.  </P> <P> Eventually, the two might have laboratories in a new Scripps building being  planned across North Torrey Pines Road from the institute's current facilities,  Beers said.  </P> <P> Skolnick's expertise lies in protein structure theory, a field in which he will  rely on the massive computing capability available with the Scripps Cray  supercomputer, Beers said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Root of Malfunctions  </P> <P> Protein structure is key to designing drugs rationally because too little or  too much of a particularly shaped protein is often at the root of malfunctions  in the body. If a protein's shape were known, chemists could then design  another molecule to lock into that structure as a therapeutic drug.  </P> <P> Skolnick received his doctorate in 1978 from Yale University and has been at  Washington University since 1985. Both he and Wong have received the  prestigious Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship.  </P> <P> Wong joined the Texas A &amp; M faculty in 1983 after completing his doctorate  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He became a full professor in  1987. Wong's awards include selection as a Presidential Young Investigator, a  program in which the nation's most promising young researchers are given  no-strings-attached grants of $125,000 to help them get started.  </P> <P> His emphasis on using natural or modified enzymes to create chemicals can be  expected to be important to Scripps' efforts to create rationally designed  drugs.  </P> <P> Within the past five years, Scripps has been turning from its past emphasis on  basic research in immunology and adding molecular biologists and chemists as  part of its effort to produce commercial products. Officials there reiterate  their commitment to basic research and immunology, but say it is time to also  turn the institute's years of fruitful basic research into products that will  help people.  </P> <P> However, the shift also will mean increasing patent revenues for the institute,  as well as increased donations from companies interested in marketing any  breakthrough products Scripps produces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Catalytic Antibodies  </P> <P> Wong and Skolnick's expertise also could prove key in a team that has been  assembled by Dr. Richard Lerner, director of the Research Institute of Scripps  Clinic, to create commercially valuable catalytic antibodies.  </P> <P> The group led by Lerner has published several scientific papers in recent years  cataloguing steady progress toward using immunological techniques to design  antibodies that will catalyze chemical reactions.  </P> <P> The hope is that these synthetic enzymes can be created to accomplish chemical  processes for which no enzymes have ever been available.  </P> <P> Known as abzymes -- a hybrid of antibody and enzyme -- these substances would  have to be first designed and tested by immunologists and by chemists such as  Wong and Skolnick. Then Scripps' plant molecular biologists would be poised to  design a gene that would produce the abzyme and insert it into plants, which  eventually could be grown as a crop and harvested for the abzyme.  </P> <P> Although scientists say such a chain of events is complicated and years away,  commercial production of abzymes is a tantalizing possibility toward which  Lerner has been steadily moving Scripps since taking over as institute director  in January, 1987.  </P></p>

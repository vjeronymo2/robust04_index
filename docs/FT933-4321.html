			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Privatisation of BR will go ahead, MacGregor reaffirms THE determination of the gov-ernment to proceed with the privatisation of British Rail, despite criticism from some Tory backbenchers, was reaffirmed last night by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. He clearly indicated that the Commons would be asked to overturn the amendment made to the railways bill by the House of Lords. The alterations made by the Lords would permit BR to bid for franchises to operate passenger services. The amendment, which the government claims would undermine the whole franchising process, received favourable comments from Tory backbenchers representing constituencies in the south-east who are worried about the implications of privatisation for commuter fares. With its majority reduced by recent by-election reverses, even a small rebellion by Tory backbenchers would cause anxiety for the government because the amendment is certain to have the backing of most opposition MPs. In a speech to leaders of the CBI last night, Mr MacGregor looked to individual BR managers to join private-sector interests in the franchising process. He forecast that it would bring competition and induce pressures to raise quality, attract custom, and reduce costs. Mr MacGregor described franchises as the best way of bringing together the experience of existing BR managers and the best from the private sector. He said: 'Each franchisee will have an incentive to improve his efficiency and profits within the terms of the franchise specification. And he knows he will have to compete with newcomers at the next franchise round.' Mr MacGregor maintained that privatisation would create a railway industry responsive to market forces where previously there had been a bureaucratic monolith answerable to ministerial or bureaucratic edict. He suggested that many of the franchises were likely to be owned by companies or consortia with local and regional interests. Stressing that bus operators were interested in franchises, Mr MacGregor said they were 'natural investments for finance or service companies with strong regional connections'.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Daewoo buys stake in Indian truckmaker Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate and the country's third-largest carmaker, is to buy a majority stake in DCM-Toyota, an Indian truckmaker, Reuter reports from New Delhi. It is planning to transform the ailing company into a profitable car manufacturer. Mr Shiv Awasthi, managing director of DCM-Toyota, said that a shareholders' meeting next Thursday was expected to approve a capital restructuring and a change in the company's name to DCM-Daewoo Motors. 'There was a need for a strategy to broaden the product range for (sales) volume and sustainable growth,' he said. Several leading carmakers are gaining a foothold in the Indian auto industry in competition with Suzuki, the most established producer in India. They include General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen. DCM-Toyota incurred sustained losses as the market for its lightweight trucks was hit by a rising yen that increased manufacturing costs, and by competition in India from rival Japanese vehicle makers Mazda, Nissan and Mitsubishi. Daewoo is planning to start with an investment of Dollars 15m to Dollars 18m but will inject Dollars 200m by 1997 and Dollars 600m to Dollars 1bn by 2000, initially to make the latest of its Racer range of 1500cc cars for the Indian market, said Mr Awasthi. 'Korea is now enjoying the price competitiveness which Japan enjoyed 15 years ago,' he said. Daewoo plans to start production by September 1995, and its first car is expected to roll off the assembly by the following December. 'We are planning 25,000 cars in the first year and possibly 100,000 by the year 2000,' said Mr Awasthi. Toyota has brokered a revival package under which Daewoo will buy 51 per cent of the company, while Toyota's holding will be reduced to half of its current 17 per cent. India's DCM, whose current holding is 56 per cent, will hold at least 28 per cent, he said. The equity base of the new company will be increased from Rs450m to more than Rs910m (Dollars 29m). DCM and Daewoo are both optimistic about the prospects for India's car market, which they expect to grow from 220,000 to 230,000 cars per year at present to 600,000 by 2000.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: BSN buys stake in New Zealand meat company BSN, the French foods group, is extending its interests in New Zealand by paying NZDollars 19.2m (USDollars 10.3m) for a 20 per cent shareholding in Best Corporation, the processed meat company. Best, which is controlled by the founding Huljich family, said that BSN would become involved through a special placement of shares at NZDollars 3.25. Best is also planning a one-for-10 rights issue. The Huljich family plan to pass their rights to the issue to BSN. After the issue and placement, Huljich family interests would hold 50.1 per cent of the shares and BSN 20 per cent. However, BSN has also been given an option to increase its shareholding over time to 40 per cent. BSN is already one of the largest food groups in New Zealand, following the recent purchase of Nabisco's biscuit, margarine and edible oils business. Best said that the company's next result would be lower than forecast, reflecting 'delays and abnormal costs' in entering new export markets. The company also said that it was buying its Australian associated company, Best Pacific Corporation, for NZDollars 2.5m. Fletcher Challenge, the forestry and resources group, has appointed Mr Kerry Hoggard, last year's New Zealand business executive of the year, to its board. Fletcher is New Zealand's third-largest company by stock market value.</p>

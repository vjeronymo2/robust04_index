			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: Nato lays to rest its past ambiguity on Bosnia Nato's ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to pull back their artillery from the vicinity of Sarajevo or face air-strikes marks a turning point. For the first time in the 22-month-old civil war, the alliance has committed itself to using force according to a clearly defined set of criteria. The ambiguity of past communiques has gone. The ultimatum may also come to be seen as the moment when Nato stopped the rot in its own house and started to fashion a new, productive military co-operation between the US and France, the two countries that made the running throughout nearly 13 hours of talks last Wednesday. The carnage wrought by a mortar attack on Sarajevo market last weekend undoubtedly created a political tailwind in favour of action; but a second calculation in Brussels was the damage to Nato's credibility if the alliance failed to live up to its own promises to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo. As one senior Nato diplomat said: 'There was a recognition that there was a risk to the alliance . . . . That led people to say 'We have got to come to terms with this now'.' Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, expressed a mixture of delight and relief that Nato unity had come through virtually unscathed (with the exception of Greece 'disassociating' itself from the decision without blocking it). 'This is a historic moment. It is a decisive moment in the life of the alliance.' But Mr Worner made clear that he was not predicting that Nato, the alliance founded in 1949 to defend western Europe against communism, would soon be moving into a combat role in former Yugoslavia. Like President Bill Clinton and other western leaders, Mr Worner hopes that the mere threat of Nato warplanes will be enough to clear the hills of Serb and Bosnian government artillery, establishing a firmer basis for a permanent ceasefire and a more promising start for a political settlement built around the demilitarisation of Sarajevo. Diplomats at Nato headquarters have over the past week suggested there is little appetite for protracted air strikes; still less is there a desire to commit the extra ground forces needed to consolidate bombed terrain. The extent of Franco-American co-operation in the drafting of the ultimatum was at first sight remarkable, given recent public squabbling. The Clinton administration's opposition to commit troops to the UN peace-keeping effort while reserving its own position on the UN-European plan for a political settlement is partly to blame; but so too is France's long-standing ambiguous attitude to Nato itself, where it is a political member but remains outside the military command. Lately, however, Paris has shown signs of re-evaluating its position on Nato, recognising that for the moment it remains the best security bet in town. This week, France and the US worked hand-in-glove as great powers and the smaller states followed. Britain kept quiet. It would be easy, but wrong, to read this passivity as one more sign of strained relations with the Clinton administration. For as one UK diplomat observed, there is no greater interest for Washington and London at the moment than binding France further into Nato, the one organisation which guarantees US engagement in the affairs of the continent.</p>

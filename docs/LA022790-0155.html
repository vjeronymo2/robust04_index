			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FED CHIEF WARNS AGAINST CHANGES IN SOCIAL SECURITY  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that a controversial  proposal to cut the Social Security tax would hamper efforts to reduce the  federal budget deficit and warned lawmakers not to tinker with the retirement  system.  </P> <P> Greenspan said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee that he also  opposes plans to move the retirements benefit program off the federal budget.  </P> <P> "I am concerned that they will ultimately be counterproductive and hamper the  efforts needed to meet our longer-term fiscal responsibilities," he said.  </P> <P> In opposing the proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) to reduce the  Social Security tax, the Fed chairman sided with President Bush, who urged  Congress in his State of the Union address not to change the system.  </P> <P> "Assuming that benefits evolve according to existing laws -- and that Social  Security revenues are set aside rather than used to lower other taxes or raise  other outlays -- the system moves in the direction of actuarial soundness; it  confers no windfall gains or unforeseen losses on any particular generation,"  Greenspan said.  </P> <P> Moynihan has argued that his proposal would end the charade in which the  surplus for Social Security created by payroll taxes makes the federal budget  deficit appear far smaller than it actually is.  </P> <P> Greenspan said he is sympathetic to Moynihan's frustration with the slowness of  deficit reduction and the fact that Social Security trust funds are used to  mask the size of the deficit, but said, "I regret that I disagree with his  solution."  </P> <P> The proposed tax cut would mainly benefit middle-income Americans. But it would  add $55 billion to the fiscal 1991 budget deficit unless other taxes were  increased or government spending were cut by that amount.  </P> <P> Greenspan, chairman of a blue-ribbon task force that recommended Social  Security reforms adopted in 1983, said Moynihan's proposal does not address the  fundamental problems facing the U.S. economy.  </P></p>

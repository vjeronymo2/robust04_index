			<p>BFN     [Text] The first active phase of the operation designed to  clear the gorges of Garm Region from armed opposition groups was  concluded on Friday [17 June].    As INTERFAX learned from Tajikistan's Deputy Defence  Minister, Major-General Aleksandr Chubarov, the operation  involved army units and troops from the Tajik Security and  Interior Ministries, who were supported by helicopters and  armored vehicles.    Garm Region lies high in the mountains. Because of its  complicated terrain it can be dominated by small mobile groups  of armed men. That is why it is viewed as a bulwark of the  opposition.    As Chubarov said, during the operation 48 men were detained  in the area of military actions, and handed over to the Security  Ministry. Some of them were soon set free, since it was proved  that they had no connection with the opposition. About 30 units  of firearms, several grenade throwers, a British-made  transmitter, and a large quantity of ammunition were discovered  in secret caches hidden in the mountains. A center for training  opposition militants was destroyed in a locality lying north of  the village of Hait.    Participants in the operation are categorically forbidden to  use "any types of weapons against population centers," and  therefore there were no civilian casualties, Chubarov stressed.    He does not share the belief that the present confrontation  in Tajikistan may grow into a long guerrilla warfare.    "If we manage to ensure reliable protection for our borders,  find effective solutions to political issues, including problems  connected with interaction between the various areas of  Tajikistan, and conclude the first stage of building our armed  forces this year, we'll be able to accomplish, together with  Security and Interior Ministries, the task of preventing the  opposition from acting on Tajikistan's border and within the  country," the general said.</p>

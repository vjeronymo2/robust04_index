			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVASION COULD GIVE IRAQ KEY TO ENDING HOSTAGE CRISIS  </P> <P> The Iraqi blitzkrieg of neighboring Kuwait, a crushing jolt to intra-Arab  relations, could incidentally affect one of the Middle East's most agonizing  dramas, the fate of the foreign hostages in Lebanon.  </P> <P> By seizing power in Kuwait city, the Iraqi military presumably fell heir to a  number of Kuwaiti-held prisoners who are a key element of the hostage issue.  </P> <P> The 15 prisoners are Shiite Muslim militants who were imprisoned in Kuwait for  various terrorist acts including bomb attacks on the U.S. and French embassies  in December, 1983. The six car bombings left six people dead and dozens  wounded. The prisoners -- two others were released in February, 1989, after  serving their five-year sentences -- are a mixture of nationalities, mostly  Iraqi and Lebanese. At least one of the Lebanese is related to Lebanon's  notorious Mughniyah clan.  </P> <P> The Mughniyahs and another family, the Hamadis, form the core of the militant  factions of Hezbollah (Party of God), the Lebanese Shiite organization held  responsible by Western intelligence for the wave of kidnapings that began in  Beirut in 1984. The demands of the kidnapers almost invariably called for the  release of the Kuwaiti prisoners.  </P> <P> In Washington, U.S. officials said they had not been able to determine whether  the Shiite prisoners are now under the control of Iraq and whether they have  been taken to Baghdad. The officials said they are seeking information through  several channels.  </P> <P> It is not clear that Iraqi control of the prisoners would improve their  prospects of release and any consequent change in the stalemate over American  hostages.  </P> <P> While Kuwait has turned aside all overtures to release or trade the prisoners,  analysts said there seems to be little reason to believe that the Baghdad  government would take a softer position. Iran, a non-Arab and Shiite nation,  would welcome such a move. But Iraq remains hostile to Iran and has taken  brutal steps to suppress the Shiite population within its own borders.  </P> <P> Of a possible break in the deadlock over the American hostages, Estelle  Ronneburg, mother of hostage Jesse Turner, expressed mixed feelings. "I'm  hoping so, but I wouldn't want it to be at the expense of the people of  Kuwait," she said in a telephone interview from her home in Boise, Ida.  </P> <P> Thomas Cicippio, brother of hostage Joseph J. Cicippio, said from his home in  Norristown, Pa., that he "had high hopes that something might break this month"  but is not optimistic that this is the hoped-for development.  </P> <P> The presumed fall of the prisoners into Iraqi hands comes on the heels of  another significant development potentially affecting the foreign hostages in  Lebanon, who include six Americans. A week ago, the French government freed a  Lebanese guerrilla, Anis Naccache, who had been sentenced for killing two  people in a failed attempt to assassinate former Iranian Prime Minister  Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris in 1980.  </P> <P> The Iranian government has long demanded freedom for Naccache, and his release  was interpreted as a French move to break through the hostage crisis.  </P> <P> Iranian leaders have influence with Hezbollah and were credited with helping  win the release of American hostages Robert Polhill and Frank H. Reed in April.  </P> <P> But whether the release of Naccache and the Iraqi control of the Kuwait  prisoners might lead to additional hostage releases is uncertain, particularly  in the case of the Kuwait 15.  </P> <P> Would Iraq's Saddam Hussein free them, triggering movement on the hostage  drama? Arguments can be made in either direction:  </P> <P> In the tangled Lebanese equation, Iraq cast its lot with the Christian forces,  sending arms to renegade Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun in last year's struggle with the  occupying Syrian army in Lebanon. To do a favor for the anti-Aoun Hezbollah  would make little political sense.  </P> <P> For the record, Iraq has maintained that it opposes hostage-taking -- although  some political observers in Britain insist that the Iranian-born journalist  Farzad Bazoft, who was executed by Iraq on spy charges while reporting for a  British newspaper, was little more than an Iraqi hostage.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Hussein might seek to cleanse his brutish reputation by  releasing the prisoners and claiming credit for any resultant freeing of the  foreign hostages in Beirut. He recently freed a British nurse who was jailed as  an accomplice of Bazoft, ostensibly on a plea for clemency from Zambian  President Kenneth D. Kaunda, who declared in turn that Hussein was a  misunderstood man.  </P> <P> Analysts of Hussein's actions, however, insist that his every move is carefully  considered. And while the hostages remain an emotional issue, Hussein is now  playing for major stakes in Arab power. Release of the Kuwait prisoners would  likely be read as a cynical attempt to erase the stain of the invasion.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Don Shannon and Robin Wright in Washington contributed to  this article.  </P></p>

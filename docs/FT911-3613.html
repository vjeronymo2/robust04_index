			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Capital spending hits VTR profit Higher interest charges made inroads into interim profits at VTR, the USM-quoted video editing and audio-visual house, resulting in a pre-tax figure of Pounds 432,000, against Pounds 601,000. Mr Philip Lovegrove, chairman, explained that the rise in charges from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 124,000 was a direct consequence of the capital investment programme. No further large capital expenditure was planned for the rest of the year. Mr Lovegrove said both Video Tape Recording and AV Department increased their revenue, despite difficult trading conditions. Turnover rose to Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 2.71m). Earnings per share came to 3.7p (5p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.2p (1.1p).</p>

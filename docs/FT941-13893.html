			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Sport: An uncertain start - Tennis The great appeal of sport is its uncertainty. When Steffi Graf is two service breaks down in the third set against Jana Novotna in the Wimbledon final, you wonder, can she escape? When England are three points ahead of New Zealand at Twickenham with five minutes to go you ask, can they hold out? When Australia have lost nine wickets against England at Lords and need 10 runs in the last two overs for victory, you agonise, will they survive? The uncertainty principle was at work this week in Melbourne. I do not remember as exciting an opening to a Grand Slam Championship as we have had during the first three days of the Ford Australian Open. On three successive days in the first round the three top ranked men in the world were all in serious danger of losing. Two survived, but only just. The third was beaten. There was no clue on day one that the two-time defending champion, Jim Courier, seeded three, would have any trouble from fellow American, Bryan Shelton, the first black player to win a tournament since Arthur Ashe. True, they had never played before but, with a world ranking down from a high of 55 in 1992 to 99, the 28-year-old Shelton was hardly expected to offer more than token resistance to the toughest match player in the business. Enter the uncertainty principle. Courier was not quite ready for a full frontal assault from a serve-and-volley terrier who had decided to risk all on big shots, even if it meant conceding points on extravagant errors. It almost worked. From the first ball Shelton chipped and charged, lunged and leapt with an enthusiasm that was infectious. Even before he broke the champion in the ninth game Shelton had won over his Aussie audience. They like a scrapper, and they showed it as Shelton won the set 6-4. 'I was thoroughly enjoying the experience and I think they saw that in my face,' he said later. Courier regrouped in the second set and swept through it in 43 minutes. This was more like it] A break in the opening game of the third set should have cracked Shelton's spirit. Not a bit of it] He broke back at once, survived four break points on his own serve in the ninth game and then raced to 6-1 in the tie-break. Courier clawed back to 4-6 but was powerless as Shelton pounced on a short ball to ram a forehand volley fast and true across the advancing Courier. Order was restored in the fourth set as Courier brought himself level. No-one was ready for what followed. Courier was broken in the opening game of the fifth. Shelton raced to 3-1 and then had the champion 0-40 on his serve. An upset was about to happen. Enter the uncertainty principle. In spite of a 14th double fault, Courier wriggled free and held his serve. Shelton was broken in the next game as he delivered a 19th double fault. The momentum had swung to Courier and he broke again in the last game for a 4-6 6-1 6-7 6-2 6-4 victory that had spanned four hours and 42 thrilling minutes. 'At 3-1 I was already preparing my acceptance speech,' said the loser. 'But Jim played well and I've got to hand it to him - when the chips were down he played some great shots.' On day two it was the turn of another black American to step into the spotlight. MaliVai Washington, a 24-year-old right-hander, ranked 26th in the world, had lost all four of his matches against Michael Stich. Their latest meeting, at last December's Grand Slam Cup had been a simple 6-3 6-1 affair. But in Melbourne in 1992 Washington had led by two sets to love. No one, least of all Washington, was quite prepared for Stich's poor form. The hero of Germany's recent Davis Cup success and the winner of last year's ATP Tour Championship should have been brimful of confidence. But his normally reliable backhand simply refused to function and his serve was not the lethal weapon it has been. Washington had something to spare in his 7-6 6-3 3-6 6-2 victory. 'It's the best win I've had in a long time and it's nice to beat the number two guy in the world,' he said. Stich had no excuses: 'He hung in there and didn't make as many unforced errors as I made. I just played a terrible match.' On Wednesday when an unheralded Russian, 19-year-old Yevgeny Kafelnikov from the Black Sea town of Sochi, pushed the world No 1 Pete Sampras to the limit. After dividing the first four sets they produced some dazzling tennis in a fifth. Tall and slight, the fair-haired Kafelnikov returned the Sampras serve with impudent assurance. A 3-1 American lead was wiped out with some glorious driving that had Sampras shaking his head in disbelief. 'He has some of the best groundies I've ever played against,' said Sampras. 'He's going to be in the top 20, if not better, in the next couple of years.' With Kafelnikov leading 5-4, Sampras was just two points from defeat on his service. The reigning Wimbledon and US Open champion refused to panic and won the next two points. The 6-5 lead to Kafelnikov became 6-6 with another solid American service game. After a long struggle Sampras broke for 7-6. This, surely was the end. With remarkable coolness the youngster hit three stunning returns. Now it was 7-7. How would it end? The question was answered in the next game when Kafelnikov tried to stretch his cramping left leg. He could no longer find the service power that had embarrassed Sampras. The Russian lost his serve and was powerless against two huge Sampras aces as the American held serve for victory. 'It was a big scare for me . . . I could easily have lost that match,' he said. This inspiring match had lasted three hours, 25 minutes with the result in doubt until the last. Long live uncertainty]</p>

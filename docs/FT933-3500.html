			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Sale of Post points way back to China: Simon Holberton on the Malaysian purchase of HK's English-language newspaper HONG KONG passed another milestone on its journey back to China over the weekend with the sale of the colony's leading English-language newspaper to Chinese interests. Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation sold 34.9 per cent of the South China Morning Post, which has been published since 1903, to Mr Robert Kuok, a Malaysian millionaire, for Dollars 349m. News Corp retains 15 per cent of the paper but is not seen as a long-term holder of the stock. The trading of assets between the wealthy in Hong Kong is a daily event but what makes the sale of the Post important is the question it raises over the future of an independent media in Hong Kong as British rule comes to an end and the colony prepares for reunification with the mainland. It has become plain that China's strategy in Hong Kong is to control the centres of power in the colony, either directly or indirectly. The media is just one of the commanding heights, along with the local legislature and the civil service, which Beijing wants secured before it assumes full control of Hong Kong in 1997. The Post has hitherto been one of the few prominent supporters of Governor Chris Patten's plans for greater political freedom in Hong Kong. The paper's relatively modest 110,000 daily circulation belies its importance among opinion makers; it is widely read by Hong Kong's educated Chinese elite, not just by the colony's expatriate community. Many at the Post, in the government and elsewhere expect the paper's editorial position to come in line with that propounded by the New China News Agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong. One government official says: 'The Post was one of the few remaining independent newspapers in Hong Kong. Now it's going to be compliant.' This view is seen as not much more than special pleading by others. According to a senior Sinologist at Hong Kong University: 'Let's face it, under colonialism the Post was pro-colonial. It was the establishment newspaper and after 1997 it will probably continue to be the establishment newspaper. The ownership change simply reflects the changes under way within the establishment.' Echoes of these changes have been seen recently in other areas. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, was refused representation by 11 leading firms of solicitors in July when he wanted to bring a suit for libel against a leading figure in the colony who is also an adviser to Beijing. Last month Mr Simon Murray stepped down from the managing directorship of Hutchison Whampoa, becoming the last English 'taipan' of Hong Kong's oldest trading company. Amicable though his leaving was, Mr Murray had become frustrated. Mr Li Ka-shing, the company's owner, had banned him from publicly supporting Mr Patten's plans for greater democracy lest it offend China. The Post's new owners are not likely to challenge China's policy towards Hong Kong. Mr Kuok has extensive business interests in China, primarily in hotels and property, oil refining and ports development. The management of the paper in the future could well fall to Singapore Press Holdings, publisher of the Straits Times; it already owns 5 per cent of the paper and is seen as the likely buyers of Mr Murdoch's remaining interest. Beijing has put great efforts into winning the support of newspaper proprietors in Hong Kong. Through the Ministry of Propaganda, the governmental face of the Communist party's United Front department, proprietors are regularly feted in Beijing. According to observers in Hong Kong there is both a positive and negative side to this development. 'You can see it as a united front exercise with Beijing co-opting influential people in Hong Kong,' says one. 'But China is also changing and it has become more receptive to these people. There is a confluence of interest.' For others, a better indication of whether Hong Kong's media retains its independence is how it reports on affairs in China. There are a number of weekly and monthly magazines in the colony which give what appear to be detailed accounts of the manoeuvrings of senior Communist party officials. Others are used by senior Communist party officials to discredit political competit ors. According to these observers, none of whom wanted to be identified, the survival of these magazines is a better bellwether of media independence than the fate of Hong Kong's oldest English language daily.</p>

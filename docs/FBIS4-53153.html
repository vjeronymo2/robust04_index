			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jack Taylor] </F>   [Text] SYDNEY, May 16 (AFP) -- Three young East Timorese  and an Indonesian are being detained and tortured by President  Suharto's elite guard over the death of one of its commanders in  Jakarta, East Timor resistance sources said Monday.    The CNRM (National Council of Maubere Resistance) released a  statement to AFP in an attempt to draw attention to the plight  of the detainees.    The East Timorese resistance group said a fifth youth who  acknowledges responsibility for his part in what was described  as the accidental death of an off-duty Presidential Guard  officer is in hiding. But their statement, distributed by the  the East Timor News Agency (ETNA), added that he was willing to  surrender and face justice if promised a lawful trial.    The incident was said to have happened outside "a gambling  location" at a brothel where the five had been forced to take  jobs as bodyguards after going to Jakarta a year ago on the  unfulfilled promise of jobs.    "East Timorese students in Jakarta appeal to Presidential  Guard members to act in accordance with their professional oath  and protect the people, punishing wrongdoers in accordance with  the laws of Indonesia," the statement said. "Those who protect  the President should excel at protecting people, not at  torturing them."    The statement said the five young men were promised jobs in  Jakarta by the Indonesian Department of Labour and President  Suharto's daughter Tutut.    The Presidential Guard commander was said to have been  "hired  by someone" to expel the East Timorese men and went in civilian  clothes to the centre where he assumed that "as is usual in  Indonesia, the civilians would be frightened by his presence and  follow his orders to leave." Instead, the bodyguards resisted  and attempted to chase the commander away, "killing him in the  ensuing scuffle."    Four, named as Hercules of Ainaro, Duarte of Lospalos,  Domingo of Ermera and Salah from the Indonesian island of Flores  had been captured and were being kept at a special closed prison  at the Presidential Guard headquarters.</p>

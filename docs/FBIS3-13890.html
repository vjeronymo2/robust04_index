Today's session will be held at the  Kenyan Foreign Ministry, while subsequent sessions will be held  at a different venue which has not yet been announced.    The delegation of the Sudanese Government will be headed by  Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, chairman of the Transitional  National Assembly, and also includes Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Muhammad,  the official spokesman for the government delegation; Dr. Nafi  Ali Nafi, Agnes Lokudu, Angelo Beda, Dr. 'Abd al-Rahman Ibrahim,  Mathiang Malwal, Musa Sid Ahmad, Peter Charliman, and 'Abd  al-Raziq al-Fadl, as well as Sudan's ambassadors to Kenya, Addis  Ababa, and Uganda.    For the rebels, the delegation of Garang's faction will be  headed by Salva Kiir Mayar Dit, Yusuf Kuwah, Philip Lomoding,  Stephen Wani, Justin Yaak, and others.    The delegation of the United Faction will be headed by  (Richard Mola) and its members comprise (Dhol Ashwal), Arok  Thuon Arok, John Luk Jok, Dr. Peter Adhok, and others.    The radio correspondent in Nairobi says that the most  positive indicators pointing to the success of these  negotiations is the presence of the leaders of the two rebel  factions, Garang and Machar, at the opening session. This has  never happened before at any of the earlier rounds of talks.  Their presence indicates confidence in the negotiations.  Moreover, Kenya's President Moi, in his speech to the opening  session, stressed the need for these negotiations to succeed so  that Africa could demonstrate to the whole world its capacity to  solve its problems by itself.    The current negotiations will have as their starting point  the point at which the two sides arrived at in the earlier  rounds at Addis Ababa, Nairobi, Abuja One and Two. It is worth  noting that the Sudanese delegation led by Mr. Muhammad al-Amin  Khalifah is fully mandated to sign the agreement to be reached.</p>

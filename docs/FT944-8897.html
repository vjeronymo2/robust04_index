			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (2): Affair with Democratic party may be cooling - Victoria Griffith examines Massachusetts politics Massachusetts voters seemed to have a split political personality during the mid-term elections last week. While they delivered Edward Kennedy, one of the last liberal hold-outs in the US, back to the Senate, they also handed Republican Governor William Weld a landslide victory. With 71 per cent of Massachusetts voters supporting Weld, pundits began to ask whether the political tide was changing in the state. Massachusetts has long been known as the Democratic Party's paradise. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in the state by three to one. The state handed Bill Clinton one of his biggest victories in the election two years ago, and residents still give the president his strongest approval ratings in the nation. 'Massachusetts Liberals' has been a label residents of the state have carried, sometimes proudly, for decades. Nearly all the famous politicians Massachusetts has produced over the years have been Democrats. The Kennedys built their political legend from a Boston base, and Tip O'Neill, former speaker of the House of Representatives, hailed from Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Democratic party has also produced some famous failed contenders. Mike Dukakis, Bush's ill-fated opponent in 1988, was a former governor of the state; and Paul Tsongas, whom Clinton defeated for the Democratic nomination two years ago, was a Massachusetts senator. But there are signs that the state's love affair with the Democratic party is cooling. Edward Kennedy won a comfortable victory over challenger Mitt Romney, but only after facing the toughest election battle of his 32-year senate career. Just weeks before the election, polls showed the two candidates in a dead-heat. 'The time when people in Massachusetts roll over and play dead for the Democrats is over,' said Mr Weld. The Republican governor's popularity is one reason the GOP has been gaining ground in the state. With his pro-choice stance and strong support for women and gay rights, Mr Weld has helped to forge a new brand of Republicanism which has made the party more acceptable in socially liberal Massachusetts. Still, political analysts accustomed to the state's left-wing image were shocked when the governor succeeded in pushing privatisation and hefty spending cuts through the overwhelmingly Democratic state congress over the past four years. And the private sector was relieved when it saw Massachusetts taking a more aggressively pro-business stance, encouraging companies to stay in the state by cutting taxes and helping them through the permitting bureaucracy. Fortune magazine now rates Boston one of the best cities in the country to do business. The Republicans have benefited from demographic changes in the state as well. The Massachusetts economy was once based on manufacturing, and unionised factory workers showed a strong preference for Democratic candidates. But the state now relies on high technology and service industries such as fund management and biotechnology, whose employees tend to be wealthier and more concerned about high taxes and government spending. Because urban dwellers are much more likely to vote Democratic than suburbanites, an exodus of residents from Massachusetts' cities to suburbia has also helped the Republicans. Even traditional Democratic candidates had to make concessions to these shifts in their campaigns this year. Mark Roosevelt presented himself as a fiscal conservative, and Kennedy began to sound like a Republican when he talked about getting tough on crime, rhetoric that goes down well with suburban voters. In spite of the changes, Massachusetts is far from becoming a Republican stronghold. In the end, Kennedy won the election by 17 points. Joe Kennedy, Edward's nephew, ran unopposed for his own Democratic seat in the US House of Representatives, and the state's Washington delegation is still overwhelmingly Democratic. The mayorship of the city of Boston, now in the hands of Thomas Menino, is also considered safely in Democratic hands. Yet the days when Democratic candidates were almost assured of victory against Republican opponents are now over, and the state has taken a definite turn to the right. Massachusetts is still a receptive place for Democrats, but it is no longer the Democratic heaven it once was.</p>

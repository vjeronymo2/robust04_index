			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Beverley losses up to Pounds 2.67m Beverley Group, the engineering concern, said yesterday that it had completed its rationalisation programme and was now planning a placing and open offer to fund future growth, both organically and by acquisition. Details were expected to be announced shortly. Rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.77m for the 1993 year pushed pre-tax losses up from Pounds 276,000 to Pounds 2.67m. Turnover of continuing operations fell from Pounds 12.84m to Pounds 7.97m. After eliminating an Pounds 828,000 technical adjustment arising from a write-off of goodwill, losses per share worked through at 7.63p (0.21p). The directors said the restructuring had provided an opportunity to create more added value through the provision of high quality products and services. However, despite the benefits now showing through, they said the group would not show significant improvements on 1993 until the second half of the year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Shaoping (0719 1421 1627)] </F>   [Text] On 9 March, the 50th meeting of the UN Human Rights  Commission adopted a motion proposed by China, deciding not to  proceed with a draft bill on "China's so-called human rights  condition," which was proposed by some Western countries; thus,  the attempt by Western countries to use the human rights issue  as an excuse to exert pressure on China suffered another setback.    At three previous meetings, Western countries also proposed  similar bills, which all came to early ends. At this round of  meetings, these countries once again proposed the bill on  "China's so-called human rights condition," asking the  Commission to vote on it. Regarding this, Jin Yongjian, head of  the Chinese delegation, proposed a motion asking members not to  proceed with the bill. His motion won strong support from the  developing countries and was passed by 20 votes in favor, 16  against, and 17 abstentions.    Jin Yongjian pointed out in his speech before the motion was  voted on that some Western countries ignored the three refusals  by the Human Rights Commission; ignored the actual situation in  which China enjoys political and social stability, sustained and  rapid economic development, and great improvement of living  standards among its people; they insisted on proposing the draft  bill which was against China, and their purpose was to exert  political pressure on China, hinder China's economic  development, and force the Chinese people to change the road of  development which is chosen by themselves and which suits  China's conditions.    He pointed out that one of the important reasons for China's  comparative backwardness today is because China suffered  invasion and looting by imperialism for a long time. In this  regard, among the countries which proposed the draft bill, some  had played a very disgraceful role, and today they once again  want to instruct China to do this and that and willfully  criticize it. How can this not cause grievances among the  Chinese people?    He said that China is willing to begin international  cooperation in the human rights domain on the premise of mutual  respect and equality and based on the purpose and principle on  the UN Charter, but China is firmly opposed to any country or  group which slanders it in the name of "protection of human  rights."    Before the vote, representatives from countries such as  Cuba,  Mauritius, Syria, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Iran  expressed support for China. They stressed that the  international community must look at China's great achievements  in the areas of politics, economy, and society. They said that  China is a big country and its population accounts for  one-fourth of the world's total, and that the Chinese Government  has endured the challenge of managing such a big country,  enabled various ethnic groups to live harmoniously, and let the  people upgrade their living standard continuously. Regarding  these achievements, the international community should give  commendation and encouragement. They pointed out that Western  countries are accustomed to imposing their own thinking and  ideologies on others, and that the bill on "China's so-called  human rights conditions" has a clear political motive.</p>

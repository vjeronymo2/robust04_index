			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Dewhurst to shed up to 1,500 jobs DEWHURST, which runs the UK's biggest chain of butchers shops, confirmed yesterday that it is to close up to 600 of its 1,006 high-street outlets in the next 18 months, with the loss of up to 1,500 jobs. Dewhurst is a subsidiary of Union International, which handles the food businesses of privately-owned Vestey. The Vestey group was recently forced to make substantial provisions on its property portfolio, and some observers regard the decision to slim the Dewhurst chain as partly a response to that. Union International and Vestey declined to comment yesterday. Mr Mike Carter, marketing manager of Dewhurst, said the company planned to sell some of the shops as going concerns and that others would be taken over by current managers. Mr Carter was unable to put a market value on the sale. He added that Dewhurst would review the situation during the next 18 months and, should business recover, the company might dispose of fewer than the planned 600 units. The company has no plans to introduce franchise arrangements for the shops involved, and does not intend to close en bloc in any particular part of the UK. Dewhurst has been hit by factors including the spread of Sunday trading, the growing strength of large supermarket chains and the recession. According to Verdict, a retail research company, the large grocery chains now account for more than half of all carcass meat and 92 per cent of all bacon, ham, poultry and meat products sold in the UK. Mr Carter denied that a growing tendency towards vegetarianism had reduced Dewhurst's market.</p>

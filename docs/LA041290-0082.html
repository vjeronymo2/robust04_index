			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEXAS;  </P> <P> LATINOS CRITICIZE REMARKS BY CAVAZOS  </P> <P> Leading Latinos criticized U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos for saying  Latino parents deserve much of the blame for a high dropout rate among their  children.  </P> <P> Cruz Chavira, chief of staff for the San Antonio-based League of United Latin  American Citizens, which claims to be the largest Latino group in the United  States, said he was upset by Cavazos' remarks and that scores of educators had  been calling LULAC to voice their anger. Cavazos, who is Latino, told a San  Antonio news conference Tuesday that although Latinos have traditionally valued  education, "somewhere along the line we've lost that. I really believe today  there is not that emphasis."  </P></p>

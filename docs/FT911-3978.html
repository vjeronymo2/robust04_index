			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Local Election Diary (Bath): Tories woo small 'c' conservatives WESTMINSTER attracts the weighty ponderings of ideologues and theoreticians, and community affairs are the territory of no-nonsense doers - the jam-makers and jumble-sale organisers that tend to hog the letters columns of local newspapers. In Regency Bath, such concerned citizens are often small 'c' conservatives - anti-commercial conservationists and strongly opposed to change. But are the big 'C' Conservatives, so preoccupied with market forces, their natural party? The hung city council has 24 Labour councillors, with the remaining 24 shared equally between the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. At Westminster, Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, holds Bath with a slim majority over the Liberal Democrats. Moreover, in the current campaign, Labour is making the most of its promises that it will return to the rates, protect education and preserve the National Health Service - deeply conservative stuff to some ears. A fair number of supplicants at Mr Patten's weekend surgery were small 'c' conservatives, not to be relied on by the Tories. There was the computer man concerned about post-privatisation water quality; a lawyer worried about tourist traffic destroying the old Georgian city; and a mother-of-three now living in Pounds 500-a-week bed-and-breakfast accomodation after failing to keep up the mortgage payments on her council house. With his undoubted personal charm, Mr Patten calmed fears and promised action wherever possible. But he could only count on the lawyer's vote. AS MINISTER for Overseas Development, Mr Patten was widely identified as champion of the wetter wing of the Thatcher Government. His elevation to the chairmanship of the party has 'hardened' his image, Bath Liberal Democrats claim. Mr Nick Westbrook, their parliamentary candidate, pushes the point as part of his effort to join his former Edinburgh University contemporaries - Mr Archie Kirkwood for the Liberal Democrats, and Mr Martin O'Neill and Mr Bernie Grant for Labour - in the Commons. 'As Patten has got a higher profile, he has been cultivating a slightly dismissive, arrogant tone that has been jarring with people,' Mr Westbrook said, while canvassing. No evidence of this could be found on the doorsteps, however, with many voters promising to back the Liberal Democrats in the local elections but reserving support for Mr Patten when the general election comes. Putting a brave face on it, Mr Westbrook insisted that elsewhere many Labour tactical voters would come to him in the national poll. Perhaps hardly surprisingly, Mr Patten, who dedicates so much of his time to disparaging the national Labour party, readily confesses to being struck by the exceptionally high quality of Labour's prospective candidate for Bath. IF MR PATTEN has a personal following, it is muted among Bath's small retailers. A highly vocal local shopkeepers' campaign has grown up to protest at the impact of high rents and the Uniform Business Rate (UBR). Mr Nick Troup, proprietor of the Broad Street Bakery and a founder of Businesses Against Rent and Rates Increases in Bath (BARRB), claims small traders are being run out of town by a greedy city council and the high prices paid for space by high-street multiples. With overheads rising by 265 per cent in five years, he says that even those who want to close down cannot, as the UBR requires new tenants to take on properties at their fully revalued rates. 'We are Thatcher's children. We started the bakery with the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, which encouraged people to get on their bikes,' he complains. 'Now we are just the government's tax collectors.' BARRB, which claims a membership ranging 'from JPs to anarchists,' is now targeting Mr Patten in its high-profile propaganda campaign, quoting him as saying: 'Businesses have been paying too little for too long.' With the Tory chairman defending majority of only 1,400 votes, it would be the ultimate irony if it were business that brought him down.</p>

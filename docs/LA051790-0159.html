			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LANDMARK AND HON AGREE ON PROPERTY DEAL;  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS: THE ACCORD IS SMALLER THAN ONE SCOTCHED LAST WEEK BY REGULATORS. A  BUYER IS SOUGHT FOR OTHER GOLF AND RESORT AREAS.  </P> <P> Landmark Land Co. said Wednesday that it has agreed to sell a 6,700-acre  Riverside County parcel to Laguna Hills developer Barry Hon for $275 million  and has hired an investment banking firm to peddle the company's remaining  big-name golf and resort assets.  </P> <P> The new deal comes just nine days after federal thrift regulators blocked a  $967-million sale of Carmel-based Landmark's prime properties to Hon.  Regulators had called the original deal unsound because Landmark's subsidiary,  Oak Tree Savings Bank in New Orleans, was providing too much financing to Hon.  </P> <P> "I felt that it was in the best interest of everyone to reach this revised  agreement quickly," said Hon in a prepared statement. "I believe that this  revised agreement gives us the best real estate development that Landmark owns  and that we are still well positioned to purchase other Oak Tree assets."  </P> <P> Under the revised deal, Hon would put $75 million down by the end of July for  undeveloped land in a planned golf-course community called Oak Valley at Pomona  Freeway and the I-10 freeway near Beaumont. Oak Tree would provide $200 million  in financing. Regulators must approve the arrangement.  </P> <P> Landmark, a leading golf course and resort developer, holds and operates more  than $1 billion worth of real estate through Oak Tree. But federal law enacted  last August to bail out the ailing thrift deposit insurance system now requires  S&amp;Ls to sell their interests in such investments within five years.  </P> <P> Gerald G. Barton, Landmark's chairman, president and chief executive, said  directors had wanted to dispose of the property in the way least disruptive to  more than 3,500 employees who work in the golf, hotel and real estate  development and operations divisions. The original deal with Hon would have  transferred those divisions intact.  </P> <P> In the face of federal objections, though, directors decided Tuesday to hire  Salomon Bros., a New York investment banking firm, to try to come up with a  buyer for the entire company, Barton said. Any buyer interested only in the  real estate operations could sell Oak Tree to a third party, he said.  </P> <P> "If we had the financial capacity, we'd pull out the real estate companies  ourself" and put them in the holding company, he said. "Since we don't, we have  to look elsewhere."  </P> <P> While he acknowledged that few prospective purchasers are large enough to buy  Landmark, which has $3 billion in assets, Barton said he believes that Salomon  will come up with offers in one to three months. Salomon also will look into  other options, including the possibility of bringing new investors into Oak  Tree.  </P> <P> As a last resort, he said, Landmark would liquidate Oak Tree's real estate  investments over the next few years.  </P> <P> Since the original deal with Hon was announced in mid-April, Landmark's stock  has taken a beating on Wall Street. The price has fallen from $17.50 a share on  the day the deal was announced to $10.875 a share at the close of trading on  Wednesday, up 50 cents a share from Tuesday's close.  </P> <P> Stock analysts and financial advisers had doubted that the first deal with Hon  would go through. It was structured to close in two phases over a year with a  total of $200 million in cash from Hon and more than $750 million in financing  from Oak Tree, an amount that represented more than 25% of Oak Tree's assets  and made regulators balk.  </P> <P> In the revised deal, Hon gives up his plans to own resort properties in three  states, more than 10,000 acres of developable land and such golfing jewels as  PGA West, La Quinta and Mission Hills Country Club, all in the Palm Desert  area.  </P> <P> But the new agreement "makes more sense both for Landmark and for Hon," said  Kenneth D. Campbell, an analyst with the Montvale, N.J., real estate investment  advising firm Audit Investments Inc. "It gives Landmark more flexibility in  dealing with others, and Hon can come in and bargain for whatever he wants."  </P> <P> Though Hon couldn't be reached for comment, his lawyers and advisers agreed.  </P> <P> "We believe Mr. Hon got the pick of the litter and is still well-positioned to  purchase other Oak Tree assets," said lawyer William Biel of Costa Mesa. And  Hon's financial adviser, Vaughn Mahnke, said Hon will "remain a key player in  the disposition of other of Oak Tree's assets."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, PLO adviser and head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the international coordination  committee of donor states, by Sufiya 'Amarah in Paris on 10  June--recorded]    [Text] ['Amarah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, how responsive were the  donor countries to the Palestinian financial demands?    [Sha'th] Today's meeting saw a qualitative change in this  responsiveness. There has always been Palestinian apprehension  that assistance might be so late in coming that it would be  impossible to establish Palestinian institutions on liberated  Palestinian territory in time to enable them to stand on their  own and begin an independent Palestinian economy. Today, I say  that there has been a transformation. It is true the sums we  are talking about are not great. There is a commitment to offer  $720 million. Today we obtained a commitment to transfer $40  million of that in the form of currency during the next week.    However, this $40 million is only 40 out of 70, which is the  deficit in the current expenditure budget of the coming  Palestinian government within the national authority. This is  more than half of the amount needed to pay the government's  expenditure for the next few months. This is enough to cover  the deficit for three months. It will be followed by a meeting  on 11 July to fulfill the commitment to cover this deficit.    Therefore, today's development was not only progress in  terms  of the promised sums but in terms of the monies transferred to  finance the difficult part, namely, the current expenditure of  the Palestinian government.    ['Amarah] Then you believe this assistance is enough to meet  the requirements of development and to rebuild the  infrastructure in the Palestinian autonomy areas, especially the  Gaza Strip?    [Sha'th] These amounts are not budgeted for all the  expenditures concerning investments or long-term projects. They  will cover current expenditures, that is, the police, the  employees of the Palestinian authority, and certain very urgent  projects, such as programs to rehabilitate Palestinian detainees  just released, and to give some compensation to thousands of  Palestinians who have borne the brunt of the occupation, namely,  the handicapped, the injured, families of martyrs and detainees  and others. These will be projects to [word indistinct]  assistance for them economically. There are projects like the  Gaza cleaning project, which will cost $15 million, employing  15,000 laborers for three months. Thus, all the manifestations  of former occupation will be removed, such as barbed wire,  cement blocks that barricade roads, and the garbage the Israelis  left on the streets. Therefore, it is an urgent payment to  implement urgent projects and to cover the expenditures of the  Palestinian government.    We are well aware that this assistance is just the  beginning.  The Palestinian people will play their role, which they have  proved for themselves and the world throughout long years of  struggle for their homeland. The Palestinians who have been  steadfast in the occupied territories for many years are asked  to transform their energies and resources into building their  independent and free country. Palestinians abroad, who have  suffered and sacrificed in order to return to their country, and  who contributed to building the countries of their brothers  outside Palestine, are now prepared to return to rebuild their  homeland. I believe self-reliance is the main Palestinian  motto. This self-reliance now needs support to transform it  into reality as soon as possible.    I would also like to say that the much talked about delay in  our Arab brothers' assistance to us, which I considered painful,  is now beginning to become clearer. We say Arab backing has  always been presented to the Palestinian people. Palestinians  have always been grateful to their Arab brothers. Some Arabs  contributed their money, some their own souls, and some their  land from which the Palestinian people set out--in Lebanon,  Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Tunisian, the Gulf countries. All these  Arab states gave their contributions. There were reasons for  delays in this contribution.    Now, I am happy to say that one-quarter of the amount given  today was contributed by fraternal Saudi Arabia. Two other Arab  states have promised the World Bank to announce a definite  amount of assistance. This was not announced today, but it will  be announced within two days. This will restore to the  Palestinians the feeling that their Arab brothers are by their  side in the process of liberation and reconstruction.    ['Amarah] Last question, Dr. Sha'th. No definite date has  been fixed for Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in  Jericho. What is the cause of this hesitation?    [Sha'th] President Yasir 'Arafat will be returning to his  homeland for which he fought for many years. He did not link  his return to his homeland with the realization of all his  demands of support for this homeland. 'Arafat has expressed the  Palestinian concern that the international community, which  pushed toward the peace process and which saluted it in  Washington on 13 September 1993, is hesitating to carry out its  responsibility to transform this peace into facts on the ground.  'Arafat felt this concern. He was expressing to the  international community his people's concern. But I now believe  he is ready, as always, to return to this homeland to lead his  people on their liberated land.</p>

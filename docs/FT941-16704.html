			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons shares fall on warning Shares of Hopkinsons Group dipped 5p to 43p yesterday after Mr Bill Goodall, chairman of the industrial abrasives, plastic products and gas control equipment group, warned of a pre-tax deficit in the second half. Hopes for improvements at Bryan Donkin Engineering and the Carborundum Abrasives operation in Germany had not been realised, he said. The group would, nevertheless, record a profit for the year before any provision for future restructuring costs. A cost reduction programme was being implemented and it expected to maintain the annual dividend. The group is expanding its plastics side with the purchase of Scottish Foam's plastic injection division for Pounds 1m cash plus about Pounds 120,000 cash, dependent on stock valuation.</p>

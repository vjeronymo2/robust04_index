			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 100 citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and approximately 10,200 producers of these fruits in Florida. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A minority of these handlers and a majority of these producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal period shall apply to all assessable citrus fruit handled from the beginning of such period. An annual budget of expenses and assessment rate is prepared by the Committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The Committee members are handlers and producers of Florida citrus. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budget is formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the expected cartons (4/5 bushel) of fruit shipped. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The annual budget and assessment rate are usually recommended by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, budget and assessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee met June 21, 1994, and unanimously recommended expenses of $210,000 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, with an assessment rate of $0.003 per 4/5 bushel carton of fresh fruit shipped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 budget expenses were $200,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an approved assessment of $0.00285. This represents increases of $10,000 in expenses and of $0.00015 in the assessment rate from the amounts recommended for the current fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 66,000,000 cartons of assessable fruit, will yield a total of $198,000 in assessment income. Interest income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated at $2,000. This, along with $10,000 from the Committee's authorized reserve fund, will be adequate to cover additional expenses. Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $125,000, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of approximately one-half of one fiscal year's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major expense categories for the current fiscal year include $98,300 for salaries, $36,000 for the Manifest department, and $12,600 for insurance and bonds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

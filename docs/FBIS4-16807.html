			<p>BFN     [Text] Moldova has decided to slash by one-third natural  gas supplies to its industrial sector due to the country's huge  debt for gas imports, said deputy prime Minister Valentin Cunev.    Moldova cannot repay the debt of 131 billion Russian rubles  with money from its treasury, Cunev said in a television  program. "The (state) budget is well-balanced and its deficit  must not exceed 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product,"  which prompts a "very simple" solution -- "if you can't pay cut  down your consumption," he said.    Moldova consumes no more energy today than four years ago  but  "produces much fewer goods," Cunev said.    He said it would be cheaper for Moldova to buy crude oil in  the Middle East and have it refined in Romania. But Moldova  does not have enough hard currency to pay for this, while  oil-exporters in the Commonwealth of Independent States accept  Moldovan goods as payment.    Russia has pledged to provide Moldova with 3.5 billion cubic  meters of gas this year, while the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom  a few days ago axed by one-third its supplies to Moldova due to  the latter's arrears.</p>

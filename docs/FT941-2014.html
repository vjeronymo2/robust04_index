			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Bar is again accused of race bias Fresh allegations of racial discrimination were levelled at the Bar last night over its new system for selecting students for the barristers' finals course. The new system, based on a mixture of academic qualifications and psychometric tests, has resulted in just 91 places on next year's finals course being offered to black and ethnic minority candidates out of a total of 882. Mrs Justice Booth, chairman of the Bar school's central selection board, defended the system as 'fair and valid'. All answers to the tests which were based on skills identified by psychometric researchers as required by barristers were double marked blind, she said. Markers had no access to information about the gender or ethnic origin of can-didates. But Mr Makbool Javaid, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, said the results were clearly discriminatory. He said: 'It cannot be the case that such a low percentage of black and ethnic minority candidates are judged fit and suitable to become barristers.' Mr Javaid, a solicitor, said the society had warned the Bar last year that the tests had the potential for bias and that it would consider seeking judicial review of the results. Women also fared badly under the new system. Out of 2,290 applicants, 1,764 were white, 481 black (45 did not disclose their ethnic origin) and 922 were women. Of the 882 offers made, 774 were to white candidates, 91 to black or ethnic minority candidates and 17 to those who did not disclose ethnic origin. Offers were made to 301 women. This is the second time in just over a year that the Bar has been involved in a row over race discrimination. Last year it was accused of discriminating against ethnic minority candidates in marking its finals examination. An inquiry set up by the Bar school found no evidence of direct discrimination. The new selection system was introduced because too many students were qualifying on academic grounds for a place on the finals course. Part of the Bar's problem, however, is that its finals course is available only through the Bar school. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has condemned this monopoly on training barristers as anti-competitive. A Bar report on barrister's training to be published later this week is expected to acknowledge that it may now have to validate courses at other centres already licensed to run the solicitors' vocational course.</p>

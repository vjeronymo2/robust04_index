			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FLORIDIANS TELL ROHRABACHER TO MIND HIS OWN BUSINESS  </P> <P> A foray into Florida politics by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) has ruffled  the feathers of Sunshine State Republicans, who have advised their California  colleague to mind his own business.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher piqued the Floridians by leading an endorsement drive in Congress  for a conservative Cuban-American businessman, Carlos Perez, in an Aug. 1  primary. Perez was associated with the Reagan Administration, which Rohrabacher  served in the White House.  </P> <P> The Florida primary will pick the GOP standard-bearer in a special election to  fill the Miami-area House seat left vacant by the death in May of Rep. Claude  D. Pepper, a liberal Democrat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refrained on Purpose  </P> <P> In a letter to House Republicans, all 10 of Florida's GOP congressmen said they  had purposely refrained from endorsing any candidate in the hotly contested  primary.  </P> <P> "We have now been placed in the untenable position of remaining silent while  other members, from outside the state, and not being conversant with the local  political situation, have allowed their names to be associated with one of the  Republican candidates," the Florida congressmen wrote.  </P> <P> "The Florida delegation would greatly appreciate no further interference by  outsiders in this Republican primary," the letter concluded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approach 'Derailed'  </P> <P> Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, who wrote the letter, said Tuesday:  "We had decided probably the best thing to do was let that particular race run  its course. . . . Our whole approach was somewhat derailed, or at least got off  on a bumpy track, when we found out Mr. Rohrabacher had spearheaded an effort  to get congressional endorsements" for Perez.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher persuaded 12 congressmen to endorse Perez.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher said he is simply standing up for an old friend.  </P> <P> "I think it's standard operating procedure that when somebody has a friend, or  an ideological soul mate, running someplace for Congress, that they help them  out," said Rohrabacher, who was a speech writer in the Reagan White House. "I  had no idea that it would cause anybody any problem anywhere."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Close Race  </P> <P> Had it not been for the support of members of Congress outside of California,  Rohrabacher said, he might not have won his first congressional race in the  fall.  </P> <P> Perez, a millionaire fruit importer, arrived in the United States nearly 30  years ago as an impoverished immigrant fleeing Fidel Castro's revolution in  Cuba. He was once mentioned by President Reagan in a State of the Union address  as an example of the success that immigrants can achieve.  </P> <P> During the 1984 presidential race, Perez headed a Latino-oriented campaign  organization called Viva Reagan. He is also chairman of the Concerned Citizens  for Democracy, organized in 1987 to raise money for medical treatment for  anti-government forces in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> In the Republican primary in Florida's 18th Congressional District, Perez is  challenging front-runner Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida state senator who is  also a Cuban-American and a political conservative.  </P></p>

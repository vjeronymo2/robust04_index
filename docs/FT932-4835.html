			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Customers first as BT plans longer working day THAT GREAT British tradition of taking half a day off work to wait for a telephone engineer or the gasman to visit could be nearing its end. British Telecommunications intends to introduce new working hours for its engineers, including routine weekend working, which fit in with other people's working hours rather than the other way round. BT, which is under severe competitive and regulatory pressure, wants to introduce a daily working span of 6am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday working. In the longer run BT hopes to introduce a proper appointment system, within quite narrow time bands, so that customers no longer have to rearrange their lives to fit in with the engineer's visit. Currently, most utilities can offer nothing more precise than morning or afternoon visits, although most of the regional electricity companies now claim to be down to a two-hour time band. Many of the utilities have offered some increase in the services provided outside normal office hours in recent years. British Gas, for example, has extended to 8pm on weekdays the time at which it is possible to query bills and make appointments. But meter reading and non-emergency service work remain stubbornly fixed within normal office hours. BT is trying to sell the flexible working and anti-social hours package to employees by offering a four-day week in exchange for the longer daily working hours. Sunday attendance would also attract a premium payment, although not the full overtime rate as at present. The main BT union, the National Communications Union, is not enthusiastic about the changes but is ready, in principle, to fit workers' shifts to customer needs. As a quid pro quo, the NCU has been asking BT for a general reduction in working time. The company has rejected that, but said that it would consider a reduction in working time for those employees in the Personal Communications department who are directly affected by the changes.</p>

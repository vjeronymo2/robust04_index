			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIRED SANTA ANA OFFICIAL WINS $1.8-MILLION SUIT  </P> <P> A judge, overturning a jury verdict, has awarded $1.8 million to a former  top-level official with the city of Santa Ana who claimed that he was fired  because of his age and his efforts to expose wrongdoing in city hiring, the  fired official said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Donald Bott, 55, of San Clemente, now interim personnel chief for the city of  El Segundo, had asserted that Santa Ana city officials laid him off four years  ago because he refused to "play ball" in tolerating alleged mismanagement and  favoritism in city practices.  </P> <P> Six months ago, an Orange County Superior Court jury refused to award Bott  damages as a result of his dismissal during a budget crunch after 17 years as  director of personnel. But then, Judge Leonard Goldstein, in an unusual move,  agreed to reconsider that decision, signaling that he found merit in Bott's  claim.  </P> <P> Bott said his lawyer received notice this week that Goldstein, setting aside  the jury's verdict, has held the city liable for $1.83 million. That is just  shy of the amount Bott said he lost in earnings because of his abrupt dismissal  in 1985, forcing him into unemployment and a bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> Court records show Goldstein signed an order in the case last Friday.  </P> <P> Lawyers handling the case for Bott and the city of Santa Ana, as well as  Goldstein and his court clerk, were on vacation Wednesday and could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper, who did not try the case, said he has  received no word yet of a decision. Cooper said he was surprised by the  reported amount of the verdict but that he had expected some damages against  the city in light of earlier rulings by Goldstein.  </P> <P> "I've felt all along that Judge Goldstein was in error in his rulings. I don't  think the facts of the case warrant any verdict (for Bott)," Cooper said. He  added that a verdict against the city would "unquestionably" be appealed.  </P> <P> The city asserted that it was forced to lay off Bott because of tight budget  conditions in 1985 and that it was well within its rights to do so.  </P> <P> "He served at the will of the city," Cooper said, "and he had no vested right  to remain as director of personnel."  </P> <P> Cooper said Bott's entire claim was built on an invalid agreement that Bott had  made privately with the former city manager in the 1960s, assuring Bott a lower  civil service position if he were ever let go as personnel head.  </P> <P> "It was an unlawful, secret agreement that emasculated the civil service  system," Cooper maintained.  </P> <P> But Bott saw his dismissal differently.  </P> <P> A gray-haired man with a methodical manner, Bott asserted that he was the  victim of a youth movement ushered in by then-City Manager A.J. Wilson.  According to Bott, Wilson wanted to bring a fresher, sharper image to city  government.  </P> <P> Bott also claimed that his position was abolished and that he was let go  because he had fought "unconscionable managerial practices" during Wilson's  regime as city manager. He alleged that Wilson and other city officials used  their powers to bypass civil service requirements, putting under-qualified  people in place of employees who were out of favor.  </P> <P> For example, Bott alleged in his lawsuit that Wilson demoted a long-tenured  secretary and replaced her in a newly created position with a "young,  attractive typist clerk who, in fact, did not meet the minimum qualifications  established by the city."  </P> <P> Wilson was named a co-defendant but was not held liable for damages, according  to Bott. Wilson said Wednesday that he had not heard about a decision and  declined to discuss the case in detail, saying only: "He was laid off because  of a budget cutback. That's it."  </P> <P> But Bott maintained in an interview Wednesday that "I was fired because I . . .  wasn't playing ball with the management."  </P> <P> "I always knew I had a just case. I felt that the jury came to the wrong  conclusion and that justice was denied me," Bott said. "This substantiates what  I've been saying all along, and it was worth all the legal frustration."  </P> <P> One juror who heard the case in June, Lillian Fukuharu, said Wednesday: "He  didn't prove his case to our satisfaction. . . . I really felt bad for (the  Bott family), but the factors -- age discrimination and all that -- just wasn't  there for us."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Catherine Gewertz and Jerry Hicks contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

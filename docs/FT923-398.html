			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Hurd to prepare ground for October emergency summit MR Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is to hold meetings with his European counterparts to try to clear the way for some progress at the emergency European Community summit in Birmingham in mid-October. However, the sour atmosphere at yesterday's Brussels meeting of EC finance ministers looks likely to make his task difficult. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will use bilateral meetings tomorrow with Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, and Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, to urge that the summit should lead to a declaration on devolving decisions to national and regional levels for agreement at the Edinburgh summit in December. The government is becoming resigned to further weeks of public wrangling among Tory MPs over its approach to Europe, even if next month's summit lays the foundation for a move on decentralising decision-making. Ministers believe Tory MPs on both sides of the argument will feel they can influence the government's approach by speaking out. Downing Street denied that the conclusions of yesterday's Brussels meeting on discussion of the ERM at Birmingham had been a setback, saying it had not expected the ERM 'fault-lines' to be resolved in one day. Officials said the communique reference to early ratification of the Maastricht treaty had to be related to recognition of the UK's strategy of awaiting the Danish government's plans for moving forward. Eurosceptic MPs will see the outcome as putting back further the prospect of sterling's re-entering the ERM. Mr Major's difficulties in reconciling his EC negotiations with divisions within his own party were underlined again yesterday. As Euro-sceptic MPs talked of possible cross-party alliances to defeat the Maastricht bill, Mr Hugh Dykes, a leading Tory Euro enthusiast, urged the government to 'see off' the dissidents once and for all. He demanded that ministers give a lead by bringing forward the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty as soon as possible. 'For months now my colleagues and I have been warning members of the government what would happen if they failed to explain and defend their EC policies adequately,' he said. While Downing Street, however, rejected the idea that Mr Major would deliver an ultimatum on Europe at the party conference next week, and insisted that ministers' weekend remarks reflected a fully agreed cabinet view, Lord Tebbit, a former Tory cabinet minister, said the government was not at one on the issue. 'There are powerful voices within the cabinet who believe that the (existing) Maastricht treaty is fatally flawed . . . , that it was a brave effort at the time it was negotiated, but that things have moved on and we could do very much better now,' he told BBC radio. 'To say that the government is entirely united is, I think, perhaps stretching it a little.' Later, writing in today's Daily Mail, Lord Tebbit launched a bitter attack on the prime minister. He said that Mr Major had become prime minister after his predecessor had been accused of 'three grave errors', over entry to the ERM, relations with Germany over Europe and the poll tax. However, he said, Mr Major had now left the ERM and been wrongfooted in his attempt to take Britain to the heart of Europe. Lord Tebbit concluded by saying that Mr Major was still at risk in the move to the council tax as successor to the poll tax.</p>

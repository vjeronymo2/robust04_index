			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei mirrors decline in futures market RUMOURS circulated, share prices fluctuated and the Nikkei average finally closed lower after small-lot activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei finished below 17,000 for the first time since last Friday, down 129.26 at 16,987.66. After opening at the day's high of 17,097.65, the index slowly sagged, mirroring a decline in the futures market. It hit a low of 16,917.70 later in the morning. Volume dropped to 160m shares from 255m and falls led rises by 629 to 255, with 198 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 8.30 to 1,290.54, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 4.51 to 1,012.69. Rumours that the new securities watchdog, Japan's version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, was scheduled to investigate the manipulation of futures markets by investment trusts unnerved market participants. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said: 'Market sentiment remains very fragile, and anything could undermine share prices.' Construction and housing-related issues were weak on reports that a small unlisted property developer, based in Tokyo, had gone bankrupt. Daito Trust Construction fell Y340 to a year's low of Y3,820. Traders said investors had started to take profits on the stock, which had been firm previously on prospects of favourable earnings. Misawa Homes declined Y15 to Y920 and Daikyo closed Y5 down at Y686. Dealers continued their efforts to generate activity by trading new Aids-related issues. Sumitomo Chemical gained Y1 to Y451 in active trading, along with Nippon Zeon, which advanced Y6 to Y660, and Calpis Food Industry, up Y40 at Y1,370. However, Meiji Milk Products receded Y16 to Y979 and Mochida Pharmaceutical relinquished Y30 to Y3,700. High-technology shares lost ground on profit-taking. Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y4 to Y660 after gains earlier in the week on small-lot foreign buying. Hitachi retreated Y8 to Y796 and NEC finished Y18 down at Y851. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 160.44 off at 19,450.91 in volume of 11.2m shares. Textile company Daiichibo weakened Y22 to Y115 on reports that a subsidiary had failed to honour a bill. Daiichibo said it would cover the losses by selling property in central Osaka. Roundup AMONG Pacific Basin markets, Seoul recorded a 4 1/2 -year low while Hong Kong's strength continued. SEOUL closed above intraday lows on late-buying by institutional investors and the composite index was finally 2.58 off at 511.61. Turnover was thin at Won108.85bn. Declines exceeded rises by 507 to 201. Daewoo Group subsidiaries were active, with Daewoo Co rising Won200 to Won10,400 and Daewoo Heavy Machinery gaining Won200 to Won10,700. HONG KONG ended at a record high but early gains were trimmed as investors took profits late in the session. The Hang Seng index added a net 37.07 at 6,162.53 in turnover of HKDollars 4.20bn. Banks were the best performers, Hang Seng Bank rising HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 53 and HSBC 50 cents to HKDollars 53. NEW ZEALAND set a 1992 high in heavy turnover with Telecom leading the way. The NZSE-40 index was ahead 6.69 at 1,589.23 after advancing from a day's low of 1,576.83. Turnover came to NZDollars 30.6m. Telecom, which gained 4 cents to NZDollars 2.26, has so far risen 7 per cent this week. MANILA reversed three days of declines, helped by a rise in PLDT shares in the US. The composite index rallied 23.09, or 1.6 per cent, to 1,451.50 in turnover of 114m pesos. PLDT climbed 15 pesos to 1,020 pesos. BANGKOK saw active buying of finance and property shares as the SET index rose 8.51, or 1.15 per cent, to 750.38 in high turnover of Bt9.82bn. Bangkok Land advanced Bt7 to Bt147 after the company said it was interested in applying to build a mass transit system in Bangkok. SINGAPORE was widely lower on selling by institutional funds. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 18.54, or 1.25 per cent, to 1,462.61 in volume of 34.1m shares, against a previous 67.8m. OCBC Foreign lost 40 cents to SDollars 13.30, DBS Foreign 20 cents to SDollars 13.30, Sembawang Shipyard 25 cents to SDollars 7.25 and Keppel 15 cents to SDollars 7. TAIWAN wavered narrowly to finish mixed as many investors stayed on the sidelines. The weighted index eased 2.83 to 4,349.68. Turnover rose to TDollars 22.4bn from TDollars 19.35bn.</p>

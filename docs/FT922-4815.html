			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Observer: In touch Investment ombudsman Richard Youard should know what he is talking about in saying he has a bee in his bonnet about the hoary old investment warning that the value of shares can go down as well as up. He's a keen amateur beekeeper. Moreover, given that he used to be called the investment referee, it is no surprise that he has a fondness for footballing metaphors when explaining his annual report. A staged reconstruction of an investment advisory interview is an 'action replay', for instance. His spoken verdict on the Dumenil unit trust debacle is that it was unsatis- factory, but 'that's not to say everybody done it wrong.' But bees and boots are not the only influences on Youard. A former partner in City solicitors Slaughter &amp; May, he still plays cornet with his old firm's jazz band, as one of his comments at yesterday's press conference showed. Questioned about an 82-year-old woman who'd been given bad investment advice, Youard replied: 'Old biddies don't live in tents' - a line from Tin Roof Blues, one of his band's favourite numbers.</p>

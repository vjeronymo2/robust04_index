The  enemy directed its main thrust in the direction of Matagis and  Hakop Kamari [Lulasaz] in Mardakertskiy Rayon in northern  Karabakh, Agdam-Askeran in the east, and Fizuli-Gadrut in the  south.    In the afternoon, the Armenian forces managed to halt the  offensive and then regrouped and launched a counterattack. The  Karabakh Defense Army units managed to encircle and destroyed a  large enemy Army unit made up of two battalions, that is, 300  soldiers, which was moving in the direction of Matagis and  Hagop-Kamari. (Two) were killed and 15 injured on the Armenian  side.    Again, following fierce battles in the direction of  Agdam-Askeran, in the afternoon the Karabakh formations managed  to halt the Azerbaijani advances and completely destroy an enemy  battalion, nearly 200 soldiers.    An important post was ceded to the enemy in Martuninskiy  Rayon in the morning. However, it was retaken in the afternoon.  Here, Azerbaijanis lost 30 soldiers. There are injured on the  Armenian side and their numbers are being determined.    The Karabakh Defense Army units' operations were more  successful in the southern war front in the direction of  Fizuli-Gadrut.

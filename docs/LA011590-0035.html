			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LEATHERFACE': MASSACRED SEQUEL  </P> <P> Back in 1974, Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" crawled out of the  hinterlands, reeking and screaming, a low-budget regional horror movie about a  family of demented slaughterhouse workers turned cannibals that slashed its way  into the public and critical light. Now, 16 years later, with one failed sequel  in between, comes "Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III" (citywide),  minus Hooper and co-writer Kim Henkel, minus the original cast, minus  everything but the plot -- shamelessly looted and stripped of everything but  its bare, bloody essentials.  </P> <P> Almost two decades after the original massacre, new director Jeff Burr and  screenwriter David Schow would have us believe that the cannibal family is  still operating, undetected, in their woodsy farmhouse. None of the events of  the 1986 "T. C. Massacre 2" -- in which the kill-crazy bunch opened up a string  of barbecue houses and an amusement park -- seem to have affected anyone.  Perhaps that episode was all a bad dream.  </P> <P> But this third one, a complete retrenchment, is no bad dream at all. It's just  vapid deja vu. Every basic scene or plot element is repeated doggedly. This  opportunistic, empty, often illogical sequel, is done without the crazy energy  or stylistic volatility of its predecessors, executed with the grim wariness of  an apprentice butcher who wants to keep his ax clean.  </P> <P> Since 1974, hordes of low-budget horror movies have copied Hooper's nubile  teens-vs-crazed killers form -- and then replicated themselves endlessly, like  rotting toadstools on a felled tree.  </P> <P> But you can't catch horror in a bottle -- especially a recycled one.  "Leatherface" (MPAA-rated R, for language and violence) is as tasteless as its  predecessors, but it reduces fear to a business and blood to a drip. It's a  slaughterhouse without any real buzz.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi -- Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas,  prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], has  said that Aden does not object to the dispatch to Yemen of an  Arab deterrent force to observe the cease-fire and disengage the  forces.    He said this in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Abu  Dhabi  yesterday. Al-'Attas said that the DRY's priority now is "a  cease-fire and then to discuss the procedures for disengaging  the forces and deploying observers."    He added that the DRY urges the Gulf Cooperation Council  [GCC] states and Egypt, to which the credit for the UN Security  Council resolution goes, to continue their role in the Security  Council so that the council may continue to implement its  resolution and take the necessary measures for that in  accordance with the stipulations of the UN Charter.    Al-'Attas said that "Recognition of the DRY is not our  priority, because recognition has become a reality since war  broke out. The pressing question now is to halt the war." He  pointed out that northern forces have recently -- having failed  to achieve the aims it had set for themselves -- resorted to  hitting residential areas and civilian and economic  installations. Al-'Attas said that Aden's contacts with the GCC  states have borne fruit over the past two days, as the United  States has issued a new statement expressing utmost concern over  the continuation of the fighting and openly expressing its  position calling for an immediate halt to the war.    He stressed that the continuation of the war will result in  numerous complications, and that "the northerners' insistence on  continuing it reflects despair and loss of control."    On the Arab League's exclusion from the diplomatic efforts  Aden is making, al-'Attas said that "the DRY has from the outset  referred to the Arab League, and contacts are continuing with  it, as a meeting has been held with the Arab League secretary  general."    He pointed out that the league supports the UN Security  Council resolution, but the conditions the Arab League is  experiencing are not helping it to take a decision. He said  that "the DRY welcomes any role by the league in the framework  of the UN Security Council resolution."</p>

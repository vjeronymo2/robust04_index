			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Lao </F> People's Democratic Republic on an assessment of the  implementation for 1993-94 of the Lao-U.S. cooperation plan for  American prisoners of war and personnel missing in action --  read by announcer; date not given]    [Text] According to a report of the Foreign Affairs  Ministry, the Voice of America -- an official mouthpiece of the  U.S. State Department -- carried reports on 2 January and again  on 13 January blaming the Lao side for failing to provide  sufficient cooperation in excavating, surveying, and searching  for American pilots missing in action during the war in Laos,  the war for which the U.S. official sector has never admitted  that it employed various types of aircraft to drop three-all  [kill all, burn all, and destroy all] destructive bombs on Lao  territory and that the bombardments took many lives, destroyed  considerable property, and left extensive damage to the  environment. After the end of the war, instead of paying  compensation to the Lao side for the losses deliberately caused  by the air bombardments, the U.S. side even pressed Laos and  Vietnam, which are still suffering bruises from this war of  aggression, to cooperate with it in searching for American  pilots. These pilots flew planes shot down by the Lao and  Vietnamese peoples while they were dropping bombs on a large  scale to mercilessly kill these people.    Though the innocent Lao people still strongly resent the  U.S.  bombing, the government, as well as the ill-fated Lao people,  have consistently agreed to cooperate well with the U.S. side in  surveying, excavating, searching, and investigating the fates of  these airborne pirates, despite the fact that the ill-fated Lao  people, who experienced the suffering, have not been given any  compensation for the losses caused by that destructive war. The  Lao Government and people have cooperated with the U.S. side  because they consider the issue a humanitarian one and have  taken into consideration the feelings of the American people,  who have also suffered due to the policies and secret activities  of their official sectors.    This cooperation, as has been mentioned many times, began in  1985 and 1986, when Lao and American technical teams excavated  crash sites in Paksong District, Champassak Province. From then  until late September 1993, the two sides jointly conducted  surveys and excavations on 35 occasions in 11 provinces. So  far, the remains of some 51 American personnel missing in action  have been discovered. The U.S. side, however, has never made any  announcements or remarks publicly acknowledging this. It is not  known why the deputy head of the Congress of the United States,  [title as heard] known as the person in charge of following up  and expediting this issue and who has apparently known all about  Lao cooperation from the beginning, has not mentioned anything  about it. He has only said unconstructively that Laos has not  cooperated, and that as Laos has failed to cooperate, it is  necessary to put ever more pressure on Laos to do so.    To clear up the false accusations of the Voice of America  and  of the spokesman of the U.S. State Department and to enable  peace- and justice-loving people throughout the world determine  themselves what is true, what is false, who is right, and who is  wrong in connection with this issue, the Lao side deems it  necessary to clarify and give the following details about Lao  cooperation, particularly in 1993 and 1994 -- from October 1993  until February 1994 -- by reviewing the reports of Lao officials  in charge of this issue:    The Lao-American cooperation project on American prisoners  of  war and personnel missing in wartime can be divided into the  four following categories:    1. Surveys and excavations of areas around plane crashes.  Based on the plan and data presented by the United States at the  technical meeting held 16-17 September 1993, the U.S. proposed  joint surveys and excavation of six crash sites in 10 provinces  throughout the country, namely Attopeu, Sekong, Saravane,  Savannakhet, Khammouane, Bolikhamsai, Vientiane, Houa Phan,  Xieng Khouang, and Luang Prabang Provinces. These began in  October 1993 and will end in late September 1994. From October  1993 to February 1994, joint surveys and excavations were  conducted on three occasions.    The surveys and excavations on the first occasion took  place simultaneously in Sekong and Saravane Provinces. The work  lasted 23 days -- from 19 October to 12 November 1993. It was  performed jointly by 32 personnel from the U.S. side and seven  from the Lao side, excluding local labor. Four helicopters were  used. No motorcars were used, because all the sites are on  mountains. There were 23 survey points and three excavation  points. Eight personnel excavated at point 1530 where a C-130  was shot down in 1968. A number of skeletons and teeth were  discovered at that point. Ten personnel worked at point 1600  where a C-130 was shot down in 1971. A number of skeletons and  teeth were discovered there. Excavation was impossible at the  third point, point 1382, because there were live bombs  throughout the area. The excavation was suspended as hazardous  to the personnel involved. Joint surveys were conducted on 23  points of plane crashes.    The joint surveys and excavations in the second stage,  called  tripartite cooperation by the U.S. side -- Lao-U.S. and  Vietnamese-U.S. cooperation -- were conducted along the  Lao-Vietnamese border in Sekong, Saravane, and Savannakhet  Provinces. Work was carried out in a radius of 10 km from each  side of the borde, the radius which the U.S. side considered a  privileged case based on the agreement reached by the deputy  minister-level tripartite meeting held in Hawaii on 10 August  1993. The second group of surveys and excavations took place  over 16 days -- from 4 to 20 December 1993. A total of 32 from  the U.S. side and seven from the Lao side, excluding auxiliary  personnel, took part in these. Four helicopters and four motor  vehicles were employed in the second stage. There were 17 survey  points and three excavation points. At point 1643 a number of  skeletons and teeth were discovered, while at points 1719 and  1750, pilots' emblems and wreckage of downed aircraft were  discovered.    During this second stage, tripartite technical meetings were  held on four occasions at the Lao Bao border checkpoint to  exchange information. The first meeting was on 4 December, the  second on 6 December, the third on 10 December, and the fourth  and last on 15 December 1993. In the final tripartite meeting  at the Lao Bao border checkpoint on 15 December 1993, Winston  Lord, deputy assistant to the U.S. secretary of state [title as  heard], accompanied by Major General Thomas Needham, attended  the meeting to observe the actual bilateral and tripartite  cooperation. After the meeting, the two expressed thanks to the  Lao Government for the fine cooperation that it has consistently  given to the U.S. side.    The third stage of surveys and excavations was conducted in  Savannakhet Province. It began on 12 January and ended on 8  February 1994, lasting 28 days. Conducting the surveys and  excavations were 32 personnel from the U.S. side and seven  others from the Lao side, excluding supporting laborers. Four  helicopters and four automobiles were employed. A camp was set  up in Sepon District on Route 9. According to the plan proposed  by the U.S. side, 26 points on crash sites were to be surveyed  and six were to be excavated -- two in Vilabouli, two in Sepon,  one in Phin, and another in Atsaphangthong Districts. As of 6  February 1994, the surveys were completed on 17 points.  Excavations at 0571 and 1363 have been completed. A number of  teeth and skeletons were discovered.    At the time this report was prepared, an excavation was  conducted at point 9950 in Na Gnom Canton, Vilabouli District,  while preparations were being made for further excavation at  point 0370. Excavations were conducted on many occasions at  point 0018. The U.S. side has requested more excavations at  this point, and the Lao side has had no objection. As the  operation is still in progress, the achievements in conducting  the surveys and excavations of the third stage can not be  reviewed and assessed yet.    2. The second category of the Lao-U.S. cooperation project  on this issue is the investigation and search for American POWs  whom the U.S. side believes to be alive. To show its good  intentions and sincerity to clear accusations from U.S.  officialdom, which has claimed that there are still American  POWs in Laos, despite the denials by the Lao side all along that  no more such POWs remain and that there is no reason for the Lao  side to keep them in Laos if there were any, the Lao side is  willing to cooperate. If the U.S. side has concrete and  reliable information on the living POWs, let the Lao side be  informed so that a team can be set up to investigate.    In fact, in the recent past, the two sides have jointly  investigated on many occasions. No facts concerning POWs have  been found on any occasion. Examples were the case of Captain  Borah, who was later found to be a 60-year-old Lao Theuang  tribesman, namely (A-lao), and the case of First Lieutenant  (Kha), whose photo was shown to the Lao side to assist with the  search. According to American experts, the photo was believed to  be a photo of 1st. Lt. (Kha). The Lao side, not expert in this  field, said immediately after seeing the picture that the person  is not an American and that the picture was not taken in Laos.  The Lao side saw the picture as taken in a zoo in Thailand.  Some one month later, it was determined that it is not a  picture of 1st. Lt. (Kha). It is instead a picture of a German  national, named Gunther, who runs a small business in Thailand.    Later, on 2 and 4 November 1993, the Lao side took (Gary  Smith), an American expert in this field, to Toumlan village in  Saravane Province. According to U.S. news sources, an American  national was found living in the village. The news was received  from a Thai trader working in the province. After an  investigation, the person was found to be a physician attached  to Medecins Sans Frontieres, which implemented an aid project in  Laos. Later, on 25 and 28 January 1994, the Lao side also took  (Gary Smith) to Nong Ma Village and Gnommalat District in  Khammouane province to further investigate information he  received about the detention of Americans at the two places. To  make sure, our side granted special permission for him to  inspect the Gnommalat prison and interrogate prisoners and  people in nearby areas on whatever he wanted to know. But, he  found no Americans living in the area. A bad point was that  while inspecting the Gnommalat prison, instead of inquiring  about the trail of the Americans, the American technician asked  why the Lao nationals were detained there. Can this be seen as  coming to find fault with the host country, which has cooperated  with the U.S. side?    3. Interviews of prominent persons: At U.S. suggestion, the  Lao side has allowed the U.S. to interview Sot Phetlasi in  Vientiane twice. The second time was on 8 January 1994. The  U.S. was also allowed to interview Lieutenant Colonel Khamla  Keophithoun in Beijing, China, on 19 December 1993.    4. Probing various war documents and films: In response to  a U.S. suggestion, the Lao allowed American experts to examine  and list available films on 10 January 1994. This project is  expected continue for the rest of the year. In addition, on 26  January 1994, the Lao also granted permission for the U.S. to  inspect the revolutionary museum in Vientiane.    In general, the Lao Government and people, as well as local  administrations and concerned authorities at all levels of the  Lao side, have cooperated well with the U.S. all along in  dealing with the problem of American POW-MIAs. According to an  agreement reached between the two sides, since August 1987 the  U.S. Government has given assurance to the Lao side that in  return for good cooperation, the U.S. will provide appropriate  humanitarian aid to the Lao people. Based on said agreement,  the Lao side has, therefore, requested said humanitarian aid  from the U.S. for 1993-94. The request, in terms of medicine,  small medical equipment, water pumps, generators, and  motorcycles for local cadres working in support of the project,  was made at the technical meeting held in Vientiane on 16-17  September 1993.    So far, the Lao side has not yet received any aid from the  U.S., while the surveys, excavations, collection of information  about American POWs believed to be still alive, interviews, and  the probing of films and documents has been done continuously  each and every week and every month to the extent that there is  almost no time for rest. What does the U.S. want the Lao to do  so as to be seen as cooperating sufficiently? If Lao  cooperation given fails to meet U.S. requirements, would it be  better for us to stop wasting time continuing to do it?</p>

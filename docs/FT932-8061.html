			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Golden Vale stake in Danish company Golden Vale, the Irish dairy group, has agreed to acquire 33 per cent of Danish company A/S Vejle Margarinefabrik, margarine manufacturer, for DKr25m (Pounds 2.6m), payable in cash on completion. Golden Vale has an option to acquire a further 33 per cent by December 31 1993 for a similar amount. In the year to September 30 1992 the Danish company made pre-tax profits of DKr5.8m on sales of DKr102.2m. Net asset amounted to DKr23.1m. In April the Irish dairy group reported a 13.5 per cent increase to IPounds 16.7m in 1992 pre-tax profits. Net borrowings fell to IPounds 7.5m (IPounds 20.6m), and gearing to 8.8 per cent (27.9 per cent). The company said this allowed it to spend 'another IPounds 30m to IPounds 40m on acquisitions without having to go to the market.' Shortly after it completed the acquisition of Leckpatrick Holdings, a private dairy processor based in Northern Ireland. The consideration consisted of 10-year loan notes, redeemable after one year, valuing each Leckpatrick share at 332p. There was a partial cash alternative up to a total of IPounds 4.34m.</p>

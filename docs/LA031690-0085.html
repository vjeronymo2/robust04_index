			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RABBIS SEEK TO POSTPONE SPRAYING;  </P> <P> MEDFLY: COUNCILMAN WACHS JOINS APPEAL FOR GOVERNOR TO HALT TONIGHT'S MALATHION  TREATMENT IN VALLEY SO JEWS CAN WALK TO SERVICES.  </P> <P> City Councilman Joel Wachs and four San Fernando Valley rabbis appealed  Thursday to Gov. George Deukmejian to postpone tonight's Valley malathion  spraying, protesting that "insensitive" scheduling is forcing thousands of Jews  to choose between a potential health risk and attending Sabbath services.  </P> <P> But an official overseeing the state's anti-Medfly project said the Department  of Food and Agriculture would make no exceptions -- especially after the  barrage of criticism it received for exempting the Crystal Cathedral in Orange  County.  </P> <P> The Jewish leaders had angrily noted at their news conference the exemption  given the landmark Protestant church in Garden Grove. The Crystal Cathedral,  headquarters of evangelist Robert Schuller, was omitted from a malathion  spraying area Jan. 25 because 2,700 ministers were attending a leadership  conference.  </P> <P> Wachs told the news conference at Temple Adat Ari El in North Hollywood that he  could not "think of a greater insensitivity" than Friday night's spraying. "It  flies in the face of time-honored practices."  </P> <P> "For the first time, religious freedom has become an issue in the Medfly  program," he wrote in a letter faxed to the governor.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Deukmejian said the letter had just been received Thursday  and that his office had no immediate comment.  </P> <P> But Dr. Isi Siddiqui, an assistant director of the Department of Food and  Agriculture, had rejected Wachs' request on Tuesday. He said Thursday the  department is still smarting from its last attempt to accommodate a religious  group.  </P> <P> "After the Crystal Cathedral, we had lots of adverse publicity -- so much so we  had to decide that this was a one-time exemption and would not happen again,"  he said. "We learned a difficult lesson. We tried to be good guys, but we got a  lot of criticism from others saying we were playing favorites."  </P> <P> Siddiqui added that Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays are generally exempt from  malathion spraying as a concession to weekend activities.  </P> <P> North Hollywood, Sun Valley, and Studio City -- an area Wachs said has at least  nine synagogues -- are part of a 47-square-mile area of the Valley to be  sprayed tonight. The spraying was rescheduled because of Monday's rain.  </P> <P> About 250,000 Jews live in the Valley, according to the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Wachs said the area includes at least three Orthodox synagogues, whose members  walk to services because they are forbidden to drive on the Sabbath. Many  Conservative Jews also walk to services out of respect for tradition, said the  rabbis, who noted that the state has advised residents to stay indoors during  sprayings.  </P> <P> Although Food and Agriculture officials insist malathion is harmless to humans  in the dosages being applied, opponents claim it irritates eyes and throats and  may cause unknown, long-term harm.  </P> <P> About 20 mothers attended Thursday's news conference with their toddlers,  carrying signs such as "Don't Spray Where Our Children Play."  </P></p>

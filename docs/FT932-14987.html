			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Sega links with cable TV groups SEGA, the Japanese video games and entertainment company, is linking with Time Warner and Tele-Communications (TCI), two of the largest US cable television companies, to deliver video games software directly to US homes. The three companies are setting up a joint venture company in the US that will use satellite broadcasting to send Sega video games software to subscribers of Time Warner and TCI's cable television. They will take equal shares in the new company, which is due to be established in the US this summer. Details of the video games service have not yet been finalised, but the subscription fee is expected to be between Dollars 15 and Dollars 20. Subscribers will need a Sega Genesis video games machine, selling for about Dollars 100 in the US, and an adaptor, unless they own one of the 7.5m Genesis machines sold in the US. Sega said the large base of Genesis users was expected to provide the first subscribers. It believes the service could attract most of the 20m subscribers to Time Warner and TCI's cable television service. The deal places Sega a step ahead of Nintendo, the largest video games manufacturer and Sega's arch-rival, which has been planning to launch a similar service.</p>

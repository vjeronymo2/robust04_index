			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'SINGER &amp; SONS' OFFERS A COMIC SLICE OF DELI LIFE  </P> <P> Here comes couch potato salad.  </P> <P> New York deli owner Nathan Singer (Harold Gould) frets about having no heirs to  carry on the family business.  </P> <P> "I need sons, right the hell now!" the aging widower says on the premiere of  the NBC summer comedy "Singer &amp; Sons" (at 9:30 tonight on Channels 4, 36  and 39).  </P> <P> In a manner of speaking, he gets them in Mitchell (Bobby Hosea) and Reggie  (Tommy Ford) Patterson, the adult sons of his housekeeper (Esther Rolle). And  the way in which these feuding black brothers come to be fixtures in helping  run a Jewish deli is pretty predictable fare.  </P> <P> "Singer &amp; Sons" is where "Oy veh" and "What's happenin', man?" mingle. The  deli's street-talking black waitress (Arnetia Walker) tells customers: "This  food ain't changed since Moses." Neither have some of the jokes, unfortunately.  </P> <P> But not all of them, for "Singer &amp; Sons" has a way of having fun with  ethnic stereotypes without being offensive, while providing enough amusing  moments to merit another tune-in when it returns in its regular time slot at 9  p.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> The characters are likable, and co-creators Michael Jacobs and Bob Young have  recruited a fine cast to play them. It's Gould who's the beef in this kosher  soul-food sandwich, however. The premiere is at its best when he and that other  grand trouper, Rolle, are interacting in front of the camera, and at its worst  when the two brothers are bickering. HOWARD ROSENBERG  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EARTHWATCH;  </P> <P> HEALTHY PLANET;  </P> <P> EATING VEGETABLES CUTS CHOLESTEROL AND CAN HELP SAVE THE FORESTS AND PROTECT  THE OZONE LAYER.  </P> <P> It's another growing season, and farmers are hoping President Bush will come  out against another vegetable. "It did wonders for broccoli," a Southern  California farmer told me last week. "Right now, we're a little long on giant  asparagus."  </P> <P> You might well ask how a dazzling urbanite like yourself (or myself) could  possibly be interested in agricultural market conditions. Recently, I visited  the doctor who was incredulous at my cholesterol count. I was alarmed until I  realized her surprise was over how low the numbers were, not how high. She  asked me what I regularly ate, and after hearing my recitation, she said in a  voice tinged with alarm, "Why, you're practically a vegetarian!"  </P> <P> I could go on about the health benefits of eating veggies and fruits, but this  is an environmental column, not a health column. So let's talk about the  earth's health, not mine.  </P> <P> Environmentally, your veggies play a fascinating role in the world. If you eat  more of them, you're helping not just your own health but the planet's. I have  read that every person who switches to a pure vegetarian diet saves an acre of  trees from being cut every year.  </P> <P> Last week brought alarming news about forest loss. It's far worse -- half again  as bad as we thought. Fifty million acres going each year. A whole state's  worth. Big states like Washington. Meat production is one of the big causes.  The harm is threefold. Loss of the oxygen-producing trees, plus the carbon  pollution from the burning. Plus -- and this is both alarming and disagreeable  -- the cattle that replace the trees on the land produce digestive gases that  account for fully a third of the greenhouse effect (according to both the old  and new deforestation reports from the U.N.).  </P> <P> This is not an anti-Burger King tirade, by the way. The minute they offered  chicken earlier this year their sales of that sandwich quickly accounted for a  third of their business. And McDonald's is now posting notices letting you know  how to avoid fat. We have choices, and the fast food people are going along by  changing their offerings.  </P> <P> If there is an "enemy" or something "bad," it's inertia or old attitudes. And  that's changing. It's already gone so far that people are saying, "OK, so I'm  eating more veggies -- for my cholesterol -- and, if you say so -- for the  planet.  </P> <P> "But what about the pesticides? When I go vegetarian, do I have to go organic,  too?" I discussed this with a Moorpark grower who, you would think, had every  reason to turn up his nose at supermarket veggies. I mean his thing is to have  you come on his organic farm and pick your own right out of the ground.  </P> <P> He showed me reports of a the State Department of Food and Agriculture study  saying that 90% of the fruits and vegetables in the supermarkets are  pesticide-free. From 5% to 8% have marginal residue and 2% to 3% enough to be  concerned about. But you'd have to stick to eating only that particular  vegetable from that farm every day for the rest of your life to get sick.  </P> <P> Tap water with chlorine is more dangerous, according to Berkeley professor  Bruce Ames, whose research is the basis of the California anti-toxics ballot  initiative. He says the real way to beat cancer is not to worry about  pesticides on your vegetables but to eat less fat.  </P> <P> Further, his review of the biochemical reactions of thousands of chemicals we  usually ingest suggests that certain of them, directly or in foods, might  reduce the onset of cancer. Ames includes Vitamin E, beta-carotene from carrots  and green or yellow veggies, Vitamin C and phenols from cabbage.  </P> <P> So, let's hope the President has additional vegetables on his mind. He can do  us and our local growers a service by bringing us together often.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Taking advantage of the rapidly appreciated yen,  industrial circles are increasingly shifting their production  bases to foreign nations and expanding the import of parts.  Within auto, electric, and machinery industries, some  manufacturers are planning to set up a new management system on  the assumption that the yen's rate against the dollar will be  100 and lower. While establishing short-term measures, they are  also trying to cope with the yen's further appreciation by  taking mid-to-long-range measures such as changing management  systems in hopes of cutting the trade surplus through the  expansion of imports and benefiting from the yen appreciation.    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., in the next two to three  years starting this fiscal year, plans to increase to 30 percent  the rate of material purchases from foreign nations. Mitsubishi  seems to have already increased this rate to 15-16 percent this  fiscal year. Mitsubishi says that "we will set up a new system  that can deal with a possible 95 yen to $1" (according to  Chairman Yotaro Iida) by doubling its purchase of materials  overseas.    NEC Corporation plans to halve its total production costs,  hopefully by the end of 1995. NEC plans to purchase key parts  of personal computers from Taiwanese makers. It also plans to  buy up those parts from its subsidiary company in Hong Kong  starting this autumn. Underlying Japanese manufacturers'  increasing procurement of parts from foreign makers is the fact  that to compete with foreign companies who sell their products  cheap in Japan by taking advantage of the appreciated yen, it is  necessary for Japanese companies to lower parts purchase costs  for their products.    IBM Japan said that a loss in exports for the period  January-December 1993 increased 20 billion yen when compared  with that of 1992. As of late March, IBM Japan has shifted its  production base for hard disk units to Thailand as part of its  measures to improve profit-earning efficiency. It also plans to  relocate factories for producing other disk units to Malaysia.    However, within the industrial circles, there is deep  concern  about the possibility that such rapid shifting of production  bases overseas will lead to industrial "hollowing out"  (according to Sony Corporation President Norio Ohga). As far as  the electronic industry is concerned, Aiwa Co., Ltd., which  specializes in manufacturing audiovisual (AV) products, has  already shifted most of its production base overseas. It  produces 70 percent of its total products in its foreign  factories, and has produced excellent results. This is because  "it is impossible for Japanese makers to produce all the parts  of their products in Japan when the employment situation in  Japan is considered" (according to Sony President Ohga).    Since there is no effective measure to deal with the  appreciated yen, the private sector for its part has no choice  but to cut the trade surplus as much as possible, which is a  main cause of the yen appreciation. Since over 50 percent of  the U.S. deficit in trade with Japan is in the area of  automobiles and auto parts trade, the Japanese automakers, while  promoting their own restructuring efforts, have started giving  serious study to a further increase in imports of finished autos  from the United States.    A senior Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association member  shows his view, saying, "The yen appreciation this time reflects  the situation wherein Japan is given the alternative of opening  its market or allowing the yen to rise further." The Japanese  say that "Japan will face further pressure unless the auto issue  is solved." In this way, there is a voice calling for further  opening of the auto dealers' network to the U.S. makers.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The battle for survival at the coal face - Michael Smith on the cut-throat rivalry as pits compete for a place in the market MR Michael Heseltine was unequivocal. The future of the 12 reprieved pits would not be secured at the expense of the remaining 19, the trade secretary told MPs on Monday. But, as the effects of the government's Commons victory on coal began to sink in yesterday, British Coal managers were less comforting about the future of the 19 which employ more than 15,000 people. 'If we cannot secure a market for all 31 pits - and it is scarcely likely that we will - there are no guarantees for any of them,' said one executive. 'If we gave guarantees we would lay ourselves open to all kinds of legal problems.' A manager at one of the reprieved 12 said he and the miners at his colliery were embroiled in a battle for survival in competition with the other 30 mines. 'There has always been friendly rivalry but now it is going to be a cut-throat business. 'I have set my objectives to be one of the survivors. But if I do it can only be at the expense of another mine, either one of the reprieved or one of the 19.' His argument rests on the widespread belief in British Coal that there is not enough room in the market to sustain the 31 (rising to 32 when Asfordby starts production) under British Coal's ownership beyond the end of this year. After last Thursday's white paper, British Coal committed itself to 'market testing', mainly through trying to sign additional contracts with electricity generators. But few in the organisation believe that this will yield the additional 25m tonnes needed in 1994-95 to sustain all 31 pits, let alone an additional six which have been mothballed and a seventh where development work will continue but large scale mining will cease. This means that some mines are likely to close or be sold to the private sector in nine months to a year. But which pits are most vulnerable? Some of the mothballed mines may exist longer than others because of British Coal's desire for reserves. Those apart, the pits with the largest question marks against their names are the 12 on the reprieved list. However, some of them could leapfrog the 19 on the survival list through a relatively small performance improvement. Take Rufford Colliery, near Mansfield. According to John T Boyd, the US consultancy hired by the government to assess the efficiency of all pits, it could market coal at Pounds 1.40 a gigajoule by 1995-96, a projected loss of 3 pence per gigajoule if new working practices are introduced. That is already better than Boyd's projections for Ellington, in the north-east of England, one of the 19 with an apparently more secure future. It could market coal at Pounds 1.28 per gigajoule and a loss of 29p. Rufford has only a slightly less rosy future than Tower colliery in south Wales, second to bottom on the Boyd list of 19, which could market coal at Pounds 1.55 and a profit of 9p. This is not to say that Rufford will replace Ellington or Tower on the list of most likely survivors, even if it does perform better than expected. First, British Coal will probably be making closure decisions from later this year onwards and Boyd's projections refer to two years hence. Other factors will influence closures, including pits' proximity to power stations and their level of reserves. The closeness of the figures demonstrates one reason why there is no fixed line between the 19 and the 12, especially for those ranked by Boyd at the bottom and top of each list. Legal considerations are as important. British Coal had its fingers burned in December when the High Court ruled it had not consulted widely enough before determining the first 10 pits to close. It was told that the closure decisions should be subject to independent scrutiny and it was suggested that Boyd could provide that role. The two thick books of assessments have supplied the unions or anyone else wanting to dispute closure decisions with a mass of information. 'We do not want to get into the legal problems we suffered in December,' says one British Coal executive. 'We will have to be - and to be seen to be - scrupulously fair.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW BRITISH COAL'S REMAINING MINES MEASURE UP  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Projected          Projected                                market price             margin                                     1995/96             Pounds                                      Pounds        (Gigajoule)                                 (Gigajoule)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daw Mill*                              1.57               0.57 Wistow*                                1.44               0.49 Thoresby*                              1.45               0.47 Goldthorpe*                            1.42               0.42 North Selby*                           1.44               0.37 Harworth*                              1.45               0.38 Riccall*                               1.44               0.33 Manton*                                1.49               0.34 Kellingley*                            1.52               0.32 Welbeck*                               1.45               0.31 Whitemoor*                             1.44               0.25 Longannet*                             1.51               0.26 Annesley*                              1.42               0.25 Stillingfleet*                         1.44               0.20 Littleton*                             1.53               0.19 Ollerton*                              1.45               0.15 Silverwood*                            1.47               0.11 Tower*                                 1.55               0.09 Ellington*                             1.28              -0.29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hatfield**                             1.54               0.35 Prince of Wales**                      1.42               0.27 Frickley**                             1.49               0.27 Point of Ayr**                         1.20               0.18 Wearmouth**                            1.28               0.12 Silverdale**                           1.40               0.14 Bentley**                              1.44               0.11 Bilsthorpe**                           1.40               0.04 Calverton**                            1.58               0.02 Kiveton Park**                         1.44              -0.01 Rufford**                              1.40              -0.03 Markham**                              1.42              -0.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Maltby***                              1.52               0.41  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rossington****                         1.50               0.28 Shirebrook****                         1.42               0.08 Clipstone****                          1.47               0.01 Bevercotes****                         1.45              -0.19 Westoe****                             1.20              -0.46 Easington****                          1.25              -0.55  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    * Pits not on original closure list   ** Reprieved  *** Development **** Mothballed  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: John T.

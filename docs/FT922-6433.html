			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Books: Responses to God WHAT IS FAITH? by Anthony Kenny Oxford University Press Pounds 5.99, 125 pages IF SOMEONE says, 'I believe in God' he means one of at least three things. He believes that God exists; or he believes that God is a reliable source of information, as conveyed by revelation; or he trusts in God's interest and protection and acts in response to them. Someone who believes in this third way must also believe in the two preceding ways. Someone who believes in God's revelation does not have to respond to it, but he must believe that God exists. But someone who believes that God exists need neither believe his revelation nor place trust in him. One may, of course, not be sure about God's existence, and therefore be an agnostic; or disbelieve it outright, and therefore be an atheist. Faith is a narrower concept than belief. It is one of the theological virtues, along with hope and charity. Aristotle believed that there is a divine and self-moving Prime Mover, God. Marlowe's Faustus, teetering on the brink of damnation, sees 'the blood of Christ streaming in the firmament'; so he still has faith, even though he has lost hope and charity. In this book Anthony Kenny investigates whether religious faith is reasonable. It is a problem which invites many approaches, so we find him asking whether we can know God only through revelation, and whether we can resolve the conflict between, on the one hand, the idea that the universe manifests benevolent design, and on the other, the 'Problem of Evil' (how the existence of moral and physical evils in the world can be consistent with its creation by an allegedly good deity). These and related discussions occupy the book's second part. In the first part Kenny tackles the central issue: whether belief in God, in the first two ways described, makes sense. His chief question is not, does God exist? but instead, is it rational to believe that God exists? Few can be better qualified to seek the answer. Kenny is a highly distinguished philosopher who was once a Roman Catholic priest. Until lately Master of Balliol College, Oxford, and now Warden of Rhodes House and President of the British Academy, Kenny has written much and widely: his books include philosophical treatises, an examination of the nuclear arms question, lucid studies of Descartes, Aquinas and other thinkers, and an autobiographical account of his path from the priesthood. It must be tempting for anyone so freighted with distinctions to express himself in ex cathedra vein, but Kenny never does so; he writes with clarity and grace. To determine whether religious belief is rational one first has to clarify the nature of rational belief. On the standard view, a belief is rational if it is suitably proportioned to the evidence for it. Along with other philosophers Kenny thinks this definition inadequate, arguing that there are many rationally acceptable beliefs for which there is, strictly speaking, no evidence, among them those 'basic beliefs' which underlie our world-view and without which we could not have coherent thought. Examples include the belief that physical objects continue to exist when we do not perceive them. On Kenny's view a basic belief is one of three things: it is self-evident, or it is evident to the senses or memory, or it is defensible by argument. Belief in God's existence is neither of the first two, so if it is to count as reasonable it has to be the third. And this means that an enquiry called 'natural theology' has to be possible. Natural theology is investigation into questions about the existence and character of a deity which relies not on scripture, prophecy, or some other means, but only on the careful use of our cognitive powers. This means that neither revelation nor mysticism will suffice to support religious belief; such belief is rational only if good arguments can be given for God's existence. The traditional arguments are familiar enough; they assert that there must be a God because the universe gives the appearance of design; something must have created it; or because the very definition of God involves the concept of his existence. Kenny finds these arguments unsatisfactory, and so declares himself agnostic about natural theology - and therefore unconvinced about the reasonableness of theistic belief. Kenny may leave these fundamental questions tantalisingly open, but in doing so he illuminates our understanding of what they involve, a valuable contribution at a time when interest in them has been sharply revived by new scientific advances.</p>

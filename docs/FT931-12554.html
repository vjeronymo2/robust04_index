			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Record exports by Brazil BRAZIL registered record exports of Dollars 36.2bn (Pounds 23.8bn) last year, notching up a trade surplus of Dollars 15.7bn - its third largest ever. Imports fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 20.5bn - just 4.8 per cent of GDP, despite a reduction in import tariffs. Brazil's export success was due in large part to the competitivity of its exchange rate, particularly in relation to neighbouring Argentina. Exports to Argentina doubled from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 3.07bn. The main export successes were meat, paper and pulp, soyabeans, shoes and textiles. Manufactured goods rose almost 13 per cent to Dollars 21.7bn, and car exports were 125 per cent up. Mr Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira, commerce and industry minister, said that the export target this year was Dollars 42bn, with the focus for expansion on Asia. He pointed out that Brazil's total trade was still only 13 per cent of GDP, below the average for Latin America. Last year's trade performance was even more impressive than the record Dollars 19.2bn surplus recorded in 1988 and the Dollars 16.1bn in 1989, in that Brazil had only recently opened its markets to competition, the minister added. Reuter adds from Braslia: President Itamar Franco, who had cancelled a February 16 meeting with economic aides, described as 'lies' a newspaper report that Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, has prepared a plan including measures against inflation, the state news agency reported. Agencia Brasil, quoting Mr Francisco Baker, presidential spokesman, said the meeting was called off because of speculation in financial markets and the press about a new economic plan.</p>

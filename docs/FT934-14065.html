			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Tied up in claims for damages - US lawyers are concerned at the growing trend to sue them when financial institutions fail There is a commercial currently running on US television that says a lot about American public opinion of lawyers. The advertisement, for a well-known brand of beer, features two good ol' boys in a bar fantasising about a rodeo in which the cowboys rope lawyers instead of cattle - a bell goes and out of the pen comes not a steer but Herman, a 17-stone tax attorney. In normal times you would expect American lawyers to laugh it off. But these are not normal times for the US legal profession. Not only is the public standing of lawyers at an all-time low, in recent years they have increasingly found themselves the target of multi-million dollar legal actions, following the failure of financial institutions to which they acted as advisers. To accountants, these actions have become all too familiar on both sides of the Atlantic. This week in the UK, for example, the administrators of Polly Peck, the failed fruit-to-electronics group, will issue a writ against the company's auditor, Stoy Hayward, in an attempt to recover up to Pounds 370m allegedly siphoned off by the fugitive former chairman, Mr Asil Nadir. But for lawyers, being made the systematic target of actions for damages for alleged professional negligence is a new experience. Many of the claims against lawyers in the US have arisen out of the recent savings and loans (building societies) crisis. Unable to recover much from more than 700 savings and loans institutions and hundreds of banks which have been closed by federal regulators over the last four years, federal agencies and investors have looked increasingly to lawyers and accountants as a source of compensatory damages. Among the failed societies, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan stands out as the source of more claims against lawyers and accountants than any other institution. Altogether, six law firms, partners of two other law firms and three leading accounting firms faced claims based on their work for Lincoln and its parent, American Continental Corp. The failure of Lincoln prompted civil claims by bondholders of ACC and two federal agencies, the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). So far Dollars 338m has been recovered from the professional advisers - roughly Dollars 180m from the lawyers and Dollars 155m from the accountants. According to Mr Harris Weinstein, of US lawyers Covington &amp; Burling, the claims against the lawyers in the Lincoln case were similar to those in many of the other cases growing out of the US savings and loan crisis. There were allegations of conflict of interest, such as that lawyers had inappropriately represented the parent, subsidiary and affiliate, when their interests clearly differed. There were allegations that the lawyers proceeded improperly in the face of evidence of intended illegal conduct by the client. And there were allegations that lawyers ignored their knowledge of the facts in writing legal opinions. In addition, Mr Weinstein told the International Bar Association meeting in New Orleans last week, the OTS actions against Kaye, Scholer and James Fleischer underlined that lawyers can also be held responsible for a client's failure to disclose information to its primary federal regulator. Why, if all these allegations are true, are lawyers in general so worried and complaining so loudly about the treatment of a handful of their colleagues, whose professional behaviour appears to have been below the required standard? The lawyers' first concern is that the savings and loan litigation has shifted the goalposts of attorney/client privilege. In the action brought against law firm Jones, Day in Arizona, assertions by the firm that it could not be held liable for merely advising its client were rejected by Judge Bilby. The line between maintaining a client's confidence and violating the federal securities laws was clearer than Jones, Day thought. An attorney should withdraw when he knows a client is engaged in a course of conduct designed to deceive others, and where it is obvious that the attorney's compliant legal advice may be a substantial factor in permitting the deception to continue, the judge said. But as lawyers point out, Judge Bilby's analysis of the correct course of professional conduct assumes that a lawyer knows that a client is engaged in deceit and that it is obvious that the attorney's advice will facilitate the illegal scheme. In reality, however, it is often difficult for lawyers to know when a client is engaged in fraud, and far from obvious that their legal advice will facilitate the deception. And how far should the lawyers go? Should they simply withdraw, or should they inform the regulators when they suspect a client may be planning something illegal? Lawyers say such a change in the attorney/client relationship would inevitably lead to defensive lawyering, rather as medical negligence actions in the US have led to defensive medicine. Deals that would have been legal will not be done. Shareholders who could have expected to profit from those deals will suffer. The second concern of the lawyers is shared by the accountants. It is that the prospect of expensive awards of damages, coupled with the laws of joint and several liability which allow any successful plaintiff to sue any one of the defendants found to have acted wrongfully for the entire amount of the judgment, will make it impossible to obtain sufficient professional indemnity insurance cover. If professionals continue to be seen by plaintiff's lawyers as 'deep pockets' offering the best prospect of compensatory damages for their clients, then some large law and accountancy firms could face ruin. Fears along these lines were expressed in New Orleans by Mr Tim Lawrence, the partner responsible for professional indemnity insurance arrangements for accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Accountants inevitably made mistakes and errors of judgment from time to time, he said. They could find themselves as auditors of a company that turned out to have been run by crooks. But they did not proceed on the assumption that everyone they were dealing with was dishonest. Yet, when in good faith they found they were inadvertently involved in a den of thieves, they were often accused of fraud, gross negligence and of being a Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisation (RICO). He asked whether the plaintiff's lawyers really believed that, or whether they were simply prepared to adopt the legal device best calculated to maximise the damages recoverable by their clients, and their own contingent fees. Mr Lawrence also wondered where the morality lay in allowing claimants to recover far more than they had lost. The concept of triple and punitive damages in the US could leave shareholders in a failed company better off than they might have been if the company had been successful. And where was the fairness in the laws of joint and several liability that allowed Coopers recently to find itself the primary target for a claim where, he said, on any concept of equity, no one could have attributed more than 10 per cent of the fault to the accountants. Mr Lawrence called for urgent reform of the law of joint and several liability so that the amount a professional person had to bear had some relation to his or her proportionate responsibility for the loss suffered. Already it was impossible to insure a big accounting firm for a sum adequate to cover the risks it faced, he said. If something was not done, 'people of the right quality will no longer be prepared to attempt the task of auditing the financial statements of any company with less than an AAA (credit) rating. The crooks will then have unfettered opportunity to bamboozle the third-rate auditors that remain.' It is difficult to judge the significance of the current claims for damages facing accountants and lawyers in the US. Some believe that it is a temporary phenomenon. Mr A A Sommer, a partner of US law firm Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius and former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission, believes lawyers' present problem is tied to the savings and loans crisis, and that it is just a one-off matter. Others disagree, however. Mr Mel Weiss, a New York plaintiff's attorney, believes it is right to target professionals who fail in their professional duty. And he also warned that what America had experienced today the rest of the world would experience tomorrow. 'You're going to see what we have here exported internationally,' he predicted. Soon it might not be only American lawyers being roped in television advertisements.  ----------------------------------------------------------------                       EXPENSIVE SUITS  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Settlements arising out of the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan case  ---------------------------------------------------------------- DEFENDANTS                    PAID TO             PAID TO Lawyers/accountants        US GOVERNMENT      ACC BONDHOLDERS                              Dollars m            Dollars m  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Jones, Day                      51.0                 24.0 Kaye, Scholer                   41.0                 20.0 Mariscal, Weeks                  5.0                  2.0 Parker, Milliken             undisclosed             4.65 Sidley &amp; Austin                  7.5                  4.0 Troutman, Sanders               20.0                  na Lee Henkel                      0.05                  na Michael Gardner                 0.35                  na James Fleischer                  0.6                  na Arthur Andersen                 20.0                 30.0 Deloitte &amp; Touche                na                 8.5 Ernst &amp; Young                   36.0                 63.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                         181.50               158.15  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Convington &amp; Burling  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

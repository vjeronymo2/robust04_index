			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark weaker on rate cuts THE DOLLAR recovered from an early fall against the D-Mark yesterday after the Dutch and Belgian central banks cut their money market dealing rates, heightening speculation that the Bundesbank will ease monetary policy in the short term, writes James Blitz. However, the D-Mark's weakness yesterday was more a matter of tone than substance. Dealers remain uncertain when the next easing in German official and rates will come, while a slightly narrower US trade deficit in September left the market no better informed yesterday about the scope for an economic upturn. The central banks of Belgium and the Netherlands reduced their rates following a period in which their currencies have risen strongly against the D-Mark. Both central banks are committed to keeping their currencies within tight ranges against the German one. The Dutch said yesterday that they had eased their special advances rate to 8.70 per cent from 8.80 per cent in response to the strong guilder. The moves had only a minor impact on their currencies against the D-Mark. The Belgian franc closed at BFr20.53 to the D-Mark from a previous close of BFr20.58, and the guilder was unchanged at NFl 1.124 to the D-Mark. However, the easing of policy had an impact on the dollar/D-Mark rate, on speculation that it might now be easier for the Bundesbank to ease policy too. The US currency had weakened against the D-Mark at the start of European trading, dropping to DM1.5815. But dealers tried to push the dollar through the DM1.60 barrier at the end of the European day, and the currency closed more-or-less unchanged at DM1.5975. Sterling failed to benefit much from the continental moves, although UK equity dealers said that the rate cuts had helped to underpin sterling after the recent easing in UK base rates. Some dealers even suggested that a cut in UK base rate to 6 per cent would be more likely before the end of the year. The pound closed unchanged at DM2.4300. Against the dollar it closed slightly firmer at Dollars 1.5210. Another factor affecting European trading yesterday was the decision of the Swiss authorities to add liquidity to the Swiss franc money market, in order to ease what they described as 'tension' in market interest rates. The Swiss National Bank has repeatedly said that it would act to prevent a sharp fall in the Swiss franc against the D-Mark as this would risk importing inflation from Germany, the country's largest trading partner. However, the Bank yesterday acted to halt the recent rise in money market rates, and 3-month money closed unchanged at 6 per cent on the bid side. The Swiss franc closed weaker at SFr0.912 to the D-Mark from SFr0.908.</p>

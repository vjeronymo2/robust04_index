			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "deu/mes": "SPD Wants To Attack Chancellor Kohl </F> More Severely; FDP Challenging the Greens"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party [SPD] and the  Free Democratic Party [FDP], losers of the European elections on  12 June, want to improve their results in the October Bundestag  elections by making their concepts more accentuated, and first  of all they want to concentrate on the Saxony-Anhalt local  elections next Sunday [26 June]. According to Federal Manager  Guenter Verheugen, the SPD wants to make it clear at tomorrow's  party conference in Halle that Germany will lose its prospects  if it "continues the politics of the same old rut." According  to FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer, the FDP's campaign will  show voters that the issue to be voted on in autumn is "the  parliamentary existence of political liberalism."    Verheugen said in Bonn that "more reasons are accumulating  each day" for having a tough confrontation with Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In this context, the federal manager  referred to the coalition's failed efforts to present a joint  tax concept for the next four years. The state secretary in the  Finance Ministry, Franz-Christoph Zeitler (Christian Social  Union), said on the weekend that this failure is not due to  differences between the Union and the FDP, but that it involves  an opportunity to focus on different priorities in the election  campaign. Verheugen said this means "simply that each of the  government parties wants to serve their own customers in the  election campaign." The slogan adopted by the Union and the FDP  on tax issues is: "Lie separately, win jointly." But they will  not succeed in this, Verheugen said.    The SPD's one-day party conference in Halle will adopt the  government program and nominate Chairman Rudolf Scharping as  candidate for chancellor. "Both these decisions will confirm  that the SPD under Rudolf Scharping has achieved a high degree  of unity," Verheugen announced. For the federal manager the  lively internal debate on the SPD's election campaign strategy  and coalition statements following the lost European elections  is not surprising. In Verheugen's view, the large amount of good  advice the SPD has received from party members is in line with  the party leadership's basic course: "I cannot trace any  tangible mood suggesting that a coalition statement must be made  or that the strategy of concentrating on a few important issues  must be changed."    Hermann Rappe, chairman of the Chemical Workers' Trade Union  and SPD Bundestag deputy, warned the SPD against making a  coalition statement in favor of the Greens. "Voters want to see  unity in the SPD, and they want to see what the SPD's political  priorities are," Rappe said on DEUTSCHLANDFUNK radio.  Discussions about a coalition with the Greens are not right  strategically, nor tactically, and they harm the party, Rappe  said.    At its strategy debate on Saturday, there was wide agreement  in the FDP Presidium that the party must deepen its election  campaign in terms of contents. Besides achievement-orientation,  the liberals' openness and their speaking out for tolerance and  the constitutional state must be pointed out clearly, Secretary  General Hoyer said. He was commissioned by the party to work  out the "necessary corrections" to the existing advertising  campaign and to present them to the Presidium within the next  two weeks. It is obvious that the FDP must not concentrate  solely on the economy, but must also "build a bridge" toward  ecology; also it has to live up to its traditional role of  "guardian" of the liberal constitutional state.    The FDP leadership also wants to conduct a more accentuated  election campaign against the Greens. In a letter to leading  party functionaries, Hoyer said that the Greens must no longer  be spared on account of being "a party of kindly idealists."  There are many overlaps between voters of the FDP and the  Greens, which must be taken more into account in the future.  The FDP does not want to "outdo the Greens in terms of green  populism," but to step up involvement in issues "that are of  utmost concern to the citizens."    Hoyer fiercely criticized Interior Minister Kanther's  proposal to establish a voluntary reserve police force. Such a  "spare-time police" is the wrong way to meet people's wish for  more security. The state's division of powers must not be  watered down. The right way, and the one that makes sense  financially, is to increase the number of police officers, Hoyer  said.</p>

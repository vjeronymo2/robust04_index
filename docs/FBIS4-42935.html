			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, June 9, IRNA -- Public order and security  were among the issues which Greek Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias discussed with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar  Velayati in Tehran, Greek Government spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos told a regular press briefing Thursday [9 June].    In reply to a Greek journalist's question if Papoulias  raised  the issue of "terrorism" during his talks, Venizelos replied  that he discussed a number of topics with Velayati and other  Iranian officials including the issues of public order and  security.    Papoulias Wednesday flew to Istanbul after a two-day visit  to  the Islamic Republic of Iran.    Last month the british newspaper INDEPENDENT alleged that  members of the greek guerrilla organisation `17 November' had  met Iranian officials.    The news was also reported in the Greek press. Tehran  rejected the report as "baseless and false."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Gu Shihong (7357 2514 1347): "Hainan </F> Implements Preferential Policies for Exit and Entry on Personal  Reasons"]    [Text] Haikou, 8 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- This  reporter learned from today's news briefing by the Hainan  Provincial Public Security Department that, entrusted by the  Ministry of Public Security, Hainan Province had implemented a  series of preferential exit and entry policies.    Peng Xiaomin, of the Exit and Entry Administrative Section  of  the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department, said that  policies toward exit and entry for personal reasons which are  more preferential than those of other localities in China are as  follows:    First, the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department can  issue visas directly to Taiwan residents on their landing at the  Haikou and Sanya ports. According to the policy of "issuing  visas on landing," Taiwan residents need not go through any  formalities before they come to Hainan. With valid documents,  they can fly from Taiwan to Hong Kong, change planes there, and  come to Hainan. In addition, if Taiwan compatriots wish to go  to any open city on the mainland, but do not want to stay in  Hong Kong or Macao to go through formalities, they also can come  to Hainan first, obtain an "Entry and Exit Permit for Taiwan  Resident Visiting the Mainland," then take a plane from Hainan  to the hinterland. They can leave the mainland via any open  port and without restriction. The Exit and Entry Administrative  Section of the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department has  set up visa offices at the airports and wharves of the Haikou  and Sanya ports where incoming Taiwan compatriots can obtain an  "Entry and Exit Permit for Taiwan Resident Visiting the  Mainland" immediately after showing valid documents, filling in  a form, and submitting two photos. The formalities are very  simple.    Second, it is not only easy to enter Hainan, but convenient  to leave it, as well. According to Hainan's policy for  formalities connected with the "Application for Exit Permit With  a Certificate of Temporary Residence" which have been approved  by the Ministry of Public Security, working personnel who have  lived in Hainan for more than six months and who have registered  their residence outside Hainan may apply in Hainan for travel  documents to visit other countries and Hong Kong. Working  personnel who have lived in Hainan for more than one year not  only can travel to other countries, but also can apply for  passports for personal reasons, such as to work, to visit  relatives and friends, or to receive training abroad. In  particular, Chinese citizens can go by sea to Vietnam following  the Sanya-Da Nang sea route, and foreigners and Taiwan  compatriots can come directly from Vietnam to Hainan. It is  said that this is China's only exit and entry sea link with  Vietnam.    In addition, the Ministry of Public Security and the Hong  Kong Immigration Department have agreed that beginning 1 January  this year, the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department may  issue "Multiple Entry and Exit Permit for Visitors to Hong Kong  and Macao" for personal reasons. This provides convenience for  personnel engaged in trade, economic, and science and technology  activities in Hainan who want to go to Hong Kong.    According to statistics, the number of foreigners who came  to  Hainan for a short stay last year amounted to 22,887 -- an  increase of 5.8 percent over the previous year. Last year, the  number of Taiwan residents who came to Haikou by plane or by sea  directly from Taiwan via Hong Kong amounted to 4,348.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Uri Lubrani, the coordinator of </F> government activities in Lebanon, by Ya'el Dan and Ya'aqov Eylon  on 21 June; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Dan] Earlier this morning, we spoke with Uri  Lubrani, the coordinator of government activities in Lebanon.  In our first question we noted that ever since Mustafa  al-Dirani's abduction [on 21 May], tension and anxiety have  prevailed throughout Israel's northern settlements. Despite  fear of a Hizballah retaliation or terrorist attack, things had  been relatively quiet. We asked Lubrani whether yesterday's  attack was the reprisal everyone had feared.    [Lubrani] I think this operation should be viewed as part of  our ongoing struggle in the security zone. The IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] soldiers often travel in convoys. Although this  was an especially serious attack it definitely falls within the  framework of regular occurrences. Regrettably, however, we paid  a heavy price this time.    [Eylon] How would you define this routine, Mr. Lubrani?  Prime Minister Rabin also said yesterday that there had been no  exacerbation along the northern border. What are the parameters?    [Lubrani] There are no clear lines. Sometimes, there is a  steep rise in activity while other periods are more quiet. As  you just mentioned, we recently experienced a quiet period but  nothing lasts forever, there is constant activity and something  happens every night. Some incidents are so low-level that they  are not worth reporting, but something happens every night.    [Dan] Does such a painful attack demand a retaliation on our  part?    [Lubrani] That is something else entirely which involves  considerations unrelated to the scope of yesterday's incident.  One must definitely consider taking steps following such an  attack. However, as I said earlier such convoys are commonplace  and often exposed to attack. This could happen again today. To  my regret, this particular attack must be seen within the  context of daily activity.    [Dan] It appears that by using the somewhat outdated sagger  missiles, the terrorists save themselves the trouble of  confronting our soldiers head on. Do we have a suitable riposte  for these missiles?    [Lubrani] We have responded by changing our tactics in the  north; however, the sagger missiles undoubtedly constitute a  deadly weapon.    [Dan] Mr. Lubrani, will we have to accept this kind of  status quo in the near future?    [Lubrani] Yes, that is my impression. It is part of our  continuing struggle until conditions are ripe for reaching  security arrangements with Lebanon.    [Dan] Thank you, Uri Lubrani.</p>

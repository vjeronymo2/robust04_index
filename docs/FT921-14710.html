			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Europe warned it must act on immigration EUROPE should adopt a continent-wide approach to controlling what could be a flood of immigration from the former Soviet Union, according to the Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies. In a report on the 'new realities' after the Soviet collapse, the London-based security think-tank said that up to 3m Soviet immigrants could arrive over the next 18 months. 'By refusing to confront the problem head on western Europe has not merely exacerbated the threat of migration but left the east Europeans dangerously exposed.' The report proposes standardised entry requirements, quotas for religious and political refugees and a pooling of relief aid. It also warns against underestimating the power of Russian nationalism and the tenacity of the Russian authoritarian tradition. 'The threat of the further disintegration of Russia itself raised the spectre of a revived, albeit ostensibly defensive, Russian nationalism which might seek to preserve its control by force over the dissident non-Russians within its borders.' The report also points to the large Russian minorities in many of the new republics which 'must inevitably constitute potential flashpoints for ethnic tensions'. It also warns that Kazakhstan 'may well succumb to Islamic fundamentalism' because its development, and that of the other Moslem republics, was held back by communism. The report urges western support for the Commonwealth of Independent States. 'The west should be grateful that instead of a rabble-rouser calling the masses to revolution, we have seen eight leaders, three of them democratically elected, sitting around a table and drawing up a blueprint that enshrines human rights, the principles of a market economy and strict control of all weapons, including nuclear.' But, it concludes 'such a structure may not survive. The emerging picture is still one of heightened instability and volatility. . . . This is a danger which must be armed against. In the long term, Russia's economic potential and military power will inevitably ensure that it returns as a very powerful player on the world stage'.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Observer: Stick it It's an ill wind . . . The Scott inquiry into the British government's murky record on arms sales to Iraq promises an unexpected bonus for the manufacturers of Post-it notes, those sticky-backed yellow bits of paper for hurriedly scribbled messages. The bulk of the damning evidence at the Scott inquiry derives from remarks scrawled by civil servants and ministers in the margins of official documents. Officials in sensitive posts say they have thus learnt an important lesson. Any controversial recommendations will henceforth be confined to Post-it notes, easily removable before documents are filed for posterity.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: P&amp;P adds QA to its training operation P&amp;P is consolidating its move away from computer distribution with the acquisition of QA Training, one of the UK's leading computer training companies, for up to Pounds 18m. The purchase will be funded partly by a 1-for-4 rights issue at 60p to raise Pounds 8.6m. P&amp;P also released its interim figures, which showed continued recovery following its exit from volume computer distribution last year. Pre-tax profits rose 35 per cent from Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.7m in the six months to end-May on turnover from continuing operations up 27 per cent from Pounds 93.8m to Pounds 119m. Earnings per share increased from 2.1p to 3p and the interim dividend is raised from 0.8p to 0.95p. Mr David Southworth, group managing director, said the company was seeing good growth across the board, which would be enhanced by the acquisition of QA. 'It will expand P&amp;P's skill base and corporate client base, and provides us with enhanced opportunities for the future.' QA is the UK market leader, with an estimated 20 per cent share, in the provision of technical training in desktop computing. It trains staff within companies who develop and support computer systems. It made an operating profit of Pounds 1.78m last year on turnover of Pounds 9.37m. Mr Southworth said it would complement P&amp;P's existing training operation, which has turnover of about Pounds 3m a year. The vendors of QA - comprising its top management, its employees, and IBM, which has a 10 per cent stake - will receive an initial Pounds 15m in cash, shares and loan notes. There will be an additional payment of up to Pounds 3m, equal to six times the amount by which QA's profits exceed Pounds 2m in the year to April 1995. Phoenix Securities advised P&amp;P on the deal and the rights issue has been fully underwritten by Panmure Gordon.</p>

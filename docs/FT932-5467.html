			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: 'Number two' resigns from Federal Express MR Tom Oliver, head of worldwide customer operations at Federal Express and the effective 'number two' executive at the nation's largest overnight delivery company, resigned yesterday. Mr Oliver said he was taking up the post of chief executive and president of VoiceCom Systems, a San Francisco-based voice processing services provider. Also departing from Memphis-based Federal Express is Ms Carole Presley, senior vice-president for marketing and corporate communications. She will remain a consultant to FedEx but will start her own consulting business in Florida. Federal Express has suffered long-standing problems in its international division and was forced retrench from an ambitious European expansion plan last year. Since then, losses on the international front have been diminishing, although competition has put pressure on domestic earnings. Mr Oliver, 52, who had previously headed the international business, became executive vice-president of worldwide customer operations in late-1991 when chief operating officer, Mr James Barksdale, quit the company. Mr Oliver subsequently oversaw much of the European restructuring action. Yesterday, FedEx said Mr Oliver would be replaced by Mr William Razzouk, currently senior vice-president of sales and customer service. Mr Fred Smith, the company's founder, remains chairman.</p>

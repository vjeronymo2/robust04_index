			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Oslo fears being Europe's odd man out Campaigners for Norwegian membership of the European Union in today's referendum have hammered home the view that to vote against joining would be to cast Norway into a political and economic limbo on the remote fringes of the continent. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the veteran prime minister, said on Saturday at a final rally held in an attempt to overturn the country's deep-seated reluctance to embrace the EU: 'If you follow the advice of the No troops, it can be costly for your country, for you and for your children. If you feel the fear (of the EU), if you listen to the pessimism. . . you will place your country in a difficult situation - isolated and alone.' The No side has responded with a forceful rebuttal. It says Norway, with its oil and gas, its fish and its plentiful hydro-power, has the fundamental economic strength to prosper independently - especially as it already has the trade benefits of participating in the European Economic Area agreement with the EU. As a founder member of Nato, the country's security is underpinned. But Mrs Brundtland and her government say these arguments amount to dangerous complacency about Norway's place in a changing world. One of their greatest concerns lies in security. Norway occupies a strategic position, sharing a frontier with Russia in the far north (Nato's only direct frontier with Russia apart from that in Turkey) and guarding the north Atlantic and Barents Sea approaches to the northern Russian ports and hinterland where much of the post-Soviet nuclear arsenal is sited. Already, Nato has lowered its profile in Norway, shifting its northern flank headquarters from Oslo to England. US forces have begun to run down some of their pre-positioned stores of military equipment held in Norway. The government, still deeply concerned by instability in Russia, is afraid that Nato's commitment to northern Norway will be weakened if Norway votes to stay out of the EU. This is because of the shift within Nato towards building a European pillar based on the Western European Union, set to become the focus of the EU's strategic and defence policies. Oslo, which at present only has observer status in the WEU, is anxious to play a full part. The case about strategic isolation has been strengthened since Sweden and Finland, Norway's Nordic neighbours, voted to join the EU. The inevitable thrust of their policy is now to participate in west European strategic developments. The argument about economic isolation is, perhaps, less persuasive because of Norway's rich natural resources and the widespread fear of an erosion of Oslo's ability to control them independently once inside the EU. But the government - and the vast majority of business and industry - warns that with Austria, Finland and Sweden joining the EU, the future of the EEA trade accord is uncertain, given that it would apply after a Norwegian No only to Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. More convincingly, Mrs Brundtland says that electing to stay outside the EU would risk provoking a negative investment flow at a time when petroleum revenues are about to peak and Norway badly needs to build up its weak onshore industrial base. This worry is not just about the inflow of foreign investment to Norway; it also concerns the flow of investments by Norwegian companies. The Yes campaign says Norwegian companies have over the past 10 years made investments overseas which produced 60,000 workplaces - while 5,000 industrial jobs were lost at home. It says this trend will be reinforced and may even be accelerated by a shift by companies across the border into Sweden. The heads of Norsk Hydro, Kvaerner, the engineering group, and the pharmaceutical company Hafslund Nycomed, the country's three largest listed companies, and the state-owned Statoil have all said their investment strategies would be influenced against Norway by a No vote. Another potent isolation argument concerns the long border with Sweden, which at present is virtually open. Transformation of the Swedish border into an external EU border could result in far stricter controls.</p>

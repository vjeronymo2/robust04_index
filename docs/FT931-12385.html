			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Cunard in marketing deal CUNARD, the shipping subsidiary of Trafalgar House, yesterday announced a 10-year joint marketing venture with the EffJohn Group, owner of the Crown Cruise Line. Cunard will market three of EffJohn's vessels under the name of Cunard Crown. EffJohn, whose parent company is listed on the Helsinki stock exchange, will continue to operate the vessels, although they will carry the red Cunard funnel. Two of the ships currently operate in the Caribbean. The third, which should enter service in July, will be based in the Far East. Two Cunard ships, the Cunard Countess and Cunard Princess, will also operate under the Cunard Crown name. The agreement will increase the number of berths marketed by Cunard by 40 per cent to over 7,000. Cunard will receive an annual marketing fee, thought to be about Pounds 3m, and a performance-based bonus. Trafalgar House has sold 14 acres of freehold land at its 350-acre Brooklands business park in Surrey to Procter &amp; Gamble for its health and beauty care division. Terms were not disclosed.</p>

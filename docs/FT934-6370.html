			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: PowerGen The heavy provisions which both PowerGen and National Power carry mean that they look more like Swiss banks than electricity companies. PowerGen topped up another Pounds 12m yesterday, offsetting the Pounds 11m it has spent in the first half. The provision was to index the present value of long tail liabilities, but the Pounds 300m total it has stashed away for a rainy day looks excessive for such a well capitalised company. The latitude allowed finance directors to interpret the blurred border between prudent accounting and profit-smoothing is something the Accounting Standards Board could usefully address. Another of the generators' little nest eggs is also beginning to hatch. PowerGen's coal stocks fell by 1.25m tonnes in the first half - releasing Pounds 46m in cash. If its stocks decline to 5m tonnes over the next 2 years, working capital will be cut by a further Pounds 300m. With such a cast iron balance sheet, the company is hoping that diversification will make its capital work harder. If that induces a justifiable queasiness, at least PowerGen has proved itself a good project manager on its mainstream capital expenditure programme. It will be difficult, however, to find sufficiently attractive projects to put the company's financial power fully to work. If PowerGen is as prudent as its accounting, shareholders may see some of their equity returned. That will only increase the financial attractions should the generators avoid a blind date with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has embarked on a move to  increase intervention in terms of selling yen and buying dollars  on the foreign exchange markets. In recent days, it has not only  significantly increased the monetary value of its intervention  activities, but has moved aggressively in arranging consignment  intervention by overseas central banks. The purpose of the  increased intervention is to stop the rise in the yen which  embodies the risk of imposing adverse effects on business  psychology and to put the economic recovery on track. However,  in contrast to such goals of the BOJ, the markets still seem to  anticipate a higher yen. The situation seems to portend a  continuing struggle between the BOJ and market trends.    On 21 April, the International Bureau of the BOJ which is  responsible for interventions in the foreign exchange markets  seemed to be enveloped in a tense atmosphere. It engaged in  intermittent yen-selling and dollar-buying operations, because  the yen had risen to 102 yen for the first time in nine days.  The value of dollars used in the intervention operations on that  day rose to about $1 billion, a substantial rise from the  average daily value of intervention running at $300-500 million  through March.    Sources at the International Bureau of the BOJ express  concern in stating, "When the value of the dollar drops to 100  yen, sales of dollars involving currency-option transactions  tend to rise and the rise in the yen accelerates." Despite a  price of $1 to 102-plus yen and a comfortable margin before  reaching a high of 100.4 yen, the judgment is that aggressive  intervention must take place.    Aside from the quantitative expansion in yen-selling and  dollar-buying intervention, a qualitative change has taken  place. According to market sources, the New York Federal Reserve  Bank placed orders on 20 April to sell yen and buy dollars at  just above 102 yen to the dollar on consignment from the BOJ.    On 14 April, the BOJ engaged in consignment intervention  through the German Federal Bank to sell yen and buy dollars,  while concurrently placing rate checks on yen-dollar price  levels with the Swiss National Bank. Intervention and rate  checks in Europe were very unusual measures. On that particular  day, the BOJ showed signs of engaging in consignment  intervention in the United States as well and the actions were  interpreted by the markets as a "demonstration by the BOJ of a  stance whereby it was marshalling all resources to stop the rise  in the yen."    The increased intervention activity is backed by a strong  feeling of a higher future yen. On the 18th, the Federal Reserve  Board (FRB) raised the federal funds (FF) rate which corresponds  to the the Japanese call rate by 0.25 percent. That move led to  a concern for the triple chain-reaction drop in bonds, stocks,  and the dollar. Under such circumstances, there is the potential  that money leaving the dollar and moving into the yen will cause  a further rise in the yen's market value.    Japanese surpluses are still running at high levels,  including the highest historical record surplus of $121.9  billion in the fiscal year 1993 trade surplus which reflected a  10-percent rise over the prior year. On the other hand,  according to Yoshihiko Koito, managing director of Sumitomo  Bank, "Institutional investors such as life insurance companies  are cautious about investing in dollar-denominated bonds and  there is a continuation in the structure whereby funds once  converted to yen because of trade surpluses no longer flow into  other foreign currencies." Chase Manhatten Bank's European  economist Robin Marshall speaks of the lingering prospect that  "the United States will exercise pressure to raise the value of  the yen to reduce the Japanese trade surpluses."    However, more than a few question the effect of  intervention.  The reason is that at one time BOJ intervention represented a  sizable proportion of overall market transactions, but now that  the size of market transactions has expanded, the direct effect  of intervention has diminished. In reality, there is a strong  underlying demand among export firms to sell dollar futures and  buy yen and the Industrial Bank of Japan observes that "there is  the prospect that the yen will break through its previous record  highs."    The BOJ is poised to intervene in the markets at a daily  rate  of $3 billion in the event the dollar falls below 100 yen, but  that does not mean that the BOJ will be able to cope with the  yen-buying trend in the markets. Thus, there are sources that  say, "Unless the New York Federal Reserve Bank engages in  collaborative intervention with the BOJ, there will be no way  that the rise in the yen can be stopped."    The Economic Planning Agency, in its "Questionnaire Survey  Concerning Corporate Actions," stated that the exchange rate at  which export firms can operate profitably is 117 yen to the  dollar. It is said that, at the current rate of just over 100  yen to the dollar, the majority of export firms must resign  themselves to a drop in profits. A high yen runs the risk of  adversely affecting an incipient recovery in the economy as a  result of a deterioration in business psychology.    Although the government and the BOJ state that "situations  must be handled in an appropriate manner," the markets are  becoming inured to intervention. The day when the dollar falls  below 100 yen, which will pose many difficulties for the  Japanese economy, is gradually nearing and the situation  portends an agonizing battle for the BOJ.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Poland's smaller parties on the block ONLY four out of Poland's multiplicity of political parties are assured of gaining the 5 per cent of votes at Sunday's election needed to enter the next parliament. Three out of the four have their roots in the former communist party or the left wing of the Solidarity movement. This is the main finding of the last pre-election public opinion poll based on a sample of 1,100 voters nationwide. A clutch of smaller parties, including the free-market Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD), the right-wing nationalist Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN), the Christian Democrats and President Walesa's non-party BBWR movement, are struggling to gain enough support to cross the 5 per cent barrier. The poll, financed by the Polish government, shows that the four leading parties - the governing Democratic Union (UD), the former-communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), the former communist-linked Polish Peasants Party (PSL) and the Labour Union (UP) led by radical left-wing members of the former Solidarity alliance, are likely to receive between 11 and 15 per cent of the vote each.</p>

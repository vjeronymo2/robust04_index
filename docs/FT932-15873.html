			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Martin Intl Martin International Holdings, the clothing group and supplier to Marks and Spencer formerly known as Albert Martin, saw profits edge ahead from Pounds 2.38m to Pounds 2.45m pre-tax over 1992 despite recession affecting its main markets. Turnover improved to Pounds 83.4m (Pounds 80m), but profits at the operating level dipped to Pounds 3.93m (Pounds 4.06m). Mr Michael Kidd, chairman, said that following rationalisation the UK showed some improvement in the second half, but that margins were lower in overseas activities. 'It is difficult at this time to see any immediate recovery from the trading conditions which applied in 1992,' he said. Net borrowings at the year-end amounted to Pounds 8.7m, representing gearing of about 40 per cent (42 per cent). The cost of withdrawal from certain activities amounted to Pounds 1.18m, taken as an extraordinary charge, and included Pounds 900,000 relating to the closure of the Queensbridge factory. A proposed final of 2.7p holds the total at 4.4p, covered 1.9 times by earnings of 8.4p (9.5p) per share.</p>

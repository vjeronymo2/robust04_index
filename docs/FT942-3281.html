			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: GCIH seeks 75% of Meltis Grand Central Investment Holdings, the food group with interests in Asia Pacific, yesterday announced the proposed acquisition of 75 per cent of Meltis, one of the UK's largest privately owned chocolate manufacturers, for Pounds 5.6m. Mr Ishwar Nagappan, chairman, said the acquisition fulfilled the company's needs to establish a UK base to complement its east Asian activities. 'Meltis is a long-established name in confectionary and offers excellent scope for organic growth,' he said. Meltis, which had warranted net assets of Pounds 5.3m in April, was established in the early 1920's. Its branded products include Turkish Delight. Mr Mervyn Weeden and Mr Paul Mustoe, joint managing directors of Meltis, will retain 25 per cent of the shares and have agreed to enter service agreements with Meltis. The purchase price will comprise Pounds 3.6m in cash and Pounds 2m in loan notes. Grand Central also announced the disposal of virtually its entire 24 per cent stake in Armour Trust. The sale of 6.35m shares at 53p would raise Pounds 3.4m. In results for the 1993 year, released yesterday, Grand Central fell into the red with pre-tax losses of Pounds 968,000 against profits of Pounds 2.8m. Turnover rose from Pounds 66.6m to Pounds 67.8m while operating profits fell from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 318,000. Exceptional items fell from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 587,000. Losses per share stood at 2.77p against earnings of 3.08p. No dividend is recommended, compared with 1.25p.</p>

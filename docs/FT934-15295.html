			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Algeria executes 13 extremists ALGERIA yesterday executed 13 Moslem fundamentalists, the largest number to go before the firing squad in 20 months of violence, Reuter reports from Algiers. The executions, announced by the Justice Ministry, signalled a continuing crackdown despite efforts to find a political consensus before the end of the year. 'The execution of these criminals reaffirms the will and determination of the state to protect lives and property and ensure stability and social peace,' the ministry said. Announcing the executions in a statement carried by the official news agency APS, the Ministry said six other condemned men had been reprieved. After the rejection of court appeals, condemned men may be reprieved only by the head of state, Mr Ali Kafi. Earlier this year, he commuted eight death penalties to life imprisonment but allowed three batches of executions to go ahead. Violence erupted in January after the army-backed authorities cancelled a general election in which the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had taken a huge first-round lead. The then president, Mr Chadli Benjedid, quit in what diplomats termed a bloodless coup. A five-man presidency took over, promising to return the country to a state of law, ensure the safety of its 26m people, and stand down by the end of this year. The FIS was later banned and its hardline wing is frequently blamed for ambushes in which members of the security forces, their relatives, intellectuals, politicians and journalists have been murdered. In response, special courts, in the capital and two of the country's biggest cities, were set up late last year with tough powers to combat killings, sabotage and 'terrorism'.</p>

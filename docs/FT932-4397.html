			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: SAS confirms move to cut stake in LanChile SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) reaffirmed yesterday that it is looking to sell part of its 42 per cent stake in Chile's leading airline, LanChile. It said the move would probably be made in conjunction with the Chilean state's plan to sell its 22 per cent stake in the airline. The sale would be specifically intended to give another Chilean investor the chance to own as many shares as SAS. 'We are prepared to lower our holding by 5 or 10 per cent because we believe it would be healthy to have a strong Chilean investor in the airline,' an SAS official said. He denied the plan had any connection with SAS's ongoing merger talks with three other European airlines - KLM, Swissair and Austrian Air-lines. The stake has a book value of SKr247m (Dollars 34m). SAS originally bought a 35 per cent stake in LanChile in 1990 to gain a strategic partner in South America. The holding became less important to the Scandinavian airline, however, when it stopped flying to South America in January 1992. Co-operation with LanChile today centres on training, agency agreements, and a joint-venture duty free operation.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Major becomes treaty's champion IT WAS impossible yesterday to escape an awkward irony for Mr John Major in the decision of the Danish electorate to overturn the Maastricht treaty. The British government neither sought nor wanted a deal on closer European integration. With a prescience rarely acknowledged at the time, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, argued repeatedly that it was premature to map out in detail the future contours of Europe. Much better to wait until the dust settled on the collapse of socialism. Mr Major resisted more than any other leader the federalist ambitions of some of his European colleagues. He fought successfully for the intergovernmental structure of the political treaty and for opt-out clauses from economic and monetary union and from the social chapter. From his perspective the final deal was still imperfect, ceding too much new authority to the European Commission and to the Strasbourg parliament and leaving too many question marks about def-ence and immigration policies. In different circumstances Mr Major might have claimed the Danish vote as a vindication of his opposition to the centralising tendency of the European Commission and the more extravagant ambitions of France and Germany. But once it had been signed, Maastricht was judged an honourable draw which left open the future direction of the Community. Now the government believes that it would have as much to lose as anyone if the accord were to disintegrate. During April's general election campaign the agreement was paraded as a symbol of Mr Major's leadership. It was the compromise he had secured against the odds. One that would heal the divisions over Europe in his own party which had led to the downfall of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. A re-opening now of negotiations with Britain's partners would threaten a parallel resurgence of the tensions within his own party. So Mr Major's message to the House of Commons yesterday was that Britain's interest lay in pushing ahead with ratification of the treaty in the hope that a formula could be found to accommodate Denmark's misgivings. The Lisbon summit would provide the first opportunity, but failing that he would seek to find a solution when Britain took over the presidency in the second half of this year. Behind the scenes, it was clear the strategy holds considerable political risks for the prime minister. It was one of those unhappy coincidences of politics that the Danish electorate's decision on the treaty came on the eve of another debate on the agreement in Britain's House of Commons. Twice since his return from the December summit Mr Major has secured parliamentary majorities for the deal he struck with his European partners. But each successive debate at Westminster has been no less comfortable for that. The 23 Conservative MPs who last month voted against ratification of the treaty had already planned a campaign of guerrilla warfare to wreck the detailed scrutiny of the legislation scheduled for this week. Yesterday the rebels were understandably jubilant when Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, forced a postponement. The prime minister depended for his majority in last month's debate on Labour's decision to abstain. He can no longer be sure that the opposition will hold to that position. There are signs too that the ranks of the Conservative dissidents may be swelled by silent critics of the treaty who supported Mr Major last month but who now believe he should seize the opportunity to re-open the package. He cannot expect any help from Mrs Margaret Thatcher. By next week his predecessor will be in the House of Lords, leading from there the call by Euro-sceptics in all political parties for the voters in Britain to be given the same chance to express their view as those in Denmark, Ireland and France. In a combative performance yesterday Mr Major bluntly rejected the notion of a referendum in Britain, arguing that the issue had been put before the voters in the general election. He defended Maastricht as a step on the road to a less rather than more centralised Europe. The intergovernmental structures which Britain had secured could well be challenged by others in any new treaty negotiations. The message from his colleagues was that Mr Major was determined to give a strong lead despite the considerable risk of a much more serious rebellion by Conservative MPs when the legislation returns to the House of Commons. There was talk also of a silver lining. If Maastricht were salvaged, the Danish referendum would serve as a powerful deterrent to those of Britain's partners pressing for yet another radical shake-up of the Community's institutions. But Mr Major could hardly have imagined, when he fought so hard for opt-outs from some of the key provisions of the Maastricht, that a few months later he would be obliged to take a lead in attempts to salvage it.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: ICI The stock exchange's clampdown on grey market dealing in Zeneca ahead of demerger is a triumph of heavy-handed regulation. Given the analytical effort expended by the City and the publication of a pathfinder prospectus, Salomon Brothers' market was better informed than most official dealings. Members of the rights issue syndicate could not freely participate. But shutting out those with a vested interest in the issue might actually have contributed to a fair price. One can only hope the exchange's promised review of grey market practice results in some more liberal guidelines.</p>

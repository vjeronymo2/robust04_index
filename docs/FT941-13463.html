			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Lesotho cabinet crisis meeting Lesotho's cabinet held a crisis session yesterday during a lull in fighting between rival army factions, Reuter reports from Maseru. The capital remained tense but shops and businesses opened. Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle appeared to have shifted ground over a request for South African military intervention. South Africa said Lesotho had requested such help, but Mr Mokhehle said this was only one option and nothing had been decided. Five soldiers have died since fighting began 10 days ago.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Teng Yen-erh (6772 </F> 1750 0334): "Hong Kong SAR Preliminary Work Committee Discusses  Treason, Other Legal Terms"]    [Text] The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] Legal Group  has begun holding a three-day meeting today in Beijing. At  today's session, the group discussed 17 criminal laws currently  being used in Hong Kong, and initially thought that, except some  terms which must be changed, they can generally be used after  1997.    During the three-day meeting, the legal group will discuss  more than 50 relevant judicial, law enforcement, and  administrative laws. After the meeting today, Li Fu-shan, the  group's convener from the Hong Kong side, said that today the  group discussed 17 clauses which are all related to criminal  laws, and that the group thought the original laws should remain  unchanged as much as possible -- "it is better to stay put than  make a bad move" -- so as to realize Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity and keep from affecting the Hong Kong people's life  and confidence.    He said that the group discussed 17 clauses and thought they  are very satisfactory, that -- except for some terms like the  "governor of Hong Kong," which must be changed -- they can  generally be maintained, but the group did not consider the  concrete problem of how to amend them.    He said that, among the clauses discussed today were the  corruption prevention ordinance and the criminal laws in Chapter  200 of the Hong Kong law. Chapter 200 is about treason and the  crime of instigating rebellion. The group thought that the  chapter is already compact and detailed and the group was  inclined to simply make some adjustments to the wording.  Today's session did not discuss Article 23 of the Basic Law, an  article on secessionist activity not included in Chapter 200.    Shao Tianren, the legal group's convener from the Chinese  side, said that, based on the demand of Article 8 of the Basic  Law, the group is keeping the original laws of Hong Kong as much  as possible, and that, as long as they do not contradict the  Basic Law, they can be adopted as the laws of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region [SAR]. But he said that some  problems within the clauses must still be further studied,  including the way to handle terms and wordings that are  different from the Basic Law. Some of the original laws come  from the British Commonwealth or from Britain, and some powers,  such as Hong Kong Legislative Council's power, come from British  laws, and how they should be handled is a matter that must be  looked into and discussions must be carried out to find a  solution.    He said that the legal group examined 53 clauses at the  previous two rounds of meetings. During the first round, eight  clauses were discussed, and, during the second round, 45 clauses  were examined. Today's session made very quick progress, looking  at a total of 17 clauses.    Tan Yao-tsung, member of the legal group from the Hong Kong  side, thought that the relevant clause on treason can generally  continue to be used after some terms have been amended, because  Britain is ruled by a constitutional monarchy, and, whether we  are discussing the British Government or British sovereignty,  they both belong to the Queen, and Chapter 200 of Hong Kong Law  follows this spirit. After 1997, Hong Kong will become a special  administrative region under Chinese sovereignty, and this clause  should be amended according to the actual conditions, for  example, some wording must be changed to read "central  government."</p>

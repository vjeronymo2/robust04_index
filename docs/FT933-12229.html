			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Ceasefire agreed in Karabakh conflict AZERBAIJAN and the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh have agreed a three-day ceasefire along the borders of the disputed enclave, the latest in a series of attempts to end the bloody fighting, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Gegam Bagdasaryan, a Karabakh parliament spokesman, said the ceasefire, which took effect at midnight on Saturday, had so far been respected by both sides. 'We agreed on condition that the time would be used to hold top-level negotiations between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh,' he said. Azeri authorities refused to confirm or deny whether a ceasefire had been introduced, but a defence ministry spokesman in the Azeri capital, Baku, told local reporters that the fighting had effectively stopped yesterday. Interfax news agency said the ceasefire was agreed after a series of consultations between Mr Safar Abiyev, Azeri acting defence minister, and Mr Samvel Babayan, Karabakh military commander. Armenian forces this year changed the tide of the five-year war over the Transcaucasian enclave, which has announced its independence from Azerbaijan. Repeated international and domestic efforts to resolve the crisis have come to nothing. The Armenians have forced Azeri troops out of Karabakh and seized a crucial region between the enclave and Armenia. Last week, they dealt Baku a further humiliating blow when they seized the key Azeri town of Agdam, east of Karabakh, despite repeated denials that they intended to gain control of the town.</p>

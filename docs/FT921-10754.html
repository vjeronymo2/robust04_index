			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Greece and Turkey restarting talks on bilateral disputes Greece and Turkey are restarting talks on bilateral disputes after a gap of several years, with the aim of signing a friendship treaty this summer, Kerin Hope writes from Athens. The move follows a weekend meeting between Prime Ministers Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece and Suleyman Demirel of Turkey, both attending the world economic forum at Davos in Switzerland. Greek officials said the agreement could be signed during a visit to Ankara by Mr Mitsotakis. He would be the first Greek premier to make an official trip to Turkey in almost 40 years. However, the agreement could cause a rift in relations between Athens and Nicosia. Mr George Vassiliou, president of Cyprus, wanted Mr Mitsotakis to avoid committing himself to the treaty signing until the Cyprus problem had been solved. Mr Mitsotakis conceded that Cyprus was an important issue but said it would be easier to reunite the island if Greece and Turkey were on better terms.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Secrecy, absolute secrecy and five-star hotel bills: As British ministers writhe amid revelations of all-expenses-paid luxury stays in Paris, Andrew Jack puts hotel discretion to the test Trying to squeeze a response about leaked ministerial hotel bills out of the Paris Ritz requires more pressure than crushing the tomatoes in the Bloody Mary supposedly invented in its bar. The opulent and secretive Paris hotel broke its silence in a sense yesterday, but only to mutter, under duress: 'We have a policy of absolute discretion regarding guests real or presumed.' That might seem ironic given more than a hundred articles in a gleeful British press mentioning the Ritz in the last few weeks in connection with the allegations of undeclared expense-paid stays by two British ministers, Mr Neil Hamilton and Mr Jonathan Aitken, illustrated by copies of their bills. Even French journalists have been indulging - though arguably out of a sense of schadenfreude, relieved to have something to report on aside from the growing number of their own politicians and business people embroiled in scandals in recent months. There again the Ritz, located on Place Vendome off the fashionable Rue du Faubourg St Honore in the centre, is rather accustomed to dealing with controversy. Indeed, the hotel - mother of all its more recent and supposedly more reputable namesakes - was founded on the back of it. Cesar Ritz opened his hotel in 1898 in Paris after decamping under mysterious circumstances from his job as manager of the Savoy in London along with his matre d', chief cashier and chef. They were accused of taking commissions from suppliers and walking off with large quantities of wines and spirits. Ever since, the hotel has tried nonchalantly to shroud scandal in luxury. Today, it has a Duke and Duchess of Windsor suite, in honour of King Edward VIII, who lived there for three years after abdicating to marry Wallis Simpson. It hosted Goebbels, Goering and other senior Nazis during the second world war, while its director was spying on them for the French resistance. The extras consumed by Messrs Hamilton and Aitken are no doubt little compared to the bar bills clocked up by Ernest Hemingway, Marcel Proust, Truman Capote, Graham Greene, James Joyce, Scott Fitzgerald and Jean-Paul Sartre in their day. Hemingway had such fun at the Ritz he once said he hoped Heaven was going to be as good. Its kitchens invented Peach Melba and, trying hard to leave his own exotic mark on the place, Mr Mohamed Fayed, its current owner, has included bullet-proof glass in a recent extravagant refurbishment. It is still unclear exactly how Britain's Guardian newspaper obtained a copy of Mr Aitken's bill, although the newspaper admitted using a fake fax on House of Commons notepaper. Mr Fayed stressed that none of the hotel's staff had been directly involved in handing over the information. Nonetheless, the possibility that journalists - let alone tax inspectors or jealous wives - might indulge in similar tactics has sent shivers down the spine of the more discreet Parisian hotels, which have been acting like the most secretive of Swiss banks on the subject all week. The five-star Westminster hotel, not far from the Ritz in Rue de la Paix, said: 'It's absolutely secret. Bills are strictly confidential. All the information is kept on computer and nobody can touch it. The guest would need to fax us and give all the details of their stay.' 'It's not very professional of the Ritz,' smirked the manager at another rival hotel. 'Maybe they should have had to check the information in more detail.' He added hastily that he disapproved of the Guardian's action too. Other hotels were quick to reassure any nervous clients that the records would remain private. The five-star Inter-Continental said: 'The accounting department decides. Usually we are not allowed to release bills. We would need to know when you stayed at the hotel and check your address was the same one you gave when you stayed.' The De Crillon, on Place de la Concorde, said: 'We don't give out information on bills. If someone asked for a duplicate by phone we would want written confirmation to check room number and the dates of stay to know if it was really the same information that we have.' Perhaps more honestly, the Meurice, opposite the Tuileries Gardens, said: 'Bills are personal. We cannot give a copy to anyone. We try to have security but it is difficult. If someone loses their bill and would like a copy we try to investigate but we would also like to help.' Few hotels could offer proof of really tight defences against determined forgery. The chief cashier at the George V Hotel asked simply in response to a request for a duplicate bill for a fax with name, address and date of departure. Le Warwick, on the Champs Elysees, misunderstood the question posed in English and thought the FT was inquiring about whether the Guardian could be put on to a guest's room bill rather than the bill appearing in the Guardian. The hotel said: 'We charge the Guardian to the room bill.' It then added: 'It would not be easy to get a copy of the bill.' Hurd hits back, Page 4</p>

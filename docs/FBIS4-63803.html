			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin had a telephone  conversation with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on 24 May  in the afternoon. They discussed the division of the Black Sea  Fleet and the basing of Russian ships in Crimea. Officially, no  details have been reported.    INTERFAX learned from sources in the Russian delegation that  the fist draft of the final document on the settlement of the  Black Sea Fleet issues had not been approved by the two parties.    Moscow has insisted that Sevastopol be the main base of the  Russian Navy and that the Ukrainian fleet be based beyond the  city limits. It can be stationed in Balaklava (Crimea) or in  Odessa.    Russia wanted the document to contain the following formula,  "Sevastopol is the main Russian navy base in Crimea." Kiev  proposed another formula, "The main Russian navy base in Crimea  will be stationed in Sevastopol."    A Russian delegation expert clarified that the Ukrainian  formula meant that all military infrastructure in Sevastopol  would belong to Ukraine. He added that the issue on leasing  would be mentioned in a separate agreement.    Russia wanted to avoid the term "leasing" and to mention  "utilization in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement"  instead.    On 24 May at 2100 the talks are still continuing. The  Ukrainian party put forward new proposals on the division of the  Black Sea Fleet within the scope of the March agreements between  the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. In accordance with these  agreement Moscow would receive 699 ships and supplementary boats  of the Black Sea Fleet and Kiev would receive 164 units.    Kiev wanted its quota to be increased.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOLERO LOOKOUT TOWERS NO MORE  </P> <P> For nearly half a century, the Bolero Lookout withstood the elements atop a  lonely peak in Orange County's Santa Ana Mountains.  </P> <P> But it took a bulldozer only 20 minutes to bring the two-story wooden structure  crashing to earth Wednesday as the Orange County Fire Department demolished the  county's last remaining fire lookout -- and along with it, yet another remnant  of the county's rustic past.  </P> <P> "God, they're finally gonna do her in; the last of our landmarks," Capt. John  Sleppy a 27-year veteran of the Fire Department, murmured sadly to himself as  he surveyed the scene.  </P> <P> The lookout, visible until Wednesday from nearby Santiago Canyon Road, had been  one of three that local fire officials built in the mountains immediately after  World War II, when Orange County consisted primarily of farms and ranches.  </P> <P> The other two were atop mile-high Santiago Peak -- Orange County's highest  point -- and Gilman Peak, near Carbon Canyon in the northern part of the  mountain range.  </P> <P> From these towering vantage points, designated spotters would scan the horizon  for any sign of smoke or fire, alerting fire crews by radio or telephone when  necessary.  </P> <P> When they weren't spotting fires, the lookouts would endure such rigors as  ejecting rattlesnakes from outhouses and fighting off swarms of bees. They also  waited fearfully as howling windstorms and driving rain threatened to topple  the rickety structures, which were built by state prison work crews.  </P> <P> By the 1960s, however, Fire Department Capt. Bill Glover said, smog had reduced  visibility to the point that lookouts were rendered virtually useless. The Fire  Department, at the same time, built so many new fire stations around the county  that lookout towers were no longer considered crucial, Glover added.  </P> <P> So, one by one, the county tore them down.  </P> <P> Bolero Lookout -- the lone holdout for the past decade -- finally was put to  the bulldozer's blade after recent Santa Ana winds left the rickety structure  tilted to one side, ready to collapse on anyone who might try to climb it. Fire  officials then decided that the lookout was too much of a safety hazard to  leave intact.  </P> <P> As fire officials organized the demolition -- shuttling two vanloads of invited  media representatives to the top of 1,600-foot Bolero Peak -- Sleppy and other  veteran firefighters reminisced about the old lookout and some of the colorful  people who used to man it.  </P> <P> Foremost among the latter group is a woman, now dead, named Lois Smith. A  full-time paid lookout for the county for several years during the 1960s, Smith  and the other lookouts tended the towers during fire season, which runs from  June through October. They would work 10 days on, 5 days off.  </P> <P> Sleppy watched glumly as the old landmark came down.  </P> <P> "It makes me sad," Sleppy said, "because I am one of the old-timers in the  county. I remember when there were no houses. . . . But the old has to make way  for the new. That's just a fact of life."  </P></p>

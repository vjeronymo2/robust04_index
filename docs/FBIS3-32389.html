			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mauricio Martinez S.] </F>   [Text] A fierce battle is being fought by the two sides,  which remain scoreless with only 10 minutes remaining in the  game, and they zealously seek the weapon that will allow them to  gain the final victory.    Upon their return from the Christmas truce, the National  Liberation Party (PLN) and Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC)  are in the home stretch, aware of the close [poll] results and  difficult battle they face. Their propaganda strategies to  achieve this differ and in the case of the Social Democrats,  perhaps, is more reactive.    The Social Christians, who announced a strong campaign  against PLN candidate Jose Maria Figueres since late 1993, have  fulfilled their pledge. They renewed reports about the  opposition leader's alleged involvement in certain  irregularities and, in certain cases, they revealed some new  ones.    The PLN launched a campaign under the slogan "The Safe Way,"  based on promises of social welfare and the party's principles.  However, the ruling party's harassment reportedly provoked a  drastic change in the PLN's preliminary strategy.    This is gleaned from a propaganda analysis prepared for this  newspaper by specialists Victor Flury, Victor Ramirez, and Jose  Alberto Ramirez. The analysis covered the period 2-10 January  and studied 23 different ads in newspapers and 35 television  spots. This is the sixth report on political propaganda, and the  experts have added their reviews of other issues, including  public speeches, debates, and polls.    Referring to the last three weeks, the analysts predict the  PUSC will continue to attack Figueres; it will strengthen some  campaign promises; and it will give a triumphant-reflexive  feeling to its messages.    PLN members, they predict, will continue to proclaim the  party's victory, extol the polls which give them the advantage,  and exert themselves to deal a psychological-political blow:  Former President Oscar Arias' eventual participation in  proselytization activities.    Flury, Ramirez, and Rodriguez believe the resumption of the  electoral battle in January provoked a national debate on  whether the parties were carrying out a dirty campaign (mutual  accusations) or a confrontation of ideas.    According to predictions included in the previous report,  which was published on 29 December, the PUSC attacked Figueres  with strong moral and business charges. Moral issues involving  the candidate's actions prevailed. Hence the slogan "Careful  with Figueres Olsen, there are problems wherever he goes." This  was followed by messages on Figueres' recent involvement,  according to the Attorney General's Office, in a possible  embezzlement with bonds and mines, as well as the removal of  seven Telenews journalists from Channel 7, reportedly a result  of pressure exerted by PLN leaders.    According to the three professionals' analysis, PLN  reportedly reviewed two scenarios in December to counter the  ruling party's attacks:    A) Launch a January campaign reviewing ideas and programs,  but -- given the PUSC's onslaught -- argue they had no other  choice but to launch a counterattack.    B) Opt for a positive campaign because party leaders figure  the people are tired of attacks. Nevertheless, given the  strength of the Social Christians' charges, a fierce internal  discussion took place and the decision adopted was to change  strategy lest the adversary's blows undermine its support.    Nevertheless, two days after PUSC presidential candidate  Miguel Angel Rodriguez' attacks, the PLN went on the offensive  by reporting the manipulation of poor people and an apparent  purchase of votes. Also, it terms as slander and dirty campaign  what was reported by the PUSC. The PLN launched a series called  "We cannot vote for Miguel Angel," recalling alleged  irregularities in the distribution of taxi license plates, the  sale of high school diplomas, and the use of construction  material. Nevertheless, the analysts believe these actions have  no influence on voters and they claim those were "isolated  events" of no importance that "will not directly affect the  party or the candidate."    In fact, when comparing the type of charges made by the PUSC  and the PLN, Flury, Ramirez, and Rodriguez say those of the  latter will have a lesser impact.    The two parties are criticized because they planned  propaganda messages in a general way, without taking into  consideration the characteristics of the press or television.    The TSE [Supreme Electoral Tribunal] deserves a special  mention in all this. Ramirez believes it played an exaggerated  role that was totally uncalled for. One specific example: its  fruitless efforts to stop the parties from attacking each other.  Analysts believe the TSE's frequent prohibitions have limited  the debate and confrontation of ideas.    Generally speaking, the three specialists believe the PLN  strategy mainly intends to depict Miguel Angel as a threat by  stereotyping him as a neoliberal. They think the concept is not  necessarily understood by most of the population. Social  Democrats will reportedly offer the voters a party with  experience, achievements, and a security tradition that,  according to them, is guaranteed by every PLN government.  Likewise, they predict that, in the end, undecided voters will  give more importance to issues such as a government team and  party tradition rather than honesty.    It is believed the green-white party's strategy is guided by  the incentive-reply concept given the Social Christians'  actions. In addition, the analysts emphasize the fact that,  even though Carlos Espinach is in charge of the PLN campaign, he  is unknown by voters, reticent, and totally out of contact with  the media.    Referring to the PUSC's strategy, experts observe a tendency  to present its candidate with more vehemence and firmness than  in the recent past. Furthermore, they say Social Christians  will try to send voters the message that Figueres is a person  who cannot be trusted to rule a country, particularly due to the  moral and business charges he has faced. The ruling party's  strategists also believe undecided voters will eventually choose  the most honest candidate rather than the one who offers more  benefits to the people.</p>

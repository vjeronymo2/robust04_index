			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Senior Sinn Fein official pessimistic The stalemate in efforts to embrace the republican movement in the Ulster peace process was underlined yesterday by Mr Martin McGuinness, a senior member of Sinn Fein, who ruled out progress without face-to-face talks with the British government. He said on BBC Radio Ulster that direct talks might move the peace process forward 'quite dramatically'. Mr McGuinness stressed that Sinn Fein was not calling for negotiations with British ministers but wanted talks aimed at clarifying the content of the Downing Street declaration.</p>

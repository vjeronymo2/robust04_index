			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Coalition split on tax reform: Foreign policy divisions emerge A public split over foreign policy and tax reform has ended the two-month honeymoon enjoyed by partners in Japan's new coalition government. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Socialist prime minister of a three-party coalition dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic party, exhibited splits with his LDP partners during a four-country tour of south-east Asia, ending yesterday. Speaking in Singapore, the pacifist Mr Murayama reversed the previous government's unprecedentedly explicit bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. He called for caution on the move, a mark of his own deep pacifism. Mr Murayama was immediatedly contradicted by Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, LDP minister for international trade and industry, seen by a growing number of government officials as a likely next prime minister. Japan would 'suffer a loss' if it failed to become a permanent council member, Mr Hashimoto said. Some senior LDP members, including Mr Yohei Kono, foreign minister, share Mr Murayama's caution. Yet the UN debate goes to the heart of an unresolved rift in the ruling classes over whether Japan should seek diplomatic influence and responsibility commensurate with its economic weight, or be content with a discreet international profile. Separately, Mr Murayama reopened a long-running controversy over the weakening state of Japan's government finances by saying that he did not necessarily want to deliver planned cuts in income tax and increases in sales tax in a single package. This drew a quick, though polite, response from Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister and head of the New Harbinger party, the junior coalition partner. He stressed that it would be 'desirable' to link an income tax cut and a consumption tax increase in a 'concrete' tax reform to be decided by the end of September, for enactment by the end of the year. Mr Takemura is sensitive to his own ministry's fear that the government faces a sharp rise in its general deficit, now at 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product, if it fails to increase indirect taxes. This is needed to compensate for an expected shrinkage in the income tax base caused by a steep decline in the number of wage earners and a rise in pensioners expected over the next 20 years.</p>

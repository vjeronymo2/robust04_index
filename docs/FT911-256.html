			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Britain should heed Spain's proposal for Community budget distribution Sir, The British government might take the opportunity of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's visit to London last week to think again about one aspect of its European policy. Spain has put high on its list of priorities for the current intergovernmental conferences a change in the EC's financing arrangements to ensure that the Community budget brings about adequate transfers from the richer to the poorer member states. Such a concept has not endeared itself to those in Britain who fear that it will only inflate EC spending still further and that such transfers are unnecessary and wasteful. No doubt much can and should be done to see that EC monies on regional and social projects are properly used, but problems on this account do not invalidate the argument for having a Community budget, whatever its size, which is consciously redistributive. At present there are serious anomalies with some of the richer EC member states being net beneficiaries. If there was an override mechanism to make sure that the overall effect of Community budget flows was as it ought to be - according to need and ability to pay - there would be less need to distort the Community's individual policies. In particular, countries both rich and poor which currently benefit from the excessive expenditure on agricultural price support might be less resistant to sensible reform of the Cap. This in itself should commend the Spanish proposal to Britain. But there are two other reasons. Since our GDP per head is around the EC average, we should come out of a redistributive budget at least as well as under the present arrangements. Second, since the present arrangements depend on a special corrective mechanism negotiated with difficulty for Britain alone, we should be much less exposed if they were replaced by something which was really communautaire.

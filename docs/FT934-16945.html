			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Union to serve ambulance writ NORTHUMBRIA Ambulance Service will today be served with a High Court writ by Unison, the public-sector union, challenging alleged increases in working hours without extra pay for some ambulance staff. The writ claims the ambulance service, which covers Tyne and Wear and Northumberland, breached National Health Service agreements by unilaterally trying to change working hours for 37 staff. The service, which was one of the first to become an NHS trust, said it could not comment as it had not received the writ. The legal move is the latest in an increasingly acrimonious battle between Unison, backed by Labour MPs, and Mr Laurie Caple, chief executive of the trust. Critics have attacked Mr Caple over his income-generation schemes, which range from car servicing to security advice, and his management style. Mr Jonathan Upton, a Unison official, said: 'This latest imposition of increased hours for no pay is an attempt to recoup money lost on speculative commercial ventures from the pockets of dedicated ambulance workers.' The trust's 1992-93 report shows the schemes making a net surplus of Pounds 14,857, but critics argue the Pounds 30,000 fee paid to an agent in the United Arab Emirates to promote its services should be deducted from this figure.</p>

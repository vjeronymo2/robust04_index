			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Fowler plays Euro defence card The Conservative party is putting defence firmly at the heart of its campaign for the European elections in June. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, yesterday launched a sweeping attack bracketing both main opposition parties together for the purposes of the assault. With a strong Liberal Democrat challenge expected in Tory seats in the south-west of England - a region in which the defence industry is one of the largest employers - many of yesterday's most vituperative comments were aimed at Mr Paddy Ashdown's party. The two Tory politicians also used a Westminster press conference to launch a 25-page document setting out the principal differences on defence between all three leading parties. The main thrust of Sir Norman's attack was to try to tar Labour and the Liberal Democrats with the same brush by claiming that there was a latter-day 'Lib-Lab pact' on defence. This consisted of a three-part plan comprising 'drastic' defence cuts, the surrender of control over Britain's security policy to Brussels and the creation of a European army. 'On defence Labour and the Liberals have the same agenda,' he said. Mr Rifkind attacked the 'brave captain Ashdown' who liked to wrap himself in the union flag and present himself as a great warrior but had appeared on CND platforms 'not all that long ago'. In a development which may disconcert Tory backbenchers who have complained that recent defence cuts were Treasury-driven, there was a strong emphasis on good housekeeping in yesterday's document. 'It remains incumbent upon the Ministry of Defence to deliver the nation's required war fighting capability at least cost to the taxpayer,' the document says. One of the chief justifications for Nato remaining the cornerstone of Britain's defence policy is that otherwise 'we would have to spend more to achieve the level of security we have now'. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, described the press conference as 'a panic reaction by a government that has grossly mismanaged Britain's defences'. Defending Britain's Interests.

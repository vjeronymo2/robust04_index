Kim, 59, is wanted in South Korea for questioning in  connection with irregularities in the Yulgok military buildup  project. He fled to the United States shortly after authorities  started to investigate people involved in the Yulgok project.    Informed sources said that Kim submitted an application for  permanent residentship in early December at a local office of  the U.S. immigration and naturalization service through his  lawyer.    Details are not known, the sources said.    There is a possibility that Kim is seeking permanent  residency in the United States to avoid criminal prosecution in  Seoul as his visa is expected to run out before a new president  takes office.    An official at the Korean Embassy said that although there  were rumors that Kim was seeking political asylum in the United  States, the reports were "exaggerated."    "He is not qualified for political asylum since he is a  criminal suspect in the Yulgok military project," the official  said, requesting anonymity.    The official said he could not confirm that Kim had applied  for permanent U.S. residentship, but he may be allowed to live  in the United States, depending on his qualifications.</p>

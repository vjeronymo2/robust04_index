This public statement confirms that there has been concrete  support from the European Academy of Sciences and other  scientific academies, which is encouraging and show their high  regard. These academies are maintaining their contacts with the  Academy of Sciences and Arts of the republic of Kosova by  rejecting the repressive acts of the Serbian regime against it.    This statement expresses special gratitude to the Academy of  Arts of Albania and high-level political personalities, who, by  denouncing this particular and repressive act of the Serbian  regime, express their solidarity with the academy and its future  work.</p>

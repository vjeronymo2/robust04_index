			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL/TOURISM  </P> <P> Blanket response: Bernard Abrams, chairman and founder of Three D Bed &amp;  Bath, and his son, Donald Lee Abrams, president of the 27-store chain, aren't  letting Orange County's dismal response to their plea for blankets for the  homeless get them down.  </P> <P> Only 32 used blankets had been dropped off at Three D's three Orange County  stores by Friday -- five days after the Abrams ran an ad seeking county  residents' help -- so they've decided to donate 500 new blankets from their  Costa Mesa-based company.  </P> <P> The blankets will be given to three Orange County social service organizations  for the homeless, Donald Abrams said Friday.  </P> <P> The blankets have a retail value of about $5,000, he said.  </P> <P> The Abrams spent $4,000 for a full-page advertisement in an Orange County  newspaper Sunday. The ad, which showed a photograph of an elderly homeless man  asleep on a park bench, asked people to gather up their old blankets and bring  them to Three D stores so they could be donated to local shelters.  </P> <P> As an added incentive, a 20% discount was offered on purchases of new blankets  to anyone who brought in an old one.  </P> <P> The blankets have not exactly been flooding in.  </P> <P> The Times reported Thursday that only 23 blankets had been received by the  Three D stores in Irvine, Tustin and Westminster. On Friday, nine more came in.  </P> <P> Abrams said the company could only run the ad one time because of the expense.  It is possible, he said, that many people forgot about or never saw it.  </P> <P> "Rather than spend more money on another ad," he said, "we decided to donate  new blankets to make sure that the needs of the homeless will be fulfilled."  </P> <P> The blankets will be delivered at noon today to Orangecoast Interfaith Shelter  in Costa Mesa; Cover Wings, a charity organization in Anaheim, and LEAP, a  division of the Orange County Child Abuse Council in Santa Ana.  </P></p>

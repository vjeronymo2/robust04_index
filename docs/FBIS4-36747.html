			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 Jun (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, minister of  international cooperation in the Palestinian National Authority,  arrived in Cairo from Paris today.    In an arrival statement, Sha'th said that during his visit  to  France he attended a conference of the donor countries. He  reported that the financing of the Palestinian National  Authority is facing a problem because the World Bank has stopped  paying out the sums promised by the donor states.    He explained that the problem has two causes, the first  being  that the donor countries usually finance long-term projects but  do not supply funds for the establishment of an authority or  government. Sha'th affirmed that the very establishment of the  National Authority in Gaza and Jericho requires money to finance  the expenses of activities without which the Authority cannot  function.    He said the second cause pertains to urgent problems  resulting from the ugly Israeli occupation, including thousands  of handicapped and injured people and widespread unemployment  resulting from the ban on Palestinians working in Israel.    Dr. Sha'th, who is also Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, explained  that one of the most important results of the Paris conference  was a declaration by the World Bank and the donor countries that  the Palestinian National Authority has met all its commitments  and that the successes made by the Palestinian police and the  maintenance of the citizens' liberties helped to rally  international support for the Authority. Sha'th said this will  pave the way for real progress.    Sha'th announced that he will return to Gaza on Tuesday [14  June] to make the necessary arrangements for starting the  National Authority's functions and to prepare for Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat's return to Gaza and Jericho as soon as  possible.</p>

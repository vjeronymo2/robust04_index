			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Simon's subtle sentimentality - Malcolm Rutherford reviews 'Lost in Yonkers' NEIL SIMON's Lost in Yonkers looks a better play in London than it does in New York. The piece won the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and is still running on Broadway. The main reason why I disliked it there was that it suffered from excessive sentimentality. It still does. On the other hand, that is plainly why so many people throng to see it. And the the London production has a redeeming virtue in a remarkable performance by Maureen Lipman. Simon is frequently compared with Alan Ayckbourn for two reasons. One is that they have an equally prolific output - about a play a year. The other is that they tend to be better received on their own side of the Atlantic. Here Simon is best known for works like Barefoot in the Park and Brighton Beach Memoirs. Lost in Yonkers is ostensibly more serious in that it is about the strains of an American-Jewish family in New York in 1942. The old mother is a refugee from the Nazis. In her enforcement of family discipline, however, she has become more Prussian than the Prussians: no-one in this household is allowed to cry. Her iron rule extends to her grandchildren. This old battle-axe is played by Rosemary Harris, just as she was in the early months of the New York production. Ms Harris has lost none of her stage presence, although she does not have to say very much. For the most part, she just stands or sits there looking fierce, but capable of shedding the odd tear herself. In New York Ms Harris seemed to have the leading adult role in the play. In London there has been a shift. Quite the most interesting part is that of Bella, her 35-year-old retarded daughter. Here is the triumph of Ms Lipman, which presumably owes something to David Taylor's direction. In New York Bella was, like most of Simon's characters, pretty flat. In London she develops. She starts as amiably backward, a child despite her age, with sudden retreats into temper and moodiness. Then she reveals her feelings as a woman. As the play goes on, she becomes increasingly the focus of attention. By the end it is clear that it is the mother who is dependent on her rather than the other way round. Ms Lipman's Bella has come to look attractive, self-confident and quite grown up. The role reversal is very cleverly done: it makes Lost in Yonkers seem a more subtle play that I first thought. For those who enjoy sentimental theatre, there are further pleasures: notably, child-acting. As the younger of the two grandsons deposited in the old gorgon's house, Benny Grant has such self-assurance that it is brave of the adults to appear on the same stage. Grant also played the part of the 13-year-old in New York. In London he will alternate with Matt McGuire whom I have not seen. Of course, everything is loaded in his favour: he has some of the best lines and the best opportunities to show off. Precocity is written all over him, but he does it with great charm. I doubt if a British writer would think of creating such a part. This is a tribute to Simon's professionalism. One small part stands out - Janette Legge as Gert, the daughter who speaks the first half of a sentence sucking out and the second breathing in, so that the latter is unintelligible. The technique of the speech defect is picked up from farce, but is another sign of Simon's eclecticism. Still, sentimentality prevails and cloys. Like the line: 'I love this country because it took in the Jews. There are lots of Germans over here fighting for America, but there aren't any Americans over there fighting for Germany.' Even Louie, the criminal son, goes off to join the US air force in the Pacific. I also wonder if Jewish families have to be so needlessly cruel in order to be kind. This is formula writing: nothing really surprises. But perhaps that is the key to its popular success. Strand Theatre. (071) 240 0300</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions Asda directors have been buying small numbers of shares consistently over the past year. The latest transaction by Patrick Gillam, the chairman, results in his holdings being doubled. At Ewart, the Belfast property company, there was an attempt to oust three directors; from the board; this failed, with directors showing their confidence with a stock purchase. Another Northern Irish company, McLaughlin &amp; Harvey has, along with most of the construction industry, seen a sharp fall in its share price. Charles Yuill, a non-executive director has purchased stock for the third time in five months. Rhino Group, previously known as JMD, is being run by the duo who were in charge of the video hire company, Cityvision. They are using it to build a national chain of home entertainment stores. The shares were acquired in the placing and open offer. Apologies to CrestaCare, where last week's share purchase was incorrectly noted as a sale.  -------------------------------------------------------------            DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR                OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -------------------------------------------------------------                                                      No of Company             Sector     Shares    Value   directors  ------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Leisure       Hotl    100,000      24         1 Bemrose              Pack     20,000      41         1 Border TV             Med     10,000      11         1 Lasmo                 O&amp;G      9,999      17         1 Rhino Group          Misc    800,000     100         1  ------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ------------------------------------------------------------- Anglia TV             Med     10,000      16         2 ASDA Group           FdRe     50,000      20         1 Berry Birch &amp; Noble  InsB     25,000      23         1 British Aerospace    EngA     25,000      35         1 Edinburgh IT         InTr      9,350      21         2 Ewart                Prop    125,000      60         2 Friendly Hotels Prf  Hotl    100,000      66         1 Kleinwort Overs IT   InTr     35,000      55         1 McLaughlin &amp; Harvey   C&amp;C    110,000      45         1 Olim Conv IT         InTr     37,500      22         1 Rhino Group          Misc  4,200,000     535         4 Wholesale Fittings   Elcs     50,000      77         1  ------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

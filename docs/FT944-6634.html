			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Safety cover curbs spark fears Safety inspectors have been asked to consult Whitehall before taking action next year against companies with inadequate insurance for deaths and injuries at work as concern grows about proposed new policy conditions. Changes planned to employers' liability policies renewed from January 'are likely to lead to compliance problems' for some employers, the Department of Employment acknowledged yesterday. The department has asked to be informed before Health and Safety Executive inspectors begin action against companies under the the 1969 Employers Liability Act, which requires employers to have insurance policies worth at least Pounds 2m per claim. Companies have had little difficulty meeting the terms of the act because insurance companies have provided unlimited-cover policies. However insurance companies faced with rapidly rising claims have decided that in future employers' liability policies will have a basic claims limit of Pounds 10m. This threatens to create problems for corporate groups because new Department of Employment guidelines suggest that each subsidiary company will have to have Pounds 2m cover 'in all circumstances'. This may leave each subsidiary without adequate cover if a large claim were made elsewhere in the group. Representatives of the Association of British Insurers are expected to meet employment department officials on Thursday in an attempt to resolve the impasse. The department said yesterday it had been 'consulting informally' with the Health and Safety Executive as well as the association to gauge the extent of the problem 'with a view to finding an acceptable solution'. The executive, which is responsible for policing the act, said about 10 companies a year were prosecuted for failing to display a certificate showing that they were properly insured. Meanwhile, the association expressed confidence that new insurance products would become available to allow companies to buy extra cover, both to meet the legal requirements and to allow proper cover against large-scale disasters. It expects the market for 'top-up' liability insurance to be a specialised sector. Questions also remain over whether insurance and reinsurance companies will make sufficient capacity available to meet large companies' demands and over whether restrictions on the new products will be compatible with the employment department's guidelines.</p>

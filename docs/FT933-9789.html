			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: GM cost-cutting 'on track' GENERAL MOTORS is on track to achieve a Dollars 4bn reduction in its annual North American parts purchasing costs by the end of 1993, compared with the level of early 1991, Mr Richard Wagoner, GM executive vice-president, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Traverse City, Michigan. The Dollars 4bn total combines a Dollars 2bn cost-reduction target set when GM reorganised its purchasing operations in mid-1992 under former purchasing chief Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua - now at the centre of an industrial spying row between GM and Volkswagen - with an earlier effort that started in 1991, said Mr Wagoner, who heads GM's global purchasing and also serves as chief financial officer. GM was still using the same basic purchasing system that Mr Lopez implemented, but it was trying to co-operate more closely with suppliers on issues such as protecting their proprietary information from competitors. Mr Wagoner said that the purchasing operation 'has been running just as good in the past three to four months as it was before', when Mr Lopez was in charge of GM's purchasing. Mr Lopez left GM for Volkswagen in March this year. GM spends about Dollars 35bn annually on parts and components in North America, and Dollars 50bn worldwide. Under the purchasing system implemented a year ago, Mr Lopez opened all of GM's North American parts contracts to new bids. However, Mr Wagoner said that more than 80 per cent of GM's purchased parts were still supplied by the same vendors. GM's worldwide purchasing programme must be 'tough but fair,' he said. Mr Wagoner explained that components suppliers now dealt with one organisation in the US, rather than with 27 purchasing organisations as previously. Mr Gerald Collins, director of GM's new North American vehicle launch centre, added that the company wanted to reduce its new product development time - including time in the launch centre - to about 35 months from about 44 months currently.</p>

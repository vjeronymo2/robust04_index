			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gabriel Pasquini: "Alert and Vigilant"] </F>   [Text] Confidential sources have told PAGINA/12 that the  national government has asked the military intelligence services  to evaluate the political and social situation in Jujuy  Province. This confirms that President Carlos Menem is  resorting to the Armed Forces to control the people's mood.  Intervention in Jujuy has been on the official agenda for more  than a week: Intelligence evaluations confirm the existence of  the basic factors for a social outbreak in that province.    Jujuy was the main item on the agenda at the latest weekly  meeting of the intelligence service chiefs at the Armed Forces  Joint Command headquarters. The meeting was not held by  coincidence: The main role is being played by the Army, Navy,  and Air Force intelligence services despite the presence of  Secretariat for State Intelligence (SIDE) chief Hugo Anzorreguy  and the National Border Police and the National Prefecture  intelligence chiefs. Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf chairs  the meeting on behalf of the government.    The evaluations show that Jujuy has all the symptoms of an  impending social outbreak and the national government is not  about to endure another situation like that in Santiago del  Estero. Beside sending former Deputy Luis "Quito" Martinez as a  political auditor, the government will reportedly send new  emissaries: There is talk of sending an Interior Ministry  official and several Economy Ministry officials, but it is not  clear if their mission will be to help the administration of  Peronist Governor Carlos Ficoseco or to study the need for a  future intervention.    Ficoseco is confronting the provincial legislature which  approved a 50 percent salary increase for public employees.  Ficoseco is in a difficult situation: If he vetoes the  increase, the demonstration by the Front of State Workers Union  scheduled for 29 March could become a repeat of the Santiago del  Estero drama; if he approves it, the fiscal program will  collapse.    In addition to popular discontent and the political crisis,  there is the suspicion of generalized corruption. Among the  intelligence reports are allegations -- impossible to prove --  of bribes as high as 50,000 pesos per legislator to vote for the  Fiscal Pact. These bribes were reportedly paid in 10  installments of 5,000 pesos. This situation reportedly resulted  in conflict when on 10 December 1993 the legislative branch was  renewed and the new legislators demanded similar treatment while  the outgoing ones demanded payment of the outstanding payments.  The report, whether true or not, would be laughable if it were  not staged with an extremely serious social situation as its  backdrop.    Whatever the outcome of the Jujuy crisis, the case confirms  that the executive branch has decided to charge the Armed Forces  with the overseeing the mood of the civilian population.  Government officials this week denied the possibility of  changing the Defense and Interior Security Laws to legalize this  situation: they seem to prefer the illegal method.    This situation is so real that members of the Armed Forces  disseminated on 25 March a false version to cover their  activities: They told the media that the government had asked  for information on criminal gangs that include former military  members operating in the great Buenos Aires area. Perhaps this  same story will be used by the intelligence services chiefs who  will be summoned by Congress to explain the situation, but it is  far from the truth. Military sources consulted by PAGINA/12  explained in simple terms the meaning of the new military role.    One high military officer told this daily: "The president  cannot permit a repetition of what happened in Santiago del  Estero, when nobody informed him that the provincial government  was stealing, that public employees were furious, and that the  provincial police were unwilling to do anything about it. One  should not make a myth of the word `intelligence.' The  president wants information on the social situation, he wants to  know what is happening among the people. He wants the 120th  Battalion to tell him if public employees want to burn  everything down." What governor would not like the concurrence  of the military chiefs?    Army and Navy sources told this daily that their  intelligence  services were basically dismantled years ago. One source said:  "We dismantled the internal network in 1983 and 1984. It is  easier than one thinks: Just cut off the money. This is how the  network of information and civilian agents was dismantled. Many  became criminals, for example, Maximo Nicoletti, the leader of  the super gang."    The same source said the intelligence services were  dismantled because "they were a political weapon, always  involved in skirmishes between Peronists and Radicals, that  created more problems than results." Other sources have  suggested that the Armed Forces never gave up their intelligence  activities.    The source added: "Colonel (Jorge) Mina, the chief of the  Army Intelligence Service, was about to ask for his retirement  last year because his unit was to have been cut from 2,200 to  900 men. With this new policy there will be no reduction and  Mina will almost certainly be promoted to general." He is  symbolic of the past: his career is enmeshed in the 601st  Battalion of Army Intelligence, which was one of the most active  units of the illegal repression during the military  dictatorship. It is again holding the watch.    The Armed Forces have found another way to become involved  in  watching over the provinces: The Interior Ministry has asked the  Armed Forces Joint Command to form a rapid-deployment force to  repress eventual social outbreaks.    This unit comprises members of the National Border Police,  the Naval Prefecture, and the Federal Police. The idea emerged  from the Interior Ministry after President Carlos Menem called  on the cabinet and all security organizations last January to  implement greater intelligence activities to detect any sign of  insurrection.    Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf asked Lieutenant General  Mario Candido Diaz, the Armed Forces Joint Command chief, for  technical assistance in preparing a rapid-deployment force. The  other security organizations view the request with suspicion.  One member told a reporter: "They will first advise on the  formation of the force, they will then intervene in the  preparation of the plan, and this is how they will take over the  operation."    There are practical reasons to support this belief. Under  the Interior Security Law, the Armed Forces can and must support  the security organizations in their functions. The  rapid-deployment forces will probably be transported in military  planes and will be fed, housed, and receive medical assistance  in military garrisons. It is not difficult to imagine that an  officer of the Armed Forces Joint Command will be in charge of  coordinating the operations.    There is also a political reason: Ruckauf may use it to  overcome Defense Ministry objections to the creation of the  rapid-deployment force, which it sees just as a way to buy  weapons and new equipment for the National Border Police and the  Prefecture. In other words, the Interior Ministry is taking a  swipe at the Defense Ministry.    The meetings of the intelligence services have more  political  importance than practical results. An intelligence meeting is  more like a poker game in which each participant eyes the other  and measures how they are lying to him and how much he can hide.  It also serves to communicate the official decision and to  maintain the military attention. Each service then sends its  report to the government through its own channels.    A general evaluation can be made right there: The Santiago  del Estero social outbreak -- which coincided with the armed  insurrection in Chiapas, Mexico -- lead to the president's  appeal to military intelligence. It has created an unofficial  manual of pointers from which to determine where an outbreak  could occur next. The manual states that outbreaks occur when a  serious social situation -- like the case of public employees  who did not get their already low salaries -- is followed by a  political crisis which allows the population to go out of  control. This is almost an example of Marxist analysis: the  late Louis Althusser would have written the formula that the  crisis came when an economic conflict was "intensified" by a  political conflict. Perhaps the intelligence agents have not  read it but the provincial governors should start doing it.</p>

The States or federal agencies like Animal Damage Control should not be involved in wolf recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule clarifies that while the States and Tribes are encouraged to lead implementation of the experimental rule, the Service will monitor and is ultimately responsible for the recovery of the species. Should progress toward wolf recovery not be evident (two years of no growth would trigger other conservation measures), the Service will cooperate with the states and tribes to assure steps are taken to resume progress toward recovery. The states and tribes already have highly professional wildlife management programs in place and their expertise, authorities, knowledge, and organizations can greatly enhance recovery of the species. Animal Damage Control is a professional federal wildlife management agency that has the responsibility, like all federal agencies, to use their authorities to enhance the recovery of listed species. Animal Damage Control has been a valuable and necessary component of wolf recovery activities in Montana and Minnesota.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 21:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There should be a mortality limit that triggers more restrictive management or reintroduced wolves that are killed should be quickly replaced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The measure of success in the wolf recovery program is not the level of wolf population mortality but growth of the wolf population. Wolf populations can withstand varying levels of mortality and individual wolf mortality is very difficult to measure accurately. Language was added to the final rule that clarifies the need to modify the state and tribal plans, which must be in compliance with the rule, if wolf population growth is not evident. Wolf population growth is easier to accurately monitor and is the criteria that is used to implement other provisions in the rule (e.g. when lethal control may be used, when a population is established, when reintroductions stop, and when wolf populations are recovered). A ``put and take'' strategy does not address the problem of a wolf population failing to maintain growth and is an expensive process to conduct. It is more productive to identify the factors preventing wolf population growth and correct them before simply continually adding more wolves that may die from the same causes. A population that required constant reintroductions to compensate for excessive mortality rates could not be delisted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 22:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The experimental population boundaries are not scientifically based and should be modified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service determined the boundaries of the experimental populations based upon the distribution of the wolf population in Montana. The experimental population boundaries do not include any portion of any known area used by breeding wolves in Montana. It was also determined that any wolf population inside the experimental boundaries would most likely be the result of reintroduced wolves and any breeding groups of wolves outside the experimental boundaries would likely be the result of natural dispersal of wolves from northwestern Montana or Canadian populations. The definition of a wolf population underwent scientific peer review (Service 1994a, Appendix 8). The rationale and location of the experimental population boundaries were also reviewed, and no better consensus of a way to define the geographic range of a wolf population was brought to the Service's attention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 23:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wolves should be reintroduced for more than 3 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once a wolf population is established in an experimental area there is no need to conduct further reintroductions and to do so would not be cost effective. The soonest the ``wolf population'' criteria could be met is in three years. At that time about 45 wolves would have been reintroduced to each area, assuring substantial genetic diversity, and 10&hyph;20 pups should be born annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 24:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> What does legally present livestock mean? Who is responsible for determining livestock husbandry practices?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions on legally present livestock are part of the rule so that control of problem wolves will occur only when livestock are present on public land in a manner already allowed by conditions in their federal, state, or tribal grazing permit. No new conditions are expected because of wolf reintroduction. Control of wolves that attack livestock should not be expected when livestock are illegally present on federal lands. Proper livestock husbandry practices means the current community standards and practices used by livestock producers as already determined by the land management agency issuing the permit. No changes from the standard livestock grazing practices already being used on federal grazing leases are envisioned. Wolf management in Montana has not affected livestock management practices on public lands and would likely not affect those practices in other areas. Issues like proper disposal of livestock carrion are already being addressed in the Yellowstone area because of other concerns such as grizzly bear recovery. Language in the final rule reflects that carrion must be managed in such a way as not to present a continuing attractant to wolves if problems occur, but leaves the livestock producer and land management agency to determine how best to address potential problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

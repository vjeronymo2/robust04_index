			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [30 January QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article: "An Act Running </F> Counter To The General Trend"]    [Text] The U.S. Senate voted on 26 January in favor of  establishing a new radio station called Radio Free Asia,  designed to direct broadcasts at Asian countries.    Many responsible U.S. officials said straightforwardly that  the purpose of this radio is to propagate U.S. concepts and  lifestyle to those Asian lands where freedom and democracy are  absent.    The U.S. Senate decision has sparked immediate reactions  from  various Asian countries. On 27 January, a Chinese Goverment  spokesman said that through its decision to set up Radio Free  Asia, the United States has trampled on the standards of  international relations and interfered in the internal affairs  of China and other Asian countries. The spokesman also said: The  U.S. Senate's 26 January decision must be cancelled.    KCNA -- the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY of the DPRK -- issued a  statement condemning the U.S. decision to set up Radio Free Asia.    Myanmar also expressed its concern over this U.S. Senate  decision.    Radio Free Asia is not the first instrument aimed at  propagating the U.S. outlook and philosophy. Earlier, during the  Cold War, the United States established Radio Free Europe and  Radio Liberty to direct broadcasts at European countries and  former Soviet countries. Then came the recent establishment of  the Jose Marti radio and television stations to beam broadcasts  at Cuba.    One of the first directors of Radio Free Europe later  revealed that the purpose of such radio stations was to create  public insecurity and anarchic conditions for propaganda targets  in the relevant countries.    These radio stations are important tools of the United  States  in its peaceful evolution strategy. Not only have relevant  countries protested against such stations, they have also been  condemned by the international community on several occasions.    After the Cold War, along with the general international  development trend, Asia has emerged as a dynamic and  fast-developing zone of peace and stability. Apart from pressing  for peace, stability, and equal and mutually beneficial  cooperation among regional countries, Asian countries want to  expand their cooperative relations with all regions and nations  on the basis of peace, stability, and mutual benefit, respect  for independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in each  other's internal affairs.    Aware of the prospects of Asia, many countries and regions,  including Europe and even the United States, consider their  cooperative relations with Asian countries important.    The Asian people believe that the U.S. Senate decision is a  product of the Cold War period that runs counter to general  trends in the Asian region, is detrimental to Asian  socioeconomic development, and will have a bad effect on  relations between the United States and many Asian countries.    According to a 29 January BBC dispatch, there has even been  criticism in the United States against the plan to set up Radio  Free Asia. Those who oppose this plan contend that this is a  Cold War-style product which is no longer useful and suitable,  especially when economic relations between the United States and  Asia are increasing daily.    U.S. President Bill Clinton and other top-ranking U.S.  officials once declared that the United States would respect the  sovereignty of other countries and their right to  self-determination and that it would not interfere into the  internal affairs of other countries. Regrettably, the U.S.  Administration has reneged on its own words by infringing upon  international law and interfered in the internal affairs of  Asian countries.    It is hoped that the United States will make the correct  decisions to suit the general trend of the world and the region.</p>

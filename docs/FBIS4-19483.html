			<p>BFN     [Text] President Martti Ahtisaari has confirmed Finland's  participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace [PFP] program.  The PFP agreement will be signed later, apparently at the same  time as Sweden. In its decision to approve the agreement, the  government stresses that Finland will chiefly take part in  peacekeeping training, rescue work, and environmental  protection. The government also points out that Finland is not  seeking new defense solutions through the PFP.</p>

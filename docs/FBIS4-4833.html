			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh AKP April 5 -- Guangdong Province, the  People's Republic of China, plans to invest in Cambodia in the  fields of industry, agriculture, trade and civil aviation, the  visiting Deputy Governor of Guangdong Liu Weiming said.    Liu Weiming who arrived here for an official visit paid a  courtesy call to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen Friday and said  Guangdong Province was willing to establish raw-material  processing factories in Cambodia for both local consumption and  export, especially to the Chinese province.    He also asked the Cambodian second prime minister for  linking  direct flights from Guangdong to Phnom Penh and vice versa so as  to facilitate the merchandises' transportation between the two  cities.    For his part, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said Cambodia  needs foreign investors and investment must be done on the basis  of mutual interests.    The royal government of Cambodia has requested China to help  restore a Chinese-built textile factory in Kompong Cham Province  which will re-employ 700 Cambodian workers.    With regard to the above request, the delegation of  Guangdong  pledged to do its best so as to put the textile factory into  operation again.</p>

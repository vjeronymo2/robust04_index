			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Agnieszka Kublik: "BBC Idea on News Agency in </F> Poland"]    [Text] British public television, the BBC, wants to create  a news agency in Poland called "Independent Television News  [Niezalezne Wiadomosci Telewizyjne NW-TV]," which  would compete with the Television Information Agency [TAI].    The BBC has already approached Polsat, the satellite  television channel, with an offer to form a company in this  regard. "Polsat holds a broadcasting license, and the BBC does  not work with pirates," said BBC Polish section chief Eugeniusz  Smolar, explaining this move.    The agency's offices would be in Warsaw, and it would be  financed by all of the television channels belonging to it. The  agency would function as a joint-stock company, whose  controlling shares would belong to the BBC. "Polsat would like  to have most of the shares," Polsat chief Boguslaw Chrabota  admitted.    The BBC's idea is as follows. The new agency would produce  and supply Polish private television channels with several news  programs daily, plus footage on political, economic, social, and  cultural events.    In addition, the BBC is offering the Poles their own "BBC  World Service" program, British television news footage,  assistance in setting up NW-TV's Warsaw offices, and training  for Polish reporters.    Smolar warns, however, that these are only working  proposals,  and everything is yet to be decided between the BBC and the  eventual partners.    "We want to create a strong alternative to Polish television  news," says Smolar. "The reason that British television is so  good is that it has strong competition. In Great Britain, ITN  [Independent Television News] competes with the BBC. ITN is a  kind of news agency of the private television channels, which  share a common information service."    The commercial channels to whom the BBC offer is addressed  have still not reached a decision. Miroslaw Chojecki of NTP  Plus, which is seeking a license for nationwide Polish  television, told us that "he does not know enough about this  idea." But he realizes that it would be cheaper to use the NW-TV  service than create one's own news agency.    At Nicola Grauso's Polonia 1 channel, which is currently  setting up a network of over a dozen local stations, we were  told that each station must decide for itself whether it wants  to cooperate with the BBC. The Warsaw-based NTW, which is part  of Grauso's network, does not yet know whether it will buy the  idea.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Gorodetskaya under the "Caucasus" rubric: </F> "Chechnya Breaks Relations With Britain. Chechen Opposition  Starts Talks With Moscow"]    [Text] The Chechen Provisional Council has taken on  responsibility for talks with Russia. In the opposition's view,  since President Dzhokhar Dudayev does not want to establish  normal relations with Russia, Moscow will finally have to bring  troops into the Republic. In the very near future, a delegation  of the Chechen opposition plans to fly to Moscow to hold talks  with the Russian Federation Government on "the restoration of  Chechnya's normal economic existence," as Umar Avturkhanov,  chairman of the Provisional Council, put it to INTERFAX. The  opposition bets on Sergey Shakhray, "the Russian Federation  minister for the affairs of nationalities and regional polities,  who is disposed to close contacts with them;" a precise date of  a meeting with him will be known on 10 May.    According to Mr. Avturkhanov, the question of Chechnya's  sovereignty and its political status should be resolved by the  people at a referendum and by the republic's constitutional  authorities, elections for which can be held only after the  situation returns to normal. The Chechen Provisional Council  has not given up the hope that Ruslan Khasbulatov will join the  opposition, because he belongs to their side of the barricades.  Given that the former Supreme Soviet speaker's popularity in  Chechnya is steadily on the rise, if he returns to politics and  heads the opposition to Dzhokhar Dudayev, the people will  "unequivocally rally around him" so as to start building a new  life under his leadership.    Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal  Counterintelligence  Service [FCS], is also inclined to think that economic talks may  become the main means to straighten out relations between Moscow  and Groznyy. In his view, this is possible because the talks  with Chechnya will be held by Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, not Sergey Shakhray. A dialogue with Dzhokhar  Dudayev, the FCS director believes, should be held "in a tough  manner," with normalization at railways passing through Chechen  territory to be a priority matter. However, Mr. Stepashin said  in Nalchik at a meeting with parliamentarians and government  members of Kabardino-Balkaria, Boris Yeltsin may meet with  Dzhokhar Dudayev only if the Chechen president recognizes that  his republic is part of the Russian Federation.    Meanwhile, not only is Chechnya reluctant to identify itself  as a member of the Russian commonwealth, but it is entering the  international scene as an independent state. The Chechen  Foreign Ministry has stated that it will suspend any ties with  Britain until "legality and the rule of law prevail in that  country" and will not participate in the CITEX-94 international  exhibition. So uncompromising a decision has been prompted by  Britain's attempt "to taint the honor and dignity of the Chechen  people by accusing them of a vendetta," after it charged  relatives of the Utsiyev brothers of murdering Karen Reed in  London. According to a Scotland Yard theory, the Utsiyevs  arrived in Britain to buy guided missiles so as subsequently to  resell them to the Azerbaijani side, and were killed by Armenian  terrorists. Having accused foreign secret services of attempts  to slander Chechnya, the republic's Foreign Ministry stated:  "The secret services appear to have an insufficient knowledge  of customs and traditions of the Chechens, for whom the murder  of a woman, a child, or an elderly person amounts to a national  disgrace."</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Co-operation replaces competition - Kieran Cooke reports on a surge in activity between Indonesia and Malaysia South-east Asia's big companies are increasingly co-operating in order to exploit more fully the area's robust economies, and leading the charge are Malaysian and Indonesian concerns. 'Over the last few months we have seen a sudden surge in business activity between Malaysia and Indonesia,' said Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, on a recent investment mission to Indonesia. 'Companies in our two countries are learning to co-operate rather than compete.' Though Malaysia and Indonesia have strong cultural, racial and religious links, there have often been sharp political differences between the two countries. Corporate contacts have been few and trade limited. The catalyst for the recent flurry of cross-border corporate dealings was a meeting between President Suharto of Indonesia and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, at the end of last year. Since then, deals have been announced on a regular basis. Indonesia has agreed to import Proton cars manufactured by Malaysia's Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional. In return, Malaysia will buy aircraft manufactured by Indonesia's Industri Terbang Nusantara (IPTN). Proton says it will export about 2,500 of its cars to Indonesia during the next year and eventually plans to assemble cars there. Malaysia has not said how many Indonesian-made aircraft it intends to buy. The deal is controversial. Other car importers in Indonesia have been angered by reports that PT Citra Lamtoro, the local company which has been appointed as Proton distributor, will be exempt from 300 per cent Indonesian duties imposed on most imported vehicles. PT Citra is controlled by Mrs Hardijanti Rukmana, the eldest daughter of Mr Suharto. One of the year's more unusual corporate deals came in February when Indonesian and Malaysian interests took control of Lamborghini, once the pride of Italy's sports car manufacturers. Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, Mr Suharto's youngest son, has a 50 per cent stake in Megatech, the Bermuda-registered company which owns Lamborghini. Other shareholders are Mycom, a listed Malaysian gaming company, and the Mal-aysian police investment fund. In April, two of south-east Asia's wealthiest businessmen, Mr Robert Kuok and Mr Liem Sioe Liong, announced they were teaming up to develop sugar plantations and refining operations on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Mr Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese, controls a business empire with interests ranging from beach resorts and housing schemes to ownership of a controlling interest in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post group. Mr Liem, an Indonesian Chinese, controls Indonesia's largest business group, with interests ranging from noodle making to cement manufacturing. In mid-July Barito Pacific Timber, one of Indonesia's largest companies and the world's leading exporter of plywood, said it would purchase about 70 per cent of a small, loss-making Malaysian building supplies company listed on the Kuala Lumpur exchange. Indonesian companies anxious to go public and raise funds for expansion are envious of Kuala Lumpur's highly liquid stock market. The Jakarta exchange is considerably smaller and less developed. Under the terms of the deal, Barito will inject a significant part of its funds into the Malaysian company and so achieve a 'back-door' listing on what is south-east Asia's biggest exchange in terms of total capitalisation. The deal has been backed by the Malaysian and Indonesian leaders, but it has also been criticised. Such corporate manoeuvrings are coming under increasing scrutiny from Malaysia's Securities Commission. In Indonesia there is criticism that Barito, controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, an Indonesian Chinese businessman closely linked to the ruling family, is not investing company funds inside the country. Last month, Renong, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, and the Indonesia state-owned Bank Rakyat Indonesia agreed to set up a Dollars 100m venture capital fund in Indonesia. Its aim is to help medium-sized industries in that country and promote links with their Malaysian counterparts. Again, the deal is supported by both governments. Renong has close links to Malaysia's United Malays National Organisation, the dominant political party in Malaysia, while Bank Rakyat is one of Indonesia's largest banks, with assets of about Dollars 12bn. 'We encourage investment from the east and west in our countries,' says Dr Mahathir, 'but we should also promote investments and co-operation between neighbouring countries.'</p>

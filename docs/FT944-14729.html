			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / At Pounds 1, do you get what you pay for?: 'Cheap' deals in the City For the cost of a City cappuccino, last week saw plenty of opportunities for canny bargain hunters. Three hundred estate agency branches, a fleet of 669 executive cars, the right to buy a prestige office block, all changed hands for just Pounds 1. Recent deals for the same price - or even less - have included a photoprocessing company, a banking group and a French bakery equipment maker. Inevitably, all the transactions involved taking on either a loss-making business or hefty debts, and sometimes both. However, the range of the deals varied enormously and with it the potential for the buyer to secure a profitable business for the somewhat minuscule investment. Bankers involved in deals where assets have been sold for 'nominal sums' - which usually equates to a pound - say that the degree of liabilities accompanying the sale depend on the urgency of the transaction. 'If it's a fire sale, the chances of the buyer pulling off a good deal are greatly increased,' said one. 'It all depends on the situation of the vendor  -and quite often the attitude of its bankers.' Hambro Countrywide last week paid Pounds 1 for NEA, the estate agency business of Nationwide building society, acquiring 300 branches among assets worth Pounds 5.2m. To compensate further, chiefly for the fact that Hambro was taking on a business which had cost Nationwide more than Pounds 200m, and lost Pounds 13.9m last year, the building society threw in a fleet of 669 executive cars - typically a mid-range Rover under two years old - for the price of half a pint of premium lager. It also added the 255-strong fleet from Nationwide Surveyors, the surveying group Hambro bought for Pounds 12m as part of the deal, for the same price. Mr Harry Hill, Hambro Countrywide joint managing director, said that NEA could be broken up and sold for 'in excess of Pounds 6m tomorrow' taking into account the value of the group's name. 'Of course we could asset strip it and make a quick killing. But we believe we can get more out of the business in the longer term.' For little more than a zone one Tube ride, property group Argent has been given the chance to re-develop a prime office site of 120,000sq ft in the City. Argent already owns the leasehold on the property - Suffolk House in EC4 - and paid Pounds 1 to Midland Bank as part of a Pounds 17.4m deal in which the bank freed itself from the lease agreement. The nominal sum allows Argent to exercise an option to buy the freehold and analysts suggested that this would cost in the region of Pounds 40m. Sources at the property group suggested that the actual development would cost a further Pounds 20m. Mr Michael Freeman, joint chief executive, estimates that the development would realise in the region of Pounds 70m when completed in 1997 on rents of around Pounds 37.50 per sq ft and a 6 per cent yield. Mr Graham Stanley, property analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: 'Where a lot of developers come unstuck is in assuming rental values will rise at rate to make the deal pay. Rents on those kind of properties are currently around Pounds 30-Pounds 32.50 a sq ft, so they've some way to go. But that's the risk of the business.' Birkby, the space management group, recently paid a 'nominal sum' to takeover I-Mex, an insolvent private property group. For its Pounds 1, Birkby took on the mortgages and debts of I-Mex which the group's bankers wrote down from Pounds 35m to Pounds 25m. 'We got it for a keen price, but these were specialist work spaces,' said Mr Kim Taylor-Smith, deputy chief executive. 'There are few companies which would be interested in this kind of development. The bank's options were very limited.' Other recent Pounds 1 deals include the Bank of England's purchase of National Home Loans from National Mortgage Bank; APV's sale of French bakery equipment maker Pavailler (for FFr1 - about 12p) and London International Group's sale of its Colourcare International photoprocessing business to management. All the buyers contacted admitted that their small investment would require hard work to turn around. As Mr Hill pointed out: 'We were lucky in that we didn't buy any liabilities other than the potential losses. If we can turn it around, there's no doubt it will have been a great deal. If we can't, it won't look so clever.'</p>

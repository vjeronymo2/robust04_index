			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): GM disappointment adds to Dow's woes Wall Street DISAPPOINTING earnings from General Motors and nervousness ahead of today's employment report for July left share prices lower across the board after moderate trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 24.58 down at 3,340.56. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 1.60 to 420.59 and the Nasdaq composite slipped 2.85 to 574.02. NYSE turnover was 181m shares. The early news from the Labor Department of a 69,000 rise in jobless claims for the week ended July 25, the largest weekly increase in 10 years, was not promising. An analysis of the figures, however, revealed that nearly almost all of the rise was accounted for by temporary lay-offs and shutdowns at General Motors and other car company plants in the final two weeks of July. Confusion over the weekly claims data added to the nervousness felt by investors about today's July employment report. Analysts are expecting a rise in non-farm payrolls and a slight fall in the national unemployment rate. The other major influence on sentiment was the latest batch of second-quarter earnings, which provided little comfort. General Motors fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 37 1/4 on 5.9m shares traded after reporting a net loss of Dollars 357.1m in its second quarter, compared to a loss of Dollars 784.5m a year earlier. The loss in the quarter was attributable to a previously announced Dollars 749m restructuring charge at GM's Hughes Aircraft subsidiary. Nevertheless, the market responded negatively to the figures because, even without the special charge, GM's earnings came in below expectations, and because investors are worried about the outlook for car sales for the rest of the year. Ford dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 41. The ADRs of British Petroleum plunged Dollars 4 to Dollars 45 1/4 after the UK oil company reported an 11 per cent decline in net profit on a historic-cost basis and before extraordinary items, halved its second-quarter dividend and announced plans for 1,500 job cuts. BP's fall would have been much greater were it not for the strong US support for the stock around the Dollars 44 3/4 level. On the Nasdaq market, Borland International weakened Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 39 3/4 on fears that its entry into the Windows software market might be postponed until next month. Canada TORONTO shook off the sharp decline on Wall Street, partly recovering from heavy midday losses to end just slightly down on the day. Brisk early dealings, highlighted by a number of large block trades, gave way to a slow afternoon session. The TSE 300 index closed 7.5 off at 3,398.6 and declines led rises by 250 to 218 after volume of 25.2m shares. Companies in the Bronfman empire recovered some ground after quarterly earnings: Hees International, the merchant bank, rose CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 12 3/4 . It maintained the dividend in spite of dividend cuts at its real estate affiliates. Carena Developments, parent of the Bronfman's real estate arm, rallied 45 cents to CDollars 4.75.</p>

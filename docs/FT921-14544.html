			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Ford car prices up 3.7% on average FORD IS to increase its car and van prices by an average of 3.7 per cent from the week after next, John Griffiths writes. The move by Ford, the market leader, is expected to prompt what has become a traditional new-year round of increases by manufacturers and importers. Ford said the increases reflected improved vehicle specifications as well as higher costs. The company appears not to have been daunted by the expected publication of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on car pricing. The MMC has been investigating whether cars are overpriced in the UK compared with Continental markets and whether the system of exclusively franchised dealers works against consumers' interests. In recent years the vehicle industry has been criticised for increasing list prices by more than the rate of inflation.</p>

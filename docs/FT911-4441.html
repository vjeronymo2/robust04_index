			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Anglo-Park plans merger ANGLO-PARK plans to merge with fellow property group St James Estates via an agreed offer of 19 new ordinary shares for every 20 St James ordinary not already held. Anglo-Park acquired a 21.9 per cent stake in St James in recent weeks and the offer is for the remaining equity. It also announced yesterday that its losses jumped to Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 68,000) in the first-half to December 31. The deficit was swelled by provisions of Pounds 518,000 against book values of developed and investment properties and a further Pounds 115,000 written off against revaluation reserves. Damage was also inflicted by a provision of Pounds 342,000 against the investment in St James. This is related to a write-down of the value of the latter's property in Oxford Street, London, following a professional valuation. The matter is the subject of litigation. The interim dividend is cut to 0.5p (2p) on losses per share of 12.6p (0.7p). Turnover fell to Pounds 247,000 (Pounds 610,000) and gross profit came to Pounds 3,000 (Pounds 165,000). For the year St James incurred a loss of Pounds 1.9m on turnover of Pounds 3.15m.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE TRAFFIC CRUNCH;  </P> <P> WHEN IS A BODY NOT A PASSENGER?  </P> <P> For the first half-hour of a recent Saturday that I reluctantly spent in  school, our instructor attempted to persuade my fellow students that the class  was not about how "to beat tickets and the system."  </P> <P> Welcome to traffic school. I attended an eight-hour session sponsored by the  National Traffic Safety Institute, whose stated goal in the course was to  "improve driving habits through changing student attitudes about driving."  </P> <P> The cast of characters ranged from a grandfatherly man who obviously felt out  of place and embarrassed ("This is my first ticket in 18 years.") to a young  woman who felt blessed to have been allowed by the judge to attend traffic  school ("I thought he'd suspend my license."). More interested in keeping our  insurance rates low with a clean driving record than in expanding our awareness  about how our attitudes effect our driving, we were not the most enthusiastic  group of students. Some expressed forthrightly their belief that the class is  punishment, prison time that must be served to salvage a Department of Motor  Vehicles record. Our minds were clearly not oriented to learning.  </P> <P> But learn I did, more than I expected, though perhaps not what the instructor  had in mind.  </P> <P> I learned that although I've had some ticketing experiences I'd rather not  repeat, other people have experienced worse. One woman, a mother of two,  received a ticket as she pulled into the driveway of her son's school. Before  50 wide-eyed and mouth-dropped-in-disbelief kindergarteners, the officer wrote  her a ticket for failing to come to a complete stop at the stop sign one block  up the street. Her twin sons both cried, thinking their mother was on her way  to jail with all the other criminals.  </P> <P> I learned about the perils of going too slow, even if you're legally speeding.  If you go 60 m.p.h. in the fast lane you can still be ticketed for impeding the  flow of traffic. I learned ways of explaining to the police why one is driving  alone in the diamond lane, which is only for car pools.  </P> <P> Some people made their daily commute with a mannequin in the passenger seat and  explained that they didn't realize the passenger had to be a real person.  Others simply put a hat on the dog. A strained claim to car-pooling was made by  a pregnant woman who said she was "driving for two." Then there's the story of  the mortician who counted as his passenger the corpse in the back of his  hearse. He noted to the officer that he did have two people in his car. As he  wrote the ticket, the officer explained that a corpse is no longer a person but  rather a body, which cannot count as a passenger.  </P> <P> In one of the class's most interesting segments, the instructor tackled the  myth of speeding as a time-saver. Using a chart that showed the travel time  between two points at different speeds, the instructor explained that going 5  m.p.h. or 10 m.p.h. faster saves a negligible amount of time, even if you're  traveling 30 miles.  </P> <P> On a 10-mile trip to work, for example, it's nearly impossible to save even one  minute. The moral of the story, according to our instructor, is that if you're  late, you're late; accept it and stop increasing your chances of accidental  death or injury by playing beat-the-clock.  </P> <P> On a recent trip back to San Francisco from Portland, I thought about that  time-speed relationship. Going 5 m.p.h. faster might not save time but going 85  m.p.h. could cut three hours from what would be a 12-hour trip. So, anxious to  get back home, that's what I did.  </P> <P> As I said, I learned a lot in traffic school.  </P></p>

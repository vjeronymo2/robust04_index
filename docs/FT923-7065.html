			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Victaulic holds steady in tough trading conditions A FAVOURABLE cash position at Victaulic offset difficult trading conditions enabling the pipes and fittings maker to report unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.9m for the six months to June 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 57.4m to Pounds 51.2m, mainly reflecting reduced demand for pipelines from British Gas which has cut back heavily on capital expenditure. This is because of uncertainties regarding the future structure and ownership of British Gas's network following the referral of these matters to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The uncertainty is likely to continue into next year. Mr David Stewart, Victaulic's managing director, said that British Gas had began to cut back on new projects since the beginning of the year. In the water industry, the group's other main market, some of the water companies reduced their investment on the repair and maintainance of mains, affecting sales of Viking Johnson, which is involved in the refurbishment of mains. The difficult trading conditions were reflected in trading profit, which fell from Pounds 6.79m to Pounds 6.46m. However, net cash of Pounds 10m resulted in interest received of Pounds 461,000 compared with Pounds 57,000 in the comparable period. Mr Stewart said cost reductions, a decline in the workforce and increased margins of 12.6 per cent compared with 11.8 per cent had also helped offset difficult trading conditions. The interim dividend is increased from 2.35p to 2.5p. Earnings per share were unchanged on last time's 10.3p.</p>

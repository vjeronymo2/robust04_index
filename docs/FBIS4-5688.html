			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Warplanes Deployed in South Korea by U.S. imperialists" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  committed a criminal act by bringing 20 odd warplanes of various  types to South Korea from their overseas bases, according to  military sources.    On the 11th of April Japan-based formations of assault  planes  and pursuit-assault planes flew to the U.S. Airforce bases in  South Korea. Earlier, on the 10th, F-15s, F-4s, FA-18s, AV-8s,  EA-6s and other types of warplanes based in Japan and the  Pacific were deployed in South Korea.    In another development, on April 10 and 11, C-5  supercolossal  strategic transport planes and C-130 and C-141 transport planes  loaded with a large number of troops and combat equipment landed  in a U.S. Airforce base in South Korea from the U.S. mainland  and Pacific bases and the airlifted troops and equipment were  deployed in operational theatres.    The Korean people and People's Army are watching with sharp  vigilance the war preparations of the U.S. imperialists and the  South Korean puppets. They will mete out a stern punishment to  the enemy, if he ventures aggression.</p>

The nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula arose from the  introduction of nuclear weapons into South Korea by the United  States.    The United States had no sooner unilaterally scrapped  subparagraph 13d of the Korean Armistice Agreement banning the  introduction of combat equipment and supplies from outside Korea  in June, 1957 than it officially declared through an  announcement of the U.S. Army authorities that it would start  arming the U.S. troops present in South Korea with nuclear  weapons. Then it shipped 280 mm a-guns and Honest John nuclear  missiles into South Korea in February 1958, and deployed them  near Uijongbu close to the Military Demarcation Line. The U.S.  imperialists have introduced over 1,000 pieces of nuclear  weapons into South Korea in more than 30 years since then,  turning South Korea into their biggest nuclear forward base in  the Far East.    The density of U.S. nuclear weapon deployment in South Korea  is one per 100 square kilometers, or quadruple that in the NATO  nations.    The United States has not ceased provocative acts  threatening  the DPRK, wielding the large number of nuclear weapons in South  Korea.    All types of nuclear-capable planes ranging from B-52  nuclear  strategic bomber to F-16 tactical nuclear bomber and nuclear  weapons from intermediary-range Lance nuclear missile to back  pack nuke of Green Beret commandoes are mobilized in the "Team  Spirit" joint military exercise, a test nuclear war, against the  DPRK annually staged in South Korea since 1976. Even E-4B, a  nuclear war commanding plane is hurled into it.    The United States announced the "withdrawal" of nuclear  weapons from South Korea at the end of 1991, yielding to the  strong demand of the Korean people and the world progressive  people for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and  withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from South Korea. But it  revealed for itself that its withdrawal of nuclear weapons was a  lie by opposing a comprehensive inpsection of the U.S. nuclear  weapons and nuclear bases in South Korea which was raised by the  DPRK.    And the United States and the South Korean puppets spread  the  fiction of "suspected nuclear development by the North" in order  to mislead public opinion.    The United States, not satisfied with the deployment of a  large number of nuclear weapons in South Korea, is going to  massively introduce sophisticated "Patriot" missiles into South  Korea. And it openly declared that it would continue to stage  other joint military exercises larger in scale, even if the  "Team Spirit" were suspended, taking issue again with the  fictitious "nuclear problem" of the DPRK.    As facts show, the outcries of the United States and the  South Korean puppets over the non-existent "nuclear issue" of  the North remind us of a thief crying "stop thief "</p>

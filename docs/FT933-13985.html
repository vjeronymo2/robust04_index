			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / People: 'Natural extension' for Cormack Ian Cormack is taking over the responsibilities of country corporate officer for Citibank in London, in place of John McFarlane who moved to Standard Chartered last month. Cormack, 45, who says McFarlane used to work for him in the early 1980s when Cormack was running the bank's European training and personnel activities, describes the job as a natural extension of his current responsibilities. 'In some countries - like Brazil - it would take up much more time. The good news is that I was already involved in the City, with a lot of contact with the Stock Exchange and the Bank of England. It was tidier than to find someone else, and it is not an enormous amount of incremental work unless there is a crisis.' The job requires a good external and internal communicator, someone who knows the clients as well as someone who can work with regulators and the rest of the banking community at a senior level. Among the many committees on which Cormack sits, he has recently been appointed chairman of CHAPS, the electronic system for clearing and settling wholesale payments; he is on the council of APACS, the umbrella body for all UK clearing systems. He was also chairman of the TAURUS monitoring group - 'we were on the outside looking in,' he says  - as well as a member of the subsequent securities settlements task force at the Bank of England. His mid-Atlantic twang notwithstanding, Cormack, born in Scotland and brought up in Cornwall, is now 'the most senior Brit' in the London office. He joined Citi in 1969, and worked for his first decade in real estate, both from New York and Paris. Current responsibilities are for European financial institutions and transaction services - the latter including cash management, global custody, and electronic information businesses. Both areas are larger than the equivalent businesses in the US and are bigger profit earners in Europe than everything else except foreign exchange. McFarlane's replacement running the UK corporate banking business is Ed Holmes who had previously been in charge of the Nordic region and is now adding the UK to his responsibilities.</p>

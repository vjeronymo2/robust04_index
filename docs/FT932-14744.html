			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / IG Metall leaders to set strike date LEADERS of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, are to meet on Monday to decide the timing of an all-out strike in eastern Germany in support of pay increases. Once the decision is made, the union will ballot its members in enterprises in the five eastern German states. All-out strikes will then take place if the union gets the support of 75 per cent of its members in any one company. The steel employers' association Arbeitgeberverband Stahl said yesterday that no talks were planned with IG Metall before next Monday. A spokesman said he saw no room for compromise at the moment. 'I think the union will strike for a few days, and having shown it can strike, it might return to the negotiating table.' The employers are recommending pay rises of 9 per cent this year, instead of the planned 26 per cent in the metal and electrical sectors, and 21 per cent in the steel sector in eastern Germany. The planned pay rises were agreed in March 1991 as part of a move to raise pay in eastern Germany to west German levels, but employers withdrew them on the grounds that the economy has worsened.</p>

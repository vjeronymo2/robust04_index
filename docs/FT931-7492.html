			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Personal View: A provincial lesson for Moscow There is a danger that the recent changes in the Russian federal government may divert attention from the progress being achieved in the provinces. This may hinder western businesses' understanding of how to gain a foothold, in regions where western assistance is already playing a useful role in the implementation of reform. As the governor of the Nizhny Novgorod province and a deputy to the Russian congress, I participate in government at the local and national level. I therefore have the benefit of both perspectives. Political uncertainty in the centre has stood in sharp contrast to the continuity in the provinces, where reforms will continue to be implemented despite Mr Victor Chernomyrdin having replaced Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister of the federal government. Nizhny Novgorod province, which has a population of 3.7m and is home to the third-largest city in Russia, provides a significant case study of reform and the constructive role the west can play in it. Once known as the 'pocket book of Russia' because of its trading wealth, Nizhny Novgorod more recently gained fame as Gorky, the closed city that was the home-in-exile of Andrei Sakharov. Restored to its original name and opened to foreigners for the first time since Stalin's rule, Nizhny Novgorod is benefiting greatly from foreign assistance, including technical assistance from the International Finance Corporation, conversion assistance from the International Executive Service Corps, and education and training for our residents from the US Peace Corps and the University City Science Centre of Philadelphia. Technical assistance has enabled Nizhny Novgorod to make progress toward establishing a market economy. When our province decided to implement the first privatisation of small-scale enterprises, including shops and small service establishments, we began our work with IFC. This co-operation has embraced new programmes designed to deepen privatisation, including restructuring our truck transport industry (financed by the US and the UK) and privatisation of collective farms. Not only has our province benefited from exceptionally rapid and well co-ordinated privatisation, it has also served as a model to other Russian provinces. We embarked on the first privatisation programme in Russia in March 1992, developing the auction method of privatisation now being used throughout Russia. A framework for privatising retail establishments had been in place for months on the national level, but only when we took the initiative was the programme implemented. We then began to privatise trucking enterprises and individual trucks. The truck auctions involved the first use of privatisation vouchers in Russia and, again, Nizhny Novgorod's programme is being used as the basis for similar privatisation in other provinces. While technical assistance must be targeted at important sectors to make efficient use of limited aid resources, it has helped us to push privatisation forward along a broad front. Our provincial privatisation agencies, emboldened by a string of successes, have embarked on ambitious programmes of their own. They have launched sectoral programmes for our wholesale trade network, construction industry and food processing plants. We are currently putting a programme in place to privatise agricultural land, once again with US financing and IFC expertise. Although the number of private farms established to date is insignificant, I am confident that we will develop a model that will help thousands of collective farms locally and throughout Russia to reorganise on the basic of private land ownership. The main barrier to reforms has not been a lack of legislation, but difficulty in implementing them at provincial level. Experience gained in Nizhny Novgorod has made a significant contribution by showing how the law should be applied and, in many instances, by demonstrating that privatisation can work and will have a positive impact. Barring a radical reversal of policy, including the repeal of dozens of Supreme Soviet laws and presidential decrees, central government will have little effect on the pace of our privatisation programmes or those of other provinces. The new Russia is the sum of its provinces in a way the Soviet Union never was. People who want to assist us in our process of change would do well to look beyond the capital. The impact of privatisation assistance to our province to date cannot be overestimated, and our experience has had a big impact on Russia as a whole.

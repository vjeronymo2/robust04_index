			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (10): The luxury of saying No / Profile of Den Danske Bank THE WORDS could serve as a motto for any prudent bank: 'I believe one must allow oneself the luxury of saying No, and it is a luxury we hope to be able to afford in the years to come as well.' They were spoken by Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive of Den Danske Bank, and the bank's record for prudence has paid off. It has emerged as by far the largest and strongest of the Danish banks, writes Hilary Barnes. 'We have a good reputation as a serious bank, and the word 'serious' is one we want associated with our name,' says Mr Sorensen. 'We like to think that we do not need to be the forerunners in every respect. We want to be the forerunners in our daily business, of course, but we do not have to be first with every new creation. 'But we do not jump onto every bandwagon that comes rushing past,' he says. The bank made a DKr1.73bn loss in 1992 compared with a DKr1.33bn profit in 1991. Provisions rose last year to a record DKr2.94bn, but the capital adequacy ratio was 11 per cent. If the bank has come through the credit and property boom-and-bust of the 1980s better than many of its competitors, part of the reason is that it took a cautious line on some of the more speculative business of the time, says Mr Sorensen. The prudential approach is part of the bank's life-blood, since a crash in the 1920s, which brought down Danske's predecessor bank. 'There is nothing to be ashamed of in this inheritance  .. It means that we think twice,' he says. But the bank is not risk-averse, he says, rejecting criticism, widespread in Denmark as elsewhere, that the troubles of the past few years have made the banks over-cautious. 'In principle our willingness to take risks has not changed over the past 10 years,' he says, pointing out that the switch from high to low inflation (in Denmark over the past 12 months it was just over 1 per cent) has a price. Inflation can no longer be counted on to take care of a bank's losses. 'You have to be more cautious. With a low inflation scenario you have got to be pretty sure you get it right first time, so we have to examine projects with greater thoroughness than 10 years ago.' Danske showed its strength last winter when it staged a two-stage multi-billion kroner support-cum-rescue operation for Baltica Holding, which controlled the country's largest insurance business. Danske's intervention led to a radical restructuring of the Baltica group and has left Danske with a 32 per cent holding in Baltica Insurance. But Mr Sorensen insists: 'We have no ambition to take over Baltica Insurance.' He will have no truck with suggestions that Danske has become too big and powerful a player in the Danish duckpond. 'A market share of about 30 per cent is not enough to enable us to dominate. And we act responsibly. We are the market leader, as we are the biggest, but we do not try to exploit this situation, and that is deliberate. 'It is part of our corporate culture than we wish to be a responsible citizen, even if this means that some business may pass us by.' The current year will a better one for the bank than last year, says Mr Sorensen, but loss provisions will remain high. He admits that the bank's earnings on its basic business have not been good enough for several years. Denmark is considerably overbanked and that means that Danske will have to emphasise control of costs. A factor in this will be the spread of electronic banking, which is already well-developed in Danish banks. 'A considerable part of our transactions already go through 'untouched by human hand'. Like it or not, you will see more automatic banking in our branches, inside the bank or in the wall. 'Costs are driving us, but so are our customers' inclinations. The younger generation are brought up with the use of electronic data processing so it is perfectly natural for them to wish to use it. 'Automats are no replacement for personal contact ... But in future you will go to the bank more rarely, and it will be for a deep discussion of a problem, about buying a house or a car or about the family budget,' he says.</p>

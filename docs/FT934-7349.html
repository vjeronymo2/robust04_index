			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (18): The burden shifts from south to north - But what happens in 1995 will cushion the impact of the UBR / Rating revaluation THE RECENT fluctuations in property rents will have a profound effect on the distribution of the business rates burden when it comes to the next rating revaluation in April 1995. For some businesses, rates could more than double; for others, they will nearly halve. While the south of England will generally benefit from the revaluation, companies in the north of England will suffer a marked increase in their rates burden, particularly in the industrial market. As a result, the impending revaluation will have a lasting influence on the performance of different parts of the property market. In particular, it is likely to aid the recovery of the market in central London at the expense of other parts of the country. The next revaluation will go some way to reverse the impact of the redistribution in the rates burden that occured when the uniform business rate (UBR) was introduced in 1990. Coming 17 years after the last revaluation, it resulted in substantial rate increases for many tenants, particularly in the south of England. For many traders, the large increase in rates, at a time, when they were already grappling with recession, had a severe impact on their profitability. When the next revaluation comes into force, another shift in the burden is expected - but in the opposite direction. Northern towns, which have proved far more resilient to the property recession, have seen far smaller declines in rental values than those in the south. As a result, many businesses in the north of England face substantial rises in rates, in some cases more than doubling their previous rates bills. The revaluation, which takes effect on April 1 1995, involves a revision of the two elements of rates - the rateable value and the UBR. The calculation of the rateable value will be based on April 1993 rental values; the calculation of the UBR will reflect the changing distribution of commercial property values across the UK. The UBR is set by the government in England and Wales. In Scotland, there is no UBR: each region levies its own rate. However, Scotland, too, will have a revaluation in 1995, based on property values in April 1993. Most commentators expect a fall in UBR in 1995. Even though rents in some sectors dipped sharply in the recession, the steep increases in 1988 and 1989 more than compensated. Overall, rents increased by 21 per cent in the five years to April 1993, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group. This gives the government scope to reduce the UBR to keep the total amount of business rates constant, after adjusting for inflation. Estimates for the UBR in 1995 vary significantly, depending on inflationary expectations and differing forecasts for the increase in rateable value. Earlier this year, Herring Baker Harris and Gerald Eve forecast that the UBR in April 1995 will be set at 40.6p and 35p, respectively. However, that disguises large variations between different sectors and regions. The revaluation will result in a marked shift in the rates burden, because of the different timing and extent of the property recession in different parts of the country. The 1990 revaluation was based on rents paid in April 1988, while the 1995 revaluation will be based on rents paid in 1993. The timing of the revaluation is significant in that some markets, such as City of London offices, which moved from peak to trough between 1988 and 1990. In most other parts of the market, rents peaked much later and have fallen by far less. The difference between the best and worst performing parts of the property market between 1988 and 1993 is marked. Herring Baker Harris, chartered surveyors, believes that commercial rents changed by between -43 per cent and +230 per cent in the period. Given that the UBR is likely to fall in 1995, it estimates that the shift in rental values will feed through into a change in rates payable of between -46 per cent and +230 per cent. Herring Baker Harris expects a significant shift in the burden of rates: the contribution from the south of England will fall from 70 per cent to 60 per cent of the total. The contribution of Greater London will fall from a third to a quarter. There will also some shift in the burden of business rates between different sectors of the property market. Industrial occupiers will bear the brunt of this redistribution with an increase in their share of the total from 18 per cent to 22 per cent of the whole. The contribution of retailers will remain at about 35 per cent of the whole, the contribution of office occupiers will fall from 29 per cent to 27 per cent and the contribution of the leisure, educational, utilities and miscellaneous category will fall from 18 per cent to 16 per cent. The extent of this shift will depend on any phasing provisions that may be introduced to smooth the transition, as they were at the last revaluation when the government introduced transitional relief to cushion the effect of the increases, particularly in the south. Opinions differ on the likelihood of transitional relief. On one hand, the increases in rates suffered by the worst-affected companies, such as industrial occupiers in the north, will not be on the same scale as in 1990. On the other hand, the revaluation may occur at a time when the government is facing another election, in which case it may be particularly sensitive to the impact of rate increases. Even if the changes are phased in, the revaluation should be of immediate benefit to occupiers in some of the markets worst affected by the property recession. Unlike falling rents which give no benefit to occupiers which are tied into existing lease obligations, the decline in rents should reduce occupation costs immediately.</p>

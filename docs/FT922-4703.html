			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: High cost of bidding for Jubilee line extension CONSTRUCTION companies estimate that they have spent at least Pounds 50m to prepare bids to build the Pounds 1.7bn extension to the Jubilee Underground which has been threatened by the decision to place the Canary Wharf office development into receivership. Bids have already been submitted for most of the 10 mile extension. London Transport has already identified an all-Italian consortium led by Italstrade as being likely to win the contract for the 2 1/2 mile section between Canary Wharf and Canada Water on the south bank of the Thames. Contractors are concerned about the potential waste of money spent on preparing bids as well as the possible loss of such a large project when construction order books are already at a low ebb. Construction work at Canary Wharf itself has halted while construction companies negotiate with the development's administrators over Pounds 60m of payments and retentions which are thought to be owed by Olympia &amp; York to contractors. Part of a contract payment is normally retained by developers for up to 12 months against the possibility of defects emerging after a building has been completed. Retentions can represent between 2 1/2 per cent to 5 per cent of the building cost. Bovis, Trafalgar House and Mowlem are among contractors still owed money under retention agreements. The companies say, however, that the sums are small by comparison with the scale of their total construction business. Smaller companies owed money by Olympia &amp; York are in a much more difficult position. Several of these could be at risk if payments are not forthcoming according to some contractors working at Canary Wharf. Olympia &amp; York, however, was a prompt payer and was thought to have been up-to-date with progress payments before the development went into administrative receivership. Larger contractors, although concerned about money owed on Canary Wharf, are more worried about the possible loss of the Jubilee Line extension. The government has said that the project will not go ahead unless any future owner of the development meets Olympia &amp; York's commitment to provide Pounds 400m towards the cost of the extension. This would involve an initial tranche of Pounds 100m paid almost immediately with the remaining Pounds 300m paid over 20 to 25 years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Vinogradov report: "Tajik Rubles Printed in Russia"] </F>   [Text] The Russian Main Administration for the Production  of State Bank Notes, Coins, and Medals [Goznak] has printed off  330 billion rubles [R] especially for Tajikistan. In outward  appearance these banknotes differ little from those circulating  in Russia. National symbolic elements give them the function of  "purely Tajik money."    As reported to IZVESTIYA at the Central Bank, these new  bills  will be issued to the client in May or June and they will become  the basic means of payment on the republic territory. In point  of fact we are talking about an actual national currency "in  ruble form," but the intergovernmental agreement indicates that  it is to play the role of a "transitional monetary unit."    The reference here is to an indefinite transition period  during which Dushanbe is expected to prepare its economy and its  approach for entry into the ruble zone. According to Viktor  Chernomyrdin, Tajikistan could become Russia's second partner in  the currency union after Belorussia [Belarus]. In spirit  Dushanbe has long been ready for such a partnership. Unlike  other CIS countries, it never left the ruble zone, nor did it  try to introduce its own currency, even ignoring IMF  recommendations.    In June 1993, when Russia introduced new money and the Asian  CIS countries introduced their own currencies, Tajikistan became  a dumping ground for old-style rubles which had lost their  purchasing power. Hot money made its way into the Tajik market  from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. In  January this year Dushanbe received R70 billion in new banknotes  out of R120 billion in credits offered by Russia on the security  of part of its gold reserves and controlling packages of shares  in a number of industrial facilities, including the Nurek  Hydroelectric Power Station. Some R350 billion in old money  accumulated by Tajik branches of the Savings Bank became  worthless.    The republic ended up on meager currency rations. Out of  some 90 billion new rubles brought into circulation, a little  over 10 percent returned to the bank. A certain amount stayed  in the population's pockets, but the majority flowed into  Uzbekistan. Uzbek entrepreneurs found their feet instantly,  organizing a huge market in cheap food on the border with  famished Tajikistan.    Tajik Premier Abdujalil Samadov acknowledged the  senselessness of a ruble injection into the local economy and  expressed support for the introduction of coupons. Now this  role will be fulfilled by paper currency with special markings.  These will circulate on an equal footing with Russian rubles,  and they will be exchanged at a rate of 1:1.    Moscow has not recognized the old money deposited in Tajik  enterprises' accounts, totaling around R200 billion in all,  since 1992 and does not accept them as a means of payment. It  emerges that, by bringing the new denominations into  circulation, Russia is simultaneously depriving the Tajik  economy of this sum. The fate of the "leftovers" now depends on  whether or not Tajikistan can demonstrate the viability of the  new ruble which has become the bulwark of the financial system,  or whether it will meet the fate of its predecessor.</p>

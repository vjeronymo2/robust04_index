			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The French people's confidence in Prime Minister  Balladur registered a 12-point drop in March, according to the  CSA-"La Vie" opinion poll. Of those interviewed (between the  two cantonal election rounds), 40 percent have confidence in  Edouard Balladur's capacity "to cope efficiently with the main  problems the country is facing," while 45 percent think  otherwise. Meanwhile, Francois Mitterrand's rating indicates  an opposite trend, with 45 percent of those responding with  positive appraisals against 39 percent negative. This is the  first time since March 1993 that the head of state leads his  prime minister in a poll.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / International Company News: Kellogg helped by sale of unit KELLOGG, the US cereals group, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 196.2m in the first three months of 1992, up from Dollars 163.1m in the same period a year earlier. Kellogg said the results included a one-off pre-tax gain of Dollars 58.5m from the sale of Fearn International, a US food service subsidiary, partially offset by a charge of Dollars 22.4m following the sale of its convenience foods operations in Canada, and some other US assets. Without these distorting factors, first-quarter profits would have improved by 4.5 per cent. Sales were up by 6.6 per cent in the first three months, to Dollars 1.51bn. Kellogg shares fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 56 1/8 yesterday.</p>

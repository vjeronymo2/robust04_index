			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Same-sex partners to get equal benefits ONTARIO'S Human Rights Commission has ruled that homosexuals are entitled to their live-in partners' pension and insurance benefits in the same way as spouses in a heterosexual marriage. The landmark ruling is expected to increase pressure on employers throughout Canada to give equal treatment to homosexuals for the full range of spousal benefits. A Canadian public-sector trade union has launched a complaint against the federal Income Tax Act which allegedly discriminate against same-sex partners in the application of tax allowances. Some experts predict that the extension of employee benefits to homosexual partners could increase the cost of company-financed pension, insurance and health plans. The decision stems from a complaint by a Toronto man employed by the Ontario provincial government. He objected to the government's refusal in 1988 to include his homosexual partner in its medical insurance coverage.</p>

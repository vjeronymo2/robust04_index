			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEVIL WHO MADE U.S. BUSINESS LEANER, MEANER;  </P> <P> FINANCE: HOW MICHAEL MILKEN BECAME THE JUNK-BOND KING GOES BACK TO THE TIME  WHEN AMERICAN CORPORATIONS WERE GOBBLING UP THE WORLD.  </P> <P> What is most disturbing, somehow, is the sheer venality of the crimes that  Michael R. Milken, the erstwhile "junk-bond king" of Drexel Burnham Lambert  Inc., has admitted to.  </P> <P> Milken, after all, was not your average boiler-room penny-stock manipulator. He  was a life force: No single person since J.P. Morgan had as great an impact in  reshaping the American business and financial landscape. But the Michael R.  Milken that comes slinking out of the federal charge-sheet is no world-class  mover and shaker.  </P> <P> A client wanted to cheat on his income taxes, so Milken rigged a series of sham  trades to create some fake losses.  </P> <P> Steve Wynn, the head of Golden Nugget, wanted to get out of a large stock  position in a takeover target. So Milken arranged with Ivan Boesky to rig the  stock price with a flurry of sham-trading activity.  </P> <P> Drexel discovered that its sales agreement with an investment fund didn't cover  all its sales expenses. So Milken overcharged the investors for trading to make  up the difference. And so the sorry recitation goes.  </P> <P> None of these offenses, Milken insisted in his guilty plea, go to the heart of  his main junk-bond business. But of course he's quite wrong about that. Milken  was the creator and soul of the junkbond market. For most of a decade, he and  Drexel exercised almost unprecedented sway over the American financial markets,  handling three-quarters, or even more, of annual junk-bond financings.  </P> <P> Such pervasive amorality at the heart of the empire taints the entire  enterprise. The entire junk-bond decade is now seen, in the words of one  eminent financial journal, as "the biggest private financial scandal of the  20th Century."  </P> <P> Reality, as always, is much more complicated. The harsh judgments now raining  down upon Milken, Drexel and the whole era of glitz and glitter that was Wall  Street in the 1980s are both true and deserved -- and utterly false.  </P> <P> The beginnings of the story go back almost 30 years to the last Wall Street  boom in the mid-1960s. American corporations, like the Japanese today, were  taking over the world. American mass-production technology, most of it from  Detroit, was generating huge cash flows that large companies were plowing into  acquisitions at home and abroad.  </P> <P> Business-school professors flocked to the soaring corporate towers and created  huge "planning," "marketing" and "MIS" bureaucracies. Executives leaned back  contentedly in a sleek world of statistics, private jets and exclusive clubs.  And John Kenneth Galbraith reported that "the problem of production has been  solved."  </P> <P> That complacent paradise came apart in less than a decade. First came the  oil-price shocks of the 1970s, then wave after wave of assaults from leaner,  hungrier, more aggressive competitors, mostly from Japan. American executives,  panting and red-faced, peered in wonderment through fat-padded eyelids as their  stock prices sank like a stone throughout the 1970s.  </P> <P> By the 1980s, as T. Boone Pickens delighted in pointing out, the total of stock  prices of most major oil companies was lower than the value of the oil they  owned. In other words, raw oil sitting in a well somewhere was worth more by  itself than if you attached an oil company to it. That was the measure of the  disdain shareholders had for their corporate managements.  </P> <P> And that is the world that gave birth to the junk-bond market. Junk bonds were  an instrument of rebellion, an avenue of financing outside the traditional  channels controlled by a cozy club of the white-shoe investment banks and the  biggest industrial companies. Milken's contribution was to see the opportunity  before anyone else and to assemble a network of like-minded outsiders to keep  the new channels flowing.  </P> <P> Junk-bond-financed management buyouts, hostile takeovers and the mere threat of  hostile takeovers forced a radical restructuring of most big companies through  the first part of the 1980s. Mobil got out of its circus and department-store  businesses. Goodyear shed its aerospace holdings and its resort hotels. All the  big textile companies refocused on just one or two markets where they could  gain a real competitive advantage.  </P> <P> Union Carbide shed a string of consumer businesses and got back into chemicals.  During the 1980s, there was a sharp drop in big-company white-collar employment  and an equally sharp rise in American manufacturing productivity. American  steel is now cheaper than Japanese steel.  </P> <P> Did Milken make this happen? No. No more than J.P. Morgan caused the  large-scale reorganization of American industry at the turn of the century. But  they both speeded the processes up.  </P> <P> But that, it turns out, is only one side of the story. Gross excess may be an  intrinsic feature of American capital markets. Most of the useful corporate  restructurings had probably already happened by 1985 or 1986. And, in fact,  probably most pre-1986 junk-bond deals have turned out to be quite profitable.  </P> <P> But by 1986, Wall Street had discovered the new golden goose. Buyout fund after  buyout fund plunged into the market, buying up lackluster companies at grossly  inflated prices. Twenty-five year-olds made millions playing computer games  with their Lotus spreadsheets.  </P> <P> And at the center of it all sat Michael R. Milken, with his billion-dollar  income and famous X-shaped desk in Beverly Hills, keeping the market rolling  and the stakes rising with a network of nouveau-riche S&amp;L and insurance  executives, ready to snap up any piece of paper with his name on it, no matter  how foolishly priced, much of which is now being choked back up onto the laps  of horrified taxpayers.  </P> <P> So how does one judge Milken and Wall Street? Was Milken a hero or a devil? A  financial genius or a crass stock manipulator? Is Wall Street an engine of  industrial restructuring or a cheap, glitzy casino? The answer to all of those  questions, confusingly enough, is all of the above.  </P></p>

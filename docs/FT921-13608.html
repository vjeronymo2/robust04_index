			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Quick word with the neighbours pays off - Business expansion scheme / The option is still open Strangled by Inland Revenue regulations to prevent tax evasion and hijacked by the introduction of special privileges for rented housing, does the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) have any role still to play in financing small businesses? The history of the BES as a programme for promoting enterprise has not been a happy one. It has raised more than Pounds 1.5bn since it was launched in 1983 but much of this money has gone into low-risk, asset-backed ventures, far removed from the entrepreneurial businesses first envisaged. The BES allows investors to claim income tax relief on equity investments of up to Pounds 40,000 a year in unquoted companies while investors are also exempt from capital gains. In return, the companies in which they invest must conform to strict rules governing the sorts of activity they carry out (no commodities dealing or banking), their geographical spread (mainly in the UK) and the composition of assets (not too much land and buildings). The introduction in 1988 of a two-tier system under which companies providing homes to let under assured tenancy agreements could raise up to Pounds 5m while other 'trading' companies could raise only Pounds 500,000 - since increased to Pounds 750,000  - tilted the scales still further away from the entrepreneurial small business. But wait. The BES may be down but it is certainly not out. Some small companies are managing to steer between the rocks of regulation to raise useful amounts of finance, while allowing their investors to enjoy the BES tax breaks. The Oxford Toy Company, a two-year-old company with projected sales of Pounds 50,000, raised Pounds 31,200 from BES investors - friends and neighbours of its two founders in Wallingford, Oxfordshire - to finance the manufacture of its Quickword board game. Hannah McDonald, who set up the company with her husband Stuart, says she read up the rules for raising BES finance in the Inland Revenue's BES leaflet, IR 51. A 10-minute telephone conversation with the company's auditor filled in the remaining gaps. Writing a brief for investors was easier than filling in a tax form,' says McDonald, a former fund manager. The local tax office gave its approval for the BES fund-raising in five days and Oxford Toy raised the money it needed within three weeks for a cost of just Pounds 86. One of the investors, Martin Vaughan, a consultant with Unipart, a car parts group, was invited on to the board. Vaughan says he had no previous experience of the BES though he does own shares in three quoted companies. Vaughan says he had been asked, as a neighbour, to test the board game and he was impressed by the enthusiasm and ingenuity of the McDonalds. 'My wife and I thought it was worth a bit of a gamble,' he says. Shareholders are kept in touch with a quarterly newsletter and several have offered their garages to store stocks of games. But if Oxford Toy found it surprisingly easy to find its way through the thicket of regulations which surround the BES, The Whole Thing, a 'green' mail order company based in Kendal, Cumbria, fell victim to the rules. The Whole Thing attempted to raise Pounds 500,000 last year but ran into a problem with two large investors who would have owned more than 30 per cent of the company. This led to 'the surreal situation of having to go to the the City Takeover Panel', recalls William Pryor, managing director. The six months delay forced the company into liquidation, though the business has since been resurrected as The Green Catalogue with projected first year sales of Pounds 500,000. 'People can slip up over the simplest things and lose their BES status,' warns Mavis Seymour, BES tax consultant at accountants Stoy Hayward. One investor realised that he was not allowed to become a paid director of the company but he announced his intention of billing it for some work he planned to do. This would also be seen as 'receiving value' from the company and led to him forfeiting his tax relief. Most BES fund-raisings are small, private deals similar to that arranged by Oxford Toy, says Seymour. In terms of the money raised, however, most comes through the more formal prospectus issues backed by a BES specialist issuing-house. Prospectus issues enjoy two main benefits: they have been prepared by a specialist so should avoid the pitfalls which can trap the inexperienced. They can also make use of the sponsor's database of clients known to be interested in BES issues. Derek Miles, an inventor, attempted to raise BES finance for The Contented Cook, a company set up develop a range of products based on an innovative cooking pot. Miles wrote his own document and arranged for copies to be sent out by a local financial consultant in Sidmouth, Devon. Miles raised just Pounds 6,000 of the Pounds 25,000 he was seeking and now says he would have been better to produce a proper prospectus for wider circulation. The problem with prospectus issues is that any company not involved in providing assured tenancy housing has to compete with the property schemes. Since property companies can raise larger sums of money, their costs of fund-raising are relatively lower. This helps to explain why trading companies accounted for just Pounds 12m of the Pounds 256m raised by public BES offers in 1990-91. 'You cannot let the costs go above 10 per cent of the amount you are raising,' says David Royds, a director of Matrix Securities, a BES sponsor. 'But there is invariably more work in raising money for a trading company.' One way to reduce the cost of producing and distributing a prospectus is to put several companies in the same document. Neill Clerk &amp; Plant Hill, a Glasgow-based firm of solicitors is currently working on a combined prospectus for three different companies. This can bring the cost of a typical fund-raising down from Pounds 35,000-Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 15,000, says Ross Macdonald, a partner. An alternative way of reducing costs and boosting the amount of finance which can be raised is to create separate companies each owning one of a chain of, say, hotels or retail outlets. If a company believes it can raise the finance it needs from a fairly small circle of investors, it may opt to prepare a memorandum. This need not contain as much detail as a full prospectus but may only be distributed to a restricted number of people, usually taken to mean up to 40 people. A fourth method of raising BES finance is for a company to approach a BES fund. But investors have shunned funds, preferring to invest directly. For all the complications that surround raising BES finance, it remains popular with many companies. Neill Clerk says it receives three approaches a week from companies seeking BES finance while Matrix Securities claims to be 'inundated' with requests for finance. Many companies are keen to attract investors they believe will be less demanding than professional venture capitalists. The BES Association, representing sponsors and others in the industry, is calling for changes to the BES in the forthcoming budget to promote investments in smaller and riskier companies. It is clear that there is a continuing need for the BES and that it is failing to serve its original purpose.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S FINALLY OFFICIAL: KELM DEFINITELY OUT OF RAM LINEUP UNTIL NOVEMBER  </P> <P> The "day-to-day" foot injury that sidelined Larry Kelm on Aug. 21 will now keep  him out of the lineup until at least November. The Rams announced Friday that  they were placing the linebacker on six-week injured reserve to make room on  the roster for LeRoy Irvin.  </P> <P> Kelm separated the metatarsals in his left foot on a routine lunge into the  line during an exhibition against the Phoenix Cardinals.  </P> <P> The first reports were encouraging, but Kelm is just now able to walk normally.  </P> <P> "He's too far gone now," Coach John Robinson said Friday. "They're talking two  weeks of straight-ahead running, two weeks of cutting and then two weeks of  practice."  </P> <P> Kelm was expected to inherit Carl Ekern's starting inside linebacker position  this season.  </P> <P> Obviously affecting the Kelm decision was the rapid improvement of linebacker  Mark Jerue, who is expected to start practicing next week after another long  rehabilitation from an off-season knee surgery.  </P> <P> Jerue is eligible to return in time for the New Orleans Saints game Oct. 22 at  Anaheim Stadium, and probably will.  </P> <P> "It's sort of miraculous," defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said of Jerue's  recovery.  </P> <P> Kelm isn't eligible to play again until Nov. 12, a home date against the New  York Giants.  </P> <P> Irvin, who has returned after serving a 30-day suspension for substance abuse,  will start at right cornerback against the San Francisco 49ers Sunday at  Candlestick Park.

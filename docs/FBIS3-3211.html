On 3 March, representatives from northern and  southern Korea resumed contacts between working representatives,  and they sent special envoys to visit each other, which had been  suspended for four months. The United States announced the  resumption of the third round of high-level intergovernmental  talks with the DPRK on 21 March and conditionally announced the  suspension of this year's "Team Spirit" exercise. This series  of dialogues and detente has thrown a new ray of hope on the  tense and mutually confrontational Korean peninsula.    The DPRK announced on 12 March 1993 that it would withdraw  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and decreed that the  Korean people remained in a "state of semi-war." The United  States and some Western countries then stated that they would  impose sanctions on the DPRK. The DPRK, however, announced that  international sanctions would mean a declaration of war against  it. With the mediation of some countries, on 2 June, the DPRK  and the United States held a high-level intergovernmental  meeting, issued a joint declaration, and agreed on principles  such as guaranteeing the non-use of nuclear weapons and of armed  threats, establishing a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, that the  DPRK and the United States should respect each other's  sovereignty and not interfere in each other's internal affairs,  and that the United States supports the reunification of Korea.  This was the first document reached between the DPRK and the  United States toward the normalization of relations since they  stopped fighting 40 years ago. In view of the United States'  promises, the DPRK announced that it would not withdraw from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty temporarily. In mid-July, the  two sides held a second round of high-level intergovernmental  talks where the United States promised to supply the DPRK with  civilian nuclear technology in exchange for its acceptance of  international nuclear inspections.    Nevertheless, the two sides differed in opinion on the form  and number of nuclear inspections with the result that the  nuclear inspections could not proceed as scheduled. The two  sides took opposing attitudes over this question and the  situation became tense again.    At working talks between DPRK and U.S. representatives in  New  York last October, the two sides discussed a "basket of  proposals for the resolution of the nuclear issue." They  included the question of official U.S. recognition of the DPRK  and holding a third round of high-level intergovernmental talks.  As planned, the third round of DPRK-U.S. intergovernmental  talks should have begun in November or early December last year.  But on 1 November, with the United States' insistence, the UN  General Assembly adopted a resolution demanding that the DPRK  accept nuclear inspections. In mid-November, the ROK and the  United States carried out joint military exercises. In the face  of international pressure, the third round of DPRK-U.S.  intergovernmental talks failed. In late December, UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto visited the DPRK to mediate. On 29 December, the  DPRK-U.S. working talks made progress. The United States stated  that it would suspend South Korean-U.S. "Team Spirit" exercises  in 1994 while the DPRK also agreed to accept "continuous"  nuclear inspections. The two sides agreed to create conditions  for a third round of DPRK-U.S. intergovernmental talks. In  January, the United States sent nongovernmental personalities to  visit the DPRK, and U.S. evangelist Billy Graham even passed a  message from Clinton to Chairman Kim Il-song expressing  willingness to make efforts to improve DPRK-U.S. relations.  However, at the same time, the United States sent a team of  intelligence experts to Seoul to step up monitoring of the DPRK.  Moreover, it stated that it would deploy Patriot missiles to  the ROK.    On 25 February, an agreement issued by the DPRK and the  United States announced that the two sides had reached an  agreement. The United States announced that it had agreed to  suspend "Team Spirit" exercises with the ROK, while the DPRK  accepted continuous nuclear inspections intended to safeguard  nuclear security. They also agreed to resume working contacts  between northern and southern Korea, which is intended to  facilitate the mutual dispatch of special envoys and holding a  third round of DPRK-U.S. talks between high-ranking officials in  Geneva on 21 March.    We must see, however, that in announcing a date for a third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks and the suspension of the "Team Spirit"  military exercises, the United States has attached conditions.  These preconditions were absent from the original agreement  reached between the DPRK and the United States. The United  States also stated that if the international inspections were  unsatisfactory, "Team Spirit" would be resumed. Observers  maintain that in resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula, they must have good faith or else agreements will  become empty even if there are many more of them.</p>

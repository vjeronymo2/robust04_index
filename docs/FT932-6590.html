			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The selling season in Australia is in its final weeks and prices are showing no signs of slipping back to recent lows. Finer merino fleece, which led the recent rise, showed a dearer tendency again this week, after last week's pause. Demand for other wools was good at firm prices, and the overall Australian Wool Corporation market indicator had recovered 8 cents by May 26 to 453 cents a kg., only 2 cents short of its peak two weeks before.</p>

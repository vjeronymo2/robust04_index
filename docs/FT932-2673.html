			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Critical days for the dollar THE DOLLAR enjoyed another rally against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday, with some dealers wondering whether the US currency was on the verge of the strategic move upwards that has been awaited all year, writes James Blitz. The currency has made several attempts at a sustained break through the DM1.67 level this year, only to fall back on fears that the US economic recovery was not powerful enough and that the D-Mark remained intrinsically strong. However, at the close of European trading yesterday, the dollar appeared set for another test of the elusive DM1.67 figure, having risen more than 2 pfennigs on the day to DM1.6585. In New York it finished at DM1.6560. For dollar bulls, the striking feature of yesterday's rally was that it came at a time when all the indicators ought to have triggered weakness in the US currency. The Bundesbank disappointed those dealers who had expected an easing in monetary policy, leaving its repo rate on hold at 7.60 per cent. Tuesday's consumer price inflation data, showing a smaller than expected monthly increase in US prices of 0.1 per cent, had also wiped away expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon raise short term interest rates, thereby reducing the premium on holding D-Marks. But this indicator has been mostly ignored by the market. Instead, the D-Mark has been undermined by growing concern about the weakness of the German economy and its budget deficit. In Europe, the D-Mark fell against most currencies yesterday. It closed at minus 21 per cent on its exchange rate mechanism divergence indicator, its lowest level since August 1991. The unchanged repo rate also failed to prevent sterling closing stronger against the currency, 1/4 pfennig higher at DM2.4950. Some dealers were also concerned that the Bundesbank was losing its grip on the setting of Europe-wide interest rate policy. It was striking yesterday that three-month Dutch guilders were  3/4 percentage point below the corresponding German rate - but the Dutch currency remained at the top of the Dutch central bank's self-imposed limit against the D-Mark in the ERM grid. Mr Avinash Persaud, an economist at UBS, believes the trend of D-Mark weakness is set to continue. 'The D-Mark is slowly losing its anchor status in the ERM,' he said. He believes that, in several months' time, the currency markets' focus in Europe will be on the setting of French interest rates rather than German ones. Mr Steve Hannah, of IBJ International, believes that another dollar setback will occur before the break through DM1.67 takes place. He thinks the two key elements of a sustained dollar rise are not in place: clear signs of a rise in US interest rates and certainty of the decline in German rates.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: India experiences turnround in fortunes The decision to postpone the planned Dollars 1bn global offering of shares in the Indian telecommunications group VSNL earlier this week is another reminder of the turnround in fortunes that has been experienced by many emerging markets so far this year. After a near 35 per cent gain in dollar terms during 1993, the Indian stock market, as measured by the IFC, has shown a rise of just 5 per cent during the first four months of 1994. The collapse of the VSNL offer came as no surprise to some analysts. Mr Nigel Spence of Lehman Brothers in London, for instance, remarked that the issue was both far too large and too expensive, with few insti-tutions being prepared to pay even the Rs1,100 to Rs1,200 (Dollars 35 to Dollars 38) per share which had been sugges-ted in a last minute effort to salvage the issue. The orig-inal pricing was expected to have been between Rs1,400 to Rs1,600. What are the prospects now for other Indian global issues? An issue by the domestic telephone operator MTNL, which was to have followed VSNL, now looks uncertain, while the government was expected yesterday to announce that it was clawing back fund raising by companies this year. 'I think that the stock market will move sideways now,' said Mr Spence. 'There has been heavy selling in recent months by US hedge funds.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES

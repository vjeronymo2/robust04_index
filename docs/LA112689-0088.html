			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCR'S ETHNIC QUOTAS AND ARTS FUNDING  </P> <P> Re ethnic balance on the arts (Nov. 13). The South Coast Repertory's grant  request was cut by 23% by the California Arts Council because it didn't have  its quota of Latinos on its board, and the Times applauds the move. Presumably  SCR's grant request will be restored if it fills its Latino quota next year.  </P> <P> To quote The Times: "SCR has shown its commitment to minorities in ways its  board composition does not indicate. It sponsors the nationally recognized  Hispanic Playwrights Project, which showcases budding authors. All told, it  spends $500,000 on (the) community."  </P> <P> But SCR's commitment to minorities doesn't matter to the California Arts  Council. Nor do SCR's nationally recognized results matter. Why? Because the  commitment and successes came from a board whose ethnic balance does not meet  the criteria set by the California Arts Council.  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor Art Museum has more than its quota of Latinos so it gets its  grant. Neither The Times nor the anonymous member of the arts council says what  the museum does for the Latinos. That doesn't seem to be important. Neither is  what SCR does for Latinos important.  </P> <P> The Times and the California Arts Council determine whether a group is worth it  or not by looking at the ethnic origin of the name.  </P> <P> Shame on you and the arts council. I thought we had come further that that. How  sad.  </P> <P> JAMES ALEXIOU  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

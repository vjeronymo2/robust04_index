			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Rosier political climate lifts Latin America - John Pitt reviews the performance of the world's emerging markets last December Latin America showed strong gains among emerging markets last month. In dollar terms, Argentina rose by 19.5 per cent while Brazil was just behind with 16 per cent, according to data provided by the IFC, part of the World Bank. Argentina has recovered well since hitting year lows in November. Ms Veronica Berger, at Latin American Securities in London, says economic prospects have greatly improved: 'The bulk of the privatisation programme was successfully carried out in 1992, IMF fiscal targets were met and latest real GDP growth est-imates are around 9 per cent.' Much of this was due to a political willingness to tackle inflation. The virtual elimination of the budget deficit has already cut the rate to 20 per cent a year, from nearly 200 per cent a month in July 1989. The stock market was also assisted by the completion of the privatisation of Gas del Estado, and investors are now waiting for the sale later this year of a 70 per cent stake in YPF, the state oil group and the country's largest company. Brazil has also gained from an improved political climate following the resignation of President Fernando Collor de Mello. Although Mr Collor delayed his departure until December 29, just before his impeachment trial on corruption charges was to begin in the senate, the market began its rally about a week before. This followed a decision by the then-acting president, Mr Itamar Franco, to allow Telebras, the telecommunications group, to increase tariffs by some 6 per cent in real terms over the next six months. This went against his earlier statements that prices would be kept down to fight inflation and make the service more accessible to the lower-paid. Since then the new government has unveiled its economic blueprint with the aim of lowering interest rates, investing some Dollars 4bn in infrastructure, health and education projects, and increasing the minimum salary. Indonesia, which lost 7 per cent in dollar terms, was the worst performer in December. Sentiment was depressed by the decline in Astra's share price as the founding Soeryadjaya family sold heavily to help pay off the obligations of their privately owned Bank Summa, which was ordered into liquidation by the central bank on December 14. The family eventually lost majority control of the automotive group as the year closed. Wardley James Capel remains bullish about Indonesia. 'We feel that the banking crisis and the Astra fiasco has been overdone and that earnings per share growth will surprise in 1993 and 1994,' the broker says in a recent document. Wardley offers some words of caution too: 'Our major concern is the possible massive explosion of scrip supply; and how long it will be before investors trust the families enough to start buying again.'</p>

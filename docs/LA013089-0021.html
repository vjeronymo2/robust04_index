			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ABORTION AND THE COURT'  </P> <P> Your editorial cites every bad thing about Roe vs. Wade, then proceeds to  support it. In essence, it says, Roe vs. Wade is based on outdated medical  knowledge, finds questionable basis in the Constitution, established a "right"  where none is enumerated, but hey, we've gotten used to it so let's not rock  the boat.  </P> <P> Bad law is bad law. Human life is not so trifling an issue that we can get by  with mediocre legislation "protecting" it.  </P> <P> CYNTHIA TEWS  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Reynolds in CIS aluminium project Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium group, has signed a technology transfer and technical assistance agreement that is to help convert a substantial portion of an aluminium defence and aerospace plant in the former Soviet Union into a manufacturer of aluminium sheet for beverage cans. Mr Randy Reynolds, vice-chairman of Reynolds, suggested the agreement was the first step towards the launch of aluminium beverage cans in Russia, which would mean the Commonwealth of Independent States consuming more of the aluminium it produces. 'By sharing our technology, we expect Sameco (Samara Metallurgical Company) to become the first to produce can stock in the CIS,' Mr Reynolds said. The former Soviet aluminium industry was set up primarily to supply material for defence and aerospace applications. The collapse of the Soviet Union left industry with huge surplus capacity. It has turned to exporting on a much larger scale. Exports to the west surged from 250,000 tonnes in 1989 to more than 2m tonnes last year, which forced down world prices to their lowest level in real terms. The Samara-based company, to which Reynolds will provide assistance, has shut down most of its plant, which once produced hard-alloy aluminium sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions mainly for the defence and aerospace industries. Sameco hopes to begin producing can stock by the end of 1995. Reynolds, the world's third-largest manufacturer of aluminium beverage cans, has joint ventures for aluminium beverage cans in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Reynolds and its affiliates have 20 plants world-wide with the capacity to produce 21bn cans a year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Berisha: Bulgaria Prevented </F> Attempts for Division of Macedonia"]    [Text] "Bulgaria refused to take part in the secret  meeting with Greece and Serbia in 1991, thereby sparing  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  from what could have become another conflict on the Balkans,"  the Albanian President Sali Berisha announced yesterday at the  airport in Vienna. Berisha discussed this question with the  Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev during his stay in Sofia last  month, when he thanked Zhelev for turning down the invitation to  take part in the meeting.    "President Zhelev's standpoint against this meeting is very  important. If Zhelev had accepted at the time the events would  have taken a completely different course," Berisha said.    Asked by the reporters at the Vienna airport whether the  meeting could have led to the eruption of a new conflict on the  Balkans, Berisha said: "Macedonia would have absolutely faced  enormous difficulties."    Berisha also stated that the former Greek Prime Minister  Mitsotakis had invited Zhelev and the Serbian President  Milosevic to attend a secret meeting in Athens in order to  discuss Macedonia [passage indistinct] where numerous ethnic  Albanian population resides. The meeting was supposed to begin  around the time of the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation  and the first signs of a war between Croatia and the rebel Serbs.    Further on, Berisha stated that the creation of a  Greek-Serbian-Bulgarian axis was planned at the meeting, which  would review Macedonia's fate and could have brought about the  division of the Republic among the three Balkan neighbors.    "Milosevic accepted to take part in the meeting, but Zhelev  refused to participate in this trilateral meeting."    "Zhelev said," Berisha added, "no, I will not come without  Macedonia being present," Berisha said in Vienna.</p>

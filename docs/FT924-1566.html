			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / French bank rates up to 10% FRANCE'S main commercial banks raised their base rates by more than half a percentage point to 10 per cent yesterday, in the wake of intense pressure on the franc on foreign exchanges. The increase hits government hopes of stimulating the economy by restraining interest rates. Societe Generale, the largest French commercial bank, led the way by announcing a 0.5 percentage point increase in mid-afternoon. Several other state-owned banks followed suit. The base rate increases were triggered by recent sharp rises in short-term rates on the French money markets, which have accompanied the Bank of France's attempts to stave off attacks on the French currency. The franc remained weak yesterday against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges, and some dealers said there had been a deterioration in sentiment towards the French currency. There was strong speculation the French authorities might have to raise official interest rates to protect the franc. The announcement of the base rate rise produced an immediate fall in the Paris stock market. The CAC-40 Index closed 0.46 per cent lower at 1,736.69. The French economy has already slowed down this year because of the impact of high real interest rates on confidence. 'The base rate rise is a blow to the government's hopes of improving confidence,' said Mr Christopher Potts, chief economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'The question is whether interest rates will go up further.' The increase raised new fears about the franc's strength on the foreign exchanges. It closed unchanged in London at FFr3.4170 against the D-Mark. But in US trading it fell below the FFr3.42 level, closer to its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism, of FFr3.4305. Currencies, Page 29</p>

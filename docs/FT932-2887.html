			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / EC loses state aid case: Court rules against closer public sector scrutiny ATTEMPTS by the European Commission to enforce higher disclosure standards for state aid to public sector companies were set back yesterday by a European Court of Justice ruling against the procedures Brussels had followed to introduce the measure. The Commission said yesterday it would be repackaging the measure, as it has done after similar procedural slip-ups in the past. The aim of the 1991 move was to uncover more of the illegal state aid which member states were not notifying to Brussels. State-owned manufacturing concerns with turnover in excess of Ecu250m (Pounds 197.5m) were required to submit balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for examination, including for 1989 and 1990, the two years preceding the change in the rules. Previously, state aids were notified by member states. But Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner at the time, reckoned that the inadequate rigour of the previous regime had let Ecu15bn in non-notified aid slip through the net over the previous five years, only Ecu5bn of which had been uncovered. Though the crackdown was controversial and strongly contested by France and Italy, Brussels maintained this was an important distortion of competition. Illegal state aid in the public sector was 10-times the flow of non-notified public subsidy to private companies, the Commission maintained. But after France challenged the measure, the Court in Luxembourg has found fault with the way the Commission introduced the measure, via an October 1991 'communication' to the Council of Ministers of the 12. The Commission yesterday said it would be reintroducing the measures by seeking to amend the 1980 directive governing the financial relationship between member states and government-owned companies.</p>

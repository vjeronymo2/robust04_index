			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATING PACT IS BITTERSWEET END TO BATTLE;  </P> <P> MEDIA: THE FREE PRESS IS SAVED, AND THE COMBINED NEWSPAPERS MAY MAKE UP TO $100  MILLION. BUT 500 PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS.  </P> <P> The Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News will execute the biggest newspaper  merger in American history on Nov. 27, joining business operations but keeping  separate news staffs, the papers announced Monday.  </P> <P> The announcement came within hours of the 4-4 Supreme Court vote clearing the  way for the merger, three years and a spate of legal hurdles after Gannett Co.  and Knight-Ridder announced the proposed truce in April, 1986.  </P> <P> The merger will cost an estimated 500 people their jobs and ends one of the  last knives-and-chains newspaper rumbles in the country, but it will ensure the  Free Press' survival. Knight-Ridder had promised to close the paper if the  merger were not approved.  </P> <P> "Whoever said a tie was like kissing your sister didn't have it quite right,"  Detroit Free Press Executive Editor Heath Meriwether said.  </P> <P> "I think it hurts competition, creates a monopoly, and I think it sets a bad  precedent for other markets in the country," said Allen Lengel, staff writer of  the Detroit News.  </P> <P> According to Gannett estimates, the merger will turn current annual losses of  $20 million at the Free Press and break-even status at the News into combined  profits of up to $100 million within five years.  </P> <P> Under the so-called joint operating agreement, which is set for 100 years, the  Free Press will publish mornings, the News afternoons, and jointly weekends.  The deal, which will split profits 55-45 to Gannett for five years and then  evenly, required a special exemption to antitrust laws under the 1970 Newspaper  Preservation Act and approval of the U.S. Attorney General's Office.  </P> <P> But after three years of legal wrangling and local outrage, even the response  on Wall Street seemed subdued.  </P> <P> "The termination of the loss helps Knight's earnings, and doesn't mean much to  Gannett, but in the future should add to both companies," said J. Kendrick  Noble Jr. of the New York brokerage Paine Webber.  </P> <P> "There is weak ad linage pretty much everywhere, but this provides some help in  an otherwise weakening outlook," said Edward J. Atorino of Salomon Bros., who  is less optimistic about the short-term prospects of newspaper stocks.  </P> <P> Gannett shares closed at $41.875 Monday, up 87.5 cents a share. Knight-Ridder  closed at $51.125, up 12.5 cents. Analysts said the stock prices already  largely reflected the expectation that the merger ultimately would be approved.  </P> <P> The subdued response may also be due to the bad blood stirred with the local  community and the legal miscalculations by the newspapers since Gannett bought  the News from its family owners in April, 1986, in a celebrated deal.  </P> <P> Two weeks later, it announced the proposed truce with Knight-Ridder.  </P> <P> The city was stunned. Since the News had only a slight edge in readers (and  roughly 60% of ad revenue), some local interests doubted that the Free Press  was really failing, as required under the 1970 law to win approval.  </P> <P> Many analysts expected that eventually the Free Press would prevail because it  was the dominant morning paper, the cycle that seemed most likely to grow.  </P> <P> The Times also learned that the two sides actually had discussed the merger  before Gannett bought the News, despite assertions by both sides to the  contrary.  </P> <P> And suspicions were raised about the weakness of the two papers, too, since  Gannett and Knight-Ridder are the nation's first- and second-largest newspaper  companies in circulation.  </P> <P> Gannett and Knight-Ridder wanted the deal to go through without a public  hearing, arguing that it was unnecessary and that delay would only hurt the  Free Press.  </P> <P> But over the next three years, Knight-Ridder's lawyers' expectations of what  would happen were often wrong, and by this year the worsening condition of the  Free Press was costing Knight-Ridder about 25 cents a share, or nearly $2  million a month.  </P> <P> In July, 1986, for instance, the antitrust division of the Justice Department  said the two companies had failed to prove that the merger was necessary and  ordered public hearings. They began a year later, a strange civic opera on the  economic vibrancy of Detroit, with the mayor and five labor unions contending  that the city could still support two papers.  </P> <P> The Free Press said it had lost $100 million in nine years, and Knight-Ridder  threatened to close the Free Press if the merger were disallowed.  </P> <P> But internal documents showed that the two papers had lost money, at least in  part, because each was engaged in a deliberate strategy to destroy the other,  forgoing profits now for a monopoly later.  </P> <P> The administrative law judge in the case disapproved the merger. If the two  papers tried, he said, they could both be profitable.  </P> <P> In August, 1988, outgoing Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III overturned the judge's  decision.  </P> <P> But just two days before the merger was to go into effect, a U.S. District  Court issued a restraining order freezing it.  </P> <P> The merger remained in legal limbo for another year, through two separate  District Court rulings and finally a hearing at the Supreme Court testing  Meese's decision.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court was expected to take months to write its opinion. The 4-to-4  vote, with Justice White recusing himself, made writing an opinion unnecessary.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Leslie Eringaard in Detroit contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMBINED NEWSPAPER OPERATIONS  </P> <P> Newspapers publishing under joint operating agreements:  </P> <P> City...Newspapers: Ownership, Circulation (as of 3/31/89) Year JOA  began-Renewal or expiration  </P> <P> </P> <P> Albuquerque, N.M....Albuquerque Journal: Independent, 119,400 (M) 154,646 (S)  (1933-2022)  </P> <P> ...Albuquerque Tribune: Scripps Howard, 40,636 (E)  </P> <P> El Paso...El Paso Times: Gannett, 61,641 (M) 98,104 (S) (1936-2015)  </P> <P> ...El Paso Herald-Post: Scripps Howard, 29,439 (E)  </P> <P> Nashville, Tenn....Tennessean: Gannett, 126,762 (M) 258,969 (S) (1937-2022)  </P> <P> ...Nashville Banner: Independent, 63,078 (E)  </P> <P> Evansville, Ind....Evansville Courier: Scripps Howard, 62,888 (M) 115,626 (S)  (1938-1998)  </P> <P> ...Evansville Press: Independent, 36,475 (E)  </P> <P> Tucson...Arizona Daily Star: Pulitzer Publ., 90,498 (M) 171,212 (S) (1940-2015)  </P> <P> ...Tucson Citizen: Gannett, 57,247 (E)  </P> <P> Tulsa, Okla....Tulsa World: Independent, 126,909 (M) 238,495 (S) (1941-1996)  </P> <P> ...Tulsa Tribune: Independent, 68,990 (E)  </P> <P> Ft.

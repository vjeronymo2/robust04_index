			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Balladur calls for EU action against 'unfair' trade The European Union should use its new-found unity over trade to push for protection against unfair foreign competition which is based on lower wages, currency rates and environmental standards, according to Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister. Speaking in a year-end interview with the Financial Times, which today names him its Man of the Year for 1993, Mr Balladur said: 'If we do not resolve these social, environmental and monetary problems, we will perforce have major distortions of competition and uprooting of companies' in western Europe. Mr Balladur, who showed himself ready to bring the Uruguay Round of the Gatt negotiations to the brink of failure before winning substantial concessions for France and its EU partners, said that Gatt demonstrated to Europeans that 'we're stronger together than if we were alone', but that 'it is important to know what you want'. 'All of us west Europeans . . . have lived since the Renaissance, or at least since the beginning of the colonial epoch, a bit like the rentiers (the privileged) of the world. This has enabled us to build up systems of social protection which are very necessary but very costly', he said. The big challenge for the EU, in addition to creating prosperity and stability in east Europe, was whether this could be preserved 'in a world in which competition has become so lively', Mr Balladur said. The French premier, who is now the front-runner - though undeclared candidate - for his country's 1995 presidential election, made clear France would try to use the new World Trade Organisation which Paris championed as a replacement for Gatt to restrain market forces. 'Can we (West Europeans) take it for granted that we will remain sufficient leaders in a sufficient number of sectors to survive - in the face of countries with populations infinitely larger than ours and with levels of social protection infinitely smaller?' he asked. 'I say we should leave this to the market, but only up to a certain point. What is the market? It is the law of the jungle, the law of nature. And what is civilisation? It is the struggle against nature.' Addressing the problem of record French unemployment, Mr Balladur said he had no intention of reducing France's relatively high minimum wage blamed by some economists for pricing the less-skilled out of jobs. Nor did he have any regrets about conceding to Air France strikers. He had decided that in loading disproportionate pay cuts on lower-paid airline staff, the plan (for bonus cuts and redundancies) was too unjust to be worth persevering with.

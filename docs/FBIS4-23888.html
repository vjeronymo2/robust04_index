			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A French delegation made up by Bernard Kouchner  and Gerard Larome was in Byumba yesterday, and held talks with  General Paul Kagame, commander in chief of the Rwandan Patriotic  Army [RPA]. At the end of the meeting, the French Government  representative, Mr. Larome, gave an interview to our colleagues,  (Innocent Huhito) and (Tito Mbasha). The Paris envoy begins the  interview by explaining the purpose of his mission:    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified  correspondent] You said that your mission was to see how to  assist orphans, and to meet with General Kagame. However, I  would like to ask you about France's present role -- what is the  exact role of France over the Rwandan issue?    [Larome] The first role is, as far as is possible, to press  the United Nations to intervene on a larger scale and in a more  consistent manner in Kigali, to stop the massacres of children,  women, and civilians, who have been killed with impunity.  Minister Juppe made a declaration yesterday in France, after  having agreed with his (?European counterparts), with Mr. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali of the United Nations, that we press for a rapid  intervention, if the need arises, under the aegis of the UN flag  in Kigali.    [Correspondent] With a humanitarian mission or intervention?    [Larome] The troops must first be on a completely  humanitarian mission, that is to say they should be able to  protect the people they are guarding and to supply them with the  food and drug convoys which we are already managing to bring to  Kigali, though under extremely difficult conditions.    [Correspondent] Is this in the framework of the United  Nations, or will it be at France's own initiative?    [Larome] The role of France on the present issue [word  indistinct] usual African partners, is to press the United  Nations to intervene in the most efficient manner possible. [end  recording]</p>

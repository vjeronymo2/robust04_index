			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PILOT SHOT IN CRASH TO GO TO PRISON  </P> <P> Thomas Root, the lawyer who was found to have suffered a gunshot wound after  his airplane crashed in the Atlantic Ocean, pleaded no contest Friday to 364  counts of securities fraud, conspiracy and related charges.  </P> <P> Under a plea bargain, Root agreed to a 15-year prison term and a $5,000 fine,  which will be imposed in January.  </P> <P> He agreed also to testify against others indicted in an alleged securities  scam.  </P> <P> The state dismissed 91 other charges against him.  </P> <P> Root, who faced up to 1,812 years in prison if convicted of all 455 charges,  called the agreement an "offer so attractive to me that I could not refuse it."  </P> <P> "I continue to suspect that my name was included in the indictment not because  of my culpability but rather because my notoriety from my ill-fated airplane  flight in July, 1989, ensured the prosecution of getting plenty of press  attention for the indictments," he said.  </P> <P> Root, 37, who is a Washington, D.C., lawyer, passed out in the cockpit of his  single-engine plane during a flight from Washington to Rocky Mount, N.C. The  plane, which was followed by military planes, eventually crashed in the ocean  off the coast of Florida.  </P> <P> Root was pulled from the ocean after the crash, and rescuers discovered that he  had been shot in the abdomen. Root has insisted that a pistol he kept in the  plane discharged during the crash, but experts have questioned his explanation  of the wound.  </P></p>

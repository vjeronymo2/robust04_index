			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gosta Karlsson: "Emissions Must Be Cut in Half"] </F>   [Text] Farmers in Scania and western Sweden can prepare  themselves for stricter environmental demands in order to reduce  nitrogen emissions from fertilizer handling. The requirements  are coming as part of the agreement by the North Sea nations to  reduce by half the leaking of nutrients into the sea by 1995.    The contribution by agriculture to the overfertilization of  the sea became a controversial subject on Wednesday [8 December]  at the ministerial meeting in Copenhagen on the nations' efforts  to restore the ecological balance in the North Sea.    England and France refused to join an agreement that by 1990  [as published] or no later than 1992 [as published] agriculture  must have switched to what is called balanced fertilization.    Exactly what such fertilization means has not been  specified,  but the purpose is to reduce the excess nutrient salts in the  sea to a minimum. This goal is in line with the European Union's  so-called nitrate directives, which take effect with the EEA  [European Economic Area] agreement.  <H5>  Overfertilization </H5>   As a foundation for the agreement in Copenhagen, each of the  eight North Sea nations has indicated which areas are most  sensitive to overfertilization. The excess nutrient salts cause  abnormal algae growth and disturbs the entire marine ecosystem.    England regards itself as not having any problems of  overfertilization at all along its coasts. As for the rest of  the North Sea, the British Government believes that it could be  a matter of "little bits here and there."    "We cannot sign a decision to solve a problem that does not  exist," said Deputy Agriculture Minister Earl Howe, who headed  the British delegation to the Copenhagen conference.    He also was not of the opinion that it has been  scientifically proven that leakage of nutrient salts and  pesticides from British agriculture can cross the North Sea and  affect other countries' marine areas.    France admits that there is a transitional problem to deal  with, but does not want to agree to a deadline for measures.  <H5>  Reactionaries </H5>   Sweden's Agriculture Minister Karl Erik Olsson tells DAGENS  NYHETER that on this point the British can only be described as  "stubborn reactionaries" in environmental cooperation.    Karl Erik Olsson believes that Sweden, for its part, has a  chance of being able to cut its nitrogen emissions in half by  1995 "or about then."    He reveals that he will shortly submit a proposal for  stricter environmental requirements for the way Swedish farmers  handle fertilizer.    "We must reduce emissions of ammonia to the air from  fertilizer plants as well as the handling of the fertilizer in  the fields. We can do this by, among other things, using better  spreaders for liquid fertilizer and by mixing it into the soil  faster."    The stricter requirements apply primarily to the farmers of  southern and western Sweden.    Since, according to Karl Erik Olsson, this will mean  expensive new investments by the farmer in new equipment, he  promises a generous transition period before new regulations  take effect.  <H5>  Strong Words </H5>   At the conclusion of the Copenhagen conference with a news  conference on Wednesday [8 December], Danish Environment  Minister Svend Auken in harsh words condemned "the refusal by  some large and prosperous industrial nations to deal with their  wastewater treatment."    One-third of all the wastewater flowing into the North Sea  is  untreated. Svend Auken did not mention any countries by name,  but it is well known that France, Belgium, and England are the  principal ones.    Their wastewater contains very large amounts of by and large  every environmental poison which affects the North Sea.

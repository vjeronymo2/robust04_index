			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Impacts on Utilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments addressed the Department's proposed analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of energy conservation standards on electric utilities. Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Defense Council stated that the utility analysis needs to consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that under the base cases, there will be less forecasting certainty than would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur under new and revised standards, and a greater probability that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilities would misforecast electricity demand. (Natural Resources Defense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council, No. 13 at 32). The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the utility analysis should consider the value of reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty in utility forecasts as a result of standards. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council gave references to a methodology. (Ohio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increased demand certainty after standards is an effect that was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> captured in the utility analysis. It results in substantial benefits to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric utilities, particularly when demand growth is rapid. These benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrue because demand growth is uncertain, and if the utility misforecasts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand, it may build too few or too many power plants. This risk of capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misallocation can be substantial in certain cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the appropriate measure of dollars to use in the utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact analysis, Natural Resources Defense Council stated that ``DOE needs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do the utility impact analysis in nominal dollar terms, using actual utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions for depreciation and rate of return. Utility rates and finances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are computed in nominal dollars, not real dollars, and this can have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dramatic impact on how new power plant construction will affect rates.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is true that utilities calculate rates in nominal dollar terms. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department, therefore, calculated utility impacts in both real and nominal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollars, in order to determine how adding an inflation factor would affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;549,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1990), Natural Resources Defense Council stated that utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion plans will need to be consistent with the Act, which will require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more controls as the demand for electricity grows. Appliance standards will,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all other things being held equal, make compliance with the Clean Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments less expensive for utilities, as it allows them to meet the cap on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions more easily. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32, 35).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The utility analysis and the environmental analysis are consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The Department collected forecasts of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of marketable permits for sulfur, estimates of the other effects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Air Act Amendments, and assessments of future utility generation by fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type. The Department assessed these estimates and assimilated them into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. (See Technical Support Document, Environmental Assessment, Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Florida Energy Office stated that capacity cost credit (for avoided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity) should not be limited to combustion turbines but should match the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> load characteristics of the subject appliance, categorized into peaking,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediate, and baseload groups. Air conditioners should be categorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to their load duration characteristics. (Florida Energy Office, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42, at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that load shape characteristics should be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an assessment of air conditioner (and other appliances) avoided peak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand. The current utility analysis accounted for these effects. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department investigated separating energy savings into peaking, intermediate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and baseload categories, to determine if this would have a significant effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the results. The utility analysis assumed a combustion turbine proxy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which values all peak demand savings at the cost of a combustion turbine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is the most widely used approach by U.S. utilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council stated that the utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis should consider transmission and distribution capacity savings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that transmission and distribution capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings should be included in the utility analysis, and did include them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Avoided transmission and distribution costs were based on the value assigned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this avoided transmission and distribution capacity by many different U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commentators stated that off-peak water heaters (those that heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water only during off-peak hours) save energy, and that this should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the utility analysis. (National Regional Electric Cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association, No. 17 at 1; Vaughn Manufacturing Company, No. 75 at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Department notes that where utilities offer time-of-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates, the economics of off-peak water heating change dramatically and may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very attractive. However, the Department does not have the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require utilities to offer such rates, and believes the lack of these rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offered nation-wide precludes consideration of off-peak water heaters in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments discussed the impacts of appliance conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards on natural gas utilities. The Washington Gas Light, Inc. urged the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department to dedicate a similar level of analytical effort to the utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost consequences of standards on natural gas appliances as it devotes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts on electric utilities from standards on electric appliances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Washington Gas Light, Inc., No. 37 at 12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department initially studied the potential impacts of standards on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric utilities and not natural gas utilities because there were more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abundant data on the former. Furthermore, significantly more residential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy consumption is electricity rather than natural gas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

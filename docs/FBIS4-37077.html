			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- Leader of the opposition, Mian Nawaz  Sharif has said that the budget presented by the Benazir  government has put the poor people in a fix. At the same time  he criticised the government for nominal increase in the defence  budget.    "Indians are building missiles and our government is  oblivious of the country's defence needs", he said while  commenting on the federal budget Thursday in his chamber. He  said he would make a substantive comment on the budget in his  speech in the National Assembly. "However my initial impression  is that the budget has broken the back of poor people." he said.    He said he did not find a single word for the poor in the  finance minister's budget speech. He said that increase in the  gas prices would result in increase of prices of every commodity.    About the 35 per cent increase in the salary of government  servants, he said that it was good. But added that what would  happen to the ordinary labourer and to the people who were not  government servants. He said government had proposed no  programme for their well-being.    Nawaz Sharif lamented that the new budget offered no relief  to the poor. He said that after going through the budget, his  initial reaction was that the government had no economic agenda  of its own. "They are carrying on the policies of my  government", he said.    He said there was no substantive increase in the defence  budget despite the fact that Indian missile programme posed a  serious threat to country's security, demanding more vigilance  and military hardware for defence.    He said unfortunately Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in her  speech to the nation Wednesday said that the armed forces had  agreed to the proposal of no increase in the defence budget. He  said that the government should have voluntarily increased the  defence budget. "Our armed forces are not of such character that  they would come to Benazir Bhutto and would bet for increase in  the defence budget". He lamented that the government was  oblivious to the defence needs of the country. He said that the  prime minister should have realised the need for increase in the  defence budget.    He said that he would make a substantive comment on the  budget in his forthcoming speech.    However, the secretary general of PML (N) [Pakistan Muslim  League -- Nawaz], Sartaj Aziz said that the budget contained a  very heavy dose of taxation. He said that the taxation is of  indirect nature, burden of which would be borne by the common  people.    APP adds: Sartaj AZiz said that there was no "new  initiative" by the government in the budget. He said tax net  had been extremely widened that would adversely affect the  common man.    He said there had been increase in inflation, the budget  deficit had been brought down marginally as compared to last  year budget and there was no development programme. He said  bulk of the new taxation was on common man. "Never in the  history of the country poors were burdened with such a heavy  taxation." he added.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Talks about the Indonesian-Malaysian dispute over  the Sipadan-Ligitan Islands have registered new results. For the  first time, the second meeting of the Joint Working Group (JWG)  approved the issuance of a joint statement saying, among other  things, that a third JWG meeting would take place in Indonesia  in May. It was revealed in the joint statement that the two  sides had agreed to solve the dispute on the basis of  international legal principles. "Included are relevant treaties,  conventions, and understandings which involve the two sides,"  the statement said.    According to a report filed from Kuala Lumpur by KOMPAS  reporter Budiarto Shambazy, the second meeting was still  dominated by a process of "reciprocal legal testing," i.e.,  claiming Sipadan-Ligitan through the study of various documents.  By studying discussions of this type, it would seem that future  discussions will also continue at the level of an exchange of  documents and of each side's response to the legal evidence  presented.    In fact, the two sides are still discussing--or in the  spirit  of ASEAN "consulting"--scores of documents to strengthen their  claim of sovereignty over Sipadan-Ligitan. There is still no  absolute certainty over who really has the rights to  Sipadan-Ligitan, even though de facto Malaysia occupies Sipadan  Island and has developed tourism there.    At this second meeting Malaysia offered its responses or  answers to the legal claims presented by Indonesia at the first  meeting held in Jakarta in 1992. After this meeting in Kuala  Lumpur, Malaysia will be seeking additional documentation to be  presented at the third meeting to be held in Indonesia in May.    "We submitted (the documents) in 1992 and we're only getting  an answer now. Of course they're looking for additional  documents to strengthen their position. We are also looking for  new documents to strengthen (our claim)," said Izhar Ibrahim,  delegation chairman (political director general of the  Department of Foreign Affairs), who was accompanied by Hasyim  Djalal, deputy chairman of the delegation.    Neither of the two chairmen was willing to reveal what is in  the documents, estimated to be more than 50 in number, presented  by the two sides to legitimate their rights to Sipadan-Ligitan.  Both Izhar and the Chairman of the Malaysian Delegation Kamil  Jaafar (secretary general of the Department of Foreign Affairs)  repeatedly said that it was too soon to reveal what is in the  documents.    "We have made every effort and we have reached the maximum  possible results, especially since we have agreed on a joint  press statement. This is as far we progressed at this meeting.  Each side has also presented a number of new documents, treaties  and arguments to strengthen its claim for sovereignty over  Sipadan-Ligitan," said Izhar.    In broad outline, Indonesia considers that Sipadan-Ligitan  is  within the area of national sovereignty because it was within  the area under Dutch colonial control. Whereas Malaysia believes  that the Dutch handed the two islands over to the British, who  colonized Malaysia. Each side's claim is also based on where the  border is drawn in the area, about which there is a difference  of interpretation.    Based on a 1969 agreement, the two countries agreed, but did  not sign a written agreement, to the principle of the status quo  of the two islands. The dispute arose when Malaysia violated the  status quo by building tourist facilities under private  management on Sipadan Island.    According to several KOMPAS sources, Indonesia has actually  requested that the dispute be settled through the International  Court. But Malaysia disagreed with the idea of  internationalizing the issue, preferring to carry out bilateral  talks.    "(The talks) are bilateral; we're not thinking yet about  internationalization," said Izhar, in response to questions  about the "internationalization" of the dispute.    Another important result which Izhar said was also reached  was an agreement to meet more often and to solve the dispute as  quickly as possible. "Both sides want to solve this issue as  quickly as possible. We will hold meetings more often," said  Izhar.    Izhar gave an evasive reply to the question of whether the  Indonesian delegation had reached its goal at the meetings this  time. "I can't say we reached the goal, but we tried as hard as  we could," he said. Referring to Indonesia's position at the end  of the second meeting, Izhar said, "Of course we're in a  stronger position. But I can't state what it is yet. We haven't  finished collecting all the documents."    After the meetings were over, on Friday afternoon (28  January) Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas took the  opportunity to stop at Subang Airport (Kuala Lumpur) to listen  to a report from the Indonesian delegation. Alatas received  Izhar, Hasyim, Sudarmadi (the Indonesian ambassador in Kuala  Lumpur) and several other delegates in the VIP room of the  airport for an hour.    In the meantime, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas told  reporters at Sukarno-Hatta Airport on Friday (28 January) that  the Sipadan-Ligitan dispute would not end in a dead-lock. Even  though it has not yet moved beyond the stage of studying each  other's data and documents, the two countries have agreed to  solve the problem in an amicable way. He admitted that the  problem requires expertise and time. Nevertheless, he said that  Malaysia had presented its response to the dispute.    In response to questions from reporters, Alatas said that  Malaysia had given its response. In order to discuss the  dispute, on his trip from Yemen to Jakarta via Kuala Lumpur,  Alatas received the response in the form of a report prepared by  the Indonesian team, which is "battling" in Kuala Lumpur under  the leadership of Drs Izhar Ibrahim, director general for  political issues of the Department of Foreign Affairs.    He said that at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia had  handed over documents to strengthen their position on Sipadan  and Ligitan. Indonesia did the same. Alatas said that at the  meeting Malaysia had presented its response on the basis of the  existing documents. However, the process will continue. In the  near future, around May 1994, a high-level meeting (SOM) will  take place. Alatas did not state Malaysia's response to  Indonesia in a definite way.    In response to the steps that Malaysia has begun to take to  occupy the two islands, Alatas emphasized that Indonesia and  Malaysia have very friendly relations now. That is why steps  that might invite a physical risk should not be taken.    "Should we send in our troops and throw them out? How could  we do that, no way we can do that, we don't live in times like  that any more, we're friends. We have many interests in common  with Malaysia. This is a problem, and we're going to solve it,  but in an amicable way. We're in ASEAN together," he asserted.    In response to a question about a possible solution to the  Sipadan-Ligitan dispute, Alatas said that at this stage  Indonesia and Malaysia had not yet moved away from studying the  documentation and the Indonesian and Malaysian legal positions.  This part of the process is not over yet and would continue. He  said that Malaysia really has a different position on the issue  and that is why we have to understand that Malaysia is  presenting different documents. In this respect, Indonesia will  continue to look into the best possible way to solve the problem.    At one point Malaysia, through Deputy Prime Minister Ghafar  Baba (KOMPAS 23 December 1992) did ask Indonesia to relinquish  its claim. He said that Indonesia will not lose anything if it  gives up the two islands because it has thousands of other  islands. However, on that occasion officials of the Department  of Foreign Affairs said that it is not just a matter of an  island but that it also involves national sovereignty.</p>

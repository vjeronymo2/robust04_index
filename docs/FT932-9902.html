			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Quebec nationalists fight to retain French-only law FRENCH-speaking nationalists in Quebec are seeking to mount a campaign against proposed relaxations of the province's French-only language law. Premier Robert Bourassa's Liberal government has tabled legislation which would overturn a 15-year ban on the use of English on outdoor commercial signs, and abolish the Commission de Protection de la Langue Francaise, nicknamed the 'language police'. The draft legislation, known as Bill 86, also makes modest concessions on the use of English and other languages in education by exempting some immigrants from attending French schools and allowing English immersion classes at French schools. Bilingual signs and immigrants' language rights are sensitive political issues in Quebec. Nationalists are expected to depict the latest proposals as further evidence of the threat to their island of French culture in English-speaking North America. About 80 per cent of Quebec's 7m residents are French-speaking. The fuss over Bill 86 is not expected to have a lasting impact. The Liberals have a large majority in the national assembly, and Mr Bourassa's popularity is high following a successful battle against skin cancer earlier this year. Bill 86 is likely to be on the statute book by the end of June, well ahead of the campaign for the next provincial election, which must take place before autumn 1994. Meanwhile, support appears to be waning for the Bloc Quebecois, the federal wing of the separatist Parti Quebecois. Judging by recent opinion polls, the BQ will capture no more than 25-30 seats - and possibly fewer - in the countrywide general election later this year. Mr Robert Keaton, president of Alliance Quebec, which represents the interests of the province's anglophone community, said that Bill 86 'sends a positive message that there's a legitimate place for the English-speaking community in Quebec.'</p>

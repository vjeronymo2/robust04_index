			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Bentsen warns of US-Japan trade deal review Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, warned yesterday that his country would have to re-examine the basis of its bilateral trade agreements with Japan if negotiations failed to make substantial progress by next month. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, is to meet President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. Mr Bentsen refused to spell out what the re-examination might entail. But his statement shows that the US has no intention of letting up pressure on the embattled Japanese government, which has had to defer other business while it attempts to reach a compromise with the opposition on political reform. 'I do not mean (the re-examination) to be a threat. But we are just facing the realities of the situation,' Mr Bentsen said yesterday after meeting Mr Hosokawa and Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister. He said the discussion had been 'very candid'. The US wants Japan to open its market to greater imports and to take measures to reduce the country's record Dollars 120bn-a-year trade surplus. Mr Bentsen said: 'Japan is out of step. It has the lowest penetration of manufactured imports, and it has the lowest foreign investment levels among the major nations.' The negotiations' sticking point appears to be the creation of indicators to ensure that any agreements are properly implemented. The Japanese fear that any objective criteria would form a commitment to set aside certain market shares to overseas companies. Mr Bentsen said: 'From our perspective, we would far prefer no agreements to weak agreements. They would have to include indicators to show we are making progress.' Mr Bentsen also called for a sustained and strong fiscal stimulus by the government. He said Japan had promised in the past to do what was necessary to achieve strong domestic demand-led growth and a highly significant reduction in its current account imbalance. In theory a domestic recovery would draw in imports. 'If you look at the figures, that hasn't happened yet. In addition, the forecasts are not very encouraging,' he said. Mr Fujii had agreed it was not in the interests of Japan or the rest of the world for Japan to have such a large trading surplus, Mr Bentsen said. The finance minister yesterday promised serious and vigorous efforts to launch a new stimulus package, including tax cuts to spur domestic demand. LDP aid sought for reform plan, Page 4</p>

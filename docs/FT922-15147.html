			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Rise in complaints about government departments COMPLAINTS by the public about their treatment by government departments and official bodies have increased sharply in spite of the Citizen's Charter, which aims to improve the quality of public services, according to a report by Mr William Reid, the parliamentary ombudsman. A total of 801 complaints were made about maladministration last year, 13.7 more than the previous year and the highest number since 1984. More than a quarter of complaints were about the Department of Social Security, with 16 per cent about the Inland Revenue. The number of investigations last year - up 29 per cent to 215 - rose much faster than the number of complaints. The ombudsman found that 90 per cent of complaints were partly or wholly justified, in line with previous years. Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration Annual Report 1991. HMSO. Pounds 12.50.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Quest for a strategy to match Hollywood  -The media Those struggling to create a strong European audio-visual industry face an uncomfortable fact: across Europe, audiences still often prefer the entertainment offered by Hollywood. Even in France, where paranoia about US 'cultural imperialism' seems rampant, consumers continue to vote with their feet at the box office. Although the most popular film in France last year was Les Visiteurs, a satire, it was one of only two French films to reach the top 10. In its first 11 weeks, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park sold 1.23m tickets in the Paris region alone. The US industry's dominance is based on the economies that flow from its scale of production and the fact that costs can be recouped in the domestic market before being exported. By comparison, Europe is fragmented by language, tradition and differing attitudes to commercial broadcasting. Many European countries have only recently developed commercial channels alongside older public service broadcasters. In the past decade, for instance, the number of commercial television channels in Europe has risen from only four to more than 60 - though the number is likely to grow with the launch of channels financed by advertising in eastern Europe. In some major European markets, commercial production skills are still not fully developed. Mr Manfred Lahnstein, president of the electronic media division of Bertelsmann, the German media group, says the German television industry still finds the production disciplines needed to turn out 30 minutes of a soap opera every day difficult. 'The advantage of the Anglo-Saxon world is that they had private television so much earlier than the continental Europeans,' he says. Even so, German television has been changed profoundly by private broadcasters such as RTL, in which Bertelsmann has a 39 per cent stake. After 10 years in existence, RTL has finally taken a lead in the ratings over both ARD and ZDF, the main German public networks. Yet many of the big commercial broadcasters such as TF1, France's privatised first channel, CLT of Luxembourg and Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest remain net importers of programmes from the US. Moreover, individual markets are at different stages of development in the new media. Cable and satellite, are well established in the UK and Germany but hardly at all in Italy. The pan-European market is still in its infancy, although a growing number of satellite channels are broadcasting to a continental market. Varying strategies are being pursued by European governments and media groups to compete more effectively with the Americans. Several governments, such as France and the UK, are moving to reduce barriers preventing broadcasting organisations becoming larger. It is, however, hard to see this process producing more European media groups on a world scale. There have been no television or film equivalents so far of the merger of Reed International and Elsevier in the publishing and information business.

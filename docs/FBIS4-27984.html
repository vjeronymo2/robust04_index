			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 7 KYODO -- The Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is opening its  two-day ministerial council meeting at its headquarters in Paris  on Tuesday [7 Jun].    The main items on this year's agenda include ways to improve  the economy and measures to increase employment within the  group, as well as strengthening multilateral trade systems.    With the total number of unemployed within the group topping  35 million, discussions will focus on promoting structural  changes in industries and creating new business opportunities to  increase new jobs, according to meeting sources.    Jean-Claude Paye, secretary general of the organization, is  expected to issue a special statement after the meeting to urge  members to job-creation programs within two years, the sources  said.    On trade matters, the OECD will call for early ratification  of the Uruguay Round trade accord which was completed last  December after seven years of negotiations under the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The participants will then discuss trade issues outstanding  after the Uruguay Round, the sources said. The issues concern  relationships between trade and five other areas -- the  environment, competition, labor standards, investment and  regionalism.    With Mexico participating as the OECD's newest member, the  Paris-based group now gathers ministers and representatives from  25 nations in the world.    On the second day of the meeting, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev will be invited to sign the first agreement on  economic assistance, the sources said.    Japan has sent Nobuo Matsunaga, the government's  representative for external affairs, to the meeting. Schedules  of the Diet sessions prevented a minister from being sent. It  is the first time in 27 years that Japan has not sent a minister  to an OECD meeting.    According to Japanese trade sources, Matsunaga is expected  to  meet with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is also  attending the OECD meeting, to discuss schedules for the ongoing  Japan-U.S. trade framework talks.    A meeting set initially between Matsunaga and U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher has been canceled, they said.</p>

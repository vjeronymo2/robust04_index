			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Floor/Wall/Equipment Exterior Cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities clean the equipment exteriors and floors for general housekeeping purposes and to keep sources of product contamination to a minimum. When water is used, these cleaning procedures become a source of wastewater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Equipment exteriors and floor areas of dry formulating and packaging lines are typically cleaned without the use of water. Vacuuming, scraping, and other mechanical means are used to clean the areas around these lines. Floors and equipment exteriors associated with liquid lines, and occasionally dry lines when an especially thorough cleaning is desired, are rinsed with water (or an aqueous-based cleaning solution, or possibly an organic solvent to clean equipment exteriors). While some facilities routinely clean equipment exteriors and floors, or do so at all changeovers between certain products, many facilities have indicated that equipment exterior and floor cleanings are performed only when required through visual inspections by the operators or facility management. Walls around formulating and packaging lines appear to be cleaned infrequently. Therefore, wastewater from such cleaning is rarely generated. The quantity of water used annually for equipment exterior or floor cleaning varies widely from facility to facility, from several gallons to thousands of gallons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This wastewater source can be minimized through the use of high-pressure, low-volume washers. Facilities have noted that attaching spray nozzles or other devices to prevent the free flow of water from unattended hoses has reduced water use. Additionally, steam cleaning of equipment exteriors is practiced at some facilities to reduce the amount of wastewater generated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has identified some facilities that wipe the exterior using rags, or use a solvent cleaner, such as a commercially available stainless steel cleaner. This avoids the generation of a wastewater stream, but creates a solid waste which, depending on the ingredients involved, could be considered a hazardous waste. Squeegees are also used to clean equipment exteriors and floors, and are not disposed after single uses. It may be possible to dedicate squeegees to a certain line or piece of equipment, but the use of squeegees may still require some water. Automated floor scrubbers are also employed at some facilities in place of hosing down floors. Mopping with a single bucket of water can also be employed in place of hosing. Floor mopping can generate as little as 10 gallons of water per cleaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has been to a number of facilities where their floor wash water is reused with and without filtering. One facility has set up its production equipment on a steel grated, mezzanine platform directly above a collection sump. Following production, the equipment and the floor of the platform, on which the operator stands when formulating product, are rinsed down and the water is allowed to drip into the sump. A pump and a filter have been installed in the sump area to enable the operator to transfer this rinsate back into the formulation tank the next time he is ready to formulate. This sump is also connected to floor trenches in the packaging area for the same product. When the exterior of the packaging equipment and the floors in this area are rinsed, this water is directed to the trenches and eventually ends up in the collection sump for reuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the Agency's opinion that wastewater generated from floor and equipment cleaning can be best reduced by: (1) Sweeping the area before rinsing; (2) cleaning on visual inspection rather than routine/daily cleaning; (3) using a floor scrubbing machine or a mop and a bucket to clean the floors; and (4) using a high pressure, low volume hose with a spray nozzle or a steam cleaning machine to clean equipment exteriors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Leaks and Spills  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Leaks and spills occur during the normal course of formulating and packaging operations. Leaks originate at hose connections or valves. Spills of raw materials occur from failures of bulk storage tanks and/or during transfer of raw materials between vessels. Product spills can occur during storage in bulk storage tanks and/or during packaging, including overfilling containers, missing the container to be filled, or tipping of filled containers before capping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leaks can be reduced by preventive maintenance such as checking equipment and connections before use or on a regular basis, while good housekeeping procedures like keeping work areas uncluttered can help in the prevention of spills. Simple preventative measures such as placing drip pans under areas where leaks and spills are likely to occur can either eliminate or minimize the quantity of water required for many types of cleanups. Leaks and spills of dry products can be vacuumed or swept without generating any wastewater. Liquid leaks and spills can be collected into a trench or sump (for reuse, discharge, or disposal) with a squeegee, leaving only a residue to be mopped or hosed down if further water cleanup is required. Liquid leaks and spills can also be cleaned up using absorbent material, such as absorbent pads or soda ash. For an acidic product, the use of soda ash or a similar base material will also serve to neutralize the spill. If a residue remains, some water may be used for mopping or hosing the area down, but methods to reduce floor wash should be implemented whenever possible. EPA has observed that many facilities cleanup liquid leaks and spills from water-based products with water and reuse the wastewater in product formulation. On the other hand the facilities generally cleanup liquid leaks and spills from solvent-based products with absorbent materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Direct reuse of materials from leaks and spills is another possible pollution prevention technique. If drip pans or other containers are used to catch leaks and spills, the material can be immediately reused in the product being formulated or packaged, or stored for use in the next product batch. Collection hoppers or tubs can be installed beneath packaging fillers to capture spills and immediately direct the spills back to the fillers. Leaks or spills around bulk storage tanks and dispensing areas can be contained by dikes, which, in fact, are often required by state regulations. (EPA recently proposed a federal regulation for containment structures at agricultural refilling establishments and at certain other facilities (see 59 FR 6712, February 11, 1994).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Air Pollution or Odor Control Scrubbers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some PFPR facilities employ wet scrubbers to reduce air emissions from PFPR operations. Facilities that also perform non-PFPR operations may employ scrubbers that are not specific to PFPR operations, but instead serve the general facility. Scrubbers can be operated with continuously recycled water until replacement of the contaminated water is necessary (as practiced by one of the facilities visited) or they can be operated with a bleed steam (blowdown) on a continuous basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many PFPR facilities employ dry air pollution control equipment, such as carbon filters and baghouses, thus accomplishing air pollution reduction without generating wastewater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some facilities may only need a wet scrubber on one particular process (i.e., a dedicated scrubber). These facilities have been able to use the scrubber blowdown or changed-out scrubber water as make-up water in the formulation of that particular product. Some facilities with non-dedicated scrubbers have been able to use the scrubber blowdown or changed-out scrubber water for floor or equipment exterior cleaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Safety Equipment Cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most PFPR facilities employ the use of safety equipment, including safety showers and eye washes, gloves, respirators, and rubber boots to protect individuals from the dangers associated with some raw materials and the production of PFPR products. Wastewater is generated from routine checks of safety showers, routine flushes of eye wash stations (to ensure the station is clean and operable), and rinsing of boots, gloves, and respirators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quantities of contaminated wastewater generated from safety equipment cleaning are generally on the order of several gallons or tens of gallons. Some facilities are successful in avoiding the generation of this type of wastewater by using disposable safety clothing (gloves, dust masks). This practice does result in a solid and possibly even hazardous waste stream, thus it does not prevent pollution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Laboratory Equipment Cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many PFPR facilities operate on-site laboratories for conducting quality control (QC) tests of raw materials and formulated products. Wastewater is generated from these tests and from cleaning glassware used in the tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Under the protocol which has been adopted, no person will be  expelled or banned from entering to the country which he is a  citizen. In addition, the protocol bans the mass expulsion of  foreigners from the country.    The protocol ensures that everyone who is living legally in  a  country is entitled to circulate, choose his residence, or leave  the country, freely.    These rights can not be restricted unless they threaten  national unity, public order, and the freedoms and rights of  others.</p>

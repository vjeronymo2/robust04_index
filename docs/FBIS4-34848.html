			<p>BFN     [Text] Regional technocrats are expected to attend a  meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, to finalize the draft proposal on  an Association of Caribbean States, ACS. It is an attempt to  expand Caricom's [Caribbean Community] reach in the region. The  draft is to be presented to regional leaders at the heads of  government conference in Barbados next month. The ACS is to  bring together Caricom member states with non-English speaking  Caribbean territories and their neighbors on the South and  Central American mainland. Trinidadian foreign affairs  officials say there is consensus on the main aims and objectives  of the ACS, but the Caracas meeting will tackle outstanding  issues, such as membership and the administrative structure of  the association. The ACS was one of the recommendations put  forward by the West Indian Commission. Nicole Huggins tells us  more:    [Begin Huggins recording] The formation of an Association of  Caribbean States was recommended as a means of expanding the  trading options of Caricom states, and also as a way of  inserting Caricom into the evolving hemispheric bloc. Local  foreign affairs officials seem to believe that the leaders of  the countries involved have the political will to bring the idea  to reality. Three meetings have been held this year in Jamaica,  Dominica, and Mexico. The final meeting on the draft proposal is  carded for Caracas.    There seems to be consensus on the main aims and objectives  of the ACS: the creation of a larger area for economic  relations, foreign policy coordination, and technical  cooperation. But key issues such as the size, structure, and  location of a secretariat are still to be worked out. A method  of funding the ACS is yet to be defined, and in a region  encompassing independent and nonindependent territories,  membership procedures are still being discussed.    One major departure from the Caricom Treaty is for ACS  members to have greater flexibility in choosing to be part of an  ACS project. This differs significantly from the Caricom Treaty,  which requires all member states to agree for almost anything to  be attempted.    If the ACS gets off the ground, it could be the vehicle for  which Caricom countries have been looking to bring their small  economies closer to those of their larger Caribbean and Latin  American neighbors. But with that comes a challenge, according  to some regional experts, to ensure that Caricom is not  swallowed up by its own creation. [end recording]</p>

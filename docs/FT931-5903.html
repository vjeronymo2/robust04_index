			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Ruhe wants brake on EFA development MR VOLKER RUHE, German defence minister, yesterday called for more drastic measures to slow down the development programme of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), accusing the aerospace industry of inflexibility in negotiating savings. He announced new measures to submit all spending on the project, jointly carried out with Britain, Italy and Spain, to a new financial control group in his ministry, saying that plans had previously not been controlled closely enough. At the same time he admitted he no longer had adequate funds in his budget to maintain spending at the current rate on the development programme, and called for the timetable to be extended by two years. The four aerospace contractors have submitted their proposals on reducing the costs of the fighter aircraft, and stretching out the production programme, in line with a deal agreed by the defence ministers last December. What Mr Ruhe now wants, however, appears to be a more drastic slowdown in the immediate future, possibly requiring lay-offs of research and engineering personnel involved in the project. Mr Ruhe was seeking to defend himself in the German parliament against attacks on two fronts: from supporters of the EFA project in his own government, who say he has been irresponsible in axing too much money from the development programme in the current year; and from opponents of the scheme who want the project scrapped. He was called to give evidence to the Bundestag defence committee after it became apparent that the DM520m (Pounds 220.3m) set aside for EFA development in 1993 would run out, probably by April. The original allocation of DM820m was cut by DM300m in a late round of budget cuts, since when it emerged that another DM180m had to be paid for uncovered spending in 1992. The DM340m left for EFA in the current budget is estimated to be DM600m short of the likely spending by Deutsche Aerospace, the principal contractor in Germany. The other companies involved are British Aerospace in the UK, Alenia in Italy, and Casa in Spain. Mr Ruhe said the lack of flexibility shown by the aerospace industry, and the expectations for spending which went far beyond the budget approved by the Bundestag, would endanger the future of the project. Anyone who wanted to see the project succeed 'must be ready to hold back in 1993 and 1994, the most difficult years in the (German) unification process.' He said Germany remained committed to spending DM5.85bn on the development phase.</p>

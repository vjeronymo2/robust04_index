			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINALLY, THEY REMEMBERED THE PUEBLO  </P> <P> A modest ceremony in San Diego the other day finally produced a small measure  of recompense for one of the more conspicuously shameful episodes of post-World  War II military injustice. Retired Comdr. Lloyd (Pete) Bucher and the crew  members of the intelligence ship Pueblo were officially recognized as having  been prisoners of war, 22 years after their capture by North Korea. The medals  given the men had been specifically ordered by Congress, even though the Navy  -- institutionally as self-protective as always in the Pueblo matter -- had  fought to block them.  </P> <P> The medals were not a gift, nor a courtesy, nor a favor. They had been paid for  in blood, pain and humiliation over 335 days of brutal captivity. But the  ordeal of the captain and crew of the Pueblo did not end when finally they were  freed by their tormentors. Instead began a new ordeal, psychologically callous  and morally unconscionable, which saw men who had heroically kept faith with  their country and with themselves blamed forothers' failures.  </P> <P> For what the Navy tried to do was hold Bucher and some in his crew almost  solely at fault for the seizure of the Pueblo, the loss of much of its secret  equipment, even for their own suffering. Yet, as the record soon revealed, the  Navy had only itself to blame for what occurred. The onus for its capture fell  not on the Pueblo, but on those in higher authority whose unforgiveable  succession of near-criminal blunders had placed the ship in harm's way.  </P> <P> The Pueblo, an old World War II Army cargo carrier, was not the vessel to send  on a spying mission in the international waters off North Korea. Badly  outfitted, it could neither fight nor run from attackers and lacked even the  means to prevent its secret equipment from falling into enemy hands. Bucher had  spotted these deficiencies before the Pueblo sailed. His requests to have them  remedied were repeatedly turned down.  </P> <P> In 1969 a Navy court of inquiry, eager to blame an individual and so spare the  institution, recommended that Bucher be tried, among other things for failure  to resist the seizure of his ship. The Navy secretary wisely ruled that no  disciplinary action would be taken against any member of the Pueblo's crew.  Yet, for 21 years, the official Navy attitude -- scapegoating Bucher and his  men -- remained unchanged. Now amends of a sort have been made, official  apologies have been tendered. Far too late, and with utter inadequacy, the crew  of the Pueblo has at long last been welcomed home.  </P></p>

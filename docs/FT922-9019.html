			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK government plans property deal to aid O&amp;Y THE UK government and Olympia &amp; York are at an advanced stage in talks on a multi-million-pound property deal which would help rescue the troubled developer. The deal would involve the government taking 500,000 square feet of space at O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf development in East London, in return for a commitment from the company that it will make its Pounds 400m contribution to the costs of extending the capital's Jubilee underground line. Talks between Toronto-based O&amp;Y and the government were already taking place before the company ran into financial difficulties two months ago with debts of Dollars 12bn. However, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has accelerated the negotiations in the hope that they will help to stabilise the company's financial position. Meanwhile, in a move to reassure its creditors, O&amp;Y disclosed yesterday that it had placed shares pledged as collateral on a Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan in the custody of a Canadian bank. The shares represent O&amp;Y's 82 per cent interest in Abitibi-Price, the newsprint producer, and its 75 per cent stake in Gulf Canada Resources, an oil and gas producer. O&amp;Y said the move was to give creditors 'a level of confidence'. A deal with the government on the space at Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest property development, is unlikely to be finalised for a few weeks. But sources close to the talks said that the Department of Trade and Industry under Mr Heseltine and the Department of Environment, his previous department, were both expected to take space. Under the proposal thousands of civil servants would move to London's Docklands, though ministers would remain in Whitehall and Westminster. If the deal is clinched, that should help O&amp;Y to refinance individual Canary Wharf buildings, which in turn would provide it with the funds for its contribution to extending the Jubilee line into London's Docklands. The 11 lenders to the Pounds 3bn Canary Wharf project yesterday agreed to provide O&amp;Y with Pounds 21m of new borrowings to meet its expenses for the rest of May. The money was provided only after extreme pressure was put on Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which was threatening to put the Docklands project into administration under UK insolvency procedures by withholding its share of the new money. In a series of meetings with its 15 principal bank creditors over the past two days, O&amp;Y has outlined its five-year financing requirements. It wants a Pounds 300m revolving credit facility to complete phases one and two of Canary Wharf. However, the Canary Wharf banks said yesterday they were unhappy that a substantial portion of this Pounds 300m was being raised for the sole purpose of allowing O&amp;Y to pay them the interest they are owed. They say they would rather have O&amp;Y shares in place of cash interest, which is what the parent company's banks have been offered. The Canary Wharf lenders are, however, being offered shares in Canary Wharf itself. But one banker said yesterday that 'at the moment these are worth nothing'. On the other hand, the parent company bank group, which is owed Dollars 4bn and is being offered O&amp;Y 'B' class non-voting shares, yesterday complained about the absence of voting rights on these shares. The main element in this Dollars 4bn is the Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan. O&amp;Y has shocked the providers of this jumbo loan by telling them that its cash flow over the coming five years will only cover between 40 and 50 per cent of the interest due on the loan. So the lenders may have to receive the remainder in the form of shares. Banks in general said that the latest refinancing proposals from O&amp;Y, presented on Thursday, were a big improvement on what was offered three weeks ago and could serve as the basis for further negotiations.</p>

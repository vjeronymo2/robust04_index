At the headquarters of the employers'  federation in Rome's exhibition center area Chairman Luigi Abete  was presiding over a meeting of the Council, Confindustria's  parliament.    Berlusconi should have been there, too, being a member. But  Forza Italia's leader was busy with his election campaign.    Almost deliberately, he happened to be just a few kilometers  away, on a visit to another professional organization,  Confartigianato [General Confederation of Italian Artisans and  Craftsmen], which is often in dispute with big industry. On via  dell' Astronomia industrialists discussed the delicate political  situation and the prospects of economic recovery. On via San  Giovanni in Laterano Berlusconi snubbed them, and attacked them.    "I do not often visit Confindustria," he told artisans,  whose  vote he is seeking. "I am a member of the Council, but I do not  go there gladly because I do not like to sit down with people I  do not like. They breathe a rarefied air there, not that of the  trenches, of work. Furthermore, I have always had the  impression that the people sent to work for Confindustria are  the ones better not left to work in the factories. Those fine  people often have other things to do...."    After the Council meeting finished Abete gave a press  conference. Reports of Berlusconi's remarks had not yet arrived.  Asked to make a statement about Fininvest's legal troubles, the  chairman replied diplomatically: "We must ask magistrates to  abide by the rules and we must have confidence in the quality of  their conduct. Citizens' rights must be protected in a modern  society that does not want to be medieval and that wants to have  confidence in justice."    Abete also sought a complex equilibrium in connection with  political issues: Confindustria is not siding with any of the  alignments, and is indeed "disappointed" with an election  campaign that everyone is conducting by dint of slogans,  completely ignoring matters of policy.    If no clear majority emerges from the elections, better a  transitional government that will complete the electoral law  than the labored continuation of the legislature. The press  conference was over.    But a few minutes later the news agencies reported the  remarks just made by Forza Italia's leader. Abete was surprised  and resentful: Berlusconi's statements seemed offensive to  Confindustria and are doubly serious coming from a member. The  chairman paused for a moment to prepare a reply -- angry but  detached. It took only a few lines: "Confindustria states that  it does not intend to allow itself to be manipulated in the  conduct of a party election campaign, nor to allow itself to  become involved in a coarse political rivalry. Just as in the  recent past it has ignored provocations from other party  representatives, so Confindustria does not intend to respond to  this latest one, either."    Chairman of the young industrialists, Aldo Fumagalli, took  issue directly with Berlusconi, however: "Let Berlusconi  remember that Confindustria is a voluntary organization  comprised of 110,000 enterprises, which evidently think  differently from him. If Berlusconi had attended the Council's  proceedings more assiduously, his assessment would now probably  be more balanced."    Former Confindustria Chairman Ernesto Gismondi, a candidate  for the progressive forces in Milan, reminded the Forza Italia  leader and Fininvest boss provocatively of "the enormous benefit  that his group, with its huge debts, was able to enjoy from the  reduction in the cost of money, which was the result of one of  the many battles waged by Confindustria."    There has never been much fellowship between Berlusconi and  the employers' federation. At the beginning of his career  Berlusconi felt snubbed by the major potentates of Italian  capitalism.    He probably now wants to take his revenge and to exploit  this  front too. Furthermore, Berlusconi's chief enemy is one of  Confindustria's top men -- Carlo de Benedetti, president of  Olivetti and owner of the L'ESPRESSO-LA REPUBBLICA publishing  group. He is almost certainly one of the "people I do not like"  cited by Forza Italia's leader in his attack on Confindustria.    Last, there is certainly no love lost between Berlusconi and  the present Confindustria chairman. Abete is a committed  supporter of an active role for the organization, has little  sympathy for uncommitted associates, and is certainly not among  Forza Italia's supporters.    Furthermore, Berlusconi does not know what to do about  Confindustria's position on the elections: The organization has  not expressed a preference for any of the alignments, nor can it  do so, in view of the fact that within it there are such  opposing viewpoints as those of Berlusconi and de Benedetti, for  instance.    Berlusconi's aim with yesterday's rupture -- which has been  in the air for some time -- is probably to gain more support  from small entrepreneurs, professionals, and the self-employed,  which groups have always been critical of the predominant role  played by Confindustria.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Gambro lifts payout as income rises 27% GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, said favourable market trends and acquisitions had helped it lift 1992 pre-tax income to SKr753m (Dollars 102.34m), up 27 per cent from SKr594m a year earlier. The performance encouraged the group to raise its dividend 20 per cent to SKr4.50 per share from SKr3.75. The group said its European renal care activities contributed substantially to the improvement, and it pointed to the favourable development of Cobe and Hospal, two companies which it has purchased in the past five years. Sales rose 12 per cent to SKr6.3bn from SKr5.6bn. Operating profit rose 24 per cent to SKr972m, with interest expenses up to SKr299m from SKr283m. Gambro's main activity, renal care, saw turnover rise 9 per cent to SKr4.5bn, thanks to strong sales of dialysis machines and other equipment. But there were bigger increases from two of its other business areas. The intensive care and anaesthesia division lifted sales 17 per cent to SKr408m, helped by the purchase of the UK group MIE, and the blood component technology area increased sales by 18 per cent to SKr385m. Kymmene, the Finnish forestry group, is scrapping its dividend for the first time in decades after posting a FM1.36bn (Dollars 225m) loss in 1992. It blamed overcapacity, low prices and its product mix for the deficit, which is bigger than its 1991 loss of FM1.3bn when it paid a FM0.90 per share dividend. Sales rose to FM13.61bn from FM13.45bn, while operating profit fell to FM394m from FM437m. The group suffered from low capacity utilisation, aggravated by FM200m in non-recurring restructuring costs and FM190m in foreign exchange losses. It did not benefit significantly from the weakening markka because half its paper is produced outside Finland. The result was a FM530m reversal in the operating profit of the paper divisions from a FM399m profit in 1991 to a FM131m loss last year. Kymmene said it expected earnings to start improving gradually in 1993.</p>

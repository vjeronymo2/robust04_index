			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi (DPA) -- Georgian head of state Eduard  Shevardnadze unreservedly supports Russia's decision to send  peace troops to Abkhazia, which is striving for more  independence from Georgia. "The implementation of this  operation is the logical continuation of the consolidation of  our relations with Russia," Shevardnadze said in a DPA interview  in Tbilisi on Tuesday. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy  Kondratyev stated in Moscow that President Boris Yeltsin ordered  the beginning of the operation on Tuesday.    The Russian soldiers are first supposed to remove the mines  that had been planted during the fighting between Georgia and  Abkhazia -- an autonomous region at the Georgian Black Sea coast  -- last summer, Shevardnadze said. "This establishes security  guarantees, not only for the entry of the peace troops, but also  for the return of the refugees."    According to his information, altogether three Russian  battalions are to be stationed in the districts of Gali and  Ochamchire. In the first stage of the operation the employment  of up to 1,500 soldiers is planned. "The peace operation will  be restricted to the troop withdrawal," he stressed.    "I already said some years ago: The real sun rises for  Georgia in the north," said Shevardnadze, "without Russia, we  also do not have the best opportunities today to save ourselves  and our state, which is being developed." "The most important  thing is that Georgia must not wage war and has to learn to  solve problems exclusively by peaceful means. Taking all  present factors into account, this is only possible with  Russia's active participation, as our bitter experiences show."</p>

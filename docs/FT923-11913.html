			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo's rebound gives support to the region A FALL in short-term interest rates encouraged investors, and the Nikkei average gained for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index ended 117.93 firmer at 16,002.41, after touching a day's low of 15,770.67 and high of 16,055.30 on arbitrage unwinding and buying by investment trusts. Volume remained flat at 200m shares. In spite of the rise in the Nikkei, other market indicators reflected underlying weakness. Declines led advances by 472 to 429, with 171 issues unchanged. A total of 136 stocks fell to new lows for the year, and the Topix index of all first section issues shed 0.76 to 1,229.38. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.30 to 962.46. Weakness in overseas markets on Monday prompted futures-linked arbitrage unwinding, but shares then recouped losses on heavy index-linked buying by investment trusts and dealers. Some traders found comfort in the fall in the overnight call rates, as a prelude to monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. However, overall activity by investors has dried up, and the low volumes leave share prices vulnerable to movements in the futures markets, and arbitrage activity. Ms Kathy Matsui at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Most investors, especially the foreigners and individuals, have adopted a wait-and-see attitude.' She added that investors will want to see some semblance of concern from the authorities about the market's weakness before coming back again. Dealers bought speculative stocks for short-term trading purposes. Meiji Milk Products gained Y30 to Y930 and Taiyo Fishery Y6 to Y452. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y4,000 to Y598,000 on selling by financial institutions, while bank issues weakened on sales by leading foreign brokerages. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y20 to Y1,670 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y10 to Y1,210. High-technology issues, which dropped on Monday on fears of sharply lower profits for the current year, rallied on bargain hunting. NEC rose Y22 to Y808 and Sony Y70 to Y4,030, but Hitachi slipped a further Y8 to Y752 and Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, was Y8 lower at Y612. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 17.18 to 18,351.07, declining for the fourth consecutive day. Volume increased to 15.8m shares from 9.2m. Roundup TOKYO'S rebound gave support to most markets in the region. HONG KONG ended moderately higher on strong buying interest in HSBC Holdings after its Marine Midland Bank division reported a turnround in first-half results on Monday. The Hang Seng index appreciated 23.95 to 6,010.44 in turnover of HKDollars 3.13bn. HSBC added HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 54.5 and Hang Seng Bank climbed HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53. AUSTRALIA was helped by the rise in Tokyo. The All Ordinaries index improved 4.4 to 1,609.3. Resource issues remained weak, although gold shares continued to rally as the bullion price touched a seven-month high. National Australia Bank attracted interest after announcing a takeover bid for Bank of New Zealand, the shares rising 8 cents to ADollars 7.87. Westpac continued to suffer from an impending rights issue, closing 3 cents easier at ADollars 3.14. NEW ZEALAND recovered some of the ground lost on Monday, the NZSE-40 capital index ending 5.08 better at 1,560.08 in turnover of NZDollars 27.2m. Bank of New Zealand dipped 3 cents to 76 cents after National Australia's NZDollars 1.48bn takeover bid. MANILA finished lower after lacklustre trade. The composite index weakened 19.96 to 1,433.04 in combined turnover of 371.6m pesos. TAIWAN rose, with paper issues stronger on reports of cheaper pulp prices. The weighted index, down more than 70 points in early trade, closed a net 11.43 up at 4,159.02. Turnover came to TDollars 23.73bn (TDollars 22.88bn). Ban Yu Paper rose 30 cents to TDollars 18.90. SINGAPORE declined, with some analysts noting that interest remained in over-the-counter Malaysian stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 11.29 to 1,434.46 in volume of 54.58m shares. Falls led rises by 124 to 102. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index put on 2.40 to 605.16 in active trade, concentrated in speculative stocks. SEOUL staged a technical rebound, the composite index moving ahead 6.54 to 511.84. Turnover was still thin, at Won107.53bn. Hyundai group shares were actively traded as six of the 17 listed group shares reached their daily upper limits. Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Precision and Industries added Won800 apiece at Won16,400 and Won17,500 respectively. KARACHI fell for the fifth straight session amid political uncertainty over democracy moves. The KSE index closed 16.42 lower at 1,400.56.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Joao Domingos in Brasilia] </F>   [Text] A council of notables, which will be coordinated by  former Deputy Plinio de Arruda Sampaio, will steer the political  course of the presidential campaign of PT [Workers Party]  candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. This council will also  seek to isolate radical PT members. Invitations are now being  extended to those who will serve on the council, which will  start meeting already this month. It will be incumbent upon the  council to evaluate -- from the standpoint of society, not of  party members -- the advertising and political content of Lula's  speeches.    Serving on this council will be people who are linked to the  political history of each region. Its members do not have to be  members of the party. In practice, the council will assume  powers that are currently exercised by some radical members of  the PT executive board, such as state Deputy Rui Falcao of Sao  Paulo State. Falcao, Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh, and Gilberto  Carvalho will join the PT leadership that will run the daily  campaign. They will thus not have time to undertake any form of  political analysis.    Falcao is one of the leading adversaries of the PT bloc in  Congress, which consists primarily of moderate members. Falcao  is frontally opposed to PT participation in the constitutional  revision process, and has become known for his political  intransigence. Arruda Sampaio said: "I cannot understand why  the PT expelled the Socialist Convergence faction from its  cadres, because Rui Falcao alone is far more Shiite than the  entire faction." Like Workers Cause, another radical Trotskyite  faction, Socialist Convergence has been proscribed within the PT.    The idea of creating a council of notables stemmed from the  acknowledgement of the errors committed in the 1989 presidential  campaign -- when Lula was defeated by Fernando Collor -- and  from the fear that the "Shiites" may manage to control the PT  campaign for the 3 October election. In 1989, the PT campaign  managers had serious problems with regional party boards which  were trying to influence the election and the use of free  electoral advertising.</p>

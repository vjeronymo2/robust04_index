			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1255 GMT on 10 February carries several news reports relating  to emigration and the activities of the U.S. Interests Section,  as well as to the perception of these activities by the general  population in Cuba.    In a preview of upcoming stories, the announcer says: "Cuban  emigration to the United States will continue to be the focus of  analysis in this half-hour of Rebelde's `Doing Radio' program.  Expect new details on this topic of great national prominence  from Zenaida Costales, who is still at the so-called Park of  Lamentations on the corner of Calzada and K Street, in the  vicinity of the offices of the U.S. Interests Section in  Havana." The announcer says, further: "You too can participate  in the topic. Call us at 32-82-97."    This preview is followed by the announcement: "The `Doing  Radio' program's automatic answering machine is your friend.  Leave your message right now. After hearing the tone, you have  30 seconds to say hello or to express your opinions."    A tone is heard, and then a woman says: "Hello from Comrade  Lucy Estela, a listener of this program. Concerning my opinion  on emigration: There has always been emigration, but there are  many ways of emigrating. There is the emigration of the patriot  and there is the emigration of the traitor. At the present time,  to emigrate is to flee the difficulties. Any Cuban who really  feels Cuban at the present time stays here in Cuba, and all  together, we struggle -- for this is not the time to emigrate.  This is a time to stay inside the fatherland and struggle. And  the Americans are waging a policy, precisely, against all those  people who are today abandoning the country because of a few  difficulties that we are having. Because if we look at other  countries, they are worse off than we are. We may be hungry, and  there may be shortages, and we may have difficulties, but we  have a fatherland. Others have no fatherland. And to emigrate at  the present time is an act of cowardice. And the Americans take  advantage of those cowards to wage political propaganda against  us, trying to make it look like Cuba does not let people leave.  And it has been said here that Cubans may leave the country  whenever they like. But what do the Americans do? They try to  get people to leave clandestinely and to have them (?drown) en  route, so that they can later blame us, the Cubans; blame Fidel,  who has given this people so much! And that is why we say: Yes,  let he who wishes to emigrate right now go ahead and emigrate.  The holes in the ranks do not matter if we who remain are firm,  as Raul said. The Fatherland or death! We will win.    "Lucy Estela, of San Lazaro, #464."    This, in turn, is followed by what is said to be a live  mobile unit report. An announcer says: "We are now in contact  with the `Doing Radio' program's mobile unit and Zenaida  Costales, who I understand is still at the Park of Lamentations,  right?" A second announcer adds: "At the park on Calzada and K  Streets, near the offices of the U.S. Interests Section in  Havana. I am listening, Zenaida. Good morning."    Costales says: "Yes, thank you. Here we are again,  broadcasting from very near the offices of the U.S. Interests  Section, where hundreds of people remain, standing vigil in an  interminable line that will permit them to find out once and for  all whether or not they will be able to travel to the United  States. I should tell you that in 1993, Cuba authorized the  temporary exit of 100,000 people, but only 30,000 were able to  travel. The remaining 70,000 were denied visas by the U.S.  Government. Why? These testimonies contain some of the answers."    Approximately 1.5 minutes of excerpts of conversations with  unidentified speakers follow.    One man says: "Hope is the only thing one cannot afford to  lose in this life."    "What if they say no?" -- asks the reporter.    The man answers: "They are obliging me to do something I  would rather not do. I would like to go see my grandparents and  come back. But they are obliging me to do something else."    Costales says: "Perhaps what he does not want to do is leave  illegally, but for him, that appears to be his only alternative.    "This is Zenaida Costales for the `Doing Radio' program.  Good  day."    An announcer thanks Costales for her report and asks her to  return to the studio to discuss this matter further.    Next, Roberto (Geli) [not further identified] notes that  the last speaker, "who appears to be a young person," seems to  be a candidate for illegal emigration/immigration, asking: "And  I wonder: Who is at fault or as a consequence of what?"    (Geli) notes that this kind of illegal  emigration/immigration  takes place in many parts of the world, adding that in the case  of Cuba, "the total number of rafters rescued, or who arrived in  U.S. territory in 1993 from our territory was 3,656." "The 1992  figure was 2,556, which, in turn, was approximately 400 people  more than the 1991 figure of 2,203 -- which cannot be compared  with the 1990 figure, which was only 467."    (Geli) notes that the number of emigrants coincides with the  beginning of increasing economic difficulties in Cuba because of  the collapse of the socialist bloc, plus an intensification of  the U.S. blockade against Cuba. He says, further: "At the same  time, another element that cannot be forgotten is that also as  of 1991, the quote calls unquote to emigrate illegally made from  U.S. territory have increased -- with calls not to stay on the  island; to show, through this, a rejection of the Cuban  political process, or the Cuban political project."    Citing official U.S. sources, (Geli) notes that 582 Cuban  rafters disappeared in the Florida straits in 1993 while  attempting to emigrate illegally,"and 28 are known to have  died," including children.    (Geli) asks himself: "And I wonder, [Rebelde journalist  Roberto] Cavada, and dear listeners, how these people who  emigrate this way deal with their feelings? I wonder what one  feels when one can no longer see the place where one spent one's  childhood anytime one wishes, when one cannot visit one's  long-time friends and life-long relatives, when one turns one's  back on the national identity and on what we Cubans call `things  Cuban'?    "What does one feel when one knows that those here are going  through a difficult phase, a phase full of shortages, problems,  and diverse difficult circumstances -- but nevertheless do not  turn their backs, and instead stay close to the family, close to  their dreams, close to their ideas? It is no doubt a very  complex problem, of course -- and having to confront such a  problem daily must cause true chaos in more than a few of the  people who emigrate anywhere in the world.    "I am of course talking about those who think and feel. And  I  say this because we all know that there are some among those who  leave who exhibit all to the contrary -- when they leave even  sick family members, old people, and children in order to go off  seeking that which every emigrant terms paradise. That is what  I have to say, for the moment, Cavada."    The journalists agree to discuss this matter further in the  future.</p>

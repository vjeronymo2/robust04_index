			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES SMOKING BAN ON DOMESTIC AIRLINE FLIGHTS;  </P> <P> FOREIGN CARRIERS INCLUDED  </P> <P> The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to premanently ban smoking aboard all  domestic airline flights, crushing the opposition of tobacco-state lawmakers  and their allies.  </P> <P> "This is a victory for the majority of airline passengers who don't want to  breathe other people's cigarette smoke," said Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg  (D-N.J.), the sponsor of the legislation.  </P> <P> Senators adopted the anti-smoking language on a voice vote after first cutting  off debate meant to stall the measure, 77 to 21, and rejecting a bid to kill it  on procedural grounds, 65 to 34.  </P> <P> The ban was included as an amendment to an $11.9-billion, 1990 appropriations  bill for the Transportation Department and related agencies that was headed for  easy passage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Last Chance for Modifications  </P> <P> The last chance for tobacco-state senators to modify the anti-smoking stand  will come with a Senate-House conference set up to negotiate all differences in  the underlying money bill. The House voted only to make permanent the current  ban against smoking on flights of two hours or less, which had been due to  expire in April.  </P> <P> The prohibition passed by the Senate not only would cover all domestic flights  of U.S. carriers but also foreign airlines that fly between U.S. cities.  </P> <P> Today's crucial vote to impose debate-limiting cloture -- adopted after  tobacco-state senators threatened a filibuster to stall the bill -- was 17  votes more than the 60 required. It was cast without discussion.  </P> <P> "We're closing in on the day when the air will be cleared in all airline cabins  in the United States," Lautenberg declared.  </P> <P> Tobacco interests say there is no proof that cigarette smoke endangers  nonsmokers and argue that there are plenty of other chemicals in recirculated  aircraft cabin air.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rights Ignored  </P> <P> Opponents of the total ban said the rights of smokers were being ignored  because they are now in the minority.  </P> <P> "I wonder how the rights of the minority in this case can be protected," Sen.  Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) said during the debate.  </P> <P> "I thought that is what this place (America) was all about," Ford, a smoker,  added. "The majority governs, but the minority's rights are protected under the  majority governing."  </P> <P> Ford said it would be difficult for smokers to go without cigarettes for the  four or five hours -- plus additional hours in the plane but on the ground --  required for transcontinental flights.  </P> <P> Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) launched the final attempt to kill the ban,  arguing unsuccessfully that the appropriations measure was not the proper place  for such action.  </P> <P> His point of order was upheld by Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.), the presiding  officer at the moment. But that stand was overruled by the Senate.  </P> <P> Hollings accused Lautenberg of "government by ambush" in putting the smoking  ban on the transportation money bill.  </P> <P> "Are we going to be a body of ambush, chicanery and fraud, or are we going to  adhere to process and have the issue heard?" Hollings asked.  </P></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Personal pensions - predictions, incentives, and now a compensation loop? (5) Sir, Insurance companies now face a compensation bill of up to Pounds 2bn for wrong pension advice. Where are they going to get the money from? Surely they are going to clip all policies to pay the cost. They will doubtless find a justification in the fine print. If so, then anyone who invested via an insurance company suffered a risk of having their investment clipped to pay compensation. Were they warned of this risk? If not, they are entitled to compensation. We may be entering a compensation loop. Toby Micklethwait, Hamilton House, Lyne, Surrey KT16 0AN</p>

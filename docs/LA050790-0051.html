			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS SUED OVER PARTY FORUM  </P> <P> A relatively unknown candidate for the Democratic nomination for state  insurance commissioner, Larry Murphy of Temecula, sued state party Chairman  Edmund G. Brown Jr. and other party officials for $10 million for denying him a  place on the rostrum when the party held a debate among insurance commissioner  candidates April 7, before voting to give television commentator Bill Press its  endorsement. Murphy said he paid a $100 filing fee but was the only candidate  denied a chance to debate. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana,  said this was both a breach of contract and a violation of Murphy's civil  rights.  </P></p>

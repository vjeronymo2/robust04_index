Procedural Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Environmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 7(a) of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 766(a)), a copy of this notice was submitted to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for the Administrator's comments concerning the impacts of this proposal on the quality of the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rulemaking has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the DOE_National Environmental Policy Act Final Rule as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 24, 1992. Based on that review, this rulemaking was found to qualify for a categorical exclusion under Appendix A to subpart D, Item A5 of the Final Rule: Rulemaking (interpreting/amending), no change in environmental effect. The rulemaking does not change the environmental effect of the current version of 10 CFR part 474.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the January 22, 1993, memorandum on the subject of regulatory review from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (58 FR 6074, January 25, 1993), DOE submitted this notice to the Director for appropriate review. The Director has completed his review. Separately, DOE has determined that there is no need for a regulatory impact analysis because the rule is not a major rule as that term is defined in section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;345) (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires that an agency prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to be published at the time the proposed rule is published. This requirement (which appears in section 603) does not apply if the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE certifies that this action will have little, if any, effect on small business. It is directed at vehicle manufacturers that will be concerned with a mix of petroleum and electric fueled vehicles in their annual production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Federalism Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that regulations or rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order 12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating such a regulation or rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE's responsibility with this action and 10 CFR part 474 serve only to provide a method of interpreting 40 CFR part 600 (Fuel Economy of Motor Vehicles) for electric vehicles. The action does not involve any substantial direct effects on States of other considerations stated in Executive Order 12612. Hence, no federalism assessment is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. ``Takings'' Assessment Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that pursuant to Executive Order 12630 (52 FR 8859, March 18, 1988), this proposed regulation, if adopted, would not result in any takings which might require compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

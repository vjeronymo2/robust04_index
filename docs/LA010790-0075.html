			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW YEAR'S GUNFIRE  </P> <P> I couldn't believe my ears on New Year's Eve. I thought I was in Panama or  Beirut. Every New Year's Eve it gets worse and worse.  </P> <P> I have never heard such a cacophony of small arms, pistols, assault rifles,  AK-47s and Uzis.  </P> <P> And all this just two blocks from the Santa Ana police station on Ross Street.  And not just at midnight, but from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. Some must have been  celebrating New Year's for Arizona and then Hawaii.  </P> <P> It goes like this. First a poor dude gets out there with his six-shooter and  fires off a quick six. Everybody counts. Then the guys with the larger caliber  pistols say, "Watch this," and fire off a quick six. The the guy with the  assault rifle says, "I can beat that," and fires off a quick 10 rounds. Then  the guy with the AK-47 says, "I can beat that," and fires off a quick 15. Then  the impatient Uzi owner beats everyone with his awesome firepower.  </P> <P> I heard police sirens, but it becomes a cat-and-mouse game. While the police  are in one section of the neighborhood, the hooligans fire from a block away.  The police move out, and the clowns come out and fire into the air again. The  police go back and forth.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana City Council is the most permissive City Council we have ever  had. They allow all sorts of evil to go on in this city. If the machine-gun and  small-arms fire on New Year's Eve had happened 20 years ago in the city, there  would have been mass arrests. It would not have been tolerated.  </P> <P> JON TURNER  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

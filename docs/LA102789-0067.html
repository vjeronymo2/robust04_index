			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RAISA GORBACHEV BEST AMBASSADOR FOR SOVIETS, FINNISH PAPER SAYS  </P> <P> Raisa Gorbachev has delighted crowds in Finland with an elegance that has made  her a controversial figure at home.  </P> <P> Accompanying her husband, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, on a three-day  state visit to Finland, the Soviet first lady drew admiration on every stop of  her own special schedule -- a museum, a huge abstract sculpture, a school and a  cheese factory.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union's secret weapon has conquered Helsinki . . . (and) is their  best ambassador," the Helsinki newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet said.  </P> <P> More than 1,000 people mixed calls of "Gorba, Gorba" and "Raisa, Raisa" when  Raisa Gorbachev, dressed in pinstriped skirt and jacket and a purple leather  coat, joined her husband on the balcony of the presidential palace shortly  after their arrival in Helsinki on Wednesday.  </P> <P> She mingled with a rain-soaked crowd on a visit to a modernist sculpture  commemorating Finland's greatest composer, Jean Sibelius. "Dobry dyen (Good  day)," she said, and shook hands with bystanders while bodyguards fought in  vain to hold off a human wave of photographers and reporters.  </P> <P> Visiting a 750-pupil school that teaches in both Finnish and Russian, she  immediately took one pupil, 9-year-old Mikko Kupari, to stay with her  throughout the 90-minute visit.  </P> <P> Teachers insisted that she selected Kupari because he produced the loudest  greeting of the flag-waving children lined up to welcome her. "She was a very  kind lady, very nice," Mikko told reporters.  </P></p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (3): Strife on the waterfront - Dockyard development plans There is strife on the Mersey waterfront, but not the kind of labour dispute that gave Liverpool a bad name in years gone by. This time the protagonists are the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company and the Merseyside Development Corporation. The row is over whether 74m birds in the bush are worth up to 20m in the hand. The MDHC wants to spend up to Pounds 20m - half of it immediately - on a floating roll on/roll off stage and a 27-acre freight terminal at Twelve Quays, Birkenhead, across the Mersey from Liverpool, to keep up its market leadership in the growing Irish Sea trade. The MDC favours a projected Pounds 74m scheme by London and General Property which would include a large measure of speculative property development, such as a science park and a student village. It, too, would have a floating stage, but a smaller, 15-acre freight terminal to be run by a Belfast freight company which is not a port operator. Mr Trevor Furlong, managing director of MDHC, is furious. He says: 'It is crazy to hand over workable waterfront sites for this sort of development. It will constrict expansion of the Mersey as a port. Plenty of other sites are available for science parks and student accommodation.' He needs the new terminal for the next step in the remarkable transformation and growth of the Port of Liverpool over the past 10 years. Indeed, acquisition of the Medway ports of Chatham and Sheerness last year has already turned MDHC into the second largest port group in the UK. Last year the company made profits of Pounds 20.3m, an increase of 38 per cent over 1992. Turnover on Merseyside reached nearly 30m tonnes, a record. There are now only 400 port operative workers - once known as dockers - compared with more than 6,000 two decades ago, shortly after the government had to rescue the company's predecessor when it defaulted on its bonds. The total workforce now is 1,600. The government, which wrote off debts of Pounds 130m five years ago, gave up a golden share this year to free the business from the last vestiges of Whitehall supervision. But it retains a 14 per cent stake, which it says will be sold, but not yet. Indeed, if the government holds on long enough, it stands a chance of eventually getting back much of the taxpayers' money used to modernise the port. It is not just more efficient work practices which have brought about the transformation, for the MDHC has aggressively set out to expand the volume of business in all directions. It has ro-ro facilities and is constantly expanding its container terminal. It is the largest trader in scrap metal in the UK. It trades in oil, bulk liquids, grain and forest products. It is the largest port trading with the eastern seaboard of the US and the largest UK port trading with Ireland. Recent developments include Powergen's Pounds 40m environmentally sensitive bulk terminal for coal imports. There is also a dedicated Euro Rail terminal for Channel tunnel freight from north-west England and Ireland. The new oil and gas field in Liverpool Bay will also bring growing benefits. Hamilton Oil is using Hornby Dock, in Bootle, for its offshore supply base. With other oil companies now prospecting in the bay, more jobs should be on their way to the docks. Merseyside is also the home of the UK's most successful freeport, which is contained in 640 of the company's 2,000 acres on the Liverpool side, with another 120 acres in Birkenhead docks. More than 100 companies use it. With 200 acres of land not needed for shipping, a subsidiary property development company has been building houses and business parks. It has also obtained planning permission from the MDC to build 1.5m sq ft of offices with P&amp;O at Prince's Dock, a prime site next to Liverpool Pier. But this is on ice until end-users materialise; there will be no speculative development. For the future, the MDHC sees further growth from the Medway ports. Medway recently announced the start of a new trucked freight service to the Netherlands. Mr Furlong is also ready to have another go at Twelve Quays if London &amp; General cannot proceed. He says: 'It will be a great disappointment if we do not get our floating stage. But it will not be the end of the world. We will have to look elsewhere. We are never complacent.'</p>

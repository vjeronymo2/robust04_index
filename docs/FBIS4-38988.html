			<p>BFN     [Text] The CIS Executive Secretary, Ivan Korotchenya, has  told Interfax that a majority of CIS countries gave support to  President Yeltsin's call for deploying collective peace-keeping  forces in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict area. Now they are  awaiting Moscow's political decision on this matter. According  to Korotchenya, he came to Moscow to inform the Russian  president of the results of his recent mission during which he  consulted the leaders of CIS countries in connection with the  initiative of Boris Yeltsin, who is the chairman of the Council  of the Heads of Commonwealth States.    As Korotchenya said, all CIS leaders "see the need to deploy  peace-keeping forces in the conflict area, and many undertook to  despatch observers there and give as much material aid as they  can." Some CIS countries "may deploy their peace-keeping  contingents in the conflict zone after the necessary  consultations," Korotchenya added.    As regards the CIS countries which joined the Council of  Collective Security, Minsk alone has not taken its final  decision on Yeltsin's appeal. It will determine its stand, when  the parliament convenes for a session after June 23. Moldova,  Ukraine and Turkmenistan, which did not sign the Treaty on  Collective Security, have not reacted to the Russian president's  call so far.    With reference to the Federation Council's failure to  approve  the deployment of Russian peace-keepers in the conflict area,  Korotchenya said he hopes that the upper chamber of Russia's  parliament will resolve this issue positively when it  reconsiders it.    The deployment of peace-keepers requires the approval of  Russia's president, who promised in his appeal that Russian  servicemen will form the backbone of collective forces,  Korotchenya said. "As far as I know, the military are ready to  all intents and purposes; they are waiting for a political  decision. Abkhazia, Georgia and the Caucasus as a whole are  also waiting for it," said the CIS executive secretary.    According to Korotchenya, the deployment of peace-keepers in  the conflict zone is designed to indicate that the CIS is  capable of resolving its internal problems on its own, without  the participation of the U.N., the CSCE, or other international  organizations.</p>

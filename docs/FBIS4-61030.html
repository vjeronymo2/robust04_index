			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In Favor of Accord in Action"] </F>   [Text] The opposition movement "Accord for Russia" shares  the idea of social accord, but regards the treaty signed the  other day as "another act of propaganda in which correct slogans  merely serve to conceal an inept and destructive policy."    Accord cannot be achieved by the mere signing of an  ostentatious document without specific commitments to society by  the authorities, a statement adopted by the movement yesterday  at an enlarged session of its council says. The document was  circulated yesterday at a press conference of its leaders. The  following participated in it: Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation; Vasiliy Lipitskiy,  chairman of the Board of the People's Party Free Russia (the  party of Aleksandr Rutskoy); Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the  Agrarian Party of Russia; Sergey Baburin, chairman of the  Russian National Union; Stanislav Govorukhin and Sergey Glazyev,  representatives of the Democratic Party of Russia faction;  Aleksandr Prokhanov, chief editor of the newspaper ZAVTRA; and  Aleksandr Tsipko, political scientist.    The authors of the statement consider that it is necessary  first and foremost to agree on a change in the government course  and on measures to save Russia, including "restoring the  effectiveness of state power," preventing further growth in  crime, and instilling order in the management of state property.    The initiators of the "Accord for Russia" movement issued a  statement, which says in particular:    We are ready to seek accord through specific actions rather  than participating in another act of propaganda where correct  slogans and words merely serve to conceal an inept and  destructive policy. Subscribing to it would mean agreeing to the  destruction of the country's scientific and industrial complex,  the mass plunder of state property and embezzlement of state  funds, the degradation of our people, and the destruction of  national spiritual values and culture.    All of us today have to agree first and foremost on a change  of government course and on immediate measures to save Russia,  including    -- restoring the effectiveness of state power;    -- preventing any exacerbation of crime and corruption and  taking tough measures to ensure citizens are really safe and  their property secure;    -- instilling order in the management of state property and  finances, preventing the economic bankruptcy of the state,  achieving economic stabilization, and implementing progressive  structural changes in the economy;    -- ensuring proper social protection and fair distribution  of  the hardships involved in overcoming the crisis among all strata  of society;    -- searching for ways to meet the state's commitments to  millions of depositors in view of the depreciation of their  savings, instilling order in privatization, and ensuring the  real protection of the interests of ordinary shareholders;    Accord and unification of society are only possible on the  basis of these specific objectives and specific actions by the  authorities.    We advocate accord in action rather than mere words. We can  see a way of extricating the country from socioeconomic  catastrophe and saving the Russian state and are ready to pool  our efforts to further this great aim.    [dated] 27 April 1994.</p>

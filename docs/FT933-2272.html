			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / The Liberal Democrats at Torquay: From Tokyo to Torquay - Conference Notebook WE HAVE been here before. As the Liberal Democrats gathered in Torquay yesterday for the start of the autumn conference season it was hard to gainsay their claim that the third party is in better shape than at any time since the heyday of the old Alliance in the early 1980s. True, the row over the party's activities in Tower Hamlets soured the atmosphere. Mr Paddy Ashdown's assertion that the national party had acted swiftly to ensure errant activists were brought into line was less than convincing. Senior party insiders admitted that the Tower Hamlets party had been given a 'final warning' as long ago as 1990 to expunge any racist undertones from its campaigning. Three years - and the election of a racist British National party councillor - later Mr Ashdown's protestations of ignorance offer a hollow defence. But with Mr John Major's government engulfed by a semi-permanent state of crisis and Mr John Smith's Labour party still fighting yesterday's battles, the Liberal Democrats will not allow the issue to cloud their week. Mr Major is unable even to spend a few days in Tokyo without being forced to call for loyalty from his own backbenchers. So the mood in Torquay is understandably buoyant. Victories this year in Newbury and Christchurch and in the county council elections have been followed by opinion poll ratings which more than once have pushed the government into third place. The Conservatives' own analysis suggests that a quarter of its remaining 32 seats in the European parliament could be lost to the Liberal Democrats next June. Ironically, the mood of anti-politics across the country which has restored the party's fortunes holds out the prospect of turning the Liberal Democrats into the natural party of government in the south west of England. So Mr Ashdown's followers now see their real opportunity in the self-destruction of the Conservative party. The talk of the 1980s - that Labour could be driven back permanently into a few northern strongholds - has been replaced by a sense that it is the Conservatives who are destined for a long spell in the political wilderness. A glance at the continued turmoil over Mr Major's leadership confirms that is no longer an incredible claim. The paucity of talent on the Conservative and Labour front benches has obscured the obvious weakness of the Liberal Democrats at Westminster. No more than a third of the party's 22 MPs could in other circumstances claim real standing as national figures. But by-election and council election successes won on the back of disenchantment in the Tory heartlands are not enough - nor is the unaccustomed and flattering interest now being shown by the media in the Liberal Democrats' fortunes. Mr Ashdown, still prone to the hyperbole which prompted him at the weekend to speculate on his own chances of reaching No 10 Downing Street, needs policies as well as popularity. The party's latest policy document recognises the gap. The rather eclectic faith in market mechanisms of previous statements has been replaced by a more distinctive centre-left approach to macroeconomic policy. Full employment - regarded for much of the 1980s as a goal only of socialist ideologues - has returned to the stage as a legitimate objective of government. The launch yesterday of a new policy-orientated journal by the party's intelligensia - Shirley Williams among them - is intended to reinforce the trend. But some of Mr Ashdown's colleagues believe the leadership is still too preoccupied with headline-grabbing gimmicks - the proposals for citizens' referenda and co-opted members in the cabinet were the latest. Many of the Liberal Democrats' instincts - devolution of political power, the reassertion of the idea that individual opportunity and society can be allies rather than enemies - strike a chord with a disenchanted electorate. The mood of the country is not one susceptible to the 'government knows best' attitude which sustained the Conservatives for much of the 1980s. But as one senior Liberal Democrat said yesterday, a huge leap must be taken before his party's status as a refuge for protest can be translated into power. The bridge - a credible policy framework - has still to be built. Then there is that other question: the Labour party. There has been surprisingly little talk so far this week of that perennial third-party issue - electoral pacts. Perhaps that is because no one now believes a deal with Mr Smith is conceivable before the next general election. Many in Mr Ashdown's party also are indifferent if not hostile to national rather than local politicking. But few doubt that the extent to which the Liberal Democrats are prepared to acknowledge common ground with Labour will be crucial to their electoral fortunes. The mould of British politics has been badly cracked. But it is not yet broken.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: ACH in ADollars 12.9m bid to take control of Melcann CSR and Pioneer International, the Australian building products groups, have moved to rationalise further the local cement industry with a ADollars 12.9m (USDollars 8.7m) take-over bid for full control of Melcann, the bagged cement distributor. The bid was announced through Australian Cement Holdings (ACH), the joint venture controlled by CSR and Pioneer. It is worth ADollars 1.85 a share for the 49.5 per cent of Melcann not already owned. ACH said the bid was pitched at 19 times Melcann's latest earnings per share, was 32 per cent above latest net tangible assets and was at a 12 per cent premium to Melcann's average share price for the latest year. If the bid went through, Melcann shareholders would retain the company's 5 cents a share dividend declared for payment in July, ACH said. The bid is subject to the condition that ACH would become entitled to 90 per cent of Melcann's shares and would be able to achieve compulsory acquisition. ACH is making the offer because it believes that Melcann is poorly positioned as an independent distributor in the increasingly competitive Australian cement market, ACH said. It said Melcann's attempts at geographic and product diversification over the last few years had been unsuccessful and extremely costly. Melcann is also a grain trader and sells swimming pool products.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- Government  departments in the capital launched a campaign titled "every  citizen is a cornerstone of the Hope Project" here today.    Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing municipal committee of  the Communist Party of China, Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan and other  government officials made donations at the newly-established  Beijing Donation Center for the Hope Project.    "The Hope Project will be full of hope when all the people  are mobilized," Zhang Jianmin, director of the municipal  people's congress said.    When a center worker asked Mayor Li Qiyan whether he would  like to aid a boy or girl, he answered: "It makes no difference  as long as it can help an out-of-school child."    In poverty-stricken areas of China, only 300 yuan are needed  to help a child through a year of schooling.    Since the Hope Project, a national effort to help send  children back to school in poor areas, was launched about a  decade ago, governments at various levels, social bodies and  common people have donated to it.    More than 2,000 people took part in the campaign today and  donated more than 100,000 yuan.</p>

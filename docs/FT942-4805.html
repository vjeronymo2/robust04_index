			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Plans to alter APR formula are attacked The Office of Fair Trading's proposal to change the way in which annual percentage rates are calculated is one of the most controversial aspects of yesterday's report on the Consumer Credit Act. The Consumers' Association said yesterday that the changes would 'weaken consumer protection and confuse consumers.' The OFT recommended that APRs on credit and store cards should be based only on the interest-charge element of the total charge for credit, with 'separate and bold' disclosure of fees and any other fixed charges. This change, which would require an amendment to the European Union directive on APRs, would help consumers understand the marginal cost of using one existing credit facility over another, said the OFT. The Consumers' Association said that the proposal 'flies in the face of the whole purpose of the APR' since it would prevent the APR from being the benchmark for comparison of all types of credit. As an interim measure to improve the consistency of APRs, the OFT said calculations of APRs for advertising purposes should be based on an outstanding credit card balance of Pounds 500 - close to the average balance on credit cards - rather than the current Pounds 1,000. The OFT also recommended that mortgage lenders quote separate APR figures for the initial period of a fixed or discounted rate mortgage and for the period after it has ended. Lenders often use the initial rate as the basis for quoting the APR on the entire life of the loan. This was criticised by the Consumers' Association as adding to confusion. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said it would improve the unsatisfactory position, although it doubted whether the APR was sufficiently understood to make it a useful contributor to consumer protection. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said the concern that consumers had little understanding of APRs was 'unnecessarily negative'. Research commissioned by the OFT into consumers' understanding of APRs found that fewer than half those questioned correctly identified its meaning and 30 per cent said they had considered the APR when looking for credit and loan arrangements.</p>

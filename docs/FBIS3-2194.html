"It's not  very likely now, but things are still developing," the assistant  governor of Sichuan, Xu Zhongmin, said in a recent exclusive  interview in Shenzhen. "He would like to remain as Sichuan  Governor, but Beijing still has the right of consideration," he  said.    Top officials in Sichuan remained worried Xiao would be  persuaded by Zhu, who was a Qinghua University classmate, to  take up the post in Beijing. "It would be a great loss for us.  We should have him for longer," Xu said.    Since being promoted from party secretary of Chongqing last  year, Xiao has taken personal charge of foreign investment and  industry portfolios, areas that are usually handled by deputy  governors, Xu said. "This is the time of great aspirations for  Mr Xiao," he said.    Zhu reportedly offered Xiao the post during an inspection  tour of Sichuan before the lunar new year, according to Taiwan's  CHINA TIMES. Xiao, 65, threatened to resign from politics  unless he was promoted to a Beijing position during last year's  14th party congress, where he barely squeaked in as an alternate  politburo member.    Zhu offered him a state councillor position as an additional  sweetener if he would become head of the People's Bank of China  (PBOC). But worries about the political pressure of being the  first governor of a supposedly independent central bank led Xiao  to refuse the offer despite his ambitions. Zhu's act was  apparently likened to offering a strong cappuccino to a man  dying of thirst.    But while politely refusing the post, Xiao expressed support  for Zhu's tight control of China's financial system, which he  said would prevent Sichuan bank savings from illegally flowing  to coastal areas. "If you open the floodgates, it becomes more  important to plug leaks. Following the recent easing of the  money supply we must prevent even a single cent flowing east,"  Xiao reportedly said.    Zhu confirmed before his recent trip to Japan that he was  having difficulty finding someone to take over the top position  in the central bank. He is believed to be desperate to shed the  governor's job because of the extra workload. "It seems not  many people would like to take the post... so I have to  continue," he told reporters at Beijing airport.    The current vice-governors of the PBOC have been most often  mooted as Zhu's probable successor, but official sources in  Beijing said there was concern that they would be too weak.  "The central government wants someone for the post who can  wield power without any restrictions," one official said. "That  means someone who is a political heavy weight, not an  experienced banker," the official added.    Fighting the threat of inflation has emerged in recent weeks  as Beijing's main concern in 1994. This contrasts with the  emphasis on quick growth and "deepening reforms" of last year.  Maintaining a tight control on the money supply despite  political pressures is considered crucial to keeping inflation  in check.</p>

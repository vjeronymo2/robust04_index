			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK;  </P> <P> DRIVER-OF-YEAR AWARD IS A 4-WAY BATTLE THIS TIME  </P> <P> When the time comes to select a driver of the year, the task is often an easy  one. Last year, for instance, Dale Earnhardt was such a standout that he was  virtually a unanimous selection. The year before, Bobby Rahal was unanimous.  </P> <P> This year, however, no such standout developed among the major racing  organizations in the country. Instead, four drivers emerged with outstanding  credentials, giving the 10 members of the selection panel a difficult job.  </P> <P> Listed alphabetically, the four are Geoff Brabham, champion of the  International Motor Sports Assn. for sports cars; Bill Elliott, champion of the  Winston Cup division of NASCAR for stock cars; Danny Sullivan, champion of  Championship Auto Racing Teams for open-wheel Indy cars; and Rusty Wallace,  fast-finishing Winston Cup runner-up.  </P> <P> Brabham, 36, won 8 straight IMSA Camel GTP races in his turbocharged Nissan ZX,  dominating the series as no one has since John Fitzpatrick won 8 of 11 features  in 1980. Brabham, an Australian who lives in Noblesville, Ind., ended up with 9  wins in 12 starts and added a postseason victory at Tampa, Fla., in the GTE  World Challenge, which matched IMSA cars with Group C challengers from Europe.  </P> <P> There are some who claim that IMSA is not on the same level with Indy cars or  Winston Cup stock cars and that winning drivers often share their rides with  others, thus watering down the significance of individual wins.  </P> <P> During Brabham's hot streak, for instance, he shared his Nissan with John  Morton at Road Atlanta, West Palm Beach, Watkins Glen and Elkhart Lake, and  with Tom Gloy at Mid-Ohio. But he won driving solo at Lime Rock, Portland and  Sears Point.  </P> <P> Although IMSA fields are traditionally filled with drivers of lesser abilities,  Brabham faced plenty of headliners in the series -- among them former world  champion Mario Andretti, Indy 500 winners Rahal, A.J. Foyt and Sullivan, and  such foreign stars as 5-time LeMans winner Derek Bell and world  sports-prototype champion Martin Brundle of Great Britain, Jochen Mass of  Monaco, Klaus Ludwig of West Germany and Sarel van der Merwe of South Africa.  </P> <P> Brabham missed 2 of the first 3 races and trailed Jaguar driver John Nielsen,  51-3, when the series reached Road Atlanta, its fourth stop. In the final 11  races, Brabham outscored the West German, 183-89, and clinched the championship  with his win at Columbus -- a race before the season ended.  </P> <P> Precedent is against Brabham, though. No driver since the late Mark Donohue in  1968 has been selected without having won either an Indy car or Winston Cup  race. Donohue won the Sports Car Club of America's Trans Am championship and,  like Brabham, 8 races in a row.  </P> <P> Elliott, 33, won his first Winston Cup championship after a year-long battle  with Wallace in which he won 6 of 29 races, 6 pole positions and for the fourth  straight year went over $1 million in earnings. He was also selected as  NASCAR's most popular driver for the fifth straight year.  </P> <P> Awesome Bill from Dawsonville, as the redhead from Georgia became known when he  won a million-dollar jackpot in 1985, finally overcame an inability to win on  short tracks, a shortcoming that prevented him from winning the Winston Cup in  1985 even though he won 11 other races.  </P> <P> He drove the family-prepared Ford Thunderbird to his first short-track win, at  Bristol, Tenn., and said, "I feel very relieved, like the whole world has been  lifted off my shoulders."  </P> <P> Although some Southern writers criticized Elliott for taking a conservative  11th-place finish in the year's final race at Atlanta, it enabled him to  collect the $375,000 winner's bonus as champion, even though Wallace won the  race.  </P> <P> Sullivan, 38, won 4 of 15 races, 9 pole positions, set 10 track records and  clinched the CART championship before the final race. This despite a slow start  during which the 1985 Indy 500 winner scored only 2 points in the first 3 races  while driving a Chevrolet-powered Penske PC-17.  </P> <P> After a major disappointment in the Indy 500, when he crashed after leading for  91 laps, Sullivan came back and won the next week at Milwaukee and then scored  a major win in the Marlboro 500 at Michigan -- a track owned by his boss, Roger  Penske. His average speed of 180.654 m.p.h. is a record for 500 miles.  </P> <P> Sullivan's late-season surge continued with consecutive wins on an oval at  Nazareth, Pa., and a road course at Laguna Seca. The win at Nazareth was also  special to Sullivan, since he is a part-owner of the track.  </P> <P> Racing's most eligible bachelor, Sullivan maintains homes in Los Angeles and  Aspen, Colo. He earned $1,217,000 during the season.  </P> <P> Wallace, 32, won 4 of the last 5 races to come within 24 points of catching  Elliott in Winston Cup points. It was the third-closest finish in NASCAR  history. Like Elliott, he won 6 races.  </P> <P> The redhead from Fenton, Mo., was the only driver in the series to win races on  a short track, superspeedway and road course, driving a Pontiac for former drag  racing champion Raymond Beadle's team. Last June, Wallace won the final Winston  Cup race at Riverside International Raceway, making it 2 in a row on the road  course.  </P> <P> The ballots are in and the name of the winner will be announced Saturday night  during the American Auto Racing Writers and Broadcasters Assn. banquet at the  Spruce Goose pavilion in Long Beach. Members of the AARWBA All-American team  will also be honored and the Jerry Titus Memorial Award will be presented to  the driver who received the most All-American votes.  </P> <P> MOTOCROSS -- One of the largest fields in motocross history will compete this  weekend in the opening round of the 13th annual Dodge Truck Golden State  Nationals at Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino. The 8-race series, sanctioned  by the Continental Motosport Club, will offer a $600,000 purse with an  international field set for the professional classes. Sportsmen and amateur  events will be held Saturday with the pros running Sunday.  </P> <P> Announced entries include such former national champions as Kawasaki's Jeff  Ward and Ron Lechien, KTM's Broc Glover, Suzuki's Johnny O'Mara and Yamaha's  Micky Dymond, plus defending CMC champions Kenny Zahrt and Sean Conley and  British champion Jamie Dobb.  </P> <P> VINTAGE RACING -- Riverside International Raceway will "reopen" once again this  weekend for the Vintage Auto Racing Assn. There will be 5 races each on  Saturday and Sunday on the new 2.5 mile track at the old facility. Cars will  range from a 1968 McLaren to a 1947 Bentley, with no cars newer than 1972  models eligible.  </P> <P> TRUCK PULL -- Anaheim Stadium will open its Speed Month this weekend with the  U.S. Hot Rod Grand Slam of Motorsports, featuring truck and tractor pulls  Saturday night and mud bog racing Sunday afternoon. A Mickey Thompson Off-Road  Gran Prix is set for Jan. 21, and a supercross on Jan. 28.  </P></p>

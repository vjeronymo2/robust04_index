General Principles of Administrative-Territorial Division </H5>   1. This Provisional Statute establishes the general  principles of administrative-territorial division of the city of  Moscow as an entity of the Russian Federation and city of  federal status.    2. The system of administrative-territorial division of the  city of Moscow is formed by:    the administrative okrug;    the municipal rayon.    3. The administrative okrug is an intracity administrative  unit whose system of organs of power is structured on the basis  of centralized government. The procedure for government of the  administrative okrug is established by a special statute  approved by the mayor of Moscow.    The city of Zelenograd forms a separate administrative  okrug.    The territory of the administrative okrug encompasses  municipal rayons.    4. A municipal rayon is an administrative-territorial unit  of  the city of Moscow within whose boundaries self-government of  the populace residing in the given territory is effected.    Municipal rayons are formed taking into account the  socioeconomic features of the applicable territories, their  city-planning and historical characteristics, and the presence  of residential buildings and facilities of municipal  infrastructure. The borders and designations of municipal rayons  are established by the Moscow City Duma upon recommendation of  the mayor of the city of Moscow.    A municipal rayon is divided into microrayons (settlements)  in which organs of territorial public self-government may be  created. The borders and designations of microrayons are  determined by the organs of local self-government of the  municipal rayon.  <H5>  II. Principles of the Organization of Local Self-Government </H5>   5. Local self-government in the territory of the city of  Moscow is effected on the basis of this Provisional Statute,  legislation of the Russian Federation, and normative acts of the  city of Moscow, taking into account its status as the capital of  the Russian Federation.    6. The organs of local self-government in the city of Moscow  are the municipalities, encompassing assemblies of  representatives of the populace of a municipal rayon (municipal  assemblies) and the head of the local administration (head of  the municipality).  <H5>  III. Local Administration </H5>   7. The activity of a local administration is directed by the  head of the municipality, who manages the municipal economy and  property, develops an estimate of income and expenditures,  ensures compliance with this estimate, and performs other  executive and administrative functions.    8. The head of a municipality is appointed by the mayor of  Moscow, upon coordination with the municipal assembly, from  among a field of candidates recommended by the prefect of the  administrative okrug.    In the event a majority of the members of the municipal  assembly fail to agree with the candidacy presented for the  position of head of municipality, the mayor has the right to  present this candidacy again or to present another candidacy.    If the above takes place, upon failure of a majority of the  members of the municipal assembly to agree with the candidacy  presented, the mayor appoints an acting head of municipality  within two weeks for a term of office of one year. The  individual so appointed enjoys all the rights and bears all the  responsibilities of head of the municipality.    A head of municipality may not engage in other paid  activity,  except for instructor, scientific, scholarly, or other creative  activity.    9. In the event of systematic failure to fulfill his  responsibilities or gross violation of these, the head of a  municipality may be discharged from his position by the mayor of  Moscow, including upon recommendation of the prefect of the  administrative okrug or based upon an appeal of the municipal  assembly adopted by two-thirds of the assembly members. The  aforementioned appeal is examined by the mayor within two weeks.    10. The head of a municipality issues directives on matters  within his competence as established by Russian Federation  legislation and normative acts of the city of Moscow.    11. The city administration and municipal assembly have the  right to supervise the activity of a head of municipality  according to procedure as envisaged by Russian Federation  legislation and normative acts of the city of Moscow.    12.

Resolutions of a municipal assembly adopted within the  framework of its competence are subject to mandatory execution  on the part of all enterprises, institutions, organizations,  organs of public territorial self-government, and citizens  located in the territory in question.    In the event a resolution of a municipal assembly  contradicts  Russian Federation legislation or normative acts of the city of  Moscow, or affects the interests of the city as a whole, it may  be suspended by the mayor of Moscow or by a responsible official  appointed by him.    19. A municipal assembly may be dissolved by the Moscow City  Duma in instances stipulated by Russian Federation legislation,  and also as the result of conduct of a local referendum on  confidence in the assembly. A municipal assembly may adopt a  resolution on early self-dissolution.    The election of municipal councilmen must be held not later  than three months from the date of adoption of the appropriate  Moscow City Duma resolution on dissolution of the municipal  assembly, announcement of the results of referendum, or adoption  of a decision on self-dissolution.  <H5>  V.

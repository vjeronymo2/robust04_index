			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST MEETS WEST IN THE PRACTICE OF DOCTOR-VIOLINIST;  </P> <P> MUSIC: MIXING VEDIC CHANTS WITH AMERICAN JAZZ, DR. L. SUBRAMANIAM MAY BE IN THE  VANGUARD OF A CROSS-CULTURAL TREND. HE'LL PERFORM TONIGHT AT THE WADSWORTH  THEATRE.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Festival appearance of Indian classical violinist Dr. L.  Subramaniam tonight marks an opportunity to hear the music of one of the area's  surprisingly underpublicized performers.  </P> <P> A resident of the San Fernando Valley since 1973, Lakshminarayana Subramaniam  spends eight to 10 months touring each year, with only rare public appearances  in the city he calls home.  </P> <P> "Yes, it's true," he said by phone from London. "I don't perform nearly as much  in Los Angeles as I would like. But most of the musicians I record with live on  the West Coast, as do many members of my family. And I love the weather. So I'm  very happy living there, even if I don't have enough opportunities to play my  music."  </P> <P> Tonight's Subramaniam concert at the Wadsworth Theatre will feature the violin  virtuoso in a program of Indian classical music performed with an unusual  ensemble of four percussionists.  </P> <P> "It is quite an unusual sound," Subramaniam said. "The percussion instruments  include the tavil -- a barrel-shaped drum played with a stick in the left hand  and pads on the right-hand fingers. Then there's the big, two-sided drum, the  mridangam, a clay pot drum called the ghatam and a tambourinelike thing called  a kanjeera. And, of course, I'll be playing solo violin. We'll do strictly  Indian classical music, probably with some ragas of my own composition."  </P> <P> Typical of Subramaniam, the ensemble represents an effort to stretch the  envelope of a musical form. Trained in both Indian classical and Western music  (he has a master's from CalArts in addition to an unused Indian degree in  medicine), he has been a persistent and hard-working advocate of innovation  within tradition, as well as of the interaction between musical cultures.  </P> <P> "As an oral tradition, Indian music is strongly based in tradition,"  Subramaniam said. "Even so, each new generation tries to push the boundaries of  the instrument and the music -- just as Paganini did with Western violin  playing.  </P> <P> "Violin and flute, for example, used to play roles as vocal accompanists in  Indian music. But now they've become solo instruments as well. In addition, we  still play ragas, but instead of playing in 1 1/2 octaves, we might play in six  octaves. And instead of playing an eight-beat rhythm cycle, we might play a 21  1/4-beat cycle.  </P> <P> "Tonight," Subramaniam continued, "I'll play with four percussionists -- an  unusual number of rhythm instruments -- which will call for careful  organization to get maximum benefit from the different sounds and timbres. All  of this is still well within the tradition of Indian classical music. What  we're trying to do is make new innovations and new forms of expression based on  that tradition."  </P> <P> Subramaniam's interest in expanding the expressive potential of his music  reaches well beyond its origins in the Indian oral tradition. In 1985, his  "Fantasy on Vedic Chants" was performed by Zubin Mehta and the New York  Philharmonic. (Since then, it has been performed in Moscow, Geneva, Paris and  New Delhi, but never, sadly, in Los Angeles.)  </P> <P> Other Subramaniam orchestral works blending Indian and Western elements include  a Double Concerto for Violin and Flute (commissioned and performed in the early  '80s by the New American Orchestra, with Hubert Laws as the other soloist), a  Double Concerto for Two Violins, and a Concerto for Violin and Orchestra.  </P> <P> As a fusion artist, he has recorded with a dynamic range of jazz musicians,  from Stephane Grappelli and Maynard Ferguson to Herbie Hancock, Larry Coryell,  Stanley Clarke and Tony Williams.  </P> <P> Subramaniam sees nothing especially unusual about such cross-cultural  activities. If anything, he perceives his work as the vanguard of an evolving  trend toward musical interactivity.  </P> <P> "To the casual listener, Indian music seems vastly different from Western  music," he observed. "But they had very similar origins. We believe our music  started with the Vedic chants -- first, via single-note lines, then, in order  to emphasize the texts by raising and lowering pitches, by three-note  tetrachords. Western music started similarly, with monotonal chant and  Gregorian chant, which then evolved through all the various stylistic changes  into the present.  </P> <P> "What people are doing now -- in classical music, jazz and rock -- is writing  pieces using elements from other cultures in an effort to create new styles.  Which makes sense, because there is so much traveling and so many opportunities  through records and video to hear what people are doing in different countries  that listeners no longer hear only the music from their own societies.  </P> <P> "I strongly believe," continued Subramaniam, "that there will be more and more  contact, and more interchange of ideas and concepts between cultures. And a  place like Los Angeles, where there are people from many different cultures, is  an especially fertile ground for this kind of creative interaction.  </P> <P> "My only hope," he concluded with a small chuckle, "is that my performance  tonight might generate some other opportunities -- perhaps via a performance of  my "Fantasy on Vedic Chants" -- to work on that interaction right here in my  own town."  </P></p>

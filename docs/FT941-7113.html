			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / German groups enter TV venture Bertelsmann and KirchGroup, Germany's two largest investors in private television, are to join Deutsche Telekom, the state telecommunications monopoly, in a multimedia venture aimed at delivering interactive television and other digital services to the home. The three have signed a memorandum of understanding to create a joint venture called Media Service, which will offer to manage and distribute new TV and telecommunications services on Deutsche Telekom's cable television network. Bertelsmann said the venture was the first step to a multimedia network that could include customised programming, interactive television and other services. The venture plans to establish a single service company to distribute new Pay-TV programmes, shopping-TV and other specialist channels on a ready-made communication network which includes 14m homes in Germany. Initial investment is expected to be around DM200m (Pounds 77.8m), and the joint venture is intending to develop its own decoder system, so that it can offer clients not only the cable distribution, but also a single sophisticated billing system, charging viewers according to the service they use. Deutsche Telekom, soon to be privatised under legislation currently going through the German parliament, is obviously keen to exploit its existing cable network as the dominant means of distributing digital television and specialist telecommunication services. The alternatives to cable distribution of digital television would be satellite distribution or terrestrial broadcasting, but Deutsche Telekom is clearly keen to exploit its existing monopoly position in German cable TV. Only in east Germany is there very low cable penetration in urban areas, with satellite broadcasting filling the gap. The deal brings together the Bertelsmann media empire, whose television interests include RTL, Germany's most profitable private broadcaster, and KirchGroup headed by Mr Leo Kirch, who is a leading shareholder in the SAT-1 station, and in the Axel Springer publishing group. Although the two groups are normally fierce rivals, they are both shareholders in Premiere pay-TV, whose technical expertise and marketing skills - with some 800,000 subscribers - could be used in the venture. All three companies were adamant yesterday that Media Services would be scrupulously neutral in its treatment of future clients, restricting itself to technical, administrative and distribution services. 'The new joint venture will not act as a broadcaster or provider of programming,' they said in a statement. That commitment is intended to ensure that the venture does not fall foul of Germany's strict controls over the broadcasting market, which forbids any one company from a majority shareholding in more than one station. The three founders said they would also be happy to accept further shareholders with minority stakes in the joint venture, which will be founded on April 1. It will be based in Berlin, and is intended to start operation by the middle of the year.</p>

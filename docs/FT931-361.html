			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Broken Hill edges to ADollars 226m for quarter BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's biggest company, has announced that net profits edged ahead by 0.8 per cent to ADollars 226m (USDollars 162m) for the third quarter to the end of February, on revenue up 13.6 per cent at ADollars 4.1bn. Operating profits increased by 3.5 per cent to ADollars 932m, reflecting favourable foreign exchange rates and an increase in revenue from its three main businesses - minerals, petroleum and steel. However, depreciation charges rose 8 per cent to ADollars 341m, largely reflecting the inclusion of NZ Steel, acquired last year. Interest expenses increased by 14 per cent to ADollars 144m, following the purchase of a 38 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing. The result was at the higher end of market expectations, but BHP appears likely to suffer a significant loss of revenue in the final quarter if steelworkers go ahead with a threatened 24-hour strike over pay. The steelworkers' union has warned that further industrial action could follow unless the dispute was settled. BHP said a strike would significantly reduce production and could threaten export sales. The third-quarter result takes net profits for the first nine months to ADollars 728m, 15 per cent over the period a year earlier. The directors declared a maintained interim dividend of 21 cents a share, fully franked. At the minerals division, net profits rose 10 per cent, before deducting outside equity interests, to ADollars 189m. It benefited from higher sales volumes for iron ore, manganese ore and thermal coal, plus higher copper prices, and an increased contribution from the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine in Papua New Guinea. On the same basis, steel profits increased by 5.6 per cent to ADollars 39.3m, helped by higher sales volumes and the inclusion of NZ Steel. However, BHP said the result was 'disappointing'. The petroleum division reported a 28 per cent increase to ADollars 106m, reflecting higher oil and liquefied natural gas production. Lower crude oil prices were more than offset by a reduction in the value of the Australian dollar against the US currency. BHP said 'significant progress' had been made towards finalising a production sharing contract for the prospective Dai Hung offshore oilfield in Vietnam. BHP Petroleum will operate the field, with a 43.75 per cent interest.</p>

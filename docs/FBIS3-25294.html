			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Durban Feb 14 SAPA -- State President F W de Klerk  says he does not regard Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's  declaration of a sovereign Zulu kingdom as secession, and says  the Zulu monarch's demands are negotiable. Mr de Klerk said the  government would officially respond to the Zulu monarch's claims  on Thursday [17 February].    In a joint statement by Mr de Klerk and the king after three  hours of talks in Durban on Monday, the state president said  "the new position" of the king and the kwaZulu government could  be fully accommodated within the interim constitution, and  possible amendments to it. He was referring to a strongly  worded memorandum by King Zwelithini on Monday in which he  declared Natal/kwaZulu an independent sovereign kingdom.    The joint statement after Monday's talks said the king and  his traditional prime minister, Inkatha Freedom Party leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, disagreed that the interim constitution  accommodated the Zulu nation. They insisted on a distinct  dispensation for the Zulu kingdom, the statement said. Mr de  Klerk undertook to examine the king's demands and respond fully  on Thursday.    Clear differences between the respective delegations over  the  Zulu monarch's demands were visible at their post meeting media  conference in the Durban City Hall.    King Zwelithini also dismissed a question that he was  seceding, saying he was claiming what rightfully belonged to the  Zulu nation. "I am asking for something that belongs to me and  my people -- no one else," the king said.    Asked whether he should not be discussing the future of the  Zulu kingdom with the African National Congress, the king said  tersely: "I am speaking to the head of state".    Mr de Klerk said he did not regard the king's claims as  secession, saying room could be created for "specific needs".  He added that under a federal system of government the needs of  South Africa's diverse population could be accommodated. Mr  Buthelezi said later he disagreed with Mr de Klerk, adding that  there was nothing "federalistic about this constitution".    Expanding on his king's demands, Mr Buthelezi said a Zulu  nation was an historical reality and "we have an identifiable  territory with the [word indistinct]".    Mr de Klerk maintained that negotiations were the only way  to  achieve an acceptable solution, saying there was a commitment  from both sides "otherwise we wouldn't be here".</p>

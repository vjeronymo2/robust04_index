			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN ATHLETIC ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> UTAH FALLS BEHIND, 27-0, THEN BEATS NEW MEXICO  </P> <P> No lead, apparently, is too big for New Mexico to lose.  </P> <P> Utah spotted the Lobos a 27-0 lead early in the second half of Saturday's  Western Athletic Conference game at Albuquerque, then came back to win, 29-27,  handing New Mexico its fifth consecutive defeat.  </P> <P> Charles Brown capped the comeback with a five-yard touchdown run with 1:07  left.  </P> <P> Utah improved to 4-6 overall and 2-5 in the WAC. New Mexico, which has blown  leads throughout the season, dropped to 2-9 and 1-5.  </P> <P> The Lobos appeared to be in total control after converting two Utah turnovers  into touchdowns to start the second half.  </P> <P> Mike Lewis started Utah's 21-point third-quarter comeback by intercepting a  pass from sophomore Marcus Goodloe at the New Mexico 24, setting up a  three-play drive that ended with a two-yard touchdown run by Brad Foster.  </P> <P> Utah defensive back Mark Swanson intercepted another pass by Goodloe to set up  a 20-yard, four-play drive that Darrel Hicks capped with a 21-yard touchdown  run.  </P> <P> Goodloe fumbled at the Utah 48 on a fourth-down play and the Utes again  capitalized with Mike Richmond connecting with Bryan Rowley on a 30-yard  touchdown pass play.  </P> <P> Buried in its own territory, New Mexico gave up a safety before Utah went 50  yards with the winning drive. A 17-yard run by tackle Wade Absher on a faked  pass and an 18-yard pass from Richmond to Greg Hoffman set up Brown's touchdown  run.  </P> <P> New Mexico's final bid ended when Jimmy Bellamy intercepted a Goodloe pass at  the New Mexico 45 with 42 seconds left.  </P> <P> Colorado State 31, Tulsa 13 -- The Rams (7-3) improved their chances for their  first bowl berth in 42 years with the victory over the Hurricane (2-8) in a  nonconference game at Fort Collins, Colo.  </P> <P> Colorado State, which made its only bowl appearance in the 1948 Raisin Bowl, is  a strong candidate for the Freedom Bowl.  </P> <P> The Freedom Bowl Committee will meet Monday to pick opponents.  </P> <P> Fullback Todd Yert scored three short-yardage touchdowns for the Rams and  cornerback Selwyn Jones sealed the victory when he intercepted a pass in the  end zone with 1:45 left.  </P></p>

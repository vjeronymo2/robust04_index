			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft plans DM1bn in non-core disposals METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the Frankfurt mining and industrial conglomerate which has in recent years been one of Germany's most acquisitive companies, is now planning large-scale disposals. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, told analysts yesterday the group plans to make disposals to raise around DM1bn (Dollars 606m) over the next two years. At the same time, capital investment is to be scaled back by 40 per cent to DM1bn for the current year. He gave no indication of which companies were for sale, apart from saying they would be non-core businesses and would not include any famous names. This rules out Buderus - the heating products company which now has a separate listing on the German stock-market - or any of the other industrial companies acquired last year from Stora of Sweden in a DM1.45bn acquisition. A list of potential sales targets has been drawn up, but a final decision on which of the group's 258 subsidiaries are to be sold has yet to be taken. Mr Schimmelbusch indicated that the group would be reducing the workforce - which rose through acquisitions from 38,173 to 62,547 over 1991-92 - during the the course of the year. But he gave no details of how many jobs would be cut and in which divisions. The disposals programme is a reaction to difficult market conditions for the Metallgesellschaft group. In the year to the end of September, group pre-tax profits fell 23 per cent to DM245m. This is the second successive year that profits have declined sharply against a background of falling metal prices and difficulties in the car components sector, which have meant that the group's Kolbenschmidt subsidiary lost DM88.6m last year before tax. Group sales last year fell 21 per cent to DM25.6bn. Analysts estimate that the group's net debt stands at DM2.1bn, compared to equity of DM3.7bn. The group's market capitalisation is DM2.9bn. Mr Schimmelbusch said that trading in the first four months of the current year was at the same, unsatisfactory level as in the previous year. The central problem was low base metal prices - afflicted by cheap imports from eastern Europe. Kaufhof, the large German retail group, yesterday reported that sales rose by 13 per cent in 1992 to DM20.3bn, up from DM18bn a year earlier. The company said the sales growth reflected its strategy of expanding into high-growth niche-retail markets, a segment of the business which accounted for 27 per cent of group sales, up from 23 per cent in the previous year. Department store sales accounted for 47 per cent of the total, down from 53 per cent.</p>

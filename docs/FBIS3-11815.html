Of the 13 institutions authorized by the Secretariat of  Finance and Public Credit (SHCP), at present only one  (Independencia) is operating, but it has encountered serious  difficulties in acquiring funds because the SOFOL's are not  recognized in financial legislation.    Another serious problem, which could become the source of  many conflicts in the future, is that existing general  regulations do not specify the SOFOL's capitalization indexes,  which further increases the distrust that other lending  institutions have toward them.    Furthermore, the only way to guarantee the long-term  credibility of these institutions is through their operations  and internal structure, because even though they are regulated  by the National Banking Commission (CNB) and by the SHCP, Mexico  has no insurance or legal guarantee to prevent these new  organizations from perpetrating frauds, which commonly occur in  the United States, where they have existed for years.    Nevertheless, although their levels of trustworthiness have  not even been established, these new institutions are already  encountering funding problems due to the lack of information  that exists concerning them. "That is one of our biggest  problems," explained Jose Luis Rion, director of Independencia  and president of the Mexican Association of Limited Purpose  Financial Corporations (AMSFOL), which was created on 2 March  during the seminar "New Financial Institutions in Mexico,"  sponsored by the Training Institute.    According to Rion, the nonbank banks will have a difficult  time acquiring, within the short term, options that will lead to  legislation through which they can acquire funds by issuing  negotiable documents or obtaining credit from other national and  foreign financial institutions, and he explained that in  Independencia's case "we have financed ourselves solely with our  resources and we know that we are going to suffer losses during  the first two years."    Despite these initial prospects, the nonbank banks promise  to  become highly profitable institutions in our country, which is  why many investors are asking themselves: What are these new  institutions really all about?    David Harris, a member of the Dechert, Price, and Rhoads law  firm and an expert on the subject of nonbank banks in the United  States, explained that in the strictest sense of the word a  nonbank bank is a bank because it has the same powers and  privileges that a bank has, with the sole exception that it  limits its activities to a sector and a specific function. This  explains the origins of the term nonbank bank or bank that is  not a bank.    He continued: Due to the ease with which they escaped the  Bank Holding Company Law of 1956, which imposed significant  regulations and many prohibitions on the owners of true banks,  in the early eighties, following the widespread emergence of  institutions that acquired the status of nonbank banks in the  United States, Congress decided in 1987 to prohibit the creation  of new nonbank banks and concurrently added several new  restrictions to those that already existed by reducing certain  status benefits.    According to David Harris, one of the U.S. Government's  greatest concerns regarding the nonbank banks is how these  institutions use credit based on the idea that the deposits they  obtain must be protected. In fact, this has proven to be of  much concern because in the United States these intermediary  organizations have perpetrated many frauds due to the  difficulties they have encountered in obtaining legislation  because they are difficult to define. Nevertheless, Harris said  that these organizations have become decisive factors in the  competitiveness of many U.S. companies.    Harris said that Mexico is now beginning to experience what  the United States has experienced for many years: the opening of  its financial system to new intermediary organizations like  these. Therefore, the U.S. experience in this area should be  taken into consideration so that Mexico can make the best of it.    Perhaps the most important nonbank bank in the world is  General Electric Capital, a branch of the General Electric (GE)  company. According to James Paulsfood, who is in charge of  Capital's retail businesses and credit cards in Mexico, his  organization has provided considerable financial support to the  SOFOL's. He says that thanks to this, Capital's active capital  has increased considerably.    In view of these prospects, these new financial institutions  constitute a great opportunity for Mexico to support the  productivity of national companies as long as they manage to  make the new financial institutions trustworthy for the public  that is to use them and for the credit institutions that are to  help fund them.</p>

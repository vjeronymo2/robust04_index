			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vladimir Korolev from the "Today's World" </F> program]    [Text] The United States is appealing to the DPRK to allow  international inspections of its nuclear sites [haek taesang].  An official spokesman for the U.S. State Department has  reportedly issued a statement making this appeal. Station  commentator Vladimir Korolev writes on this:    What on earth is this story about? The United States is  insisting that the DPRK should dissolve the suspicion of its  nuclear weapons development by allowing international  inspections. Pyongyang and Washington have held talks on the  nuclear issue. They reached a principled agreement [wonchikchok  habui] on the nuclear issue through the two rounds of talks.    Pyongyang is pointing out that the two military sites [kun  taesang] of the DPRK cannot be included in the list of nuclear  inspection targets.    Western countries still entertain the suspicion that nuclear  weapons are being developed in some nuclear sites of the DPRK.  The United States is persistently saying that it will not  continue talks with the DPRK unless international inspections of  some nuclear sites are conducted. In the third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks, both sides' delegates should discuss  improvement in relations between Washington and Pyongyang.    The U.S. State Department spokesman has reportedly warned  that UN sanctions against the DPRK may follow.    A treaty on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was  likely to be signed at every occasion, but the plan for it  always went wrong.    I think it is time to assume a more constructive  [konsolchok]  position in resolving the nuclear issue.</p>

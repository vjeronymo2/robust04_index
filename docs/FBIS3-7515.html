The DP has had to change part of its North Korean policy  after a Pyongyang official threatened to turn Seoul into "a sea  of fire" last week.    The party had insisted on a peaceful solution of the nuclear  issue through dialogue.    The party used to stress an "independent" diplomacy, calling  for talks among the three concerned parties--South and North  Korea and the United States.    But signs of changes in the DP's stance on the North Korean  issue have been increasingly conspicuous since last week.    Some DP lawmakers have carefully raised the opinion that the  government should refer the nuclear problem to two-way talks  between Pyongyang and Washington.    They insist that exchange of special envoys between South  and  North Korea should not be a precondition to the IAEA's  full-scale inspection of the North's nuclear facilities.    "Instead, the government has to concentrate on closer  economic exchange with the North," a senior DP official said.    "The principle of independent diplomacy should be changed,  depending on the circumstances," he said.    DP leaders have rushed to plan a strategy to cope with the  rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula.    Members of the DP Supreme Council have met every day since  last week to decide the party's official position toward the  ongoing crisis in the inter-Korean relations.    However, they have failed to reach consensus so far because  of sharply dissenting views among them.    The DP leaders complained that the Seoul government is  largely responsible for both the deadlock in the nuclear problem  and the rupture of the inter-Korean talks.    "Our security-related authorities lack consistent North  Korean policies. They have vacillated between tough and  moderate lines," a Supreme Council member said.    Despite some signs of change, the DP remains unchanged in  its  stance toward the North Korean problem in many areas.</p>

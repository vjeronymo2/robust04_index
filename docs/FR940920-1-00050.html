			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has determined that additional dioxin/furan control is achievable with activated carbon injection, which is the basis for MACT for Hg, as discussed above. The EPA's analysis of test data from a recent testing program at an MWC at the Camden County, New Jersey, facility and other facilities indicates that the injection of activated carbon into the flue gas of an SD-based scrubbing system provides additional removal of dioxins/furans (greater than 50 percent additional control over levels achieved with SD/ESP systems alone). As such, the EPA believes a dioxin/furan level of approximately 10 ng/dscm total mass (which represents a 99-percent reduction) is achievable for MWC's using GCP and equipped with SD/FF's and activated carbon injection. Because carbon injection is being proposed as part of the basis for MACT for Hg, the EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants based on carbon injection. The EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans on both a TEQ basis and a total mass basis. Based on the EPA's analysis of an average TEQ ratio, the 10 ng/dscm total mass emission level translates to 0.16 TEQ. However, because there is uncertainty about the ratio, the proposed MACT floor for dioxins/furans on a TEQ basis is 0.20 ng/dscm. Using the average TEQ ratio, 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ is equivalent to about 13 ng/dscm total mass dioxins/furans. Therefore, the EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants at a level of 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass. Sources may comply with either format of the limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, since the activated carbon injection technology does not have a long-term record of commercial application in the United States and since the 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass standard is restrictive, the EPA is proposing a 3-year optimization schedule for activated carbon injection applied at initial subpart Eb applications. All affected facilities commencing construction after September 20, 1994, but on or before September 22, 1997 would be required to meet a standard of 0.50 ng/dscm TEQ or 30 ng/dscm total mass for the first 3 years following the date of initial startup. Thereafter, the standard would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass. For all affected facilities commencing construction after September 22, 1997, the standard at startup would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass. Starting in 1994, MWC units with activated carbon injection technology will be initiating commercial operation. As dioxin/furan data become available from MWC's operating with carbon injection technology, the EPA will reconsider the appropriateness of the 3-year optimization schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Nitrogen Oxides. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The average NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission level for MWC's without postcombustion NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control (at both small and large MWC plants) is 225 ppmv.

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Steeper GDP drop expected FORECASTERS have scaled back their expectations of Britain's economic performance this year and next, according to data released by the Treasury yesterday. The Treasury's latest survey of independent forecasts, compiled last month, showed that on average economists now expect gross domestic product to fall this year by 0.2 per cent and GDP growth in 1993 to be only 2 per cent. The June survey of 30 forecasters in the City, economic research institutes and academia pointed to growth of 0.4 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next year. The increased pessimism has caused the forecasters to revise upwards their expectations of unemployment and the government's public-sector borrowing requirement. The latest consensus is that unemployment, which was 2.72m in June, will rise to 2.88m in the final quarter of this year and increase to 2.97m by the end of next year. In June, the forecasters predicted unemployment of 2.85m at the end of this year and 2.87m in the final quarter of next year. The survey found that, on average, forecasters now expect the PSBR to total Pounds 31.7bn in the current financial year and Pounds 36.4bn in 1993-94, up from June's estimates. Consensus expectations for inflation have fallen to 3.8 per cent by the end of this year.</p>

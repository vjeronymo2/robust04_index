			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca to build plant in China Zeneca announced plans yesterday to build a Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m) herbicide plant in China. The company has signed a memorandum of understanding with China's Chemical Industry ministry and is now looking for a site and a joint venture partner. Zeneca, which demerged from ICI last year, said it expects the plant to be on stream by the start of 1996. It will be able to make 3,000 tonnes annually of Paraquat, the active ingredient in some of the company's herbicides. Zeneca does not reveal its world output of the chemical, but the new plant would join others in the UK, US, Brazil, Japan, Thailand and Malaysia. A new UK plant is planned to produce 8,000 tonnes a year. China is one of the fastest growing markets with demand for non-selective herbicides such as Paraquat having doubled in the past four years. 'Rising prosperity in China will increase the demand for food in terms of both quantity and quality,' said Mr Gordon Barker, business director of Zeneca Agrochemicals. 'This demand will be met by greater use of modern methods of agricultural production.' This is the second announcement in a week by Zeneca of expansion in China. On January 13 it announced the launch of its diprivane anaesthetic. Wood Mackenzie, the stockbroker, estimates the world market for paraquat at Dollars 460m a year.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: End is near for dogged prime minister MR Pierre Beregovoy can take cold comfort when he steps down as as French prime minister from the fact that the new conservative government will have little choice but to carry on his own economically rigorous policies. Along with several other senior Socialists, Mr Beregovoy was last night struggling to win a parliamentary seat. He found himself in the unaccustomed position of having to go through to the second round, next Sunday, to contest a seat in Nevers, where he is mayor. The last time Mr Beregovoy fought a general election, he won his seat in the first round. He called on voters last night to 'prevent the right from exercising a power without sharing or counterweight'. The right has promised to make some fine adjustments to Mr Beregovoy's policies, such as accelerating his partial privatisations. But the broad approach, especially on the firm franc, will probably be the same. This is partly because the disciplines of membership of the European Monetary System leave almost no margin for manoeuvre and partly because the right's solutions to unemployment are not very different from the failed prescriptions that contributed to the Socialists' downfall. It is also a tribute to Mr Beregovoy's doggedness in holding a firm economic line in a Socialist government that did not always give him whole-hearted support, from the time he succeeded Mr Jacques Delors as finance minister in 1984 and became prime minister last April. The one achievement for which he has said he wants to be remembered is the control of inflation, now at a mere 2.1 per cent, well under half its mid-1980s level. Mr Beregovoy, 67, has been an effective prime minister in that he was neither brilliant enough to get in President Francois Mitterrand's way, a mistake which cost former prime minister Michel Rocard his job, nor erratic, a mistake which led to the dismissal of Mr Beregovoy's immediate predecessor, Mrs Edith Cresson. Steering this middle way has made Mr Beregovoy appear sometimes unexciting, a criticism also levied at his possible successor, Mr Edouard Balladur. The moral could be that a low profile is a useful survival quality for French prime ministers. Yet despite his alleged greyness, Mr Beregovoy has also been an electoral asset for the Socialists as one of the few members of the outgoing government to have solid working class credentials. His background is very different from that of many of his colleagues and advisers, who tend to have bourgeois origins and a training in the elite public administration colleges. Mr Beregovoy never even went to high school and failed the entrance exam for St Cyr military academy. The son of a Ukrainian grocer, he started as a machine tool operator before joining the SNCF railways, where he became a prominent trade union member, then went to a junior management job at Gaz de France. He went into politics as a member of the left-wing Parti Socialiste Unifie, a precursor of the present Socialist party, where he worked for Pierre Mendes-France, the one-time prime minister whom he cites as his mentor. Mr Beregovoy joined the inner circle of French politics as Mr Mitterrand's chief of staff in 1981, just as the Socialist president first took office. It was from there that he later went to the Finance Ministry. Mr Beregovoy is said to suspect that some have held his lack of civil service education against him. Indeed, in one widely quoted jibe, a graduate of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration is said to have remarked: 'You only have to look at Mr Beregovoy's socks to see that he is an honest man.' That remark has lost some of its significance since he admitted receiving an interest-free loan from a later disgraced businessman. Whoever Mr Mitterrand chooses from the UDF/RPR coalition as Mr Beregovoy's successor, the style is at any rate likely to switch back in line with France's traditional ruling elite. The new incumbent might have smarter socks, but he is likely to tread roughly the same policy path.</p>

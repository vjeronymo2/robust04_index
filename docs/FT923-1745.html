			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Pension fund theft insurance launched THE PROVISION of unusual business at Lloyd's of London took a new turn yesterday with an underwriter launching the first known insurance against pension fund theft. Syndicate 1007, managed by Spreckley Villers Hunt &amp; Co, is the lead underwriter for insurance cover that will protect pension fund assets for up to Pounds 50m. The policy will provide 'first party' cover, which should permit prompt reimbursement once theft has been established without the need for civil or criminal action. It defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of pension fund property with the intention permanently to deprive the assured of that property. It will apply to any theft by people or organisations that have control over or access to pension fund assets. They include trustees and their employees, administrators, investment managers, actuaries and directors. Applicants will have to complete an eight-page form asking for details of those involved in handling pension fund assets, how the fund manages and handles investments and whether it takes part in stock lending. Existing insurance cover has been available only for negligent errors or omissions by pension fund trustees and not for deliberate fraud. Mr Simon Haggas, an assistant underwriter, said the new idea was prompted by the plight of the Maxwell pensioners. 'We were kicking ourselves about why we had not done it before,' he said. 'It takes something like the Maxwell affair to make it happen.' Asked whether the introduction of the cover was a publicity stunt, he said: 'Oh, absolutely not. We are in it for the financial gain. We want to make money out of the product.' Losses caused by Hurricane Andrew in the Bahamas, Florida and Louisiana will top Dollars 10bn, the Thomas Howell Group, loss adjusters, warned yesterday. Estimates have been raised in Florida and delayed by slowness in claims while residents concern themselves with food and shelter.</p>

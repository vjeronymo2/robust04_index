			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Waigel announces new DM12bn package Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday announced a DM12bn (Pounds 4.9bn) package of new measures to help revive economic activity in east Germany, but insisted it would make no difference to his net borrowing requirement next year, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The key element in the plan is DM10bn to support indigenous east German entrepreneurs, by increasing the state subsidy for their investments in manufacturing industry to 20 per cent, up to a maximum DM1m per project. The aim is to promote the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises. The package is intended as part of the government's contribution to its planned 'solidarity pact' with German employers and trade unions.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier in Italian acquisition Reed Elsevier, the international publisher, has taken its first move into the legal publishing market in Italy with the purchase of a 40 per cent stake in the Giuffre group which has offices in Milan and Rome. Reed is buying the stake in Giuffre Editore, a family-owned company, and its sister company Mori which in the year to December 1992 had sales of L102bn (Pounds 43.4m). No price was announced but it is believed the stake cost Reed, which has been expanding its international legal publishing operations, just under Pounds 30m. Giuffre specialises in law, economics and political science. It claims Italian market leadership in legal publishing for the university and professional market. The company has a backlist of about 5,000 titles and 60 journals. Reed Elsevier's main legal publishers are Butterworths in the UK and the Commonwealth and Editions Techniques, the French legal publisher bought earlier this year in a deal worth Pounds 77m.</p>

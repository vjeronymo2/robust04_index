			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: Tenneco chief steps down Mr Mike Walsh, one of the most highly-regarded executives in the US, is to step down as chief executive of the Tenneco conglomerate. He and his family want to devote themselves full-time to the treatment of a tumour discovered on his brain last year. The move will come as a blow to Tenneco, owner of the troubled Case agricultural machinery business, because Mr Walsh was in the middle of restructuring the group. Mr Walsh will be succeeded as chief executive by Mr Dana Mead, 58, the group's president and chief operating officer.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Air France plan likely to provoke EU row: French government agrees fresh capital for state-owned airline to aid restructuring moves The French government is set to provoke a head-on confrontation with the Brussels authorities and European countries, including Britain, by agreeing to inject up to FFr20bn (Pounds 2.31bn) in Air France, the troubled French national airline. The government said yesterday it would approve a significant recapitalisation for Air France if the state-owned airline's 42,000 employees and their unions approved a restructuring plan drawn up by Mr Christian Blanc, the airline's new chairman. The government refused to give details of the recapitalisation and restructuring programme which the airline will unveil today. But it said Air France had asked for 'a very large sum'. French government officials would not confirm press reports that the airline was seeking a FFr20bn capital injection. 'In the current state of things I cannot confirm this figure. I simply want to tell you that the state has decided to do its duty by Air France,' a spokesman said. The EU has recently recommended an end to all state aid for European airlines, but has agreed to allow financially strapped national carriers to receive one last package of state support as long as they launch a thorough restructuring programme. But the size of the Air France plan is expected to set off a storm in Brussels and other European capitals. The UK government, along with British Airways and British Midland Airways, has been stepping up its campaign against state subsidised European national carriers, claiming that state aid was distorting competition in the liberalised single European aviation market. Air France, which lost FFr7.5bn last year and has debts of FFr37bn, has been struggling to put together a restructuring programme to restore the airline to a competitive footing and return it to profit. An earlier restructuring programme involving 4,000 job cuts was rejected by unions and led to the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali as Air France chairman, after the government refused to back his strategy. The latest attempt is not expected to involve compulsory redundancies, but significant internal organisational changes. Both the French government and the airline's new management have been at pains to avoid another politically damaging confrontation with the airline's workforce and unions. Mr Blanc's proposals are also expected to include eventual employee share ownership in exchange for wage cuts and other productivity improvements. The government indicated yesterday it would inject funds into the airline in tranches. The first would follow approval by the unions of the restructuring plan, and subsequent tranches would be subject to the implementation of the programme. Air France, which has lost money since 1989, has already received state aid totalling FFr5.84bn in 1991 and 1992. The EU is currently investigating another FFr1.5bn aid package made last year.

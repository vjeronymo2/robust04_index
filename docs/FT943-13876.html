			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Envoys missing in Algeria There was no sign of the ambassadors of Oman and Yemen to Algeria who were reported missing on Friday, but the Omani envoy was reported safe. The burnt-out car in which Mr Kacem Askar Djebrane and Mr Hilal Ben Salem were travelling was discovered 10km from Khemis El Kechna, at the heart of a region known as the 'death triangle', south east of Algiers. The area has over the past year been the scene of bloody encounters between the security forces and supporters of radical Islamic movements who have, on and off, controlled some of the town and stretches of the countryside. The Oman news agency said yesterday Mr Bin Salem was 'safe and sound and in good health'. It said it had learned from Algerian security sources that the ambassador was safe but it gave no word on his whereabouts. Violence has risen in recent weeks although the strict media censorship makes the task of estimating the exact level of violence ever more difficult.</p>

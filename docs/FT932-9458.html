			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Surprise repo rate cut EUROMARK futures rose sharply across the board yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised financial markets by cutting its repo rate more aggressively than had been expected, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank lowered the repo rate, which sets the cost of lending short-term funds to commercial banks, by 11 basis points to 7.60 per cent on both 14-day and 28-day maturities With German call money hovering at around 7.73 per cent at the start of the day, there had been little expectation of a significant easing in policy, since official interest rates and market interest rates were more or less in line. However, yesterday's move by the Bundesbank raised new expectations that the official discount rate, which sets the floor for money market rates, will be cut at the central bank's next council meeting on May 19. German call money yester-day fell to a close of 7.68 per cent, putting it back to the level at which it stood before German unification. One London-based dealer suggested yesterday that pressure will come on the lower rate floor once the cost of overnight money has fallen to 7.50 per cent. The betting in some banks yesterday was that, if this was the case, the discount rate would be cut by 25 basis points on that day. The cut raised expectations that the Bundesbank is easing policy more aggressively than had been expected. The June Euromark contract rose 8 basis points on the day to finish at 92.91. This assumes that there are another 29 basis points to come off three-month money in the next four weeks. French franc futures rallied even more strongly in the belief that yesterday's move opens the way for more cuts in France's official interest rates. The June Pibor contract was up 18 basis points on the day to stand at 92.66. The September contract climbed 17 basis points to end at 93.40. Sterling markets were quiet following several days in which speculation has spread that there will be another cut in UK base rates this year. Three-month money was a fraction tighter on the day, finishing at 5 15/16 per cent from a previous close of 5 7/8 per cent. This was partly due to difficulties removing a shortage of Pounds 600m in the discount market, for which there was late assistance of Pounds 210m. The overnight rate was at 6.50 per cent at one stage of trading.</p>

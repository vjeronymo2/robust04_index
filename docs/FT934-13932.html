			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (3): Business continues to dominate the ballot box / A look at politics in the territory FORGET about trying to contact the top executives of Bermuda's leading companies on election day. Most will be out at the polling booths, not just marking their ballots but endlessly shaking voters' hands in their role as candidates. The connection between politics and business was reinforced earlier this month when the United Bermuda Party (UBP) re-established the grip it has held on power since the country became self-governing in 1968. The UBP is ideologically right of centre and unashamedly pro-business. Many of its members of parliament and even ministers are senior business people or partners within the professions. Potential conflicts of interest abound in Bermuda. If an individual is not wearing two hats, then the chances are that she or he has a sibling or cousin in high places who is. Even the opposition Progressive Labour Party (PLP) is beginning to attract professionals such as accountants and lawyers as candidates, increasing the inter-connections between business and politics. That does not mean that string-pulling always works. In spite of lobbying efforts by the country's three home-grown banks which have long supported a strong degree of economic protectionism, a new trust law was introduced in 1991 which has opened up trust work to other local and international companies. Local interests in some areas are beginning to give way to more global ones. The unanswered question is how far Bermuda could survive a change of government. Talk to most civil servants on the island, and they will insist that they are independent and willing to serve whichever party comes to power. But this system has not yet been tested, and a speech made shortly before the election by one senior PLP official hinted that certain public servants in senior positions might expect to be changed because they had become too closely allied with the UBP. A change in Bermuda's political position could also pose a challenge for the island's future as an offshore financial centre for international business. While many executives publicly remain detached or neutral on political matters, privately many express concerns that the PLP's ascendancy would generate a rush to the airport. The rhetoric in the October election from the UBP made frequent reference to 'the islands to the south', pandering to fears of a repeat of the experience in countries such as the Bahamas, which lost much of its international status after the economic reforms introduced by the Pindling administration in the early 1970s. Ironically, much of it ended up in Bermuda. The UBP reinforced its message with constant references as to whether the PLP was 'fit to govern'. These claims of incompetence have been vigorously rejected by the PLP, which says it recognises the contribution of offshore businesses to the economy and would do nothing to harm them. It has, however, said it will place greater emphasis on its planned programme of 'Bermudianisation' which would return the country to its own citizens. Issues of race are frequently discussed. While many white Bermudians and expatriates will insist that racism and discrimination do not exist, few blacks would agree. Few hold senior positions and many parts of the island have concentrations of one ethnic group or another, 30 years after desegregation was formally introduced. Concerns about race may explain why the PLP boosted its share of the popular vote from 37 per cent to 46 per cent, while other minority parties or individuals outside the two-party system were voted out of office. The PLP, which has remained in permanent opposition, still draws its support predominantly from the black community and blue-collar voters although it has now begun to garner professionals as voters too. Drugs and education were among the more significant election issues raised by the party. In a country of just 60,000 people, parochial concerns were also important, such as pledges that St George's, at the eastern end of the island, would be the exclusive harbour for a cruise-ship. Many political activists say that Bermudians expect to be personally canvassed by their politicians One of the most widely discussed issues in this year's election was the future of the US naval air force base in the east, which brings substantial revenue to the country and runs the civilian air traffic control and airport maintenance that is essential to Bermuda's infrastructure. Warnings of a US withdrawal have generated frenetic travelling to Washington DC to negotiate better terms. Bermuda's political structures have a number of peculiar features. The 40-person assembly which meets once a week has some of the smallest constituencies in the world. Most hold less than 2,000 voters and each has two seats - an apparent legacy of the time when landowners had extra votes which were converted after desegregation into a seat for blacks within each district. Then there is the link with Britain. Removing Bermuda from the sterling area during the 1970s - when the country pegged its currency to the US dollar - is one of only the most obvious indications that the island looks at least as much to the west as east across the Atlantic towards its old coloniser. Yet the post of governor remains - appointed by the British and paid for by Bermuda. Lord Waddington, the former British home secretary and leader of the house of Lords, who took over the job in summer last year, may have attempted to be more informal than his predecessors, but he retains control of foreign affairs, internal security, defence and powers of pardon. He is reluctant to be drawn on the subject of eventual independence, but says: 'Those who support the status quo would say Bermuda has it both ways: it is self-governing and has stability ultimately underwritten by Britain. 'It has found it convenient to remain a dependent territory.'</p>

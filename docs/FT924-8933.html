			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Tory rifts reopen over Europe amid calls for reshuffle FRESH Conservative party skirmishing over Europe broke out yesterday, testing the authority of Mr John Major amid continuing confusion over when Britain will complete ratification of the Maastricht treaty. As the prime minister faced calls from the right wing for a cabinet reshuffle, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, appeared to retreat on a concession offered last week to Euro-sceptic MPs. He suggested on BBC radio that the Commons' consideration of the Maastricht bill and the Danish referendum were 'not interdependent'. However, Downing Street again said it regarded May as the most likely time for the Danish poll and that would coincide with the Commons third reading of the ratification legislation. The Maastricht bill would then go to the House of Lords in time to complete all parliamentary stages by next October or November. Underlining the conflicting pressures on Mr Major, the apparent delay - even if watered down - has angered the pro-European wing of the party and dismayed Foreign Office ministers. Mr Ray Whitney, MP for Wycombe and prominent Europe enthusiast, said: 'We are all less happy than we would have been and we do have a problem.' Mr Peter Temple-Morris, MP for Leominster, said the delay would make the Danes 'feel stronger than they actually are'. However, an equally ferocious warning not to be cowed by pro-Europeans will come on Thursday when Mr Major addresses the 60-strong Thatcherite '92 group' of Tory MPs. Senior 92 members are calling for the promotion of right-wing ministers such as Mr John Redwood, local government minister, to replace the more pro-European Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, and Mr John Gummer, agriculture secretary. They are also calling for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to be 'reined in'. One 92 member who spoke publicly yesterday, Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North, said: 'We have a centre-left cabinet and a centre-right parliamentary party . . . The prime minister should have an early opportunity to redress that balance and have a cabinet more representative of popular and party opinion.' Some right-wingers regard concessions by Mr Major as a quid pro quo for their helping him avoid defeat after Wednesday's Maastricht debate. But these are likely to inflame the party's internal rows. Mr George Robertson, a Labour party foreign affairs spokesman, said the prime minister was 'impotent', with his 'twisting and turning complicating and worsening all the stresses and tensions which threaten Europe's ability to solve its deep troubles'.

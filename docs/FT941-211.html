			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Cocom sets stage for successor Member nations of Cocom - which curbed cold war exports to communist countries - agreed yesterday on the eve of the organisation's demise to continue talks to establish a successor organisation. The new body is to restrain arms sales and the transfer of sensitive technology to countries which threaten peace in the Korean peninsula, the Gulf and South Asia. Cocom - the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls - is being wound up today after 47 years of co-ordinating a western embargo of militarily sensitive items and technology to the Communist bloc. Its 17 member nations met yesterday in The Hague to confirm its fate and set the stage for further talks. But with its strategic rationale no longer tenable as the cold war disappeared, Cocom has so far been unable to agree on the precise shape and power of its successor organisation. Agreement was reached in The Hague on a framework for the new arrangement, but the goals and principles are still under discussion. Technical working groups will continue to meet and it is hoped the new organisation will be in place by autumn. While talks continue, Cocom members agreed to maintain the current lists of proscribed products (industrial, military and atomic energy lists) and to allow each member country the discretion to issue licences under national laws. The Cocom secretariat in Paris will continue to monitor licensing during this transition period. In line with this, the US Commerce Department announced last night it would remove individual licensing requirements on virtually all low level telecommunications equipment and computers to former communist countries, except North Korea. Mr Robert Rubin, National Economic Council chairman, said by removing controls that were no longer needed, the US could focus on real security and proliferation concerns. 'In the post-cold war world we face new threats of proliferation and we must be vigilant in respect to restricting access of sensitive technologies to countries like Iran,' he said. Items controlled because of proliferation concerns - chemical weapon precursors, viruses, supercomputers and sensitive electronic equipment - will remain subject to licensing requirements. Controls on items that help develop weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles will also be retained.</p>

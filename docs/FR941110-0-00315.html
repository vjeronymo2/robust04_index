			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first sentence of &sect;&sect;905.1008(d)/906.8(d) modifies the interim rule's provision restricting eligibility to applicants who have been current in their lease obligations for a period of at least six months. If a family has been in residence for less than six months, the homeownership plan may now allow eligibility on the basis of lease compliance for that lesser period. The final rule also adds language that is appropriate in this context to existing Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyers who may elect to terminate their present Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyer agreements in favor of purchase under a Section 5(h) homeownership plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to several comments, the affordability standard of &sect;&sect;905.1008(e)/906.8(e) has been modified. In the interim rule, the cost-to-income ratio_based on mortgage principal and interest, plus insurance and real estate taxes (PITI)_was 30 percent, but a percentage figure of 35 percent was allowed with special justification. As aptly pointed out by some commenters, the interim rule did not say what was required to justify the 35 percent exception ratio or how maintenance, utilities and (if applicable) common ownership fees were to be taken into account. The final rule's revised formula now states that the average monthly estimate for the total amount of all of the stated types of homeownership costs_including maintenance and utilities and (if applicable) cooperative, condominium or homeownership association fees, as well as PITI_may not exceed 35 percent of the applicant's adjusted income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter urged that separate affordability standards be adopted for single-family and multifamily properties, with the latter to take into account cooperative or condominium carrying charges, as well as debt service payments on individual mortgages or share loans. For single-family houses, this commenter recommended that a PITI cost-to-income ratio of more than 35 percent be authorized, citing the fact that, in the general housing market, the current ratio among first-time homebuyers tends to be higher. For multifamily properties, a two-part affordability standard was recommended: (1) the ability of homebuyers to meet their financial obligations on an individual family basis; and (2) the ability of the homebuyers involved to meet their financial obligations on an aggregated basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the prospective purchasers under the Section 5(h) Program are low-income families, the Department believes that it would be imprudent to allow a cost-income ratio of more than 35 percent for either single-family or multifamily housing. The final rule requires that, if applicable, cooperative, condominium or other homeownership association fees must be taken into account. This is sufficient to address the financial viability of multifamily properties on both an individual and aggregated basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g) of these sections simplifies the requirements concerning preference among the various residency-based categories of potentially eligible applicants. This affords each HA broad discretion in defining, on the basis of present residency status, which categories of residents are eligible to apply under the particular homeownership plan, and in establishing preferences among those categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For occupied units, the rule continues to require a preference for the existing occupants. If such occupants cannot meet the other eligibility requirements, or do not desire to purchase their units, a further provision of the rule (&sect;&sect;905.1010/906.10) prohibits their involuntary displacement to make the units available for sale to other families. Consequently, the question of other residency-based eligibility and preference categories is pertinent only if the homeownership plan contemplates sale of vacant units, or if an existing occupant voluntarily agrees to vacate and relocate, pursuant to &sect;&sect;905.1010/906.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For vacant units, the only residency-based preference category that is mandated by the final rule consists of residents of the HA's other public or Indian housing units. The HA may limit eligibility to applicants in that category only, in which case the question of further residency-based eligibility or preference categories will not arise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, subject to the preference for families who are already residents of public or Indian housing, the homeownership plan may, at the option of an HA, also allow application for purchase of vacant units by families in either or both of the other residency-based categories permitted under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section: (1) Section 8 residents, and (2) other low-income families who are neither public or Indian housing nor Section 8 residents at time of application or selection, subject to their completion of the prescribed minimum period of public or Indian housing or Section 8 residence prior to conveyance. For example, families in the second category_families who are not presently public or Indian housing or Section 8 residents_would have to take occupancy of the Section 5(h) unit under a lease-purchase agreement, providing for completion of an initial period of public or Indian housing tenancy (30 days or more, as prescribed by the homeownership plan) prior to conveyance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in &sect;&sect;905.1008(h)/906.8(i), the rule does not preclude any other types of eligibility and preference factors that the HA may wish to establish in its homeownership plan, if consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements. For example, in a situation where vacant units comprising only a portion of an otherwise occupied development are to be offered for sale, the homeownership plan could limit eligibility to the other residents of the same development, or give them preference over the residents of other HA developments. As another example, with reference to families that are not already public or Indian housing or Section 8 residents, the HA would have the option to restrict eligibility to families who are already on the HA's waiting lists for other programs, or to give such waiting list families a preference over other nonresident applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

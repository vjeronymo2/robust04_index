			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The main political parties today officially  registered their respective presidential candidates for the  elections to be held in May.    The first party to do so was the PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party], then the Papa Egoro Movement, the  Arnulfist Party and the Liberal Party, and finally the Morena  [National Renewal Movement], Molirena [Nationalist Liberal  Republican Movement], and Civic Renewal Party.    With the registration of the candidates headed by Mireya  Moscoso de Gruber on the one hand, and Ruben Dario Carles on the  other, the possibility of an alliance that would group the civic  [civilistas] forces that struggled against Manuel Antonio  Noriega's regime has been frustrated. With these four [number  as heard] slates the political panorama is clarified and the  uncertainty about the presidential candidacies disappears.    Now, only the Solidarity Party and the Democratic Christian  Party have yet to register their candidates. Last week, Jose  Salvador Munoz registered as presidential candidate for the  Doctrinaire Panamenist Party.    In accordance with the electoral scheme, there are seven  candidates for president of the Republic in the first free and  democratic elections to be held after over 20 years of military  dictatorships.</p>

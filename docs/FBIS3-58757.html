			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta </F> by Federico Bugno "on a flight back to Rome from Cairo"; date  not given: "Beware: This Is a Return To the First Decade of This  Century"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Although obviously tired,  Foreign Minister Andreatta had not lost his proverbial energy.  He said of many authoritative Italian commentators that "they  only get excited when they talk about Italy's national  interest," in the petty nationalist belief of rediscovering a  nonconfessional foreign policy to set against the Catholic  foreign policy desired by Alcide De Gasperi, which has lasted  for the past 40 years. Thus they ultimately discover a foreign  policy confined to what can be seen barely beyond our borders,  in a merely geographical vision of international politics.  Against geopolitics, he sets geoeconomics, which does indeed  have "global horizons." He vigorously defended Italy's busy  activity within the international bodies: "We are among the  countries that have benefited most from these alliances and from  having taken part in a system within which certain rules  prevail," he said.    [Bugno] But the concept of the national interest is not now  so uncommon. The new Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott,  cited the U.S. national interest to explain the Americans'  support for Boris Yeltsin. And in Germany and Poland some  emphasis is placed on this concept. Not to mention France,  where this emphasis has never been absent.    [Andreatta] I too perceive the dangers of a  renationalization  of European foreign policy. In the way international relations  are taught in the universities, in the mentality of the new  generations of diplomats, there is something of a taste for a  return to the "art deco," the "Liberty" period in foreign  policy. This, because the great war of religion which divided  the world is over, and so too is the imposition of an order  founded on the basis of the strict mathematical logic of the  nuclear equation. Personally, I regard all this with anxiety.  Of course, I could even admit that, as an exercise, France's  gamble over GATT was textbook material. They were able -- for  the sake of nonvital interests that had become important only  for reasons of domestic policy -- to play a well orchestrated  game which, however, placed in jeopardy negotiations that lasted  2,800 days and that made it possible to lower world tariffs by  almost 40 percent. At one stage they hinged on France's problem  with increasing its grain exports by a few million tonnes or  denying American films access to European television channels.  The French jeopardized the negotiations with their  parliamentary filibustering methods. Such conduct does not seem  to me to belong to the mainstream of history. However, it  cannot be assumed that all countries can succeed in doing that  which France succeeded in doing, keeping in mind that France has  in its past someone called De Gaulle, who always did such  things. For these reasons I believe that Italy -- a country  that is very superficial on matters of security and defense and  that will never equip itself with the financial and political  resources to organize a security based entirely on its own  management capability -- must be careful not to become isolated.  Hence the concern with strengthening the framework of  international organizations.    [Bugno] How?    [Andreatta] I will give you some examples. We proposed to  the British that the Central and Eastern European countries be  admitted to the second and third pillars of the Maastricht  Treaty, that is, those that concern a common security and  foreign policy and justice and domestic policing policy. This,  reversing the old belief that first we should build the economic  Europe and then the political Europe. This is not possible with  these countries. This also entails a division of labor, however  -- leaving to NATO the predominant, though not exclusive, task  of reassuring the Russian moderates, and to the European Union  that of providing the intermediate countries with economic,  political, and institutional relations, providing them with such  substantive ties as to make it clear even to the most  expansionist of the Russians that, beyond Belarus and Ukraine,  there lie territories already integrated into Europe.  Furthermore, with a view to the NATO summit in Brussels we  wrote to American Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NATO  Secretary General Manfred Woerner, notifying them that we would  be asking that part of the budget resources be reserved for  financing research into nonlethal weapons to be used in  peacekeeping operations and for the use of techniques for border  control and for crime control in guerrilla warfare. We also  placed emphasis on the issues of security in the Mediterranean;  in the future it may be possible to offer the countries of the  Mediterranean some kind of association analogous to the  Partnership for Peace, the instrument now being used to  stabilize relations with Eastern Europe.    [Bugno] Are these all Italian initiatives?    [Andreatta] Yes, but the newspapers do not talk about them  and the parties are not interested. On no less than two  occasions in October I was summoned before Parliament just to  hear the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] criticize me for  having failed to side with the rebels in the White House in  Moscow against President Yeltsin. According to the PDS, the  Italian Government should have corrected its pro-Yeltsin stance,  shared by all the Western countries, and sided with the old  Parliament. But nobody asked me to come to discuss the issues  of the NATO summit. And yet dozens and dozens of people in Rome  and Brussels, in the embassies, are dealing with these issues  precisely in order to put forward Italy's viewpoint, what you  say is the national interest.    [Bugno] What conclusion do you draw from this?    [Andreatta] As far as the PDS is concerned, the sole  conclusion is that this party has reached as far as the economic  and foreign policy lines that have been the constants of the  past 40 years. I do understand that this could constitute  so-called "innovation" for the PDS. It certainly is not so for  the country, and it is not so for me, since I have always  demanded a balanced budget, and when I was treasury minister I  used to have to increase the deficit by 1-2 billion lire just to  make the PCI [Italian Communist Party] -- now the PDS -- happy  and thus to try to have the finance bill passed. Nor is there  anything new abut the obvious observation that Eastern Europe  and Russia are now having to pay for the rebirth of the liberal  ideal that lay behind the revolutions of 1848 but which never  prevailed in Russia.    [Bugno] You have often drawn a distinction between the  national interest and the general interest. Why?    [Andreatta] The reason for this distinction is that I would  like to demystify the idea held by some elites that their own  interests coincide with those of the country. What lies behind  the writings of some commentators is in fact the same mistake as  Henry Ford made when he said that Ford's interests were  America's interests. No, interest is something that has to be  built politically, in a complex manner, just as the concept of  the common good is a complex one, too. And in a democracy  viewpoints can change in time.    [Bugno] I must ask you this question. Somalia and Bosnia:  These are two issues that are prompting much discussion.    [Andreatta] Somalia: My position has been to avoid turning a  technical and military disaster into a rupture with our allies.  The easiest solution was precisely to raise the flag of  national interest and, as at Sigonella, to become famous for 15  minutes and to damage Italy's relations with its own partners  and with the United Nations. I consider it one of my merits  that I have succeeded in blocking any suggestions in this  direction, avoiding encouraging the Italian people's worst  instincts -- that oscillation between broad internationalism and  an escape into peevish isolation. We have countered errors  without challenging the authority of the United Nations. And  this corresponds to Italy's general interest.    [Bugno] What about Bosnia?    [Andreatta] None of the warring sides seems to want to stop,  and the international community, by facilitating supplies, is in  fact ensuring that matters continue that way indefinitely. And  yet in December peace seemed to have been achieved. But it is  the Muslims now who are opposing a division on the basis of 33  percent to each of the warring sides, as they themselves  demanded during last year's negotiations on board the  Invincible, and the danger is that they will no longer obtain  even that. But you cannot impose the desire for peace on a  people when each of their components has suffered terrible  iniquities.</p>

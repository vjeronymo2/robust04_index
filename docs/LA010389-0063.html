			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> UCLA PICKS APART ARKANSAS AND WINS SEVENTH STRAIGHT BOWL GAME  </P> <P> Troy Aikman was at the crossroads at Texas Stadium Monday, ending a fine  collegiate career with the kind of passing that made his reputation at UCLA.  </P> <P> And, if he is the Dallas Cowboys' No. 1 pick in next April's National Football  League draft as expected, the quarterback gave hopeful Dallas fans some  optimisim.  </P> <P> Aikman's third-down efficiency confused Arkansas on two long touchdown drives  as the ninth-ranked Bruins set an National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record  with their seventh consecutive bowl victory, beating the Razorbacks, 17-3, in  the Cotton Bowl.  </P> <P> Aikman converted 12 of 20 third-down opportunities and threw a touchdown pass  as the Bruins again showed their domination in postseason play.  </P> <P> UCLA (10-2) broke a tie with Georgia Tech, Nebraska, USC and Alabama in  claiming a spot in the record books with a seventh bowl victory. The Bruins'  victory streak includes three Rose Bowls, a Fiesta, an Aloha and a Freedom  Bowl.  </P> <P> Aikman overcame an early interception to direct the Bruins on touchdown drives  of 93 and 74 yards as UCLA gained a 14-0 halftime edge over the Hogs, who had  only two first downs at halftime.  </P> <P> Aikman converted 6 straight third-down plays before Mark Estwick scored on a  1-yard run for a 6-0 Bruin lead after a scoreless first period. The extra-point  kick made it 7-0.  </P> <P> Late in the first half, Aikman took UCLA on a beat-the-clock drive in which he  fooled Arkansas (10-2) for the second touchdown. On third-and-goal from the  Hogs' 1, he bootlegged the ball on a fake sweep then threw a touchdown pass to  tight end Corwin Anthony with 21 seconds left for a 14-0 lead.  </P> <P> Arkansas' Kendall Trainor kicked his 24th consecutive field goal, a 49-yarder,  in the third period to keep the Hogs from a shutout.  </P> <P> UCLA's only second half points came on Alfredo Velasco's 32-yard field goal in  the fourth period.  </P> <P> Aikman made excellent use of UCLA's running game, handing off to freshman  tailback Shawn Wills 18 times for 120 yards.  </P> <P> Aikman was closely watched by members of the downtrodden Cowboys' organization,  who are thinking about making him the first pick in the NFL draft.  </P> <P> Dallas Coach Tom Landry watched on television but scout Gil Brandt was in the  press box.  </P> <P> Aikman finished his career at UCLA with a 20-4 record as a starter. He hit 19  of 27 passes for 172 yards.  </P> <P> UCLA's alert defense held Arkansas to only four first downs, one by penalty.  </P> <P> The clear, windless day was ideal for UCLA's passing attack. It was the first  appearance for a West Coast team in the Cotton Bowl since Oregon played  Southern Methodist 40 years ago.  </P> <P> A sellout crowd of 74,304 watched Aikman overcome early jitters, failing to see  Arkansas linebacker LaSalle Harper at the Razorback 12. The interception ended  a UCLA first-period drive that had reached the Hog 17 after an interception and  20-yard return by Darryl Henley.  </P> <P> UCLA's first touchdown drive was helped by a personal foul against Arkansas'  Otis Lloyd after Aikman had been stopped short on a third-down run.  </P> <P> Aikman then completed a 10-yard pass to Reggie Moore, a 12-yard pass to Mike  Farr, and a 9-yard pass to Brendan McCracken, all on third down, on the 93-yard  scoring drive.  </P> <P> The 74-yard scoring drive was aided by Aikman's 20-yard third down pass to Paul  Richardson.  </P> <P> Aikman converted 8 of 12 third down opportunities in the first half. He also  completed passes to 10 different receivers as he read the Arkansas defense.  </P> <P> UCLA lost another chance to score in the third period when Laurence Burkley  fumbled at the Arkansas 7 and Kerry Crawford recovered for the Hogs.  </P> <P> It was only the second meeting between the schools. They tied, 10-10, in the  1978 Fiesta Bowl.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DONAHUE ROLLS A 7  </P> <P> A look at UCLA Coach Terry Donahue's 7 consecutive postseason victories:  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.55IN:1.89IN:3.87IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Date  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Bowl  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Score  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan. 1, 1983  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rose  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> UCLA 24, Michigan 14  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan 2, 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rose  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> UCLA 45, Illinois 9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan. 1, 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fiesta  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> UCLA 39, Miami 37  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan. 1, 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rose  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> UCLA 45, Iowa 28  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dec. 30, 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Freedom  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> UCLA 31, Brigham Young 10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dec. 25, 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Aloha  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> UCLA 20, Florida 16  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan. 2, 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cotton  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> UCLA 17, Arkansas 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

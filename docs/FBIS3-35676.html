According to the deputy minister, he had the impression  after  yesterday's meeting of experts that Russia was attempting to  delay the negotiations. The mood is not very optimistic,  Domarkas said in an interview with a Baltic News Service  correspondent today before the continuation of the negotiations.    The Lithuanian and Russian commissions on the delimitation  and demarcation of the state borders are headed by Deputy  Foreign Minister Domarkas and (Gary Chmikhov), the first deputy  head of the Kaliningrad region administration. In the meeting  in Vilnius, a great deal of attention is being paid to problems  of the marine border. The negotiators are today dealing with a  project prepared by the Lithuanian Geodesic Service.    Domarkas thinks that disagreements on the marine border are  stipulated both by economic interests and by psychological  standpoints. According to him, the deposit on the [word  indistinct] shelf has influence, too, as both sides have a claim  to it. The head of the Lithuanian commission agrees that both  sides propose at the negotiations their maximal projects but,  according to him, this is customary in [word indistinct]  practice.    The Lithuanian side hoped to complete the negotiations in  Vilnius on the land state border, but Russian negotiators stated  that Moscow had not yet evaluated the previously agreed draft  agreement. The next meeting on the Lithuanian and Russian state  border should take place in Moscow in a month's time. The  negotiators hope that agreements on the borders will be signed  and will come into force this year.</p>

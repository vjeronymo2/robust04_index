			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Sydney hopes for rain as fires race into suburbs Cooler weather late yesterday offered some hope that Sydney might soon win its four-day battle against fires which have destroyed more than 150 homes and killed four people, Reuter reports from Sydney. But weather forecasters said Sydney would not see rain until Wednesday or Thursday. 'Until we get rain, the situation remains on a knife edge,' said Richard Whitaker, a meteorologist. Firefighters were last night planning a massive, and risky, control burning along a 50km line in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, in an effort to contain Australia's worst fire crisis in 200 years. But as night fell, wind shifts saw hundreds more residents evacuated from southern and northern suburbs. On the edge of the Royal National Park, firemen evacuated more residents as a huge fire raced towards the outlying southern suburb of Waterfall. Helicopters were also water-bombing flames at the semi-rural Oxford Falls in Sydney's north, while nearly 300 elderly people were evacuated in Belrose after fires broke out in the surrounding Garigal National Park. However, the blaze in the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, which had threatened several suburbs, was slowing, and in Sydney's southern suburbs of Jannali and Como fires were suppressed but not contained, firemen said. About 7,500 firemen, backed by military units, are fighting 120 fires across New South Wales. Many of the fires have been lit by arsonists.</p>

He explained that the measures that  the Israeli Government has adopted so far are mere worthless  formalities.    In a news conference he held this afternoon, 'Abd-Rabbuh  asserted that the Palestinian leadership wishes the peace  process to continue and the negotiations to succeed but at the  same time it believes that several major requirements need to be  met to guarantee the success of this political process.    He announced that the foremost requirement is providing  protection and security for the Palestinian people against the  terrorists among the Israeli settlers.    'Abd-Rabbuh said that the Palestinian leadership will  continue its contacts with all the concerned parties, namely the  UN Security Council, the United States, Russia, and the EU in  order to fulfill the necessary conditions to resume the  negotiations.    The Palestinian official said that the current circumstances  do not encourage the resumption of the negotiations because if  they were resumed they would remain under the threat of the  Israeli settlers' armed terrorism, particularly in the absence  of any effective deterrent by the Israeli Government.    He pointed out that the measures and methods employed by the  Israeli Army against the Palestinian citizens who were  protesting the Hebron massacre caused many of them to be  martyred and dozens to be wounded.    He added that the Israeli Government is still adopting  limited and nominal measures against a small number of settlers  but is using mass punishment against the Palestinians in the  occupied territories, such as imposing total curfew and allowing  the army to fire at them.    'Abd-Rabbuh said that Israel's disarming of five settlers is  a measure that cannot convince anyone that it wishes to provide  protection for the Palestinian people, especially when the  Palestinians see large numbers of armed settlers walking about  in their towns and villages.    'Abd-Rabbuh added that there seems to be a consensus about  having international presence in the occupied territories and  said this has now become an urgent demand in order to reassure  the Palestinians that they will be safe from further violence.</p>

But they added that any NATO military action, particularly  bombing to break the Serb blockade of the mainly-Moslem towns of  Srebrenica and Tuzla, still depended on a go-ahead from UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    NATO's political executive, the North Atlantic Council  (NAC),  met Wednesday to follow through a decision at last week's summit  of the 16-nation alliance to prepare for bombing raids on Serb  positions around Srebrenica and Tuzla.    Detailed plans for such raids were prepared by commanders of  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) last week and handed to  Butrus-Ghali in Geneva on Monday.    They are now being studied by the UN's special  representative  in ex-Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, who must then submit his  recommendations to the UN and subsequently to NATO.    A NATO spokesman said: "The council welcomed the close  consultations established between NATO and the UN  secretary-general, and his active and rapid response to the NATO  (summit) declaration.    "The (NAC) meeting agreed that the next steps lie with the  UN, although the alliance stands ready to provide whatever  assistance it can," he said.    NATO sources said this meant that military experts of the  alliance would work closely with Akashi on the bombing plans.    The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that  Butrus-Ghali had accepted the "high political priority" of  planning for NATO intervention and, if necessary, air strikes.    The NATO summiteers threatened last week to bomb Serbian  positions if Serb forces continued to block the relief of  Canadian peacekeepers at Srebrenica, and the re-opening of Tuzla  airport which is needed for UN aid missions.    Butrus-Ghali has so far been reluctant to authorise the air  strikes, fearing reprisals against UN forces in Bosnia and  disagreements in the UN Security Council where Russia is against  any escalation of the conflict.    One diplomat said NATO officials had been working for months  on detailed plans for military intervention in Bosnia.    He said the plans could be put into operation almost  immediately, pending only last-minute "fine-tuning" to bring  them into line with specific UN requests.    In a related development, the Dutch Defence Ministry said 21  soldiers are to leave Friday on a reconnaissance mission to  determine prospects for sending a contingent of troops to  replace the Canadian forces in Srebrenica.    A statement said the 10-day mission would determine when  some  1,100 personnel, including an air battalion, could be deployed  to the eastern Bosnian enclave.    A first reconnaissance mission some weeks ago failed to  produce the necessary information, and UN officials asked the  Dutch Government to organise a second mission.</p>

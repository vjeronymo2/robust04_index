			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Kabul becomes target for new 'Great Game' IN the week since the Mujahideen rebels seized power, Kabul has become both the target of a regional scramble for power, and an island in a fragmented nation ruled by local warlords. In the regional power struggle, Pakistan and Iran are competing for influence in a new Afghanistan that will provide a long land route to the prized former Soviet central Asian republics. Saudi Arabia, flush with oil dollars, also is seeking a voice in Kabul. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has openly acknowledged his interest in re-opening the pre-1917 trade route between Tashkent and Peshawar. This week, he pressed the point by flying in with his army chief of staff, Asif Nawaz, and intelligence director, Javed Nasir. Also aboard the aircraft were Saudi Arabia's intelligence chief Prince Turkhi Bin Al-Faisal and 60 Pakistani journalists. Less openly, Iran has made clear its interest in fostering a loose, Persian-speaking union which it would like to see include northern Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The official Pakistani visit was seen as the opening salvo of an expected stiff competition. It was an attempt to say: 'We have got here first'. 'This is a kind of signal to others, including Iran, that 'we have established ourselves',' said an Asian diplomat. 'We don't know what Iran's reaction will be.' In this evolving competition following the end of the 13-year war, Afghanistan has again assumed its historical role as a crossroads for greater powers seeking regional influence and corresponding wealth. Northern Afghanistan has undetermined but estimated rich deposits of emeralds, gold and lapis lazuli. A toehold here could make it easier to establish stronger contacts with Uzbeks, Tajiks and Turkmens over the border, where there are large deposits of uranium, oil and natural gas, in addition to a huge cotton crop. 'For all three countries, Afghanistan is vital as a stepping stone to Central Asia,' said another diplomat. 'Whatever happens will have repercussions on the rest of the region.' The scramble for power is occurring amid the confusion of Afghanistan's new domestic struggle. Kabul's power over the countryside appears to have unravelled to its worst state since before 1880, when, after decades of instability, the then Emir Abdul Rahman patched together the whole of Afghanistan under his rule. The main cities and small villages in the countryside have come under the control of figures who are effectively local warlords. In western Herat, the local strongman is Ismael Khan, a former army officer who defected to the Mujahideen early in the war. In the southeastern capital of Gardez and Khost, the strongman is Jalalludin Haqqanni. The potential of regions simply spinning off in their own direction, Herat toward Iran, Soviet Central Asia, and Jalalabad and Kandahar toward Pakistan, suddenly has become more than just a fear, since bankrupt Kabul can offer little inducement to remain in its domain. In such a confused state, the fruits of the end of the war could simply be more years of misery for the Afghans, diplomats and Afghans have said in interviews in the past few days. 'Apart from the boundaries of Kabul, the country is totally fragmented,' said a European diplomat. 'You go from village to village, and there is a different Mujahideen commander in each one. 'Who will pay the people (to remain loyal to Kabul)? If you don't pay, they will try to grab everything for themselves.'</p>

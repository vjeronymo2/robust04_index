			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar finishes below peak THE DOLLAR touched a peak of DM1.7825 in Europe yesterday after the weekend Group of Seven meeting failed to present a united front aimed at limiting the currency's advance. The market took this as a green light to push it higher, suggesting that the dollar was heading for DM1.80, but it ran out of steam before the close of trading in London. Dealers said there was some uncertainty about direction in the early European morning, but when the central banks did not intervene the dollar moved up sharply. Its failure to attack DM1.80 and a lack of follow-through commercial demand led to retrenchment later in the day. The downward trend continued in New York, the US unit touching the DM1.75 level before finishing at DM1.7512, and leading to comments that the currency may have peaked at DM1.7825 for the time being. Earlier at the London close the dollar was up to DM1.7690 from DM1.7545; to SFr1.4840 from SFr1.4785; and to FFr5.9650 from FFr5.9200, but had declined to Y137.60 from Y138.15. On Bank of England figures its index rose to 67.2 from 66.8. The D-Mark remained among the group of weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, losing ground to the pound, French franc and Italian lira. It also slipped to Y77.80 from Y78.75 against the Japanese currency. Uncertainty continues about the prospects for interest rates. A joint report from Germany's leading economic research institutes said continuing threats to inflation were no reason for tighter monetary policies from the Bundesbank. Referring to the problems caused by unification, it argued that an increase in indirect taxation produces a one-off rise in prices and did not represent a sustained acceleration in inflation, while high budget deficits are also no reason for the Bundesbank to reduce the supply of money. The report also warned that rising interest rates could slow economic growth and claimed that high wage awards which outstripped productivity would be inflationary only if fin-anced by the injection of extra funds from the central bank. At the same time, Mr Helmut Geiger, president of the German Association of Savings Banks, said a cut in rates will not take place this year, and 'next year, too, there will be no considerable easing'. At this week's securities repurchase agreement tender, the Bundesbank has offered one-month money at an unchanged fixed rate of 8.60 per cent. Sterling fell 90 points to Dollars 1.6770 and declined to Y230.75 from Y233.00 and to SFr2.4875 from SFr2.4925, but rose to DM2.9675 from DM2.9575 and to FFr10.0025 from FFr9.9800. The pound's index eased 0.1 to 90.7, but the currency rose to third from fourth strongest place in the ERM. Trading was nervous ahead of Thursday's local government elections in England and Wales. In New York, sterling rallied to end 2.10 cents up at Dollars 1.6980.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Oakland police are playing down speculation that a serial killer is stalking  area prostitutes. But the slayings of six women in little more than two months  have spread fear on the streets. "We're all a little scared," said Renee  Jackson, who said she has worked the streets for 11 years, "but not scared  enough, because we're still out here." Police Capt. Jim Hahn said it was too  early to talk about a serial killer, pointing out that about 10 prostitutes are  killed in the city each year. Still, he admits that six deaths in such a short  time is unusual, and the possibility of a single killer is not being ruled out.  </P></p>

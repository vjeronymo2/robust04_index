The prime minister is currently undergoing a rehabilitation  treatment at one of the MMA hospitals after a cardiac operation  some two weeks ago. According to a medical commission, Prof.  Berov could be back to work any time he wants, the MMA Chief  also told the briefing. The operation improved the circulation  of blood through the heart by 80 per cent and increased the  working capacity of Prof. Berov, MMA Chief told journalists.

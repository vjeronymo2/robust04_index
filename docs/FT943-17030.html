			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Free-market policy on energy praised by IEA The government's free-market approach to energy does constitute a policy - and that is official. The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based grouping of industrialised countries, yesterday gave its blessing to the UK's laisser-faire stance - often denounced by critics as a 'non-policy'. The IEA says in an in-depth review that while UK energy policy does not have targets and prescriptions, 'it is based on a clearly articulated principle of reliance on market forces'. Moreover, 'the overall direction of UK energy policy can be commended as consistent with the IEA shared goals' of open and free energy markets. The UK experience could even be useful to other members of the IEA who were restructuring their largely state-owned energy industries. The IEA's accolade was accepted gratefully by the government. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said: 'I welcome this endorsement of our liberalisation policy. The UK is pleased to be in the vanguard of change and a model for others to follow.' The IEA was not wholly unreserved in its praise. It said there were still imperfections in the gas and electricity markets and urged action to remove restrictions on the movement of oil and gas. The government could do more to raise energy efficiency and improve the environment, particularly by ensuring that the transport sector bore its share of energy costs. Mr Eggar said that many of the IEA's criticisms were already being acted on, and others were technical. The UK's present policies, formulated in the mid 1980s, are intended to return as much as possible of the energy industry to the private sector, and to allow energy prices to find their natural levels. The policy has come under attack from those who believe the UK should take a more hands-on approach. Last year's coal industry crisis raised doubts about whether the free-market policy was in the country's best interests. The IEA reviews members' energy policies every four years. The UK review will be published later this year in a compendium entitled 'Energy Policy of IEA Countries'.</p>

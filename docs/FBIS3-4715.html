			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 1 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said Tuesday he plans to discuss with Chinese leaders for a  peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue when he  visits China March 12.    In an interview with the KYONGNAM SINMUN on the occasion of  the 48th anniversary of the local newspaper in South Kyongsang  Province, Kim made the remark hinting that there were ongoing  discussions between South Korea and China on the nuclear problem.    "My upcoming trips to Japan and China will be historical  visits that will leave a distinct mark in the pan-Pacific era,"  Kim said.    Noting that Japan and China are two of South Korea's three  largest trade partners, Kim said the country has to surpass  Japan in technology and competitive strength if it wants to be a  force to be reckoned with in the world.    As for China, it is a country with enormous potential, Kim  said. It isn't too much, therefore, to say that South Korea's  economic future depends on what kind of relations it will have  with the giant neighbor, he added.    The president said he plans to discuss how to steer the  course for future-oriented ties with Japan and how to promote  favorable economic relations with China when he visit Tokyo and  Beijing later this month.    With regard to a possible summit with North Korean President  Kim Il-song, Kim said he did not know when it will be realized.  But if it does, he hopes to discuss problems including peace  and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as well as  inter-Korean economic cooperation.    On North Korean military provocation, Kim said he could not  rule out the possibility unless peace settles in Korea through  mutual trust. South Korea is trying to change the attitude and  way of thinking of the North Koreans through dialogue, Kim said.    Asked about a possible unification through the so-called  "absorption formula," Kim said "it is not desirable, nor will it  ever be a goal for South Korea."</p>

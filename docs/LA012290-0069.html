			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WATER SKIER, 26, KILLED BY BOAT THAT TOWED HIM  </P> <P> A 26-year-old water skier was fatally injured Sunday afternoon when he was run  over by a boat that had been towing him, police said.  </P> <P> Louis Michael Andreoli of Newport Beach was pronounced dead at 2:09 p.m., less  than an hour after the boating mishap in which he suffered head injuries,  police said.  </P> <P> Andreoli had gone water skiing with three friends in a borrowed, 18-foot  inboard-outboard power boat Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> He was skiing about 400 yards offshore from the main Corona del Mar beach  Sunday afternoon when, "for some reason, he was run over by his friends," said  Lt. Don Chandler of the Newport Beach Police Department.  </P> <P> Chandler said the boat was impounded and the case is under investigation. He  refused to elaborate.  </P> <P> Lt. William Francis of the Orange County Sheriff's Department, which responded  to the incident, said: "We're satisfied that it's strictly a boating accident.  There's nothing to indicate there was anything intentional, absolutely  nothing."  </P> <P> Francis declined further comment.  </P> <P> Chandler said he could remember few if any fatalities like the one Sunday. And  Sgt. Howard Mol of the Sheriff's Harbor Patrol, while recalling some serious  jet-ski accidents, said: "This is really the first fatal water-skiing accident  in at least four years."  </P></p>

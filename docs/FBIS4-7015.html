			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA)--The South Korean  Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) called a  press conference on the first anniversary of its inauguration on  April 25 and vowed to wage a powerful anti-U.S., anti-Kim  Yong-sam struggle, according to a radio report from Seoul.    The federation at the press conference noted that the Kim  Yong-sam regime made many commitments when it set sail, but has  fully revealed its anti-popular nature in the course of the  Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations. It  declared that it will launch an anti-U.S., anti-Kim Yong-sam  struggle on the occasion of its first founding anniversary.    It said there is nothing to expect from the Kim Yong-sam  regime which has clearly disclosed its color of a conservative  "government".</p>

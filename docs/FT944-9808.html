			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Brussels probes regional aid fraud The European Commission's anti-fraud unit is investigating a series of alleged financial irregularities involving cash spent on projects to boost the economies of European Union's poorer member states. The inquiries are likely to be controversial because of the general view in Brussels that the amount of fraud in its regional funds programme is minimal. However, an official in the anti-fraud unit, Uclaf, which is being expanded because of mounting political concern about the scale of fraud, said it was 'naive' to think that there was little or no fraud in the EU's structural aids programmes. Structural aid covers transport, industry and sewage treatment projects in the EU's poorer countries such as Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece and parts of Italy. In most cases, cash paid by Brussels is matched by similar amounts from the member governments. Regional aid schemes account for about 25 per cent of the EU's budget, but the proportion will rise sharply over the next few years. Of 90 current investigations by Uclaf, about a third involve cases of suspected fraud in structural aid projects. The rest involve agriculture spending, promotion of tourism and illicit import or export declarations. Experts believe that between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of the EU's annual Ecu70bn (Pounds 54.6bn) budget is wasted through fraud or related financial irregularities. Most reported fraud cases concern agriculture spending. The Uclaf view is that much of the fraud in the structural aid programme is hidden by the failure of member states to report on where the spending is taking place. An Uclaf official said: 'When a member government spots an irregular payment (in this type of programme) the tradition is for it to drop the project from the list of schemes being funded and start a new one, without telling Brussels. We have to fight against this kind of practice.' Uclaf's stance may be helped by new rules, introduced in the summer, under which Brussels could tell member states that they will be less likely to get cash in future if they fail to comply. Among the Uclaf cases involving structural funds are several instances of cash apparently being diverted to companies or individuals instead of being spent on training programmes. In other investigations, officials are looking at a series of road building projects which appeared to lead to excessive profits for specific contractors.

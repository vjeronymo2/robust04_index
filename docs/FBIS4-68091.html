			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ajk"-signed report: "Organized Crime Will Grow This Year"] </F>   [Text] People will be exposed to even more pressure from  organized crime this year than they have been hitherto, and  especially in the fields of narcotics, embezzlement, illegal  waste management, smuggling, and money laundering. The  government has informed the deputies about this in its report on  the security situation for 1993.    Klaus's cabinet did not register any direct signal last year  concerning terrorist activity being prepared against Czech  citizens, foreigners, or objects in the republic. Some time  ago, however, Stanislav Devaty, head of the Security Information  Service, communicated exactly the opposite to the deputies of  the left-wing parties in the Chamber. According to the findings  of the secret service, terrorist groups were preparing to attack  these politicians.    Although the government does not expect any direct military  or any other external threat to the republic, it does expect  terrorist actions here because of the political development in  former Yugoslavia.    It is particularly because of the constantly deepening  conflicts between ethnic groups and religious cultures in  Africa, in the Middle and Far East that there are risks that  might threaten our security in the future, the report reads.    The report also discloses that in 1993 not only did the  number of crimes committed increase from 350,000 to 400,000, but  the violence of the perpetrators is also growing, and they are  more frequently using firearms. The Interior Ministry wants,  therefore, to enable citizens who are concerned about their  property or can prove to the police that their health or lives  are threatened to obtain handguns through a law on arms and  ammunition.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CON MAN TRADES ON RIVERS' NAME  </P> <P> A con man who says he's borrowing jewelry for Joan Rivers has made off with  thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from at least two Manhattan stores,  the syndicated talk-show host said today.  </P> <P> "This is terribly sad," Rivers said in a news release.  </P> <P> "The store owners are nice, honest people, and this shouldn't have happened to  them."  </P> <P> The well-dressed man in his 30s said he was borrowing the jewelry for Rivers to  wear during a televised interview with arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, according  to Jennifer Geertz, a spokeswoman for Rivers.  </P> <P> The con man left two phone numbers with the stores, one at CBS and another that  reaches a recorded message at offices of "The Joan Rivers Show."  </P> <P> "He was a real pro," Irene Kojen of the Peipers &amp; Kojen store told New York  magazine. "He was so smooth that when he asked for one ring, I lent him two, so  Joan would have a choice."  </P></p>

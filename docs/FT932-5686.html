			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average moves ahead in spite of stronger yen BARGAIN hunting absorbed the unwinding of arbitrage positions, and the Nikkei average closed modestly higher in spite of the yen rising further against the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei gained a net 39.06 at 20,591.41 after falling to a low of 20,469.83 in the morning on sporadic arbitrage-linked selling. The index peaked at 20,687.98 just before the close. Volume totalled 370m shares, against 342m on Monday. Most investors remained on the sidelines due to the further strengthening of the yen, which at one point rose to a new Tokyo high of Y106.88 to the dollar. Declines narrowly led rises by 507 to 496, with 175 issues unchanged. The Topix index ended 0.65 points up at 2,359.28, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead 1.92 to 1,241.55. Dealers said activity was dominated by arbitrage-linked trading ahead of the futures and options settlement for June contracts on June 11. Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda, head of equity trading at Daiwa Securities, said investors were in the final stage of adjusting their positions before next week's settlement day. According to Daiwa, long cash arbitrage positions against June futures contracts have fallen to some Y680bn from a peak of Y1,200bn through unwinding and rolling over of positions. Long positions against the September contract now total about Y150bn. In spite of currency movements, NEC rose Y30 to Y1,030 on reports that it had acquired a licence to use software made by Apple Computer, of the US. Other leading high-technology issues were higher on bargain hunting, Fujitsu firming Y10 to Y765 and Hitachi Y2 to Y847. Chiyoda, the plant engineering concern, moved ahead Y60 to Y1,700 on reports that it had won a large-lot order to build natural gas plants in south-east Asia. Mining companies were higher on reports that blast-furnace steel makers were increasing the use of coal. Mitsui Mining and Smelting, the most active issue of the day, appreciated Y15 to Y583, while Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced Y40 to Y1,130. Speculative issues continued to rise on buying by individual investors. Nippon Carbon climbed Y34 to Y589 and Morinaga Milk put on Y14 at Y734. Clarion, however, relinquished Y5 to Y625 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 29.09 to 22,935.31 in volume of 21.7m shares. Small-lot buying of speculative favourites fuelled the advance. Roundup AS ITS neighbour, Singapore, took a holiday (along with Bombay, Karachi and Jakarta), Kuala Lumpur came back from a day off to register a new closing high. KUALA LUMPUR gave strong buying of index-linked shares the credit for its closing peak of 740.06, up 4.81, although volume was down a little from 421m to 391m shares. Support for the index stocks came just before the close. The biggest gain was made by the feedmill group Gold Coin, which forged ahead MDollars 1.32 to MDollars 6.00 in turnover of 4.5m shares, on scrip issue rumours. SEOUL just failed to hold Monday's closing high, the composite index losing 0.34 to 751.97 in volume of 69.9m shares. Relatively low-priced shares were supported by the notion that they have potential compared with other stocks which have drawn attention in recent days. Kukje Corp and Saeil Heavy Industries went limit up, rising Won400 apiece to Won9,300 and Won8,960 respectively. TAIWAN was led higher by finance issues, the weighted index adding 48.53 at 4,316.43 in turnover down from TDollars 18bn to TDollars 15.9bn. A broker said the good performance by finance stocks, especially the three provincial commercial banks - First, Chang Hwa, and Hua Nan - was due to rumours, thought unlikely to be true, that some provincial assemblymen are trying to revise the assembly's initial dividend-distribution plan for the three banks to distribute more dividends. BANGKOK stayed bearish, the SET index ending 6.87 lower at 818.84. Turnover was healthier at Bt2.9bn, but brokers said about one-third of this could be attributed to trade in four new listings. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index lost 3.5 at 1,733.9, but was above the day's worst on news of higher than expected domestic economic growth. HONG KONG, in contrast, almost lost a midday rebound, the Hang Seng index closing just 3.62 up at 7,375.81. MANILA nudged lower on foreign selling and what was described as marginal (0.92 per cent) GNP growth in the first quarter. NEW ZEALAND finished mixed, although leading issues staged a late recovery to close mainly higher. The NZSE-40 index was finally 0.85 ahead at 1,638.36.</p>

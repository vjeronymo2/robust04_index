			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (14): Quick work needed - Profile: Fifth Avenue MR PAUL FABIAN divides the six days which followed the fateful afternoon of Friday September 4, 1992, into various parts: the surreal, the worst and the best. This was the week he and Mr Brian Worth, through a new company they formed -  -Idealdirect, which would trade as Fifth Avenue - acquired the business and assets of Fifth Avenue Ltd, for an unspecified amount, from the receivers of the Berkertex Group. Based just off London's Oxford Street, Fifth Avenue supplies retailers and mail order houses such as Littlewoods, C&amp;A, Etam, British Home Stores and Burtons, mainly with ladies garments. With a turnover of Pounds 13.6m and a profit of Pounds 525,000 in 1991-2, Fifth Avenue Ltd represented approximately 30 per cent of the activities of its parent, Berkertex Group. There was little synergy between Berkertex and Fifth Avenue Ltd. The former made dresses, the latter made separates and each operated virtually independently of the other. It therefore came as no surprise when, in November 1991, Berkertex asked Mr Fabian and Mr Worth if they would like to conduct a management buy-out. A price was agreed on and Fifth Avenue Ltd's directors put together a deal which involved financial backing from the Bank of Ireland and 3i. At the last minute Berkertex Group decided it had undervalued the business and asked for an extra Pounds 500,000 more or, as Mr Fabian puts it, 'a golden wave goodbye'. The deal fell through. Disappointed as he was, Mr Fabian says: 'It did give us a chance to put our toes in the water, go through all the necessary budgeting, cash-flows and presentations to financial institutions.' Fifth Avenue Ltd went on to have a successful year of trading. By September 1992, it had accrued Pounds 2.2m in its account at the Bank of Scotland and owed creditors around Pounds 650,000. In the meantime, it was becoming increasingly apparent to Fifth Avenue Ltd, that Berkertex was experiencing trading difficulties. 'We could see they were in trouble,' says Mr Fabian, 'but the problem was determining when they would become insolvent.' As the situation deteriorated, Mr Fabian got in touch with Blick Rothenberg (the accountants which had assisted with the failed 1991 MBO) and 3i, to warn them that their services might be needed again. At midday on Friday, September 4 Mr Fabian was contacted by the Bank of Scotland. He was told the directors of Berkertex Group had informed the bank that they were unable to continue to trade. The bank was drawing in its loans and overdraft facilities. Touche Ross had been appointed as receivers. Mr Fabian was summoned to an immediate meeting with the bank at which Fifth Avenue Ltd, under its joint guarantee responsibility for the overall debt of the group, was asked to deposit Pounds 12.5m to cover the debt. 'It became surreal,' recalls Mr Fabian. 'I told them they could have the Pounds 2.2m (accrued in its account at the Bank of Scotland) but that I didn't happen to have the other Pounds 10.3m on me.' Mr Fabian and his co-director went into action. They contacted Blick Rothenberg and 3i, then made an appointment to see the receiver. On Saturday, the receiver explained that he had a duty to sell the business to the person who came up with the best offer. Sunday was spent with Blick Rothenberg working on a business plan. Monday morning, Mr Fabian had a meeting with Barclays Bank, Langham Place to ask for a Pounds 500,000 overdraft facility. The afternoon was spent in negotiations with the receiver and contacting solicitors to put the MBO paperwork in place. On Tuesday, the directors organised funding. On Wednesday morning, Barclays Bank confirmed the overdraft facility and negotiations continued with the receivers. By Thursday afternoon, the MBO purchase from the receiver was complete. Idealdirect had been formed. Mr Worth and Mr Fabian hold 77. 5 per cent of the shares in equal quantities between them, while 3i holds the rest. Funding for the directors' part of the business came from a large, short-term loan from a supplier, personal savings, guarantees and loans. 'That was the worst part,' says Mr Fabian. 'Having to give personal guarantees and realising what that commitment meant.' Mr Fabian and his partner paid substantially less for the business than the 1991 asking price. 'It was a forced sale and you've got all the risks inherent in purchasing from the receiver,' he explains. 'There are no warranties.' Among many issues was that of whether suppliers and customers, affected by the receivership of Fifth Avenue Ltd, would want to trade with Idealdirect. 'We were desperately lucky,' says Mr Fabian. 'We have a history of trust and mutual respect built up over 18 years of trading and it served us well.' The MBO was completed as quickly as possible for sound reasons. 'It was a question of confidence; given a further week we thought the business would disappear,' he explains. Although Idealdirect is not liable for the debts of Fifth Avenue Ltd, Mr Fabian and Mr Worth are making agreed ex-gratia payments to suppliers. 'We feel our reputation is at stake,' explains Mr Fabian. Employees have also been paid wages overdue from the period of collapse. Mr Fabian has no qualms about conducting a MBO in the middle of a recession. 'We're trading well with turnover 10 per cent up on last year, we've got our costs under control and I'm confident about the future,' he says. Eight weeks on, Mr Fabian admits he still has not quite come down from the high he experienced at the end of the MBO. 'The best part,' he says, 'was coming back to the office after it had all gone through, knowing we'd saved everyone's job and finding the staff had put on a surprise party.'</p>

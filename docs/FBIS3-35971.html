			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vitaliy Chukseyev] </F>   [Text] Washington February 2 TASS -- The U.S. multiple-use  spaceship "Discovery" is to lift off from the cosmodrome on Cape  Canaveral at 3:10 p.m. Moscow time on February 3. For the first  time, the crew of the shuttle will include Russian cosmonaut  Sergey Krikalev. He has already made spaceflights twice in  international crews. The flight on board the "Discovery" will  set the beginning to a joint programme of space exploration  which became possible due to agreement between the presidents of  Russia and the United States. Before entering on a pre-flight  quarantine, Krikalev gave an interview to ITAR-TASS.    Krikalev said the programme for flight preparation at the  Lyndon Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, differs little  from the cosmonauts training programme in Russia. Language  barrier was the main difficulty. Krikalev said that he and his  standby Vladimir Titov were sent to Houston on November 1, 1992  without having been given time for language studies. The  programme included the study of systems, safety rules, training  in the ways of emergency evacuation from the ship and drilling  in survival methods.    Asked about the flight's purposes and programme and his  personal contribution to it, Krikalev said his purpose was to  meet the requirements for an ordinary member of the American  crew. Upon the arrival in the U.S., the Russian cosmonauts  began training in fulfilling the duties envisaged by the rank of  a specialist which corresponds to Russian qualifications of a  flight engineer. The main purpose of the flight is to bring  into space a satellite shaped like a saucer and to put it into  orbit by means of a special manipulator. Sensors installed on  the satellite will analyse jets of the shuttle's engines. This  is very important as the cooperation programme envisages the  shuttle's flight towards Mir station and the linkup with it.    When asked what he thinks about the fact that he will make  the flight on board an American and not a Russian shuttle,  Krikalev said that regarding the level of technology and  organisation of the programme Russia and the U.S. are on  approximately the same level. American astronauts are ahead in  some things, Russians in others, particularly from the viewpoint  of prolonged flights. Russian "Buran" was launched back in  1988. It took off and landed in an automatic regime and in very  bad weather. Not a single shuttle ever flies when the weather  is so bad, Krikalev said.    Regarding Americans training for a flight in the Russian  orbital complex in 1995, Krikalev said that several American  astronauts are training for the flight. He said the advantage  of their training is that the American astronauts selected for  the flight have been studying Russian eight hours a day over the  recent months. The Americans attitude to this aspect is serious  and they are thorough.</p>

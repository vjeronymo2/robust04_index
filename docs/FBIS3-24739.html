Members of the subcouncil are:    Lt. Col. P. N. Bohlolo (United Peoples Front),    Adv Peter Gastrow (chairman) (Democratic Party),    Mr M.S. Gininda (Inyandza National Movement),    Lt. Gen. L. Malan (SA Government),    Mr Sydney Mufamadi (African National Congress),    Adv Gert Myburgh (National Party),    Mr Krish Naidoo (NIC/TIC) [Natal Indian Congress/Transvaal  Indian Congress]    Maj. Gen. P.J. Nembambula (Venda Government)    2. Objects of the subcouncil:    See the copy of Sections 3 and 15 of the TEC [Transitional  Executive Council] act annexed hereto. (not attached) The  subcouncil has, inter alia, dealt with the following matters:    3. The establishment of a National Police Inspectorate:    The subcouncil has agreed on the details of a National  Police  Inspectorate which is to be established in terms of Section  15(1)(a) and (b) of the TEC Inspectorate, which is to consist of  a national component (five civilians, four SAP [South African  Police] officers and four officers from other police forces) and  nine regional inspectorates, one each for the nine regions  demarcated in the interim constitution, which will each consist  of one civilian, one SAP officer, one officer from any other  police force operating in that region. A civilian is to be  appointed director of the inspectorate.    The task of the Inspectorate is to assist the subcouncil to  monitor police activities relating to the elections and the  maintenance of a free political climate and to ensure that its  decisions are properly acted on by the different police agencies  in the RSA, self-governing states and TBVC [Transkei,  Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] countries. The inspectorate will  also monitor the deployment and control of police resources in  relation to the policing of "political" violence and election  activities.    It is proposed that the Inspectorate, which will be  accountable to the subcouncil, will be established once all the  parties represented in the TEC have had an opportunity to submit  nominations for the civilian posts and once the various police  forces have nominated police officers for the various positions.    4. The establishment of a national independent complaints  mechanism:    The subcouncil has reached agreement on a new independent  complaints mechanism envisaged in Section 15(1)(c) of the act. A  credible and effective complaints mechanism is essential to the  improvement of police-community relations in South Africa. This  mechanism will come into being once ratified by the TEC, and the  subcouncil proposes that it resorts under the Goldstone  Commission. It will receive and investigate all complaints  lodged by members of the public about alleged misconduct by  members of the different police agencies. In order to ensure  that there is one effective complaints mechanism during the  period in which the TEC operates, it is proposed that:    (a) The Goldstone Commission also be tasked with the  investigation referred to in Clause 3.2.4.1 of the National  Peace Accord;    (b) The police reporting officers appointed in terms of the  National Peace Accord should be assigned to the Goldstone  Commission to staff this mechanism;    (c) Experienced investigators from the "complaints  investigation units" or equivalent units of all policing  agencies should be seconded to the mechanism, ie the Goldstone  Commission, in order to assist with investigations;    (d) The TEC request the minister of justice not to proceed  with the implementation of the provisions of the security  officers Board of Enquiry Act of 1993 until this act is  discussed by the subcouncil and the TEC and duly amended. This  act also aims at establishing a complaints mechanism but  reservations have been expressed about some of its provisions.    It is envisaged that the Goldstone Commission will appoint a  suitable civilian as director of the independent complaints  mechanism and that the commission will be at liberty to appoint  local and foreign police or civilian experts to assist with the  investigations. The complaints mechanism will be empowered to  investigate complaints about police conduct relating to, inter  alia, election related issues, serious and minor criminal  offenses, contraventions of the National Peace Accord code of  conduct, misconduct and infringements of regulations issued by  the subcouncil or the TEC.    5. The establishment of a committee of experts:    In terms of Section 15(1)(e) of the TEC Act, the subcouncil  has the power to establish a committee of experts to evaluate or  monitor any aspect of policing relevant to the objectives of the  TEC. The subcouncil has decided that the police board,  established in terms of the National Peace Accord, provides an  established and credible capacity for expert advice. For a  number of practical and cost related reasons the subcouncil has  decided not to establish a "standing committee" but to rather  draw on the expertise of police board members and others and  appoint them to a short-term committee of experts to investigate  a particular issue as and when the need arises. Proposals in  this regard are to be forwarded to the TEC for ratification.    [Text] 6. Rules and code of conduct for the police:    In terms of Section 15(1)(j) of the TEC Act the subcouncil  is  empowered to issue a new or amended code of conduct which shall  be applicable to all members of all policing agencies. The  subcouncil is further empowered under Section 15(7)(a) of the  TEC Act to issue rules aimed at ensuring uniformity of conduct  of members of all police agencies. The subcouncil took into  account that the existing standing rules and orders of all the  police agencies are virtually identical and has agreed on some  additional rules which complement the existing ones. These rules  focus mainly on promoting good police-community relations, on  ensuring impartial and apolitical policing during the election  and on the need for the police to ensure that no intimidation  takes place.    The subcouncil agreed that the security forces code of  conduct, contained in Chapter 4 of the National Peace Accord,  should also remain the code governing the conduct of members of  all police agencies. It is further provided that police  officials shall accept the certified results of the election.    The rules and code of conduct for the police will be  forwarded to the TEC for ratification before being implemented.    7. The co-ordinated control and command of different police  agencies    In terms of Section 15(7)(a) of the TEC Act the subcouncil  has, in co-operation with most other police agencies in the  self-governing states and TVBC countries, agreed on the  establishment of a "Transitional Policing Committee" which will  ensure that co-ordination and uniformity exists amongst all  policing agencies in the execution of their duties for the  purpose of the TEC Act. A senior police officer from each of the  policing agencies will serve on this committee which will meet  once a week and report to the subcouncil. The Transitional  Policing Committee will also have the task of formulating joint  strategies to prevent intimidation, to ensure impartial policing  of public political activities and to generally deal with the  policing of the run-up to, and the election itself.    The proposals with regard to the above committee will be  forwarded to the TEC for ratification before implementation.    8. The position of the Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu:    (a) Ciskei Police: The Ciskei has been co-operative and has  responded to requests by the subcouncil to submit information  and suggestions. It has been agreed that representatives from  the Ciskei Police will form part of the substructures of the  subcouncil once they formally become members of the TEC as  required by the TEC act.    (b) KwaZulu Police: Despite requests the KwaZulu Police has  not submitted any names of police officers to serve on the  various sub-structures of the subcouncil. Requests for  information, co-operation or proposals have met with the  response that legal advice is being sought or that the relevant  officer is not available and that a reply will be sent as soon  as possible. There has therefore been no co-operation from the  KwaZulu Police and the matter has been referred to the TEC for  its attention. The subcouncil regards it as essential for the  KwaZulu Police to co-operate in the same manner as other police  agencies are doing in order to ensure effective and accountable  policing to take place in the Natal/KwaZulu region during the  election period.    (c) Bophuthatswana Police: There has been no response from  the Bophuthatswana Police to requests from the subcouncil to  supply information or to participate in its activities. The  subcouncil is keen to involve the Bophuthatswana Police in all  its structures and activities as it would assist in promoting  free political activity in that country. The legal situation  appears to be that, in terms of South African law,  Bophuthatswana is an independent state and South African law  does not apply in that state unless Bophuthatswana law so  provides. The TEC Act does create the possibility of the TEC  having jurisdiction in Bophuthatswana provided that the latter  becomes a participant of the TEC. As this has not happened the  TEC has no jurisdiction over Bophuthatswana.    9. Instability in northern Natal:    At the request of the TEC the subcouncil submitted a  memorandum to the management committee of the TEC about the  security situation in northern Natal. The subcouncil recommended  inter alia that the SAP be urged to review the situation with a  view to increasing the number of static reporting points in  northern Natal in order to make their presence in the area more  accessible to the community and that the SAP be urged to  continue to liaise with the SADF [South African Defense Force]  in order that the SADF provide manpower and logistical support  as the situation warrants.    The subcouncil receives a weekly report from the SAP about  the state of political violence in northern Natal.    10. Instability in Katlehong:    The violence in Katlehong, including statements emanating  from Self Defence Units in the area, was raised in the  subcouncil. At the initiative of the management committee of the  TEC and others the whole matter of political violence and  instability on the East Rand is being comprehensively addressed  by a task group at national level and the subcouncil will await  their recommendations before addressing the matter further.    11. Position of Captain Craig Kotze:    The subcouncil made representations to the minister of law  and order about the undesirable situation of a police office  acting as spokesperson for the political head of the SAP and  thereby becoming involved in political controversy which affects  the police force as a whole. The minister informed the  subcouncil that Captain Kotze terminated his services in the SAP  on 5 January 1994 and that since 6 January he has been employed  as a consultant by the Ministry of Law and Order with the task  of acting as spokesperson for the Ministry of Law and Order.    12. Violence and transport problems in the Western Cape:    The subcouncil discussed a request by the transport forum of  the Western Cape regional peace committee to intervene in the  transport dispute and the resultant violence in Kayalithsa,  Gugulethu and Nyanga by securing protection by security forces  for buses and their passengers. The subcouncil decided to  acquaint itself with the issues first hand and to send a  delegation from the subcouncil together with two civilian  members of the police board to Cape Town in order to meet with  the relevant role players in the area. A meeting will take place  on Thursday 3 February.    [signed] Peter Gastrow, chairman    [dated] 28 January 1994</p>

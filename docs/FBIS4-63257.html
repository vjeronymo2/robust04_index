			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Yadukha from Sevastopol in "Crimea" </F> column: "Ukraine Is Getting Ready To Make War" -- two last  paragraphs are report by Pavel Felgengauer]    [Text] In spite of denials by the Ukraine Defense Ministry  and the Navy Press Center, on 19 May in a conversation with  SEGONDYA's correspondent a high-ranking officer at the Black Sea  Fleet headquarters confirmed information about the landing near  Sevastopol of Ukrainian Special Force and National Guard units  with a total strength of approximately 1,000 men.    The troops were landed in two groups at the Belbek and Cape  Khersones airfields, whereupon they were assigned to Ukraine  Navy units. The officer advised that in Kherson Oblast, in the  village of Chernobayevka, a Ukraine military field hospital has  been set up. whose personnel are making no secret that they are  getting ready to receive casualties with bullet and  fragmentation wounds.    Furthermore, Ukrainian troops are being concentrated around  the city of Izmail where a Black Sea Fleet brigade of combat  boats is located. According to unconfirmed reports, the  storming of the unit has been set for 25 May.    From 18 to 22 May the Black Sea Fleet command is holding  "scheduled" -- the word the Navy Press Center makes a point of  emphasizing -- exercises. They involve more than 20 battleships  and submarines, aircraft, helicopters, and fleet coast  installations.    On Thursday a session of the Crimean parliament heard Acting  Internal Affairs Minister Maj.-Gen. Valeriy Kuznetsov announce  that on the morning of 19 May a detachment of the Ukraine  Special Forces, under the command of Ukrainian First Deputy  Interior Minister Nidrigaylo, attacked the Interior Ministry  headquarters in Simpferopol. Crimean militia forces managed to  repulse the attack. Prior to that President Kravchuk issued an  order transforming the Crimean Interior Ministry into a regional  directorate of Ukraine's Interior Ministry, including a new  post: "deputy minister -- chief of the Crimea Directorate."    Local parliament deputies believe that military preparations  in Sevastopol, Izmail, and Simferopol are elements of an overall  plan to destabilize the situation on the peninsula. Political  observers suppose that an armed confrontation on the peninsula  could become a pretext for postponing or cancelling presidential  elections in Ukraine which bode no good to its present  leadership.    According to some reports, Thursday's closed session of the  Crimean parliament considered the question of introducing a  state of emergency on the peninsula.    Sources in the Defense Ministry in Moscow confirmed to  SEGODNYA's correspondent that the 1st Ukrainian Mobile Air  Brigade, created on the basis of the 98th Paratroopers Brigade,  part of which was evacuated to Russia, is, according to  intelligence reports, "making preparations" for a possible  seizure of a river vessel (craft) brigade in Izmail. Mobile Air  Brigade servicemen earlier took part in the seizure of a ship  division in Odessa.    The Ukrainian Mobile Air Brigade is located in Bolgrad and  could be moved to Izmail within several hours. The command of  the river vessel brigade has been "warned about a coming  provocation" and, if necessary, could obviously offer resistance.</p>

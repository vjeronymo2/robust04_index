			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Nirmin Murad, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] A total of 33 Iranian diplomats have slipped out of  the country quietly in compliance with a Jordanian request that  Tehran reduce its diplomatic representation here to a number  compatible with Amman's presence in the Iranian capital.    As part of the agreement between Amman and Tehran, the last  of the 33 diplomats left at the end of February and the  previously bustling embassy, according to the secretary general  of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been reduced to four  diplomats, including the ambassador, four administrators, a  driver and cook.    Nayef Hadid told the JORDAN TIMES that the Kingdom believed  it was necessary to request the reduction because the number of  Iranian diplomats in Jordan was not compatible with Amman's two  diplomats in Tehran.    In the first on-the-record confirmation of the Jordanian  request, Mr. Hadid said that he first approached the Iranian  ambassador here about reducting his diplomatic staff in November  last year.    "Ten days later, Iranian guards shot at our embassy in  Tehran  injuring a security man," Mr Hadid said. The shooting incident  was not reported in Jordan.    Officials, however, had said that Jordanian ambassador to  Iran Yasin Istanbuli was attacked at his home in Tehran and his  assailants searched his house and stole some of its contents in  August of that year.    It was Tehran's refusal to apologise officially over the  mistreatment of the Jordanian ambassador that initially made the  Jordanian government ask for the reduction.    Sources had said that Mr. Istanbuli was tied up for several  hours while his assailants searched his house and stole some of  its contents.    Jordanian officials at the time expressed their suspicion  that the assailants of Mr. Istanbuli belonged to one of the  security wings in Iran and demanded that the Iranian government  investigate the cause.    The government here, according to the sources, also demanded  an "official apology" from Tehran but only received a message  that the Iranian government was "sorry" that the attack had  taken place.    Privately, officials say that the Kingdom was becoming  concerned over increased activities by Iranian diplomats to  infiltrate cultural and research centres in the Kingdom and  distribute leaflets targetting Gulf regimes.    Officials contacted by the JORDAN TIMES would not confirm  these accusations but one source said that the embassy had been  able to win support among private sector businessmen here and  that these influential traders contacted the Foreign Ministry on  behalf of the embassy when it first became known that they were  being asked to reduce their staff.    Jordan and Iran restored diplomatic relations in 1990 after  a  decade of strained relations caused by Amman's support of Iraq  in the 1980-88 war. Iran reopened its embassy in March 1990 and  appointed the first ambassador in 13 years in October 1993.</p>

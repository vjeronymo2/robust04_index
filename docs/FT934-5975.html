			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bank of Japan move aids Nikkei The Tokyo investment community, seeking any sign that the authorities cared about the descending market, was heartened yesterday by larger than expected injections into the short term money market by the Bank of Japan, and the Nikkei average rose for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index gained 155.81 at 17,222.92 after a day's low of 17,003.30 and high of 17,410.04. The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 5.81 to 1,471.85, but declines led rises by 577 to 467, with 123 issues unchanged. Traders said sentiment had improved following Wednesday's comments by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, expressing concern over the recent declines in the stock market and saying that he was 'seriously watching over the movements'. Volume was 318m shares, against 310m. London continued to take no short term action on the local Nomura strategy team's 'worst case scenario' for the Nikkei, fearing a bottom as low as 12,000, and the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.66 firmer at 1,188.26. Money market traders said the central bank had pumped Y900bn into the market yesterday, prompting a fall in three-month certificate of deposit rates to a new low of 2.27 per cent. 'Now that the BoJ is moving, let us hope the government will also act to help stocks,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. The Nikkei fell in early trading, but later firmed on buying by tokkin, or specified money trusts, and life assurers, who were encouraged by the BoJ's stance on the money markets. Arbitrage selling and margin unwinding later hurt the index, but a rise in the futures market in the afternoon prompted arbitrage buying. In spite of yesterday's rise, traders said that selling pressure will remain strong ahead of the settlement of futures and options contracts on December 10. East Japan Railway rallied Y3,000 to Y439,000, while NTT lost Y7,000 to Y723,000. Banks continued to lose ground on fears of mounting bad loans. Some investors fear that the recent fall in the stock market will hurt banks, which are trying to write off such assets, covering the losses by realising profits on shareholdings. Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y30 to Y3,170 and Bank of Tokyo lost Y50 to Y1,660. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 47.70 to 19,230.96 in volume of 23.5m shares. Shimano, the bicycle parts maker, moved ahead Y70 to Y2,800. Roundup Pacific Rim markets put in a mixed performance. HONG KONG was buoyed by a late round of buying after a day of uncertain trading. The Hang Seng index finished 48.25 higher at 9,286.31. The mood, however, remained inhibited by the outlook for the 17th round of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political reform plans this weekend. Swire Pacific 'A' surged ahead HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 56: after the market closed it sold one-third of its Swire Aviation unit to Citic Pacific for HKDollars 120m. Citic retreated 30 cents to HKDollars 20.50. AUSTRALIA drifted to a higher close on bargain hunting, with the All Ordinaries index adding 9.6 at 2,042.0 in thin turnover of ADollars 462.5m. News Corp gained 30 cents at ADollars 10.10, while BHP shed 6 cents to ADollars 17.08 after having spent most of the session in positive territory. SINGAPORE's activity was dominated by Malaysian shares traded over the counter, and the Straits Times Industrial index moved forward 10.38 to 2,091.17. SEOUL ended an active day sharply lower on aggressive across-the-board profit-taking by both institutional and individual investors, and the composite stock index slipped 9.56 to 819.42. A smaller than expected flow of customer deposits into securities houses dampened expectations of a liquidity-driven rally. TAIWAN was firmer in moderate trading ahead of tomorrow's local government elections. The weighted index climbed 8.64 to 4,198.52 in turnover of TDollars 21.1bn. KUALA LUMPUR was steady in thin volume, with cautious buyers picking up selected stocks and the composite index moving within a five-point range before ending just 0.01 higher at 970.31. BANGKOK saw broking house Phatra Thanakit hit its 10 per cent downward limit at the close, losing Bt68 at Bt636. This followed news that the stock exchange authorities fined Phatra Thanakit Bt40m for an erroneous sell order of Ayudhya Investment and Trust shares on November 17. Both firms resumed trading, having been suspended since then: Ayudhya Investment rose Bt12 to Bt141. The SET index declined 12.41 to 1,309.26 in turnover of Bt11.05bn. MANILA slipped as investors took profits after trading began in Benpress, a media and power holding company. The issue, offered at 3.50 pesos, traded up to 12.25 pesos before closing at 10.50 pesos. The composite index receded 21.79 to 2,350.61 in turnover of 2.7bn pesos. BOMBAY ended slightly higher on late buying, reflecting hopes that carry forward costs to be fixed today would be lower than expectations. The BSE 30-share index advanced 24.59 to 3,077.94. KARACHI eased at the close on profit-taking and the KSE index finished 2.44 down on balance at 1,702.52, having opened 9.03 points ahead on reports that the US wants to lift sanctions on Pakistan. NEW ZEALAND edged forward as the market awaited the formation of a new cabinet. The NZSE-40 index finished 1.85 up at 2,060.31.</p>

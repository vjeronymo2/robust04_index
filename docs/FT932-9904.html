			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK and China agree on HK land sale ANGLO-CHINESE relations briefly returned to normal yesterday when British and Chinese officials agreed to the release of 127.8 hectares of land for sale in the 1993-94 financial year. Included in this year's land disposal programme is 45.59 hectares for the Black Point power station, located in the New Territories, which is due to come on stream in 1996. It will be fired by natural gas piped from a gas field near Hainan Island. The result of the meeting of the Sino-British land commission cheered the Hong Kong stock market. The Hang Seng Index rose 102.74 points to end the day at 6,841.97. However, British officials cautioned against too much optimism. Although the agreement was greeted with a measure of relief, they pointed out that China benefited directly from Hong Kong land sales and that it had no interest in undermining the colony's property market. Under the terms of the 1984 joint declaration, half of the proceeds of land sales in Hong Kong accrue to the colony's post-1997 government. A special fund set up to manage those proceeds has accumulated revenues in excess of HKDollars 80bn (Pounds 6.6bn). Still left unresolved by yesterday's meeting was the future development of the colony's container port. Last year the land commission approved the release of land for the ninth container terminal, but China rescinded the agreement in retaliation for Governor Chris Patten publicising his plans for wider political participation in the colony.</p>

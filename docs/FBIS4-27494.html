			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  staged an air war exercise, deploying scores of overseas-based  nuclear-capable F-16 and F-15 fighter-bombers, assault planes,  pursuit-assault planes, VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing]  assault planes and anti-submarine planes in South Korea on May  27 and 28, military sources said.    This provocative war exercise was aimed at examining the  quick deployment of overseas-based warplanes of various types in  the Korean peninsula and their capacity of entering into action.    This war gamble was part of their preparations for a war of  aggression to stifle the DPRK by force of arms.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Call To Extend Voting Day if Necessary -- "The election is  teetering in some areas," begins a page 10 editorial in  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 22 April. The list of  "unsupplied ballots, unopened stations and unstuck stickers is  proving much too long for comfort." It "seems unlikely that by  tonight" all people will have voted, and the Independent  Electoral Commission's (IEC) response has "thus far displayed  the smack of the high horse. The Commission should swallow its  pride. Its staff -- and South Africa knows they are exhausted,  and is grateful -- should stiffen the sinews for what could be a  long laaste skof [last shift]. If tomorrow must be a fourth  day, let it be so. Neither the letter of the law nor the  drooping of eyelids should lead to doors being closed as long as  any voters are left standing in the cold."    Call for 'Firm Action' Against Bombers -- A second editorial  on the same page says "nothing could have been more sickening  for ordinary citizens making their way to voting stations  yesterday than the news that another bomb had gone off, this  time at Jan Smuts Airport." News of arrests "is a welcome  indication that the police are pursuing their responsibilities  with vigour." The perpetrators of these "cowardly" acts should  be brought before the courts. "Only firm action will dissuade  the similarly-minded from more of the same as the new order  finds its feet."    U.S. Interest in South Africa -- On the same page Peter  Fabricius writes "In Washington" on the amount of U.S. media  attention to South Africa. Fabricius says that according to THE  WASHINGTON POST, "by many of the traditional definitions of  national interest, the U.S. might appear to have little stake in  the SA elections. There are no oil fields to protect, no U.S.  troops or bases in the region, no Soviet surrogates to contain  and no colonial guilt to assuage." Fabricius therefore believes  part of the explanation for the U.S. interest in South Africa  "seems to be enlightened self-interest. The Clinton  Administration has identified South Africa as one of the world's  10 best emerging markets and is trying hard to buy in while the  prices are low, so to speak."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   IEC `Not Totally To Blame' for Electoral Arrangement Faults  -- "Some of the failings of the R 700m [million rand] electoral  machine have been inexcusable, but tempting as it is to accuse  it, the Independent Electoral Commission is not totally to  blame," declares the page 8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS  DAY in English on 28 April. The IEC "was operating in a  situation without precedent, necessitating guesswork and  assumption about how many people would vote, and where."  Inkatha's last-minute decision to participate in the election  also "put a huge additional burden on an already pressed  organisation." Therefore, "if an extra public holiday,  additional polling hours, a few million more ballot papers and  some careful negotiation about controversial ballot papers can  overcome the problem, the nation will have come off lightly.  The new South Africa was never going to be easy, but it is  here."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   IEC Electoral Arrangements `Fine Job' -- "It would have been  a miracle for yesterday's elections to have gone off without  technical hitches," states a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 28 April. The paper notes that the IEC  was blamed for "shoddy arrangements in various areas." "In the  first place, such shortcomings are common to all elections. In  the second place, this country undertook this gigantic exercise  for the first time. Finally, the politicians should take much of  the blame for hindering the process towards election day and  making the work of the IEC difficult by the constant changing of  deadlines. The IEC, in fact, must be congratulated for doing a  fine job under difficult circumstances."</p>

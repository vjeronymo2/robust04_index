			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed J.I.: "Intensive and Often Clandestine </F> Military Assistance"]    [Text] Since the middle of 1990, when the French Armed  Forces came to the rescue of President Habyarimana's Hutu  regime, French assistance to Kigali had been especially  significant and often discreet, if not clandestine. At its  peak, France even went as far as providing Rwanda's governmental  army with some 150 French Government consultants or military  advisers on permanent secondment, not to mention the 400  paratroopers sent in 1993 to fight the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF), which at the time was backed by Uganda. In addition, it  supplied no less than 20 million francs [Fr] in military  equipment each year (or Fr40 million, including soldiers' pay).    The men sent to Rwanda to train its regular army mostly  belonged to the 1st Marine Paratrooper Corps (RPIMa), normally  based in Bayonne.    The 1st RPIMa is directly under the command of the army  chief  of staff; it is a unit which performs special missions. It was  sometimes relieved by teams from the 13th Corps of Paratrooper  Dragoons (RDP) based in Dieuze (Moselle), whose forte is  reconnaissance operations deep into hostile terrain. Commandos  belonging to the 13th RDP even entered Uganda covertly to assess  the nature of the assistance provided by this country to RPF  fighters.    Equipment provided by France, some of which was supplied for  free, to the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) was very diverse,  including light armored vehicles, Gazelle helicopters, Noratlas  or Guerrier aircraft, and pieces of field artillery. When the  fighting between the RPF and President Habyarimana's army was at  its fiercest, the guns were sometimes operated by French  soldiers.  <H5>  Traumatized French Soldiers </H5>   Similarly, French advisers were provided with  light-intensifier binoculars which make it possible to see and  shoot at night just as if it is broad daylight, in case they  needed to carry out clandestine actions. Binoculars of this  type were then left in the hands of the Rwandan Armed Forces.    For his travel needs, President Habyarimana was given a  Falcon 50 tri-jet aircraft (which was shot down, probably with a  ground-to-air missile, while landing on 6 April) to replace a  Caravelle III aircraft.    Never, however, were French military advisers instructed to  supervise or train Hutu militias, whose role in the exactions  perpetrated in Rwanda are today acknowledged by all, and which  are even now still slaughtering Hutu civilians. These militias,  whose weapons are often rather primitive, are complacently left  to their own devices by Rwanda's regular army, which relies on  them for the "dirty jobs" it wants to have carried out in the  field.    Among those French soldiers who evacuated foreign nationals  in April as part of operation "Amaryllis," after President  Habyarimana's plane was downed, some remember being assaulted by  Hutu militiamen who had gone berserk. Worse, some of the French  soldiers who were sent to Rwanda to escort some 1,420 foreign  nationals to Bangui (Central African Republic) had to witness --  without being able to intervene -- crimes committed by Hutu  militias in Kigali and the surrounding countryside. Today,  these French soldiers admit that they remain "traumatized" by  orders forbidding them to react, even while massacres were going  on under their eyes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Press conference given by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy reported by </F> Radmir Kilmatov: "Yavlinskiy Suggested That the Dollar's  Exchange Rate be Increased"]    [Text] At his press conference yesterday, Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy, people's deputy and head of the EPItsentr [Center  for Economic and Political Research], provided an assessment of  the current economic situation in Russia and the new composition  of the cabinet. He said the government does not have a program  and will not be able to overcome the crisis. Yavlinskiy said he  has such a program himself, and one of its elements is the  establishment of "a real dollar exchange rate."    In Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's estimation, the current situation  is  characterized by the practically complete lack of investments in  1993, the danger of granting preferential loans and budgetary  investments in 1994 ("the temptation is very great to become a  good and kind government"), the continuing production recession,  and by the dollar's exchange rate being held back by the  government when prices are rising (in the EPItsentr head's  opinion, the real exchange rate is 3,000 rubles to the dollar at  present).    In Yavlinskiy's opinion, there is "a vast inflationary  spring" of unpaid debts to farmers, the VPK [military industrial  complex], and budgetary organizations in the economy today (in  the view of the EPItsentr, the total indebtedness amounts to 5  percent of GNP). The attempt to resolve the problem of  nonpayments by credit methods led to the point that vast amounts  of credit funds did not reach the enterprises and "accumulated  in commercial banks," which engaged in conversion, as a result  of which $20 billion went abroad. A new negative factor has made  its appearance--"collectivization of industry," as the result of  40 percent of the property being turned over to labor  collectives in the privatization.    The government personnel approved by the president's edict  yesterday cannot solve Russia's economic problems, in  Yavlinskiy's opinion, inasmuch as it is "a typical government of  the Silayev type" which has no program ("only Chubays will be  working until the last voucher"). "We do not know whether it  visualizes the current situation in the economy or not,"  Yavlinskiy said, noting that the entire concept of government  must be changed, transformed from a sectorial concept into one  which takes the federal system of Russia into account.    In Yavlinskiy's opinion, the scenario for economic  development in 1994 under the current government will be as  follows: in the first quarter, inflation wil reach 30 percent  monthly and the ruble's exchange rate will fall faster than  prices rise. A critical point will be in the spring, when the  production recession will reach 50 percent of the 1989 level and  inflation will increase even further because of the money added  in the first quarter; as a result of state purchases and the  rise in prices for energy resources, the budget deficit will  increase sharply. The summer should be comparatively stable,  since "the main recession will be under way already." The  EPItsentr manager is very concerned about months in the fall,  since "the risk of losing control over inflation, which may  exceed 50 percent per month, will increase."    Yavlinskiy said he has his own program, which will make it  possible to hold inflation at the level of 20 percent monthly.  He said increasing the dollar's exchange rate "to the real rate"  is a top priority in such a program. In conformity with this  program, the government should assume responsibility for the  dynamics of the exchange rate--for example, by concluding  transactions in futures, compensating for fluctuations in the  exchange rate. The government should also reject any forms of  preferential credit and subsidization and put an end to trade  with import credits in the currency market. Institutional  changes in the structure of the economic system and a structural  and technological industrial policy are among the program's  measures requiring prompt attention.</p>

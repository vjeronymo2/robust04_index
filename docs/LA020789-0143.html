			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> The president and chairman of Standard Logic Inc. has resigned after a dispute  with company directors over management of the small Anaheim electronics  manufacturer.  </P> <P> Dennis A. Wade resigned Jan. 27. His replacement is Wes Baumgardner, a company  founder and president and chairman from 1967 to 1987.  </P> <P> The company also said it has canceled a letter of intent to merge with U.S.  Metals &amp; American Welding Supply, a metal manufacturer in Sandy, Ore. "The  terms they submitted to us were not acceptable," Baumgardner said. He said  Standard Logic will continue to seek other merger candidates.  </P> <P> Baumgardner said the differences between Wade and the board coincided with a  worsening financial picture in November. The company expects to report a loss  of more than $1 million on revenue of $2.4 million for its fiscal year ended  Oct. 31.  </P> <P> Baumgardner said the firm is "reevaluating its assets" after a sharp decline in  sales and new orders in the first quarter ended Jan. 31. Revenue declined 56%  to $232,000, from $534,000 a year earlier.  </P> <P> He said the company has "redirected" its marketing program and hopes to return  to profitability within 3 months.  </P> <P> Standard Logic, which employed 130 people and had sales of more than $8 million  in the 1974-75 period, currently has only 13 employees.  </P></p>

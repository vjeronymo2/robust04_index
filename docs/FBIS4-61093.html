			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Zadunov: "Let Number 13 Be Lucky"] </F>   [Text] Republic of Crimea -- Thirteen leaders of political  parties registered in the Crimea have put their signatures to an  "Accord for Revival" declaration which was adopted at a  roundtable session.    The parties, which signed this charter stated their  readiness  for mutual accord and close cooperation with the Crimean Supreme  Council, president, and Government in the interests of creating  favorable conditions for extricating the Crimea from the  political and economic crisis into which it is being thrown.    The declaration contains the idea of building a  parliamentary  presidential republic. All branches of power in it would be  legally equal to each other, a government of national confidence  would be formed, and equal participation in governing all the  peoples populating the Crimea would be ensured. The document  approves the implementation of economic reforms and the  transformation of the Crimea into a focus for all CIS countries'  economic and cultural interests in conditions of civil peace and  accord.    All this should serve to create on Republic of Crimea  territory a regime of open economy. The parties are also  declaring their intention to make all their actions strictly  commensurate with the provisions of the Crimean Constitution and  international law.    The party leaders who signed the declaration also called on  Presidents L. Kravchuk and Yu. Meshkov not to take  ill-considered steps in their mutual relations, which could  adversely affect people's futures.</p>

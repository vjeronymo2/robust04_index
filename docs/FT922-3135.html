Ms Anne Campbell, Labour MP for Cambridge, highlighted the growing loss of scientists to Britain. She said the proportion of Fellows of the Royal Society living in the US had increased from 4 per cent in the early 1960s, to 13 per cent in 1984, 20 per cent in 1991 and an estimated 30 per cent in 1992.

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / SA peace summit set for weekend THE African National Congress (ANC) and the South African government last night agreed that their leaders should hold a peace summit within days to pave the way for the resumption of talks on a post-apartheid constitution. After 10 days of negotiations, the two sides agreed late yesterday that the summit should be held at the weekend. Mr FW de Klerk, the president, and Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, would be the main participants. Agreement was reached after the two sides resolved the issue of the release of political prisoners, including three ANC members involved in terrorist attacks. It was understood that the three would be released shortly. The summit is likely to focus on measures such as action to contain violence emanating from single-sex township hostels, the banning of weapons in public, and the issue of an amnesty for government security officers, as well as the question of ANC mass protest actions leading to violence.</p>

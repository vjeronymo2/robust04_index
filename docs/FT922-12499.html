			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Russia brushes CIS partners aside on Start treaty RUSSIA alone will ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) with the US, in spite of demands from other former Soviet states holding nuclear weapons to be co-signatories, according to Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister. Start ratification has been delayed by the collapse of the Soviet Union, co-signatory to the treaty. Mr Kozyrev said: 'The production of nuclear weapons is on Russian territory, thus the dismantling must also be on Russian territory. If you have to choose which of the four nuclear states would sign the treaty, it must be Russia.' The demand to be a Start co-signatory has been voiced by Ukraine among the other three nuclear states, which include Belarus and Kazakhstan. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Kozyrev stressed that war between the former Soviet states - particularly Russia and Ukraine - was 'unthinkable'. But he warned that Russia was prepared to use 'every other kind of leverage available to a great power', including economic embargos and sanctions, 'to protect the interests of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the interests of Russia'. The foreign minister said a resolution due to go before the Russian parliament demanding the return to Russia of Crimea, at present part of Ukraine and home to the Black Sea Fleet, could 'have a destabilising effect'. But he said Crimea should hold a referendum to decide its status. Last night the Crimean parliament's presidium recognised as valid a petition signed by nearly 250,000 people calling for a referendum on independence 'in union with other states'. If ratified by the parliament, the referendum could be held in June. Mr Kozyrev said: 'It is extremely important that Russian-Ukrainian relations be kept within the CIS framework. Only under that would the frontiers between us be guaranteed. We respect very much Ukrainian independence but they must be realistic in dealing with Russia not to destabilise the situation.' The foreign minister said he had approached neutral countries such as Austria and Finland to provide officers for CIS peacekeeping forces which could be deployed in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and Moldova, where there have been clashes over the Trans-Dnestrian region.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Pakistan denial over Chinese missiles Pakistan denied yesterday it had received long-range M-11 missiles from China, which faces possible sanctions by the US for its weapons exports, Reuter reports from Islamabad. China has repeatedly denied the sale of M-11 missiles to Pakistan and yesterday told the US to stop making an issue of its weapons exports. US officials said earlier in the week in Washington that the administration, which two months ago renewed favourable trade benefits for China, planned to warn Beijing it could face sanctions. They said the issue, involving mounting evidence that China was shipping M-11 missile technology to Pakistan, would be raised by Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, when he met the Chinese foreign minister, Mr Qian Qichen, on Sunday in Singapore.</p>

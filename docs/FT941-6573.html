			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional boosts Pegasus to Pounds 6.93m Pegasus Group, supplier of accounting software for small and medium sized companies, showed sharply improved profitability last year after a change of management, a substantial disposal and the launch of a new flagship accounting system. The company, based in Kettering, Northamptonshire, reported 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.93m, including exceptional profits from the disposal of its business forms operations of Pounds 6.15m. Profits for the previous 17 months were Pounds 620,000, including exceptional credits of Pounds 337,000. Earnings per share were 76.1p (7.7p) or excluding exceptionals 7.8p (2.1p). A final dividend of 3p is proposed for a total of 5p, against 9p for the previous 17 months. Turnover was Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 10.3m) including Pounds 2.61m (Pounds 3.75m) from discontinued activities. Mr Jonathan Hubbard-Ford, appointed chief executive in a boardroom coup in December 1992, said the company was set for recovery following a poor diversification and acquisition programme which had damaged both cash flow and product development. The company's business forms operations had been sold in total to Deluxe Corporation for Pounds 8.75m in cash plus a further estimated Pounds 1.25m. As a result year-end cash balances stood at Pounds 8.28m. Net interest income contributed Pounds 229,000 (Pounds 297,000) to the pre-tax figure. The company's share of the 'modular' accounting systems market was up 5 percentage points to 32 per cent by value. Losses on software products were reduced to Pounds 319,000 (Pounds 1.04m), due to the launch of the latest version of Pegasus' principal accounting package, Senior. The company's future, however, depends to a large extent on its new flagship product, Pegasus Opera. It is thought to have taken 10 per cent of the modular market since its launch in September last year.</p>

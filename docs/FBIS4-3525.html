			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Soifa Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- The Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) faxed a message to its mainland Chinese  counterpart Wednesday [20 April] suggesting that a special round  of talks be held in Hong Kong April 27-29 on issues related to  the March 31 Qiandao Lake travel disaster, in which 24 Taiwan  tourists died.    "We hope Beijing's Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait (ARATS) will give US a definite answer soon," SEF  Secretary- General Chiao Jen-ho said.    It was the second time in less than half a month SEF  expressed its intention to talk with ARATS about the Qiandao  Lake incident. ARATS failed to reply to a similar request made  last week.    Chiao reaffirmed that the talks will focus on possible  compensation for the bereaved families of the incident's victims  as well as the protection of Taiwan tourists and businessmen in  Mainland China.    He again urged Beijing authorities to thoroughly investigate  the incident, to make public the results of the investigation,  and to respond to 10 unanswered questions of the families,  including why autopsies were performed on the victims' bodies  without the prior approval of their relatives.    "Although ARATS has informed US that mainland authorities  have already arrested three suspects involved in the incident,  the message was too simple to settle our doubts and  apprehensions," Chiao noted.    Beijing's handling of the incident angered not only the  bereaved families but also the general public and government  authorities here. Local travel agencies have decided to stop  organizing tour groups to the mainland from May 1.  Government-sponsored cultural exchanges with the mainland have  also been suspended.    Chiao said that unless Beijing opens up about the matter in  detail and handles all related issues properly, cross-Strait  relations would be adversely affected.    SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations founded by  their respective governments to handle cross-Strait exchanges in  the absence of official ties.</p>

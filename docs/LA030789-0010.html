			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LESBIAN GETS 25 YEARS FOR SLAYING WOMAN  </P> <P> A lesbian sailor who was convicted of murdering another woman in a love  triangle was sentenced Monday to 25 years to life in state prison.  </P> <P> Sherral Lyn Clayton, 25, of Lemon Grove was given the term for the Oct. 7  slaying of Shelly Dupee, 21, who was found stabbed 54 times, with her throat  slashed, in her Spring Valley apartment.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Chappell said in court last month that Clayton "killed  the competition" because both women had been dating a third woman.  </P> <P> A Superior Court jury convicted Clayton of first-degree murder Feb. 2 after  deliberating 2 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> Clayton testified that she killed Dupee in self-defense after Dupee attacked  her, saying: "You're not going to take Debbie away from me." Clayton was  arrested at a hospital, where she received six stitches for cuts to her  fingers.  </P> <P> Clayton had worked as a jet mechanic and had been in the Navy for eight years,  according to the probation report.  </P> <P> The "other woman" listed in the report said her relationship with Clayton ended  a month and a half before the slaying because of her interest in Dupee.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The change of government in Slovakia has evoked a  positive response abroad, Eduard Kukan, the new foreign  minister, said in the "Kroky" TV program.    Regarding relations with neighboring countries, he said that  he is not very optimistic about whether it will be possible for  the government to comprehensively resolve relations with the  Czech Republic and Hungary during its six months in office. A  peaceful atmosphere, however, must be created first of all.    As to the U.S. press, he noted that it views Slovakia as a  naughty child. That is why it is the role of the new diplomacy  to provide an objective picture of Slovakia.</p>

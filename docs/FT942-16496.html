			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The BES and tax Could you please give some information on the effect of payments under approved BES on total income for tax purposes. 1. If the relief given for BES payments in Paye coding reduces the tax liability to the 20 per cent band, is it possible to claim relief on the unused part of this band (eg, against building society interest taxed at 25 per cent). 2. Do payments under BES reduce total income so that, where appropriate, the various age reliefs may be claimed? 1: Yes. 2: No. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets IR51 (Business expansion scheme) and IR121 (Income tax and pensioners). IR51 is obsolete but might still be available. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

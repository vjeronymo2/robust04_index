			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wilson (Connolly) falls Pounds 5m in depressed market WILSON (CONNOLLY) Holdings, the Northampton-based builder, saw pre-tax profits drop from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 8.77m in the first half of 1992. The interim dividend is held at 1.27p. Turnover dipped from Pounds 99.9m to Pounds 97.2m. House sales were slightly lower. Wilson said it sold 1,250 houses at a net margin of 11 per cent in the first-half compared to 1,300 homes in the 1991 period. Mr Lynn Wilson, chairman, said that 'house prices have continued to fall with a consequential effect on profits,' and it was difficult to see any recovery in the housing market. However, he added that,'by careful management of our resources and the proceeds of our share placing, we are currently cash positive and interest payments during the period were 14 times covered by pre-tax profits.' The company said that its property side continued to trade profitably while its construction company 'continued to perform creditably in a most difficult and competitive market.' Earnings per share fell to 3.2p (5.1p), but the unchanged dividend remains covered 2.5 times.</p>

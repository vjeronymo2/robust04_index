According to local officials, the province met its target of  gaining the capacity to produce an annual 930,000 tons of steel  at the end of the Eighth Five-Year-Plan period (1991-1995) two  years ahead of schedule. Last year's steel output represents an  increase of 15.5 percent compared with the previous year.    Gansu, regarded as one of China's most backward areas,  abounds in iron ore resources. With the introduction of reform  measures concerning labor, personnel and distribution, the  initiative of workers in local iron and steel companies have  been brought into full play, and the province's steel output has  increased at an annual rate of 80,000 tons to 100,000 tons over  the past three years. Economic results were also enhanced for  three years running.    Last year the province recorded 700 million yuan in profits  and taxes from steel production.</p>

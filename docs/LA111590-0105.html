			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Iroquois Pipeline Approved: A $583-million pipeline to supply Canadian natural  gas to the utilities in the northeastern United States moved a step closer to  construction as the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  unanimously approved the project. The decision came after months of debate  between utility companies and environmentalists over whether or not the  370-mile Iroquois Gas Transmission System project was needed. The pipeline,  carrying natural gas from Alberta, will run from Iroquois, Ontario, to Long  Island, N.Y., crossing New York state and Connecticut.  </P></p>

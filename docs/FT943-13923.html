			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: From figures to dragons, suns, moons and laughter - An exhibition of Maggi Hambling's recent work As she approaches 50, Maggi Hambling remains as unpredictable and unclassifiable as she is prolific. Not only does she never seem to stop unless tied down, her paints confiscated and studio locked, but what she does is likely to surprise and test even the most committed of her supporters. Portraits, life drawings, landscapes, mystical abstractions upon landscape, symbolist or mystical abstraction - all have appeared in their turn over the past dozen years or so, and not as single spies at that, but in battalions. She is something of a surrealist, and an expressionist within the broad meaning of the act - though for saying as much I was once pinned against the wall by the late and redoubtable Vera Russell, who said to me darkly as she shook me by the throat: 'Maggi is not an Expressionist: Expressionists are German.' Even she, I feel, had she seen this latest work, would now concede the point. Towards Laughter, her show at the Barbican, offers us a just such a view of the paintings of the last ten years, with a handful of earlier works to set the thread. It is not a straightforward retrospective, but more a retrospective of an idea, and its development within the work. Miss Hambling, in her portraiture and figure painting, has always been interested in physical expression, passing moods and states of mind. The show opens with one or two examples - a portrait, from the mid-1970s, of Lett Haines, her sometime teacher, roaring with laughter and profoundly convincing in its psychological subtlety; and another laughing and this time female head from 1984, which is more robustly stated. But rather closer to the particular idea, as we see it develop through the show, are two much stranger images. The first is of the ghost of another of her great teacher-friends, the artist Cedric Morris, a wispy and transparent ectoplasmic figure in his chair against the light. The second, 'In Praise of Smoking', is a conversation piece in the extended series of paintings she made of her friend, the comedian Max Wall, in the early 1980s. It shows the two of them in the studio, one posing, the other painting, with the smoke from their cigarettes rising to come together in a cloud above their heads, a cloud personified in the head of ghostly monkey. The jump from this to the first of the sunrise paintings, which marks the transition from overtly figurative painting to the abstraction that makes up by far the greater part of the show, is thus not so great as it might at first appear. The key work is the Dragon Sunrise of 1986, a burst of orange against the blue out of a black cloud that immediately calls to mind the Zen temple ceiling paintings of Japan. Soon the moon appears, to do battle with the sun - reflected images, ambiguous surfaces, suggestions of pools and water, or dragons and demons chasing the richly darkening sky. These are increasingly ambitious and dangerous paintings, in terms both of scale and content, and it is a measure of the artist's skill that she carries them off so often, and so beautifully, in this phase of the work. And suddenly, with the 1990s, the laughs take over, great bursts and belly laughs of pigment, pools of colour, swirling and rioting together. They begin quite soberly with 'The Happy Dead', another symbolic and abstracted sky, and so, happiness to laughter, the thought of the physical, visible presence and description of mood and sound, the intangible and the evanescent, is born. These are now high risk ideas and images, the danger ever-present of ludicrous, bathetic failure and belly flop, and it is a measure of Miss Hambling's nerve that she has persisted with them with such spirit and, in the event, to such effect. Here they are: 'Brothel Laugh', all puce, pink and voluptuous with hints of buttocks and black stockings; 'Suicide Laugh', desperate, defiant and vertiginous, light on dark and into the void; 'Bathroom Laugh', swirling, supine forms, pink against blue; 'Laugh Defying Death', legs kicked in the air; 'Champagne Laugh', yellow froth and glass held high; 'Secret Laugh', off to the side and turning away; 'Ghosts of Laughs', fading into silence. Lately Miss Hambling has also made some ceramic sculpture, linear, spindly, precariously curling and colourful objects that are, in sort, cousins to her painted images. Like them they are suggestive and evocative things that invite sympathetic recognition and fellow feeling. But then the shared joke is no mere laughing matter, but a privilege too. We laugh or die. Maggi Hambling laughs a lot, and this is a brave show. Maggi Hambling - Towards Laughter; the Concourse Gallery, Level 5, the Barbican EC2, until July 31, then on to Preston.

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: Tougher business entry regulation would give stability and strength Sir, The government and other optimists often quote the number of new company registrations as a sign of growth and regeneration of industry. This ignores the fact that very many of these are 'phoenix' companies, set up to acquire the assets (but not liabilities) of bust businesses, often owned by the same people who owned the previous business. There is evidence that this process is sometimes a deliberate 'financial cleansing': I am sure we have all seen it. Anyone with even 'O' level economics will know that a reasonable level of profits can only be maintained in any industry if there are barriers to entry sufficient to keep irresponsible traders out. UK company and insolvency law does nothing to help in this respect, and while it continues to allow the recycling of assets in fragmented and over competitive industries, it will delay the recovery of profits and the return of investor confidence. I suggest that stricter criteria are needed for those starting in business and who wish to enjoy limited liability, than the Pounds 50 or so it takes to buy an off-the-shelf company. In the long run, effective measures would lead to greater stability and industrial strength in many sectors.

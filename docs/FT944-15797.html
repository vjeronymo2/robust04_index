			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / This Week: Film/Video The question occupying most sensible UK filmgoers at present is: 'How do we avoid seeing Forrest Gump even though all our friends are going?' Here are some suggestions. Tell your friends you have it on good authority (FT film critic) that Gump is a long, winsome, platitudinous piece of Hollywoodiana. Then move smartly off in the direction of Pulp Fiction. All the things said against Quentin Tarantino's Cannes Golden Palm-winning thriller, opening this week, are true. It is violent, amoral, foul-mouthed and drugs-obsessed, and, as a piece of action cinema, it makes the same director's Reservoir Dogs look like Lady and the Tramp. In addition, its mongrel cast - John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel - spend 2 1/2 hours trying to make sense of a four-stories-in-one screenplay. But the things said for the film are also true. Tarantino has a gift for black comedy unsurpassed in modern film-making and a wild pop-art eloquence as a dialogue writer. Try the film yourself. If you are worried about what to do with Aunt Edna, drop her off at Forrest Gump. On no account let her stay at home with most of the new video releases. They include the cheerfully OTT Mafia comedy Romeo Is Bleeding (Gary Oldman as a violent Mob trouble-shooter) and the good-in-parts gothic gore fantasy Necronomicon. But they also include the hauntingly beautiful Vietnamese film The Scent Of Green Papaya. Tran Anh Hung's meditation-in-miniature on loss, love and family,filmed entirely inside a French studio, was a hit of last year's festival season. It is slow, sensual and lyrically-shot: a painting come to life. Other good news for Aunt Edna. The Client, opening this week, is a clean and decent John Grisham thriller about a boy witness caught in a trial-room tug of war. And that chaste and charming comedy, Four Weddings And a Funeral, is still showing, having become the highest-earning British film ever (Dollars 200m worldwide). This means that all those subsidy-obsessed British film people who keep crying out for lucrative grants now have one: Hugh Grant.</p>

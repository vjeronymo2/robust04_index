			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY SENDS IN NEW PLAY FOR COLISEUM;  </P> <P> RAIDERS: MAYOR'S DEPUTY SAYS A CHANGE IN MANAGERS MAY BE NEEDED TO MAKE THE  FOOTBALL TEAM A BETTER OFFER.  </P> <P> In an indication that Mayor Tom Bradley is dissatisfied with the progress of  talks to keep the Raiders in Los Angeles, his deputy, Mark Fabiani, suggested  Monday that it might be necessary to find a new private manager for the  Coliseum to make the football team a better offer.  </P> <P> The president of the current Coliseum private management firm, Spectacor  Management Group, said Fabiani's statement comes at an inopportune time, just  days after Spectacor made Raider owner Al Davis a new offer to which he has not  yet responded.  </P> <P> Besides, Spectacor official Anthony Tavaras said, Bradley does not have the  authority to retain a new private manager. Such a decision to pay off  Spectacor's Coliseum contract and obtain a new manager would have to be made by  the Coliseum Commission, to which the city appoints three of nine members.  </P> <P> Against the background of a new $127-million Oakland offer to the Raiders with  a 45-day acceptance deadline, Fabiani said Bradley is concerned that there may  not be much time to pursue the Raider negotiations.  </P> <P> Accordingly, Fabiani said, the mayor has asked him and his new appointee to the  Coliseum Commission, labor leader William R. Robertson, "to look at all  available options."  </P> <P> "If it becomes clear at some point that Spectacor can't or won't perform under  its agreement with the Coliseum Commission, the mayor has an obligation to  explore every other possibility to keep professional football in Los Angeles,"  he said.  </P> <P> However, he added, Bradley does not regard an infusion of public money as a  possibility. The options under discussion are a new private manager, or a new  partner for Spectacor, replacing MCA Inc., which bowed out. A new partner might  enable Spectacor to make a better offer.  </P> <P> Tavaras, however, expressed concern that Fabiani's statements might undercut  Spectacor's latest offer to Davis. He characterized the offer as generous.  </P> <P> What is reported to be blocking a Los Angeles agreement with Davis is his  demand for an unconditional $10-million cash advance, guaranteeing that the  Coliseum will be renovated. Spectacor does not want to make the payment all at  once and it wants other conditions met.  </P> <P> If environmental or historic preservation considerations were to prevent  renovations, then the Raiders could keep the money, just as they kept a  $10-million advance from Irwindale when that city was unable to fulfill its  promise to build a stadium there.  </P> <P> Some Oakland officials have suggested that if Davis were to accept the latest  Oakland offer, the Raiders might buy out the rest of their Los Angeles Coliseum  contract, which has two years remaining, and move back to Oakland in time for  this fall's games.  </P></p>

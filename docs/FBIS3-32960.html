			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments through 15 February:    Foreign Trade Minister Juan Santos has said the Group of  Three's (G-3) agreement to create a free trade zone -- the  Agreement of Economic Cooperation -- has not been stalled by  tariff issues. According to Santos, the members of the G-3 --  Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico -- fully agree on tariffs, and  he added that only small details are pending. He also said that  if everything goes according to plan, the agreement will be  signed within 30 days. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1955 GMT 8 Feb 94)    The multinational oil firm Dutch Shell has asked the  Colombian Government for a 10-year extension of its concession  for the exploitation of an oil field in the southern department  of Huila. The oil field, which is scheduled to revert to the  state on 18 November, yields 18,000 barrels of crude a day.  Shell said that if the extension is granted, it will comply  with the terms established by the government and will pay  corresponding royalties. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2035 GMT 9 Feb  94)    Official sources said today that Colombia was able to  increase its banana exports by 10.8 percent during the past year  despite the difficulties this Latin American export is facing in  the European market. In 1993, banana exports yielded $400  million in revenues. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1833 GMT 10  Feb 94)    The expected revenues Colombia will receive from the Cusiana  oil bonanza have prompted the government to request $400 million  less in new loans than the planned amount for 1994. This  measure seeks to avoid a greater increase in international  reserves, which could interfere with exchange and monetary  policies. In addition, the government seeks to reduce the  foreign public debt from $15 billion to $10 billion from now  until the year 2,000. The Executive Branch has already notified  the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank of the  move. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 11 Feb 94 pp 1A,  1B, 3B)</p>

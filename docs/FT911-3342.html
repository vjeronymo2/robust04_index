			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Poor second half as CI dips 38% CI GROUP, the formerly acquisitive steel and engineering concern, saw pre-tax profit fall 38 per cent to Pounds 4.83m in the year to January 31. The decline, from Pounds 7.77m, came in spite of a 9.5 per cent turnover increase to Pounds 93.75m (Pounds 85.61m). CI said this was accounted for by acquisitions early last year. Mr Albert Hargreaves, chairman, said the pain of UK recession had been felt since October. Only Pounds 1m was added to interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.8m. In the steel division, turnover expanded 8 per cent to Pounds 49m, but pre-tax profit fell 34 per cent to Pounds 3.2m. Worst hit had been sales of reinforcing material to the construction industry. Engineering turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 44.7m, but profit fell to Pounds 1.62m. The capital goods business slipped into loss as sales plummeted by a third. Early this year, Mr Cedric Grew, a driving force behind the acquisitions policy, resigned as chief executive. He was replaced by Mr Rob Yates, the former head of the steel division. Mr Hargreaves said the resultant review of activities had focused on the problem areas of reinforcing, capital goods and part of the foundry business. Two factories had been closed and further rationalisation was going on. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.46m (Pounds 696,000) was made. Some unspecified costs were also incurred above the line, as the workforce was cut by 7 per cent to 1,500 and Mr Grew was paid off. Mr Hargreaves said the group had grown quickly and encompassed 20 companies. 'But probably 80 per cent of the turnover is generated by 20 per cent of them.' It would concentrate on areas where it had a significant market share or a concentration of management skills. A prime example was industrial flooring, where Redman Fisher Engineering had won a Queen's Award for export. Operating profit fell to Pounds 6.64m (Pounds 9.31m) and interest charges rose to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.55m). Year-end gearing was reduced to 40 per cent (44 per cent) of shareholders' funds of Pounds 16m (Pounds 17m). Capital spending was cut from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2.5m. Earnings per share slid to 3.77p (5.93p). A slightly reduced final dividend of 1.225p leaves the total unchanged at 2.05p. COMMENT Several nettles have been grasped at CI, as the changed leadership has given belated priority to managing recession rather than growth by acquisition. Cash has started to move in the right direction and orders have picked up since a dismal February. With 79 per cent of sales in the UK, the group has obvious vulnerability and many uncertainties remain, not least over how much more the reorganisation will cost. A second-half improvement might rescue profit to another Pounds 4.8m, a prospective p/e of 7.8 on yesterday's close of 29 1/2 p. Its 25 per cent discount to the engineering sector reflects uncertainty over both trading prospects and the results of the reorganisation. Until the picture is clearer, the share price is unlikely to make much headway.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'TIS THE SEASON TO SHOP -- BUT IT'S OFF TO SLOW START;  </P> <P> COUNTY'S MALLS, SWAP MEET BUSTLE ON 'OPENING' DAY  </P> <P> While Orange County malls absorbed the biggest crowds of the holiday season's  opening day Friday, thousands of area shoppers chose a different course,  browsing for bargains at a bustling county swap meet.  </P> <P> Under overcast skies, shoppers from throughout the county milled among 1,200  booths and an eclectic mix of products, from Quake Ready Survival Kits to  sunglasses to auto accessories.  </P> <P> John Stevens, 14, of Huntington Beach said he "mainly came here for the  inexpensive prices." Carrying bags in both arms, Stevens said he had "just  about finished all my Christmas shopping in under two hours. . . . .This place  is pretty good."  </P> <P> Stevens was among the tens of thousands of shoppers to descend on the Orange  County Fairgrounds, picking the sprawling swap meet as an alternative to the  county's packed shopping malls, where limited parking and traffic snarls  complicated an already hectic day.  </P> <P> Doug Davenport, the self-proclaimed Shammy Man, said business at his booth of  absorbent car towels has been "wonderful." He said he averaged about 100 sales  an hour, adding, "This place is crazy with shoppers."  </P> <P> Davenport also sold his 125 copies of the farewell edition of the Los Angeles  Herald Examiner for $10 each. The newspaper closed shop Nov. 2.  </P> <P> The swap meet extended its regular Saturday-Sunday schedule to accommodate  shoppers who like to tackle their Christmas lists the day after Thanksgiving.  Richard Olsson, managing director of the swap meet, said the 20-year-old,  open-air market attracts a steady stream of customers who shy away from the  scene at area malls. "I can't guarantee better prices, but I can guarantee a  better time," he said.  </P> <P> In contrast to the easygoing atmosphere at the swap meet, area malls grappled  with long lines and occasional traffic delays.  </P> <P> By noon, many of the malls were teeming with consumers searching for Christmas  presents as well as parking spaces. Cars overflowed the South Coast Plaza mall  in Costa Mesa, backing up traffic and overwhelming valet parking services. At  times, the line for South Coast Plaza backed up as far as the San Diego Freeway  near the Bristol Street exit, causing minor delays.  </P> <P> Shoppers also backed up traffic on the Santa Ana Freeway, where delays were  common all day long. But the sometimes chaotic scene outside did little to  dampen the enthusiasm of storekeepers who depend on the Friday after  Thanksgiving to open the holiday shopping season with gusto.  </P> <P> "This day is unique in retailing," Jo Qualls, vice president of the Costa Mesa  Tiffany &amp; Co., said as patrons crammed into her store. "We all wait for  this day all year long. This is what makes the retail world exciting."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE JUDGE: WHEN AIDS ENTERS IN TO HOUSE SALE  </P> <P> Q. I would like to sell my house that I have been renting out for the last few  years. My tenant, a very nice young man, died a few months ago from AIDS. I am  wondering if I have any duty to tell a buyer about this. Does the law say I  have to?  </P> <P> GG, Orange  </P> <P> A. The law requires an owner of real property to disclose to the buyer if an  occupant has died on the property in the three years before the date of the  offer to purchase, except if the occupant died of AIDS.  </P> <P> If the buyer, however, asks you any questions concerning any deaths on the  property, the law does prohibit you from intentionally misrepresenting the  facts to him.  </P> <P> Q. I am a single parent with a teen-age son. My son is normally a good kid with  average grades. He, like most boys his age, does occasionally get into trouble,  which is why I am writing to you.  </P> <P> A week ago, my son was caught with a friend writing school slogans on a  neighbor's fence. The neighbor was furious and said I couldn't control my  child. My feeling is that my son should be the one he's yelling at. What's the  law on this?  </P> <P> TP, Santa Ana  </P> <P> A. The law specifically provides that a parent is responsible for any graffiti  that her minor child willfully writes on another person's property. A parent  can be sued for an amount not more than $10,000 for each act of misconduct by  the minor, as well as court costs and attorney fees if the parent loses in  court.  </P> <P> Q. Last year I won a small claims case, and the defendant owes me a little  under $1,000. What is the best way to try to collect?  </P> <P> BT, Anaheim Hills  </P> <P> A. This is a commonly asked question and one that seems to trouble most small  claims plaintiffs that win their lawsuit. As a result, the Legislature has just  passed a law that would allow a small claims debtor to pay the amount of the  judgment to the court that heard the case. The court will notify the judgment  service. Contact the court that heard your case for more details on how to use  this new procedure.  </P> <P> If you don't want to do this, you may follow any of the more traditional  approaches. One of the most commonly used methods would be to garnish the wages  of your judgment debtor so that his employer withholds a portion of his  paycheck to satisfy your judgment.  </P> <P> Another method is to execute on any real or personal property that the judgment  debtor may possess. This method would result in the property being sold in  order to satisfy your judgment.  </P> <P> You may also place a lien on real and personal property of the debtor.  </P> <P> If you do not know what kind of property, if any, the debtor possesses, you may  require him to appear at a judgment debtor examination and be questioned under  oath by you.  </P> <P> Again, contact the court that heard your case for more information about these  methods.  </P></p>

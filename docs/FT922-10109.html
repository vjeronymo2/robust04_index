			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Property: Bath houses updated - Michael Hanson returns to one of England's most elegant cities I LIVED in Bath 32 years ago, and I am always pleased to return to this graceful Georgian city to see how it is faring at the hands of the developers and the preservationists. The developers got their way for too long in the 1960s and 1970s, with the connivance of the city and county councils. In recent years conservationists have been in the ascendancy. Today, Bath is bustling. The city of Beau Brummel is looking elegant again: most of its stone buildings have been cleaned of their two centuries of smoke and grime. But there is still much to do. Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, a London agent, is seeking a buyer for the Empire Hotel, that grand Edwardian building overlooking Pulteney Bridge and the weir. Bath city council is offering it for sale on a 125-year lease with planning permission for its restoration as a 100-bedroom hotel. The city needs it. Bath is still a civilised place in which to live, and eminently commutable now that British Rail's inter-city service takes only 81 minutes to Paddington. That people still want to live in elegant surroundings is shown by the experience of Johnson Fairchild, a local firm of property developers going from strength to strength over the past five years, despite the recession. 'We are a small company doing quality work, and I don't think the recession has made much difference to the market for quality,' says Brian Fairchild. 'We tackle two or three sizable projects a year and, to be honest, the margins are better now than they were.' The company's latest project is the restoration of two 18th century houses in Great Pulteney Street, on the other side of Pulteney Bridge. The shops on either side remind one of how medieval London Bridge used to look. Since the Second World War, these two houses had been converted into 12 rented flats, part of a portfolio of properties in Bath owned by a private family company. With the help of Angela Crofts, a local architect, building surveyor Alan Hardiman, and specialist builder G J Gilbert, Fairchild Johnson restored these Grade I listed houses to their 1792 standard of elegance - when Great Pulteney Street was one of the most fashionable streets in England. Angela Crofts says: 'Over the years, these fine but neglected Georgian houses had fallen into a sad state of disrepair. The street facade had been cleaned and restored but, internally, previous multi-occupancy meant that most of the original rooms were subdivided. There were numerous old-fashioned kitchens, bathrooms and toilets, some on half landings or in decrepit extensions to the rear.' All the architectural details have been restored or replaced. This being 1992, not 1792, refinements such as central heating, modern kitchens and bathrooms, service lifts and security systems have also been installed. The result is two fine buildings. One is a whole house of some 7,000 sq ft, with three principal bedrooms and bathrooms; a two-bedroom staff or nursery flat on the top floor; three spacious reception rooms; a whole floor with kitchen, breakfast room, dayroom, and utility room; and another floor with a whirlpool bath, fitness room and conservatory, opening on to a garden. At the end of the garden there is parking for two cars. Offers of Pounds 750,000 are being sought for this house by the Bath office of Savills and local agents Cobb Farr. Next door, Johnson Fairchild has converted the house into two maisonettes: four-bedroom apartments, each for sale at Pounds 375,000. One is already under offer at the full asking price. In the centre of the terrace, with a tall round-headed window in the drawing room, this is the more elegant of the two houses, but it was easier to convert than its neighbour, and the developers did not feel the market was yet ripe for two whole houses. 'Bath is a very small town with a very tight market,' explains Brian Fairchild. 'We have lived here all our lives, and we know the right streets  -and the right side of those streets in which to buy property.' Until five years ago Brian Fairchild was a garage proprietor in Bath. He sold his business at the top of the boom, and joined forces with Keith Johnson, a former restaurateur. The third director of Johnson Fairchild plc, Brett Halling-Brown, is an accountant who has been a tax consultant for the past 15 years. On the strength of this and their previous successful projects in Lansdowne Place West, Cavendish Place and elsewhere in the city, they can now fairly claim to be professional developers.</p>

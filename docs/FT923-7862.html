			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computer bees to the honeypot Intel's launch this week of an accelerated version of its 486 microprocessor has prompted the release of a swarm of new high-performance personal computers and set the PC industry buzzing with price war frenzy. Some 30 computer manufacturers have announced PCs based on the 66MHz Intel486 DX2 microprocessor, which provides a 70 per cent system performance improvement with little increase in cost. This is because the fast microprocessor can work with standard lower-speed components and PC makers can place the new chip in their machines without redesigning circuit boards. Among those companies offering PCs based on the new chip are IBM, Compaq, Dell and Tandy. With little else to differentiate their products except price, competition is fierce.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 5 (AFP)--China denied Tuesday [5  April] it was sending a high-level delegation to North Korea to  mark the 82nd birthday of Kim Il-Sung on April 15.    "We have never heard something like China sending a  high-level delegation to North Korea to attend President Kim's  birthday celebrations," said a foreign ministry spokesman  contacted by telephone.    He was denying a report by South Korea's YONHAP news agency  which said that members of the delegation would have talks with  Kim about the nuclear standoff following Pyongyang's refusal to  allow full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections  of its nuclear sites.    On Monday North Korea officially rejected an appeal by the  United Nations Security Council to open its sites to IAEA  inspectors.    China is the North's closest ally and so far has refused to  put any pressure on Pyongyang over the nuclear affair or to  support moves to impose international sanctions.</p>

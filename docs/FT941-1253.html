			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Fed move hits European turnover Equity trading in the leading European markets declined in February after the strong growth of the previous two months. Turnover declined by 8.2 per cent last month after rising by 15.3 per cent in January and 12.2 per cent in December. February's fall accompanied a 4.4 per cent decline in the FT-A Europe index, following the decision by the Federal Reserve to raise US short-term interest rates on February 4. The move took the markets by surprise: they had not been expecting any tightening until mid-year. It also triggered panic selling by hedge funds in the bond markets and the instability quickly spilled over into equities. Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities notes, however, that in contrast to the declining activity in domestic markets the volume of European stocks traded on Seaq International, the London screen-based system, managed a 0.2 per cent rise on the month. This took London's share of trading in continental European equities to 16.1 per cent of the total activity in the domestic markets in February, up from 15.2 per cent in January and 14.8 per cent in December. 'This continuing faster volume growth in international trading, compared with domestic market activity, confirms continued involvement of international investors in the European markets, including sales by US institutional investors as the going became tougher,' says Mr Cornish. February's turnover downturn accompanied falls in the market indices for all eight countries. The Italian market, down only 0.6 per cent, suffered less than the others while its turnover, against the trend, rose by a massive 46.7 per cent to a record level. This represented an 82 per cent rise on the average for the previous three months and took Italian turnover, for the first time, above that seen in France over the month. Italy saw record inflows into mutual funds in February while strong US demand for Italian equities has also emerged this year, with the investors tending to overlook immediate political uncertainties ahead of the general election on Sunday and Monday. Instead they are concentrating on the longer term corporate and economic outlook. The privatisation programme held the key to Italian trading with February seeing the successful sell-off of the IMI financial services group and the run up to the sale of BCI. In addition, the telecommunications sector returned to favour as plans went ahead to bring together five separate companies under one umbrella, in preparation for privatisation later in the year. Germany was the month's biggest loser with turnover down 19.5 per cent, and 12.9 per cent on the average for the previous three months, as the motor sector, and particularly BMW put in a strong performance but financials were neglected. But with share prices down 3.7 per cent overall, the large fall in turnover was regarded as a return to more normal, but still good, levels after the records seen in December and January. Switzerland was another loser, with turnover down 14.6 per cent from January's record, as investors judged that the time was ripe to take profits in the banks after the sector's strong run-up to its reporting season.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse              Nov        Dec        Jan        Feb        US                    1993       1993       1994       1994    Dollars bn Belgium           78.39      91.60     107.56      95.76       2.73 France           191.05     218.65     251.96     244.62      42.16 Germany          177.99     211.05     219.29     176.59     103.45 Italy          35,092.8   41,385.6   53,924.0   79,109.6      46.90 Netherlands       27.20      25.40      35.00      32.00      16.69 Spain           1,384.6    1,267.5   1,521.82   1,400.80      10.07 Switzerland       29.60      31.30      39.70      33.90      23.76 UK                52.61      55.79      65.31      59.80      88.92  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Idalberto Acuna, president of the People's </F> Assemblies in Centro Havana Municipality, by Gisela Bel Heredia  for the "Exclusive" program --live or recorded]    [Text] [Bel Heredia] I am here with Comrade Idalberto  Acuna, president of the People's Assemblies in Centro Habana  Municipality. Idalberto, we would like you to explain the  progress report process and its results in the municipality you  represent.    [Acuna] Well, the progress report meetings began in mid-May  in our municipality. We had scheduled 308 meetings, but I  believe the most significant thing is not the number of meetings  or the fact that a program was carried out, which I can readily  say has been carried out according to schedule. I believe the  most interesting thing in this progress report process is the  people's participation. They have always participated but, based  on the guidance received from the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP] in connection with deputies, ANPP  province delegates, administrative officials, chiefs of  distribution centers, officials in the service, gastronomy, and  trade sectors, everyone who is part of the great ANPP system  actively participated.    [Bel Heredia] Idalberto, referring to the main proposals and  the main topics analyzed at the meetings that were held in the  different districts and groups, what areas did they mainly deal  with?    [Acuna] The same ones that are definitely more important  nowadays -- electricity, gas, aqueducts. There is something I  want to clarify, however. They have dealt with issues that were  already discussed in other assemblies; for example, products  missing from warehouses. This was not a significant issue, and  we think we have yet to receive a report on this. That is  definitely an achievement and we have made sure that people get  their supplies, to prevent the type of problems that previously  occurred.    We have received some proposals concerning the gastronomy  sector, mainly dealing with the distribution of hamburgers,  pizzas, and other products. We have reviewed innumerable  formulas to see which ones are definitely more acceptable.    [Bel Heredia] Idalberto, if you had to make an assessment of  the process that is about to conclude, what would you say about  Centro Habana?    [Acuna] We think it has been a superior progress report  process. It has been superior because we have even ascertained  the support given to the measures recently implemented in the  country. In fact, it not only deals with the measures that have  already been implemented; it also involves all the work carried  out in each district, which is confirmed by the documents sent  to the ANPP. They prove that the support has been absolute.</p>

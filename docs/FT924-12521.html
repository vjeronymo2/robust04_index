			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (4): Costs can vary greatly - Property and labour markets THE costs and availability of property and labour rank among the top concerns of companies considering relocations. Property costs can vary greatly depending on whether a company is looking to locate a manufacturing plant, find a headquarters or regional office or set up a distribution warehouse. Yet, no matter the type of facility, shifts in the US property market have occurred that have affected and will affect property prices. Two factors have wreaked havoc with the US property market over the past few years: the overhang in supply of commercial properties from excessive building during the 1980s and a decline in demand stemming from the US recession and continued economic sluggishness. Although the building boom of the 1980s is over, some cities overbuilt more office space than others and some, such as Chicago which arrived late to the party, have recently faced substantial and badly timed additions to their office property inventories. In 1991, after the economy had run out of steam, Chicago added 3.4m square feet of commercial property and saw its central business district vacancy rate rise to 22.3 per cent from 17.6 per cent between the second quarter of this year and the same period last year, according to figures from Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a top US commercial property firm. Vacancy rates can push rental costs up or down. In the central business district of Los Angeles, the vacancy rate rose to 29.2 per cent in the second quarter from 22.6 a year before and rental costs declined from a range of Dollars 20-42 per square foot to Dollars 17-40. In addition to lower prices, more vacant space can also mean tenants can win fatter concessions from landlords for outfitting the space or grace periods at the start of the lease. Even with little additional building, the cost of property has been driven down in some areas by lack of demand. Areas such as New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, including such states as New York and Pennsylvania, have been hard hit by the US economy's downturn and the consolidation of the securities and banking industries. On the opposite coast, the computer and defence industries that were once the engines powering California's growth have been shrinking painfully over the past two years and, at least for defence, will continue to do so. But as testimony to the gravity of the US recession, the national vacancy rate has continued to climb for central business districts even though the amount of newly added space in those areas has declined every year since 1986. However, this trend has been accompanied by a shift away from central business districts. More and more companies are choosing to set up in the suburban areas immediately surrounding large or mid-sized cities or to forsake cities for more rural locations, particularly for greenfield plants. BMW, for example, selected Spartanburg, South Carolina for its new assembly plant. In greenfield sites, it is virtually worthless to cite property costs, since these frequently are a bargaining chip in negotiations with a relocating company. Often the site itself can cost nothing or very little. The flight from the inner cities has partly been spurred by costs, but it also has much to do with quality of life issues - such as schools, housing, parks and recreation. The northern suburbs of Atlanta, for example, have been ranked as the number one preferred location by a series of surveys, including that of Ernst &amp; Young with the International Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives which was published earlier this year. The area's amenities, and most particularly the relatively reasonable cost of housing, has convinced a number of large companies to relocate there recently, including UPS. The cost of living for employees is important for companies partly because of what kinds of salaries and wages will be required at the new site. Runzheimer International, a Wisconsin-based consulting firm on living and travel costs, calculates that Dollars 60,000 is the standard compensation for a middle management employee or a highly skilled technician. Based on a family of four, with a mortgaged home and two cars, companies would have to vary their compensation levels according to location. They would have to pay employees more to settle in Los Angeles, with total annual costs of Dollars 77,454, than in Memphis, where costs run to just Dollars 55,492 a year. For companies seeking reasonably priced manufacturing labour, the US's south-east continues to offer the best value with an average of just Dollars 9.77 per hour, according to figures compiled by PHH Fantus, the leading US relocation consulting firm. Yet in spite of the lower averages of wages in the region, two of the south-east's states, South Carolina and Georgia, have innovative public programmes to train employees for incoming investors. Mr Robert Ady, president of PHH Fantus, said that foreign firms often overestimate the skill level of American workers. He advises them to realistically appraise local worker capabilities. South Carolina's programme to train BMW workers was, he said, crucial to its choice of that state. With the North American Free Trade Agreement on the horizon, however, those whose top priority is to set up in a low wage location are likely to go to Mexico.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          COST-OF-LIVING VALUES IN SELECTED LOCATIONS: 1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Location                    Total annual           Index                            costs (Dollars)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Los Angeles, CA               77,454               129.1 Washington, DC                71,967               119.9 Boston, MA                    69,901               116.5 Chicago, IL                   66,353               110.6 Atlanta, GA                   63,925               106.5 Minneapolis, MN               63,227               105.4 St Louis, MO                  60,081               100.1 STANDARD CITY, US             60,000               100.0 Houston, TX                   58,344                97.2 Phoenix, AZ                   55,718                92.9 Memphis, TN                   55,492                92.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on a family of four with a Dollars 60,000 annual income, living in a 2,400 sq ft home which carries a mortgage and incurring all normal home ownership and maintenance costs. The family owns two cars: a late model driven 14,000 miles a year and a four-year-old model driven 6,000 miles yearly. Car expenses include both fixed and operating costs. Federal, state and local income taxes are paid. They also pay sales taxes and purchase goods and services typical for a family in their income bracket at their location. The family has also set aside an amount for investments and savings. Costing is based on representative communities surrounding the core city in which families earning Dollars 60,000 a year are most likely to reside.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:   Runzheimer International  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

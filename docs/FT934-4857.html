			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Franco-German telecom alliance to be extended France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, the French and German state telecommunications operators, appear set to announce ambitious plans for further co-operation next week. They will reveal their intentions next Tuesday in Brussels, the same day that European Union telecommunications ministers meet in the Belgium capital. Both companies have an existing alliance, called Eunetcom, to provide 'one stop' services for multinational companies. Industry observers believe they are planning to extend their co-operation, most likely by merging core activities in spheres other than domestic 'voice', including international services and data communications. A future exchange of equity stakes also appears to be a possibility. Although the Franco-German telecom plans are not on the ministers' agenda next week, any significant merging of activities by the two operators will require the approval of the European Commission for its competition implications. In Bonn, Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry and telecommunications minister and Mr Wolfgang Botsch, his German counterpart, yesterday gave their support for increased co-operation in a joint statement issued during the Franco-German summit. The two ministers said the alliance 'could lead to an exchange of capital as soon as the two companies changed their legal status'. Deutsche Telekom is slated for privatisation next year. The French government, however, has delayed plans to change the legal status of France Telecom in the face of strong trade union opposition. Both ministers also defended the co-operation plans, saying that 'they respected the rules of competition'. However, other European telecommunications operators, notably British Telecom, are concerned that the alliance will isolate them and impede fair competition as the EU's telecommunications markets are liberalised over the next five years. AT&amp;T, the US telecoms giant, has been engaged in talks with the French and German companies about a possible relationship with its 'Worldsource' international venture launched this summer. But the current plans are not believed to include the US carrier in the immediate future.</p>

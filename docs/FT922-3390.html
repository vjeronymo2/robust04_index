			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Technology: Cluck, cluck, cluck IT MAY not look like a chicken, or even taste like a chicken, but in one crucial respect - its thermal characteristics - it acts like a chicken. Nestling discreetly among the chilled foods in Marks &amp; Spencer's in-store refrigerators is a new breed of poultry that will never reach the nation's dinner plates but is a classic example of how food hygiene - and productivity demands - are driving equipment development. The so-called Plastic Chicken, developed by M&amp;S in partnership with Elm, a Scottish-based electronics company, was designed partly with the new UK food safety regulations in mind, which will require chilled food to be kept at 5 deg C. But M&amp;S increasingly wants to hold chilled food at as low a temperature as possible without freezing it, to incorporate an ever-wider range of fresh food into its dishes. In the past, says Nick Holloway, M&amp;S senior food technologist, monitoring fridge temperatures involved time-consuming reading of thermometers placed in various positions on the refrigerator shelves. These, however, measure the temperature of the air rather than that of the product. M&amp;S wanted to go direct to the product temperature for greater accuracy. The solution was the Plastic Chicken, which incorporates a partially insulated and damped temperature probe replicating the temperature characteristics of a chicken or, with adjustments, a range of other chilled foods. The battery-operated chicken takes a temperature reading every minute, then puts an average temperature into its memory every 15 minutes up to a maximum of 10 days, or a maximum of six months if less frequent readings are taken. If the temperature exceeds preset limits, the Chicken alarm lights discreetly - no clucking. Data from the first generation Plastic Chickens, which will be in all 280 M&amp;S stores by the end of July, are transferred by infra-red beam to a hand-held reader unit held up to three feet away. But M&amp;S has now hit on the idea of putting mini-transmitters in each chicken linked to a receiving station in the store's food office, further increasing the cost savings on collecting temperature data and improving vigilance. The radio system can be retrofitted to the original Plastic Chickens, says Holloway, and will probably be introduced next year. It gives 'battery hens' a whole new meaning.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Surge in mortgage lending lifts housing recovery hopes A steep increase in the number and amount of mortgage loans approved in March gave the most significant boost yet to signs of a recovery in the UK housing market. That growth should feed through into an increase in mortgage lending actually undertaken, when the figures for lending by banks and building societies in April are released later this month. According to statistics published by the Bank of England yesterday, the number of loans approved in March was 99,000, with a total value of Pounds 5.2bn. For the first quarter of this year, 260,000 loans worth Pounds 13.81bn were approved - a return to levels not seen since late 1991. Total net mortgage lending in March amounted to Pounds 1.84bn, compared with Pounds 1.51bn in February. Net lending in the first quarter of 1994 came to Pounds 5bn - the highest since the first quarter of 1992. Mr Adrian Coles, director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), said the figures for net advances - 22 per cent higher in March than in February - made it clear the housing market was genuinely recovering. 'Only a reversal of the downward trend in interest rates or a major change in the provision of income support for mortgage interest would be likely to undermine this recovery,' he said. The CML is concerned that the government is looking at further restricting mortgage support, which currently costs Pounds 1.2bn. Mr Philip Jenks, controller of mortgage lending at Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, said that the increase in activity had been spread pretty evenly across the UK, but had been particularly encouraging in the south-east of England. He added that while a similarly sharp increase in mortgage loans approved was unlikely in April, he expected the levels recorded in March to be broadly sustained. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said the figures showed that the housing recovery had definitely arrived, but that they could have been distorted somewhat by buyers' desire to take advantage of the low fixed-rate mortgages.

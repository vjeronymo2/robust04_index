			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Yemeni rulers approach poll without doubt: Illiteracy confounds secrecy in ballot requiring written vote IT WILL TAKE three days for the results of today's first general election in unified Yemen to be published. Few, however, doubt the likely outcome - a strong enough showing for the two parties that engineered unification in 1990, North Yemen's General People's Congress and the south's Yemen Socialist Party, to continue in coalition government. Both parties have made it clear that Yemen 'requires' a coalition to nurture its democratic experiment, which, on paper, is the most ambitious ever undertaken in the Gulf. Generously, they have also said that other successful parties in the election will be welcome to join them in ruling the Gulf's poorest and most populous, fractious and ruggedly wild territory. This formula is likely to draw in several members of Islah, an alliance of Islamists and the country's biggest tribal group, the Hashid, which is Yemen's fourth biggest party and, possibly, a few members of the Ba'ath party. President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the GPC leader, told a weekend press conference: 'There is the idea that there should be a coalition - giving the chance to other parties to come forward and participate in government with us.' Even the most enthusiastic among international observers witnessing the election agree with opposition parties that there has been, as one US observer put it, 'some major fancy footwork going on' to ensure GPC and YSP dominance in the poll. But both the government and opposition groups hope, for slightly different reasons, that today's ballot will mark an historic turning point. For the governing parties, the poll will lend their rule representative legitimacy. But it also offers the hope that Yemen can rehabilitate an image in the west which was tattered by its refusal to join the anti-Iraq coalition during the Gulf war. That directly cost Yemen an estimated Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.27bn) in aid from the Gulf, US, Britain and others - money Yemen, with 13m people, and a failing economy, cannot afford to lose. 'We are hoping the elections will very much improve our relations with these countries,' says Mr Ali Salem al-Deid, the vice-president. 'It is time for these countries to support us.' Projecting a progressive image of democratisation and stability is also vital to sustaining the confidence of the 20 international oil companies already in Yemen, and to attracting more. Hopes of economic revival rest entirely on the prospect of raising oil production from the present 180,000 barrels a day to 1m b/d, based on the government's optimistic reading of Yemen's potential reserves. For the smaller opposition parties in the election today's vote offers the prospect of Yemen moving towards a centralised, constitutionally guaranteed civic society. Previously, power was brokered, often violently, between the still non-unified army, the ruling parties and tribal groupings. 'The army and the tribes are still stronger than civil society here,' says Mr Mohammed Abdul al-Mutawqil, an independent candidate. 'They have the authority, the money and the guns.' For many, the cosy-looking struggle between the main parties is less important than a broader contest within the country between the forces in favour of consolidating their present powers and the forces of democratic and constitutional change. Mr al-Mutawqil says this battle is being waged inside the biggest parties, by the younger technocrats within Yemen's elite, as well as against these parties. He believes that if 20 per cent of the 301 deputies returned after the election represent the progressive tendency, that will constitute a substantial success and platform for future elections. Neither he nor other opposition figures believe they can realistically hope for much more out of what is, after all, a considerable experiment. Mr Abdul Rahman al-Jifri, leader of the opposition Son of Yemen League, points out that both the GPC and YSP were former ruling parties. 'They have never implemented democracy in their lives - how can we expect they'll do so now?' he says. Allegations of vote-buying, the pre-filling of soldiers' ballots, drawing constituencies in the ruling parties' favour and other charges have dogged the campaign and raised eyebrows among the 20-strong team of international observers. Some 37,000 troops are being deployed to help guarantee peace. But there are some signs of procedural difficulties. The election observers, though loath to commit themselves before the poll takes place, have raised doubts about some aspects of the ballot. Concern centres on the fact that, with up to 80 per cent illiteracy in Yemen, a large proportion of the 2.7m registered voters will have to enlist help in the polling station to cast their vote  for which they are required to write in the candidate's name on the ballot sheet. Mr Ed Stuart, observer with the International Republican Institute, said it was 'highly unusual to see a ballot constructed' as it has been in Yemen. 'I think it will present some problems.' A colleague went further: 'The concept of a secret ballot has gone out of the window,' he said.</p>

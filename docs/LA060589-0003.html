			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: TO SERVE AND PROTECT THE SEAPORT SHOPPERS  </P> <P> Sometimes the changes in San Diego go unnoticed for years. Then one day people  notice something is different and begin asking what happened.  </P> <P> Take the rally in downtown San Diego last week. The topic was drugs and money,  but a lot of attention was paid to five sharply dressed, heavily armed  individuals marching in the parade.  </P> <P> The five wore crisp, dark blue pants and shirts, with bright yellow chevrons on  their sleeves, shiny badges and Smokey Bear hats. They were armed with  handguns, batons and tear gas.  </P> <P> They were older than the San Diego cops. But a heckler trying to shout down the  head of the Urban League made sure to position himself far away from the  ferocious-looking five.  </P> <P> "Who are those guys?" was a common refrain.  </P> <P> Answer: private security guards from Seaport Village.  </P> <P> The shopping complex has had its own 24-hour security force since 1982, now  numbering 10 full-time members, headed by a former suburban police chief from  Massachusetts.  </P> <P> All of this is seen as economically necessary for a trendy shopping complex  that, until recently, was cheek-by-jowl with San Diego Police Department  headquarters. (A new headquarters opened two years ago.)  </P> <P> "We feel it's a deterrent," said Seaport Village manager Phyllis Cicchetto. "We  want people to feel safe here."  </P> <P> It's simple: If upscale shoppers feel threatened, they quickly take their  business elsewhere.  </P> <P> When crime (real or imagined) menaces the affluent, merchants take notice,  public officials catch hell and things happen. It's different for people  farther down the economic scale.  </P> <P> They're allowed to hold marches and send petitions to politicians.And Another  Thing . . .  </P> <P> Notes from everywhere:  </P> <P> * A support organization has formed at San Diego State University for a  much-maligned group to discuss common problems: the Heterosexual Student Union.  </P> <P> * With its garish yellow paint job, the Paddock restaurant in Encinitas was a  civic eyesore for years, squat on the city's busiest street, Encinitas  Boulevard, just east of Interstate 5.  </P> <P> The Hungry Hunter chain has now bought the restaurant and taken two steps to  curry community favor.  </P> <P> The building has been repainted a pleasing tan. And half the revenue from  Tuesday's gala opening is pledged to Jenny Pratt, a local teen-ager who was  crippled in an unsolved 1987 attack.  </P> <P> * After some financial reshuffling, the BodyWorks fitness parlor on 7th Avenue  in downtown San Diego has a new advertising tactic.  </P> <P> Signs (including one offering a free cholesterol test) have been placed flat on  the roof of the two-story building, looking skyward. They're visible to flabby  office workers in surrounding high-rises.Barber Buddies  </P> <P> One of the nagging questions from the alleged money-laundering caper of Richard  T. Silberman has been: How did Silberman, a respected businessman and political  insider, ever become pals with Chris Petti, a reputed mobster?  </P> <P> Their natural habitats seem quite dissimilar. Silberman is La Jolla, Petti is  Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Silberman has been telling friends that Petti  </P> <P> is just some guy he met at the barber shop at the Town &amp; Country Hotel in  Mission Valley. They used to talk while waiting to get trimmed, he says.  </P> <P> Michael Stafford, who has owned the shop for 15 years, confirms that both were  steady customers but says he never saw them in the shop at the same time. "It  could have happened, but I doubt it," he said.  </P> <P> What does Stafford think of the criminal case in which the FBI allegedly stung  the pair into thinking they were dealing in Colombian drug money?  </P> <P> "It cost me a very good customer," Stafford said.  </P> <P> Petti is getting his hair cut free these days at the Metropolitan Correctional  Center.  </P></p>

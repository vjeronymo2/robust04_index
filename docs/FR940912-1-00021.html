			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A third regulation that may affect the chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry is the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (RCRA) air emission standards for hazardous waste treatment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage, and disposal facilities. That rule will establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for controlling emissions from wastes that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified as hazardous under RCRA at facilities subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle C permitting requirements. Under that rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous wastes would have to be managed in controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units until the waste is treated to remove or destroy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain hazardous components. The rule only applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units and facilities that are permitted under RCRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle C. However, under RCRA, wastewater treatment units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not subject to subtitle C hazardous waste management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards provided the unit is part of a wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment facility that is subject to regulation under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either section 402 or 307(b) of the Clean Water Act. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste tank systems that are used to store or treat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater that is managed at an on-site wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment facility with a National Pollution Discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elimination System permit or that discharges to a publicly-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owned treatment works would generally be exempt from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCRA regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the HON, the benzene waste NESHAP, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the RCRA air standards, section 182(b)(2) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that State implementation plans (SIP's) for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone nonattainment areas be revised to require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of reasonably available control technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (RACT) for control of VOC emissions. The EPA has defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RACT generally as the lowest emission limitation that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular source is capable of meeting by the application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of control technology that is reasonably available,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering technological and economic feasibility. In some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, the EPA has, or will, issue guidance relative to RACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the form of a control techniques guidelines (CTG)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document. A draft of the Industrial Wastewater (IWW) CTG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was released for public comment on December 29, 1993. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI is a subset of the industry group which is covered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the IWW CTG. The CTG is intended to provide State and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air pollution authorities with an information base for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding with their own analysis of RACT to meet statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Due to time and budget constraints, the IWW  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CTG has not been finalized. An alternative control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology (ACT) document has been prepared and provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the States as interim guidance to aid in development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules in the absence of the final IWW CTG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In spite of the guidance and the three separate rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to regulate emissions from wastewater streams at SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, there are substantial gaps in the extent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which these rules control emissions from SOCMI wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams with the potential to emit VOC. The HON applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only a segment of the industry that produces a specified set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of products, which does not include all SOCMI installations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the HON only regulates streams that contain HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at concentrations above a trigger level. Consequently, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HON does not regulate wastewater streams that emit VOC that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not HAP. The benzene waste NESHAP applies to all SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installations but is very limited in scope regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste streams regulated, i.e., only those streams that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain benzene are subject to the rule. Many of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams at SOCMI plants do not contain benzene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but do contain other VOC that are emitted to the atmosphere  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if left uncontrolled. The RCRA air standards for hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste toxic storage and disposal facilities are not expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to impact a significant number of wastewater streams at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI plants because of the wastewater exemption under RCRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA analysis of SOCMI wastewater data submitted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry shows a significant number of wastewater streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated by SOCMI process units will not be regulated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HON or other wastewater related rules. This is in large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part a result of the fact that the source category coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the SOCMI Wastewater NSPS is considerably broader than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that of the HON. For example, the chemical list defining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the affected SOCMI process units is nearly twice as large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the NSPS as for the HON. For many of the SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industries, VOC-containing wastewater streams do not contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP and therefore controlling only HAP-containing streams,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as is required under the HON, would not substantially reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC emissions. It is estimated that 68 percent of all new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI chemical production process units will have wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams that would require control under the proposed NSPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but will not require control under the HON.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NSPS for SOCMI wastewater sources is needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fill the gaps in the coverage of VOC emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams left uncovered by other regulations. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the benzene waste NESHAP and the RCRA air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are risk-based standards. Risk-based standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are designed to reduce emissions to a level that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect human health and the environment with an ample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margin of safety. The goal of an NSPS, on the other hand,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to improve ambient air quality over time by application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of best demonstrated technology (BDT) on all new, modified,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or reconstructed sources. The goal of the CTG is to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance to States in revising their SIP's and to help bring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their nonattainment areas into compliance with the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ambient Air Quality Standards. The SIP rules do not apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at facilities that are in ozone attainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, NSPS require installation of BDT rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RACT, which in some cases may achieve a higher level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction. The NSPS would impose consistent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide regulatory requirements, which would ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste streams and wastewater streams at all new, modified,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reconstructed SOCMI process units are controlled in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent manner using the best emission controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, although a portion of waste streams and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams at SOCMI sites are already controlled as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result of existing and planned regulations, none of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations cover all SOCMI waste streams with the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to emit VOC. These other regulations are limited in scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and leave some wastewater streams uncontrolled for air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. These uncontrolled wastewater streams are the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject of the NSPS for SOCMI wastewater sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is possible that there may be some overlap among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those regulations affecting wastes and wastewater at SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, leading to possibly duplicative requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to avoid the burden of such duplication, the EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing in the SOCMI NSPS that the owner or operator of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste management units, treatment processes, or control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices affected by the proposed rule may comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control requirements of the proposed rule by demonstrating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the benzene waste operations NESHAP, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HON, or the RCRA air emission standards for hazardous waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. The owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator would also be required to maintain records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documenting which regulation is being used to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the proposed NSPS. An owner or operator who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chooses to demonstrate compliance in this manner would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempted from the inspection, monitoring, reporting, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping requirements of the proposed rule that relate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the affected waste management unit, treatment process, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device. The Agency is soliciting comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed approach to reducing the regulatory burden for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these sources. In addition, the Agency is interested in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving information on the level of burden that would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed by the possible duplication of requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

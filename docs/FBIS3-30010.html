			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Leaders of two out of seven  ruling parties told Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Thursday  [24 February] that an immediate cabinet reshuffle is not  necessary, renewing their opposition to a shakeup expected to  center on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  from his post, coalition sources said. In a meeting with  Hosokawa, Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo  Ouchi urged the premier to revoke his reshuffle plan, the  officials said.    Hosokawa told the two that he may consider a reshuffle after  the Diet passes both the third supplementary budget for fiscal  1993 and an amendment to a political reform package, they said.  The Diet passed the extra budget Wednesday, while the amendment  is expected to be approved in early March.    From the coalition's seven parties, the SDP, DSP and  Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger) have objected to the reshaping  plan while Shinseito (Japan renewal party) and Komeito [Clean  Government Party] support it.    Takemura differs with Hosokawa on the blueprint for Japan's  future politics. Hosokawa has reportedly considered seeking a  two-party system called for by Shinseito and Komeito, but  Takemura has voiced objections.    Takemura also attended the meeting and suggested he has not  changed his position opposing his removal, the sources said. He  has reportedly rejected Hosokawa's request to go to another  ministerial post.    Murayama told Hosokawa that an immediate reshuffle will give  "an impression of a power struggle" within the coalition. Ouchi  asked the premier not to cause a crack in the coalition by a  shakeup, they said.    Hosokawa was quoted as saying he does not have a concrete  idea on a reshuffle and will decide on the matter after hearing  opinions of ruling party leaders.    On Tuesday, Hosokawa told reporters he asked his top aides  to  look into the possibility of uniting seven ruling parties  against the Liberal Democratic Party in the next general  election for the House of Representatives.    The prime minister told leaders of the SDP, DSP and Sakigake  that the idea of alliance has nothing to do with the merger of  ruling parties nor with a two-party system.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL TO VOTE ON BLOCK GRANT PLAN  </P> <P> Looking to upgrade housing in low- to moderate-income areas throughout Brea,  the City Council will decide tonight whether to apply for its 16th year of  membership in the countywide Community Development Block Grant Program.  </P> <P> The program, established in 1974 by Congress to provide grants to cities for  community development projects, aids many Orange County cities in improving  residences and updating buildings that no longer meet building code  requirements.  </P> <P> The city staff is recommending that the council approve the city's application  for funds to rehabilitate 35 residences.  </P> <P> As a participant in the program for 15 years, Brea has processed almost 170  housing rehabilitation loans and completed several public works projects with  the funding. The city has allotted three-fourths of the grant money for housing  in central Brea, and most of the rehabilitation funds have been used to correct  serious health, safety and code enforcement problems, city staff members have  said.  </P></p>

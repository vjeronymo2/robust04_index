			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Observer: How do, pardner? A puff of white smoke from the boardroom of Goldman Sachs and one of Wall Street's most discreet competitions has been decided. Every two years the world's most profitable private investment bank anoints another clutch of multi-millionaire partners and the latest batch has just been announced. How the 123-year-old partnership chooses its partners is one of Wall Street's best-kept secrets. Gavyn Davies, the ubiquitous London economist whose wife has gone to work for shadow chancellor Gordon Brown, is a partner, as is his side-kick and fellow-economist, David Morrison. But Bob Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and an even bigger figure on the international policy circuit, is not. The current crop of 35 new partners includes a son and a nephew of John Weinberg, the firm's senior chairman, and two women. But beyond that, the firm is rather shy about disclosing the age, colour and nationality of its new partners - who can probably expect to make between Dollars 2m and Dollars 4m a year after they have bought their way in. And if they reach the top they can make megabucks. It has been reported, for example, that Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman, the bank's two co-chairmen, earned more than Dollars 15m apiece last year. Once upon a time there was a 50:50 chance that a hard-working young banker would become a Goldman partner. Now the firm has 7,000 staff and just 167 general partners. By contrast S G Warburg, which earns less than a third of Goldman's estimated Dollars 1bn plus a year, has over 300 directors and a mere 5,000 staff.</p>

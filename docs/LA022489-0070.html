			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  JUDGE REJECTS DELAY IN ECCLESIA TRIAL  </P> <P> An Oregon judge has rejected a petition filed by four Ecclesia Athletic Assn.  members to halt their trial for the beating death of the group founder's  daughter.  </P> <P> Clackamas County Circuit Judge John Lowe ruled that the defendants have no  legal standing to have the trial transferred to federal court after they  claimed the state of Oregon prohibited them from free exercise of their  religion.  </P> <P> The defendants also asked that the trial be halted so their organization could  hear the case against them. In addition, they sought a forum including Jim  Bakker and his wife, Tammy, Pat Robertson, Jimmy Swaggart and other television  evangelists.  </P> <P> Defendants Willie Chambers, 35; Brian Brinson, 30; Frederick Doolittle, 28, and  Constance Jackson, 37, are charged with manslaughter in the October beating  death of Dayna Broussard, 8, the daughter of Ecclesia founder Eldridge  Broussard Jr.  </P> <P> Broussard founded the group in Watts, saying it would provide athletic training  and discipline for inner-city children.  </P></p>

Environmentally dangerous waste  from the rich Western Europe is being dumped in Russia. The  waste is exported as recyclable but in actual fact it is  unusable poison, says Russian Greenpeace.    Russian Greenpeace spokesman Dima Litvinov: "Now  they are looking to Russia and other parts of the former Soviet  Union as a good place where they can get rid of their waste."    Correspondent: This is Dima Litvinov, one of the  Russian Greenpeace activists who have warned against this  development, that Western Europe is beginning to dump its  dangerous waste in Eastern Europe.    Russian Greenpeace has just discovered 16 train carriages  standing unprotected in a railway siding in the Orenburg area in  the region bordering on Kazakhstan. The railway carriages hold  1,200 tonnes of waste from Germany and France. The waste  contains poisons, including cadmium and arsenic. The waste has  been sold as raw material for the region's nickel industry but  it is totally useless. Because of the dangerous cargo, the  Russian railways refuse to have anything to do with the  carriages any longer and the authorities have not found anyone  willing to receive the dangerous cargo. Right now most of the  cargo is frozen, but soon spring will arrive, melting it, and a  catastrophe will not then be far away, says Dima Litvinov.    Litvinov: "There is a huge risk that if nothing is  done with this material, there will be a real disaster in the  area."    Correspondent: What might actually happen?    Litvinov: "If the material gets into the drinking  water tables it is certain that the people in the city will  become ill, they may have to be evacuated. I don't know whether  it can be calculated now how many might die from it."    Correspondent: Although the so-called Basle  Convention bans export of waste that is dangerous to the  environment, the convention makes an exception for waste that  may be defined as recyclable. As early as next week, this  export is to be discussed in Geneva, and several West European  countries, led by Denmark, have demanded a tightening of the  convention so that there will be no repetition of the case  involving the railway carriages in Orenburg.</p>

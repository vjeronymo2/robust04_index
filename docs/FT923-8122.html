			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Buoyant Novo Nordisk rises on strong sales NOVO NORDISK, the insulin and industrial enzymes giant, reported a 21 per cent rise in first-half sales from DKr4.45bn (Dollars 794m) last year to DKr5.38bn and a 42 per cent rise in net profits from DKr458m to DKr649m. The results were better than expected and reflect a growth in sales volume, as exchange rates remained unchanged and prices stable, said the group. Pre-tax income increased by 36 per cent from DKr693m to DKr941m, including a turn round in net financial items from a DKr24m loss last year to a DKr54m profit this year. The group cautioned that stock building by important customers may mean slower growth in the second half. The interim statement maintained an earlier forecast that pre-tax profits for the year will increase by 'at least 15 per cent'. Group investments this year will increase to DKr2bn from DKr1.3bn last year. Shareholders' equity increased during the half year by DKr631m to DKr10.11bn, some 63 per cent of total assets. Earnings per share were up by 21 per cent from DKr14.39 to DKr17.42.</p>

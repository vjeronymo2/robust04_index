			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Goodyear surges to Dollars 103.3m GOODYEAR, the last surviving large US-owned tyre company, yesterday reported third-quarter net profits of Dollars 103.3m, up sharply from Dollars 59.1m a year ago. The Akron-based company said in September it expected to achieve third-quarter earnings per share higher than the Dollars 1.01 per share recorded in the same period last year; the 1992 quarterly earnings per share were Dollars 1.44. Goodyear said its improved third-quarter results had been helped by the introduction of new products and a strengthened distribution network. Interest expenses were also lower, although advertising costs were higher. Revenues in the third quarter were Dollars 3bn, in line with earlier forecasts by the company and compared with Dollars 2.8bn a year ago. In the first nine months of 1992 Goodyear had net profits of Dollars 279.3m, compared with a loss of Dollars 8.5m in the same period of 1991. Revenues for the nine months were Dollars 8.9bn, up from Dollars 8.1bn Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said Goodyear's replacement tyre sales remained strong in the US, and he claimed that the company was gaining market share. On Wall Street, Goodyear's share price improved by Dollars 1 1/8 after the results were published, to Dollars 66 7/8 .</p>

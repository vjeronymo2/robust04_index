			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran--The use of satellite dishes is on the agenda  at cabinet proceedings and a decision will be made within a  month, said Interior Minister 'Ali Mohammad Besharati.    In an exclusive interview with the TEHRAN TIMES, the  minister  said, "The use of satellite dishes is not illegal, but will need  to be authorized."    Besharati was commenting on earlier reports by the local  press which quoted him as saying that satellite dishes are  'illegal and will all be confiscated within two months.'    There were fears after the interior minister's announcement  that some could take undue advantage of the situation and  blackmail those who are now using dishes.    "The issue is under discussion by the cabinet and a  comprehensive decision is to be made within a month," said  Besharati.    President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's cabinet meets every  Wednesday.    Satellite dishes began mushrooming on rooftops in the last  two years and the Persian daily SALAM recently reported that 400  dishes were being installed in Tehran daily.    "The cabinet will approve rules and regulations on the use  of  dishes and the Interior Ministry will be responsible for their  enforcement," Besharati said.    "Of course the Interior Ministry will give enough time for  dish users to surrender them to the ministry voluntarily," he  said.    Besharati said a commission comprising representatives from  the Islamic Propagation Organization and the Ministry of Culture  and Islamic Guidance will set rules and regulations for issuing  permission for satellite dish use.    He said foreign missions in Iran should apply for permission  and it will be granted to them.    "Before the cabinet's approval and an announcement by the  Interior Ministry, no one is authorized to confiscate the dishes  and if approached by someone who wants to, people should inform  the nearest police station," Besharati emphasized.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["A Single Voice" column by dissident Wei Jingsheng: "Will </F> the Wolf Ever See the Lamb's View?"]    [Text] Ordinary Americans don't really understand China,  just as most Chinese don't really understand America. Because  of this, the people of the two countries often misunderstand the  actions taken by the government of the other side. Sino-US  relations have recently been subject to just these kinds of  misunderstandings.    The Chinese government does not believe America really cares  about the fate of the Chinese people. As Beijing sees it, the  US is using the human rights issue as an economic bargaining  chip and a political tactic for attacking the Chinese Communist  Party.    As a result, the Chinese government tries to deal with human  rights as a problem in foreign relations. Its main rationale  for resisting the mounting international pressure is that  "interference in China's domestic politics is unacceptable".  There is a tendency to treat political dissidents as human  pawns in China-US trade negotiations. Beijing participates in  this sordid trade because it does not understand US thinking.    Beijing does not believe the US will actually refuse to deal  with the Chinese government because of human rights. Beijing  does not believe the Americans are really willing to forego a  chance to make some quick money, or that the Americans are  applying these same moral judgments impartially to the policies  of other countries.    Though perfectly well aware their own behaviour is wrong,  Beijing's leaders are determined to hold out until the last  minute in the belief that this will allow them to recover  "face". In time, they believe, the "Yankees" will reveal the  reality behind their feigned concern for human rights. This  will result in greater freedom for the Chinese communist  government--all the better to strip more freedoms from ordinary  people.    It appears the US government also misunderstands the real  thinking of the Chinese government. US leaders have the  impression that the Chinese leadership are like the dimwitted,  obtuse rulers of a backward people who do not understand that  violating human rights is actually wrong. As a result, the  Americans are considering abandoning the strategy of steadily  increasing pressure on China and relying instead on "persuasion  and education" in order to improve China's human rights. This  is like Aesop's fable about the lamb that tried to reason with a  wolf.    I fear any attempt to use reason and logic in this situation  will prove abortive. It's not that the wolf doesn't understand  reason, but rather that he isn't interested in discussing reason.    I'm not sure whether the American people understand the way  the Sino-US relationship is changing, but the Chinese people's  understanding of their own government is very clear. Before the  communists took power, they were the group which clamoured most  enthusiastically for human rights and democracy. It is  impossible that they do not understand these concepts. But  their autocratic rule has given them excessive power and they  have no interest in honouring the promises they made to the  masses.    The Chinese people's understanding of the US government's  position, on the other hand, is not necessarily correct. The  real effect of America's new China policies has been to convince  the Chinese people that the image of the US the communist  leadership has peddled to them for all these years is correct.  The line is that the US government is a rich man's government  controlled by capitalists and that--like the Japanese--the  Americans do not care about violating their consciences to make  a quick buck.    I do not believe this is the case, or rather I do not want  to  believe it. But when people disdainfully equate the democratic  system of the United States with Japan's plutocratic system,  what evidence can I offer against it?</p>

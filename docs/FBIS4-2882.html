			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman </F> Comments on Wei Jingsheng Case and Human Rights Issue"]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--Shen Guofang made a  relatively long statement at today's Foreign Affairs Ministry  news briefing in response to questions on the human rights issue  raised by a number of reporters.    He said that the human rights issue is very extensive and  that China is willing to have international cooperation on the  issue of human rights. The case of Wei Jingsheng is not an  issue of human rights. I have talked with many reporters about  the Wei Jingsheng case and have discovered that reporters do not  know very much about him. The so-called human rights do not  simply mean releasing criminals, which is irrelevant to human  rights.    Regarding the request Warren Christopher made during his  visit to China a month ago, when he asked Qian Qichen to solve  the problems of the Chinese side's approval of applications for  family dependents to visit their relatives in the United States  and of releasing 108 Tibetans, Shen Guofang said not without  ridicule: I do not know whether reporters have ever been to the  U.S. Embassy in China, where there is a long line of people  waiting for visas every day. Many people were not able to get  their visas to the United States and, as a result, their  families were broken up. As a matter of fact, many people do  not want to permanently stay in the United States and only wish  to visit their relatives and friends there. Regarding the  namelist of the 108 Tibetans, we often receive similar lists  from western countries. Upon investigation, however, we have  found that there are many problems in those lists.  Investigation has revealed that some of the people did not  exist at all, some had already been released, and other were  serving other sentences. When western personalities have given  such namelists to us, we have tried to verify the contents and  sources with them, but they themselves could not tell us where  the information came from.</p>

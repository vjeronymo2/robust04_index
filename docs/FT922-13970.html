			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems hope for two votes in Solihull / Hearing the final verdict of the Martins, the FT's family of floating voters MR NEIL KINNOCK's final attempt to lure floating voters into the Labour net has failed to reach the Martin family. This evening, when Lyn, Tony and their first-time-voting son, Russell, walk out into Keswick Road, Solihull, on their way to the polling station, the Conservatives will be sure of one vote and the Liberal Democrats can count on one - probably two. The Martins have never taken an election as seriously as this one. 'We started the campaign with an open mind,' said Tony. They have watched the news, seen the party election broadcasts, grown weary of the debates on TV and felt, latterly, that they were being side-tracked. 'Instead of getting to grips with it (the issues), it's all about this PR,' complained Lyn. She, like her mother, will vote Conservative. But not, it appears, with vast enthusiasm. 'I think it's a case of 'better the devil you know',' she said. 'We've fared quite well under the Conservatives. There've been times with the high mortgage rates when we've really struggled.' Then, as an afterthought, 'but we struggled under Labour'. Tony has been impressed with the way Mr Paddy Ashdown has handled the Liberal Democrat campaign. He voted Labour in the 1970s, following his parents who now have switched to the Liberal Democrats. For a spell in the mid-1980s he was, somewhat reluctantly, a shop steward. That scarred his thinking. 'If I thought Labour would get in, I'd vote Conservative. But if it's going to be a hung parliament, I'm inclined to vote Liberal Democrat.' Russell has not made up his mind. 'I've still got time. I want to let it go right to the wire.' But he is edging towards the Liberal Democrats. The poll tax has coloured his view of the Conservatives: 'It was a mistake and yet they know it was a mistake. It's the one mistake that's forced me away from them.' Like his parents, Russell concedes that 'Mr Kinnock has brought a lot of good things up'. But he draws back. 'The way, like, Kinnock avoids things. I don't like people like that. I like people like Paddy Ashdown who hit things on the head.' Still, he views the prospect of a Labour government with a detached equanimity. 'If they do get in, I'd be ready to give him (Mr Kinnock) a fair crack of the whip.' Lyn and Tony are more fearful. The past dogs them. 'Labour is so union-oriented. There'll be lots of strikes again,' said Lyn. Tony argued: 'I think with Labour they're manipulated a bit by the unions. It's just been pushed to the background.' Labour's campaign has failed to break down this resistance. 'Mr Kinnock just aggravates me,' confessed Lyn. Tony said: 'I don't think I could trust him.'</p>

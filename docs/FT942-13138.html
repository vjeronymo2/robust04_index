			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (10): Easy access is a crucial factor - Information Highway A new high-speed motorway in the UK, stretching from Lands End to John O'Groats, would be almost totally unused if there were no other entry or exit points. Likewise, the success of any information highway depends on easy access. The Clinton administration has grabbed headlines in the US by announcing government initiatives to build a national Information Highway. This is intended to connect homes and businesses across the US. Each will have a 'black-box' that will connect them via a cable to all kinds of services. Among the first applications suggested are video telephones, interactive shopping and on-demand entertainment services. Telephone companies and cable TV operators see the enhancement of current services as a growth opportunity. The main competitor for cable TV is video rental. Rental stores are able to offer a vast array of films while a cable operator can only broadcast one film at a time. Connected to the information highway, a customer would be able to select a film from a large repertoire and then receive it down the wire a few minutes later. The technology required is impressive. Even a short movie takes a large amount of space on disk and requires a high-speed reliable data channel for delivery without visual glitches. Keeping a library of a few thousand films on-line will require significant advances in computer storage technology. Given the present rate of advance in this area, it is unlikely to be a real problem. Possibilities for advertisers are exciting. Adverts could be matched to the film currently showing (such as ice picks during Basic Instinct, perhaps?). As the highway would also be used for interactive shopping, it would be possible to deliver an advert together with the ability to order the product by simply pressing a 'Yes' button on the black box. Advertisements could be aimed at a subscriber based on previous purchases and customer profiles. However, the difficulties in accessing domestic subscribers are well known. Mercury Communications in the UK had a fully digital telephone network long before British Telecom, but domestic penetration has been held back by the cost of connecting households into its network. The only wires running into most houses carry either mains electricity or telephones. Neither is suitable for the high-speed data flow required for video transmission. The coax cables laid for television transmission offer much better pathways but very few households have such a connection. New houses in some areas of the UK (such as Milton Keynes) are built with a cable TV connection as standard, but this is only scratching the surface of the problem - a great number of households still lack such a connection. To complicate matters, the way that the data will be transmitted over the wire is itself an area of considerable debate. It is unlikely that technical merit alone will decide which method triumphs. There are similarities with early video recorders - VHS was the least technically advanced of the three systems at the time (VHS, Betamax and V2000) but it succeeded because it had the highest market penetration of software. The largest computer network in existence - the Internet - sees the information highway simply as a logical extension of itself. The Internet is a collection of thousands of different systems that agree solely on a set of protocols (called TCP/IP) for connecting to one another. It arose in the 1970s as a loose inter-connection of research and educational establishments. It now has over two million users world-wide, with the majority of traffic being commercial. Current growth is around 12 per cent a month. Governments have rarely succeeded in legislating for innovation. The much vaunted Japanese 'Fifth Generation' project has yet to produce any real benefits. Government sponsored bodies are simply too slow-moving to keep pace with the demands of an emerging technology. Usually, the imposition of a goverment body adds a layer of bureaucracy that stifles the creativity that it set out to promote. Whether Europe needs a single information highway seems moot as it is unlikely to get one. Agreement between national telephone companies is notoriously hard to achieve. In any case, the Internet already extends into Europe and many multi-national companies have their own high-speed links across the continent. An information highway will only succeed if it can achieve a 'critical mass.' The first few telephone and fax machines were relatively useless: it was only the spread of these devices that drew everyone else into having one. For the information highway this is more likely to come about by meeting real needs than by political rhetoric.</p>

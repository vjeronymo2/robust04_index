			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] and the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy [ANRE]  decided to abolish on-the-spot safety inspections at power  generating stations, except for nuclear power plants. In  principle, MITI and ANRE plan to abolish the safety inspections  in five years by gradually shifting the power plant inspections  to private companies' voluntary inspections after revising the  Electricity Enterprises Act [EEA] by the end of 1995. MITI will  also study the possibility of abolishing its auxiliary organ,  which carries out the safety inspections as MITI's  subcontractor. This is in response to a request made by power  companies, which following implementation of the plan, will be  able to save over 10 billion yen. It seems that the plan will  also be linked to lowering the power rate, which is higher than  in European countries.    Regarding power companies and household power generation,  the  government enacted safety standard on the basis of the EEA.  Currently, engineers of MITI and its auxiliary organ, the Power  Generating Facility and Technological Inspection Association,  make regular one-the-spot safety inspections at power generating  stations, either operating or under construction, once a year.  They inspect boilers, turbines, and other facilities and there  are more than 100 items subject to inspection.    The number of items has been increasing since the EEA was  enacted in 1911.    According to a plan MITI explained to electric companies on  11 May, the government plans to: 1) gradually abolish, except  for nuclear power plants, the on-the-spot inspections, which are  being conducted at all power generating stations, by allowing  instead private companies to carry out voluntary inspections; 2)  reduce frequency of inspections and the number of inspected  items; and 3) ease the system in which private companies are  required to have government approval for power plant  construction plans, and to convert it to a notification system.  Except for nuclear power plants, MITI will gradually abolish  on-the-spot inspections in five years.    Nine electric power companies are paying the government and  its auxiliary organ 4-5 billion yen a year as fees for the  inspections and state examinations.    The power companies, if the plan is implemented, will not  have to shut down their power plants for the inspections.  Therefore, their plant operation efficiency will improve.  Ultimately, "the power industry as a whole will be able to  reduce operation costs by more than 10 billion yen," (according  to a senior executive of an electric power company).    MITI started in March discussing the possibility of easing  government regulations on electric power at meetings of the  Council of Electric Power Companies [Denki Jigyo Shingikai] (an  advisory organ to MITI). The same agency plans to incorporate  measures designed to gradual abolish the inspections into a  proposal that will be mapped out in late June. MITI will submit  a bill for revision of the EEA to an ordinary Diet session in  1995 at the earliest.</p>

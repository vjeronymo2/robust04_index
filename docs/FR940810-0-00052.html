			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OSHA responded in 1990, by proposing a new provision to require employers to notify OSHA in writing prior to engaging in demolition, renovation, and removal operations which are not small-scale, short-term operations. OSHA's proposed notice requirement shared many core elements with EPA's then current and proposed notification requirements under NESHAPS. OSHA noted that ``(t)he proposed notification is modeled after the notification requirement concerning asbestos abatement projects that occur in conjunction with building demolition and renovation operations. OSHA noted further that ``(e)mployers can satisfy the OSHA (proposed) notification requirement simply by forwarding a copy of the EPA form to the OSHA area office when complying with EPA's asbestos NESHAP.'' (55 FR at 29731). Both EPA's and OSHA's proposed, notification requirements would exempt less extensive operations. In OSHA's case, the exemption would have applied to small-scale, short-duration operations as otherwise defined in the standard. EPA's cutoffs are annual amounts: 260 linear feet on pipes and 160 square feet on other facility components. OSHA noted that many asbestos jobs would meet the notification requirements of both agencies, however there would be an indeterminate, yet significant number for which EPA notification would not be called for, but OSHA's proposed requirement would apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most public comment opposed the requirement. The major objection was the burden on the employer from completing and mailing the notification form. Further, some commenters questioned the overall usefulness of the notification requirement in promoting compliance (See comments of Shipbuilder's Council of America Ex. 7&hyph;2.) BCTD continued to argue for extensive reporting requirements for the reasons stated above. A few other commenters supported its position. (Ex. 7&hyph;5, 7&hyph;6, 7&hyph;34, 7&hyph;64, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;118, 7&hyph;132, 7&hyph;149, 141, 144). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has carefully reviewed all the comments. Based on the review and subsequent developments, the final regulation scales down OSHA's proposed notice requirements. OSHA is now requiring advance notification of Class I (mainly large-scale removals) only when the employer intends to utilize controls other than a negative pressure enclosure which meets the requirements of paragraph (g) of this standard, and in some circumstances, where modifications of glove bag systems, glove box systems and other control systems described in paragraph (g) are made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a number of reasons for OSHA's decisions. OSHA believes that the potential benefits in direct risk reduction from a separate OSHA reporting requirement are unlikely. There are already extensive EPA and state reporting requirements which OSHA requirements would partly duplicate. The EPA and state requirements already create any incentive to comply that such reports could create. Similar OSHA reports would not increase this benefit. Information which may be useful to OSHA in targeting inspections can be retrieved by information-sharing with the EPA while avoiding overlapping reports. OSHA notes that the Paperwork Reduction Act requires that federal agencies avoid clearly duplicative reporting requirements. Various comments challenge the value of duplicative requirements (e.g., Ex. 7&hyph;17, 7&hyph;20, 7&hyph;22, 7&hyph;28, 7&hyph;39, 7&hyph;46, 7&hyph;47, 7&hyph;50, 7&hyph;54, 7&hyph;72, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;76, 7&hyph;77, 7&hyph;78, 7&hyph;79, 7&hyph;81, 7&hyph;86, 7&hyph;87, 7&hyph;88, 7&hyph;89, 7&hyph;102, 7&hyph;103, 7&hyph;108, 7&hyph;112, 7&hyph;125, 7&hyph;133, 142, 147). Thus, although OSHA's and EPA's reporting requirements are only partially duplicative, these considerations have influenced OSHA's decision not to require extensive pre-job reporting. OSHA is concerned that in reviewing the volume of reports which may be spawned by a separate OSHA requirement which exceeded the EPA requirements would strain OSHA area offices enforcement resources and drain such resources from other enforcement efforts. However, OSHA finds that advance reporting is appropriate where information is related to new or modified control methods for Class I work. In such cases, heightened attention to the data supporting their use will result from the requirement to send them to OSHA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BCTD's contrary view that compliance would be enhanced was based in part on its contractor's report, submitted after the 1984 hearing. The report estimated that an advance reporting requirement would reduce ``the number of workers with TWA exposures over 0.1 f/cc'' up to 30% in drywall removal and demolition, and lesser amounts in other construction work. These estimates were based on the opinions of a seven person ``focus group'' which included three representatives of member unions of BCTD. No methodology was presented for deriving these quantitative estimates, and no supporting data has been submitted in either rulemaking (see brief Ex. 143 at 198). The Court referred to the report in its decision as uncontradicted, but that was because it was submitted late in the rulemaking procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes based on its experience that these estimates of specific quantifiable benefits are speculative. But more importantly, the now-existing EPA and state reporting requirements and OSHA's use of that data for targeting inspections will achieve those benefits without duplicative reporting requirements. Further, OSHA made various changes to the final standard which will also achieve some of these benefits. These include the expanded provisions on hazard communication, which will alert employees in all asbestos renovation, removal and maintenance work that presumed asbestos containing material is present; that require competent persons to evaluate the work site before work is begun, by informing employers that OSHA is setting up information sharing systems with EPA to access employer notices sent to that Agency, and that require employers who use new and modified control systems to notify OSHA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Help for OSHA in targeting inspections from the submission of advance reports is the other claimed benefit from a reporting requirement. Some participants claimed that because pre-job reporting was helpful to EPA in targeting its inspections for compliance with NESHAP requirements, an OSHA pre-job reporting would similarly benefit this Agency. EPA did not testify at the hearing, but available information shows that its reporting system provides useful information to that Agency's enforcement program. NESHAPS reporting is made mostly to 45 state agencies, delegated by EPA to implement the asbestos NESHAP. Reporting in EPA Region II, is directly to the Regional Office. These reports are the source of two data bases: the National Asbestos Registry System (NARS), which develops a historical record of asbestos contractors, updated quarterly: and the ACTS system, which is a local data base on the compliance history of each contractor. OSHA is informed that ACTS is a tool that delegated agencies may use for day-to-day tracking of asbestos activities. EPA's evaluation of the reports submitted to it and other information used in its NESHAP enforcement effort constitute a valuable resource for OSHA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

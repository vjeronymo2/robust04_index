			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Management: Having the right stuff British managers no doubt hope they will soon be able to tuck their recession strategies into the bottom drawer. But there is always something to learn from those which have best weathered tough times. OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, part of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has surveyed the 250 UK companies with the biggest turnover and come up with a 25-strong league table of 'recession busters'. Based on profit growth in the period 1990-93, the list is headed by the travel group Airtours (whose average annual profits increased by 141 per cent during the three years in question), followed by security systems and banknote printer De La Rue (33 per cent) and the north of England supermarket chain Wm Morrisons (29 per cent). Being in a so-called 'recession proof' sector obviously helps, which is why food retailers and wholesalers account for six of the 25 places. Other traditionally resilient sectors such as the food and drink sector, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications are also well represented with nine constituents between them. In general OC&amp;C says the successful companies have adopted one of three strategies: Aggressively pursuing and well executing, acquisitions. Tomkins, for example, is in sixth place with 25 per cent profits growth. Moving quickly to capitalise on the woes of competitors. Airtours, which benefited from ILG's collapse and recently tried to outmanoeuvre Owners Abroad, started the recession with a low cost base and has targeted profitable business rather than merely seeking volume share. Dominating sectors. Besides De La Rue, Weir Group (8th with a 20 per cent profits improvement) and Rentokil (4th and 28 per cent) are cited in this regard. OC&amp;C partner Chris Outram claims that the study 'shows that it is possible for companies to outrun a low-growth economy. 'Low growth and even recession are not necessarily excuses for reduced profits.'</p>

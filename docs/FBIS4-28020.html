			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jun 2 (ANTARA) -- The Indonesian Government  Thursday announced a new investment policy granting greater  liberties to foreign capital in company share ownership,  geographical spread and sectoral business lines.    Capital Investment Promotiom Minister Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo  said under the new policy there would be two forms of foreign  investment: joint ventures and companies 100 percent owned by  foreigners or foreign corporate bodies.    Explaining the main provisions of Government Regulation  Number 20/94 on share ownership in companies set up under the  foreign investment scheme, he said Indonesian ownership of  shares in joint ventures had now been fixed at a minimum of five  percent.    Previously the ratio of share ownership in such ventures  after 20 years of operation had to be 51 percent Indonesian and  49 percent foreign.    Under the new regulation foreign share-holders are still  expected to transfer part of their shares to Indonesians after  15 years of operation but no specific percentage figure has been  stipulated.    "If the Indonesian and foreign partners agree to a 50-50  shares division, that would be all right. If the foreign  share-holders decide to transfer only one percent, that would be  ok too," Sastrowardoyo said.    The new regulation further does away with the old  requirement  that to set up a 100 percent foreign-owned company, investors  have to sink a minimum of one million US dollars in it.    Now the foreign investors only need to provide initial  equity  in an amount as required by the needs of their business.    The minister said 100 percent foreign investment projects  may  now set up in any part of the country, while previously they had  been restricted to Batam Island or bonded industrial zones.    Joint ventures under the new policy are now permitted to  operate in the production of goods or services deemed vital to  the state and affecting the needs of the majority of the  Indonesian people , Sastrowardoyo said.    They included ports, electricity production and  distribution,  telecommunications, shipping, aviation, drinking water, railways  and mass media.    However, these areas remain closed to 100 percent  foreign-owned companies.    Based on the new government regulation, companies set up  under the foreign investment scheme will be given business  licences valid for 30 years reckoned from the date they begin  commercial production.    On the same occasion Industry Minister T. Ariwibowo said  that  after Indonesia allowed the entry of foreign capital, many  neighbouring countries that used to be closed to foreign  investors had followed suit.    "Therefore, we should review all our economic policies so  that we can maintain the pace of our development effort," he  said.    He pointed out the country's population growth should be  anticipated by the creation of new job opportunities and to this  end Indonesia should achieve an economic growth rate of six  percent a year.    "Government Regulation Number 20/94 is aimed at setting a  condition for the creation of new jobs that will in turn  increase the national income through taxes," he said.    The government was also hoping that the new policy would  accelerate the transfer of technology and management skill to  Indonesians, Ariwibowo said.    Minister/State Secretary Murdiono told the same press  conference, under its sixth five year development plan Indonesia  plans to induce investments totalling rp [Rupiah] 660 trillion,  73 percent of which is expected to come from the private sector.    This was why the government was giving more opportunities to  national as well as foreign businessmen, he said.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How To Spend It (The Electronic Age): Pocket pagers for teenagers - A variety of fads are catching on around the world. FT writers report on what is happening where The must-have item for any trend-conscious Californian teenager these days is the pocket pager - preferably in this season's colours of bikini blue, hot pink or a see-though 'ice' shade. These matchbox-sized devices may have begun life as a communications tool but they are now seen as a fashion item. Teens are also hot on pager accessories: bungee cords, gold chains and special clip-on cases are all the rage. The coolest choose a pager in one colour with a holster in another. Pagers had a bad image until about a year ago, because they were said to be used by drug dealers and their clients. Attitudes have changed. While many high schools still have an official ban on pagers, administrators are turning a blind eye to a trend that is too big to fight. Teenagers are not the only age group catching on to the pager trend. Pagers are also becoming the communications tool of choice for 'baby boomers' looking for affordable ways to stay in touch with their ageing parents and baby-sitters. But surveys suggest that teens are three times more likely to carry pagers than others. The appeal of a pager is clear for a generation of Californian youngsters which typically spends more leisure hours on the telephone - local calls are free - than watching television. The pager is, after all, the next best thing to a mobile phone, which few of them could afford. In California, a simple pager that accepts numeric messages costs about Dollars 70, with a service charge of Dollars 10 a month. A cellular telephone typically sells for Dollars 160, and monthly call charges can mount quickly to Dollars 100 or more. It is, however, parents who buy most of the pagers that are touted around by teenagers - and they have self-interest in mind. The pager is a high-tech way to lengthen the parental apron strings while still keeping tabs on young Jenny or John. The new house rule for the Californian teenager is: 'When I page, you call home.' In a society where parents double as taxi drivers for their youngsters because there is little public transport, pagers are an asset when plans go astray. Low-cost paging services, of the sort used by most teenagers, are designed to transmit only numeric messages, normally a telephone number. But youngsters have worked out codes to make the most of the system. Mother's code number is always 303 which, turned on its side, looks like mom. The girl/boyfriend code is 143 - the number of letters in the words 'I love you'. For the lovelorn, the code 1 1717155 00 means 'I miss you' because, when those numbers are squeezed together, they look a bit like the words.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  Li Lanqing, in meeting here today with Ian m. Rolland, chairman  and chief executive officer of the U.S.-based Lincoln National  Corporation, said that developing bilateral economic and trade  cooperation is beneficial for both China and the United States.    Li said that China is the biggest developing country, the  U.S. is the biggest developed one, and the economies of the two  countries are mutually complementary.    Developing bilateral economic and trade cooperation is  conducive to the economic development of the two countries and  global economic development as well as to maintaining world  peace and stability, said Li.    Developing bilateral trade and strengthening exchanges in  culture and education between the U.S. and China are good for  the two countries and their peoples, said Rolland, adding that  he believes that the majority of the businessmen in the U.S.  share the same view.    "We believe that more and more U.S. politicians will also  share the same view," Li said.    Rolland said there is no such force that can hold back the  momentum of the development of bilateral trade.    The Lincoln National Corporation, founded in 1905 and named  after late U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, is one of the top ten  insurance companies in the U.S.    Rolland said that his company is deeply impressed by China's  economic development and is interested in its insurance market.    He said that his company will set up a Beijing office on  April 28, and that they are looking forward to developing the  China market.    Li expressed his congratulations on the opening of the  Beijing office, saying that "a thousand-li journey is started by  taking the first step" and that he is convinced that the office  will experience good development in the future.    Rolland and his party arrived here April 22 as guests of the  China Association for International Friendly Contacts.</p>

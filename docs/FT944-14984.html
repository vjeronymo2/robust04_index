			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Barclays acts to create a stronger divide Barclays has implemented changes promised by Mr Martin Taylor, the bank's chief executive following his appointment a year ago, to create a stronger divide between head office functions and the UK clearing bank. The bank's head office personnel department is to be split, with many functions passing to UK banking serv-ices. Mr John Davies, current deputy director of personnel, will become personnel director for the UK bank. Within the Barclays group, Mr John Cotton will become the director of group human resources. The bank said he could head a small central unit that would oversee broad personnel policy issues and manage senior personnel. Mr Howard Trust, the legal director of BZW, Barclays' investment banking arm, has been appointed to a new position of group general counsel from next January.</p>

			<p>Container   Seized   <F P=102> 94WD0418A Port-of-Spain TRINIDAD SUNDAY GUARDIAN in English  11 May 94 p 1 </F>  <F P=103> 94WD0418A </F> <F P=104>  Port-of-Spain TRINIDAD SUNDAY GUARDIAN </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO     [Text] Action by alert employees at the Carib  Brewery in Champs Fleurs on Friday assisted the Customs  Department in making its largest marijuana haul for the year,  and has opened up leads to a possible transhipment operation  involving containers ferried between Miami and Jamaica.    The illicit cargo, more than 2,000 pounds of compressed  marijuana with a street value of more than $TT6 million, was  discovered when Carib employees involved in a loading operation  came up against a camouflaged fibre-glass wall and secret  compartment inside a 40-foot steel container.    The container, which came into Trinidad a week ago  originally  with goods from Jamaica for a Piarco entrepreneur, was one of  several sent to the Carib plant from the Port-of-Spain docks by  shipping agents to be loaded with products for Kingston.    Together with their management, the employees alerted the  Customs officer who is always at their plant overseeing the  export loading operations, and found the drugs when they pried  the wall open.    The marijuana was nearly wrapped in some 250 plastic bags  stacked inside a two-foot deep compartment behind the  fibre-glass wall, which was painted and corrugated to make it  appear identical to the regular steel wall at the back of the  container.    They also found a Jamaica newspaper dated April 3 inside of  the compartment.    Carib management was loud in their praise for the work and  co-operation of the Customs officials, as well as the employees  who made the discovery.    They had become suspicious when the container was filled  although they had not yet hand-packed the number of cases that  each such container is supposed to hold.    According to reports, one of the employees crawled along the  two-foot space between the cases and the roof of the already  filled 44-foot container to examine what the problem might be,  and on tapping the rear wall found to his surprise that it was  not steel but corrugated fibre glass.    The cases were then offloaded and the bags of marijuana  found  behind the fibre-glass wall. Preliminary investigations have  revealed that the particular container was loaded in Jamaica and  arrived in the country on April 23 from Miami with a cargo of  goods consigned to the Piarco entrepreneur.    The goods were cleared on April 28 before the container was  assigned to Carib by the shipping agents the following day. But  the marijuana was not discovered until the loading operations at  the brewery late Friday afternoon within an hour of the arrival  of the container on the Carib compounds.    A team of Customs Preventive officers went to the plant to  view the booty about three hours after it was discovered. They  weighed it on the spot, packed it in two vans and despatched it  to their warehouse in Port-of-Spain.  <H5>  Full Support </H5>   A Customs spokesman said their investigations were  continuing  along "certain positive directions." He was not prepared to  reveal any more, but the Narcotics Branch of the Police Service  has also been brought into the picture.    In pursuit of information regarding the origin and  destination of the illegal cargo, local authorities have  contacted international investigative agencies, and the local  Customs Department was receiving the fullest co-operation of  their counterparts at U.S. Customs.    However, local shipping officials were saying yesterday it  is  unlikely that any marijuana trafficking occurred in any  direction between Jamaica and Trinidad because police believe  both countries produce the drug in vast amounts.    The shippers believe, therefore, that the marijuana was  transported originally from Jamaica to Miami where it missed its  pick-up because of some foul-up. The shipment then became loose  cargo until its discovery at Carib, which ships about 50  containers a week, mostly to Jamaica.  <H5>  Tracing the Drug to Trinidad </H5>   Container SCZU 3031795 arrived at the Port-of-Spain docks on  April 23 on the vessel MV-Cari Sky.    The voyage originated in Miami, but that particular  container  was loaded at Kingston, Jamaica, and consigned to a Piarco  entrepreneur.    The Piarco entrepreneur took delivery of the sealed  container  on April 28, having a transport contractor move it out of the  Port-of-Spain docks.    The container was returned to the port the following  morning,  April 29, before 8 o'clock, apparently empty.    Later that morning, the container was delivered to another  transport contractor and arrived at the Carib brewery at 1.12 pm.    The container was backed up to the loading dock for  immediate  packing of a cargo of Guiness destined for Jamaica.    By 2.30 pm, Carib loaders found that the container could not  take the expected 1,600 cases. Their investigations revealed the  false wall in the container and the Customs officer on the spot  was summoned. They pried the wall open and found the marijuana  stacked in a two-foot deep compartment, packed in plastic bags.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Observer: Direct question At least one person has not been carried away by the growth of Direct Line, the UK telephone insurer. The firm's annual report confirms that Peter Wood, its intense chief executive, was paid Pounds 17.3m this year. But the emoluments of Direct Line's chairman are not so grand. In fact, George Mathewson was paid nothing last year. Perhaps Mathewson, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, Direct Line's parent, is content with the Pounds 401,000 he got for his main job. Or perhaps he is making a point to his ambitious junior colleague.</p>

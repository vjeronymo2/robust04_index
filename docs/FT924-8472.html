			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Letter for the defence The following was submitted to the court in evidence FROM Alan Clark, then trade minister, to William Waldegrave, minister of state, foreign and commonwealth affairs End of the Gulf War: Defence Sales Guidelines I am concerned about the large number of licence applications for export of dual use equipment to Iraq agreed at official level but deferred by ministers. The goods concerned, totalling over Pounds 5.6m for Iran and Pounds 3.1m for Iraq, include spare parts for civil aircraft and helicopters, communications and transport equipment and machine tools. Para 2 of the official's note enclosed with Geoffrey Howe's of 31 August suggested: 'We can use discretion within the ministerial guidelines to adopt a phased approach to borderline cases, relaxing control on a growing number of categories as peace takes hold.' It would in my view be entirely consistent with this policy to issue without further delay the licences mentioned above. Not to do so will harm the efforts of British companies to re-establish themselves in both markets and deny them industrially valuable orders. Our international competitors are not so inhibited and this case for continuing to apply a wide ranging unilateral UK embargo on defence sales is now well-nigh impossible to justify to British firms. The ceasefire holds and while I am aware that substantive peace negotiations have yet to get off the ground, I doubt if it could seriously be argued that progress would be affected by such a marginal relaxation of controls by the UK. Apart from outstanding applications, there are important new orders to be won if licences are available. A prime example is a Pounds 14m contract for Westlands for refurbishment of two UK built Iranian hovercraft. This would provide 120 man years work in a severly depressed sector of industry. The work in the UK would take 18 months and the Iranians would meantime be denied use of the craft - urgently needed for rehabilitation of Iran's offshore oil industry. But Westlands will not get the contract without an assurance of a re-export licence and the work may be lost to Australia or the Soviet Union. Licence applications for this work have hitherto been resisted on the basis that refurbishment would upset the strategic balance in the Gulf. Continued denial of licences on these grounds would strain credulity. I hope that you and David Trefgarne can agree to the above proposals. I recognise, of course, that whatever is agreed between us will require the prime minister's approval in the light of her private secretary's letter of 2 September. I would not propose an announcement of any decision to issue the outstanding licences but we should be prepared to explain our decision if necessary and appropriate defensive briefing would need to be available to meet possible criticism. I am copying this letter to the prime minister and David Trefgarne. This is important]</p>

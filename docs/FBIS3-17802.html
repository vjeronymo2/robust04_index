The improvement in the taxation system and  American experts' assistance in this direction, the American  contribution to spring agricultural work, and other problems  were discussed. They also touched upon ways to find a political  settlement to the Karabakh conflict. The CSCE Minsk Group and  Russia's important efforts in this regard were stressed.    The prime minister also referred to the reoperation of the  Armenian nuclear plant and to the position of the U.S. official  organs.    The ambassador noted that those Americans opposing the  reopening of the Armenian nuclear plant are not informed about  the power situation in Armenia. They are worried that the  safety of the nuclear plant is not up to the desired level  therefore they will not assist with its reopening.    Gilmore handed Bagratyan a letter from the president of the  International Organization of Science and Technology inviting  Armenia to join the international organization.</p>

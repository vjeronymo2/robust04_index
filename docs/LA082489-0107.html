			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Chile's President Augusto Pinochet warned political parties against any attempt  to remove him from the army command or to bring charges against the armed  forces for alleged human rights abuses when he hands over the government to  civilian rule next March. The armed forces would demand the constitutional  right of their chiefs to stay at their posts for eight more years to be upheld,  the general said. The military would also reject any attempt to review an  amnesty law covering alleged violations committed following the 1973 military  coup, Pinochet, 73, added. "Under no circumstances will (the armed forces)  allow one of their members to be vilified or humiliated for actions carried out  to save Chile," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sector faces humbling time - Electronics JAPAN'S large integrated electronics companies and consumer electronics manufacturers are preparing to humble themselves before their shareholders again as they report disappointing results for fiscal 1992. Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturer, saw the sudden departure of its president in the wake of poor performance, and scandal caused by a financial subsidiary and by its own defective refrigerators. NEC expects to report a Y40bn (Dollars 359m) pre-tax loss, while Fujitsu is likely to announce a Y20bn deficit, its first loss since it was listed on the Tokyo stock exchange. The immediate outlook for most companies in the sector is not bright. Consumer demand is unlikely to rise strongly until later this year, and there are few consumer items on the market capable of leading the industry out of the doldrums. However, computer sales are expected to improve, while semiconductor sales are reflecting strong US demand.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enrique Atienza from Camaguey Province for the </F> "Exclusive" program]    [Text] A deplorable accident occurred at 1030 today at the  corrugated roof factory in Camaguey Province. The explosion  occurred at one of the two reactors [reactores] located in the  factory's pilot plant. These reactors are experimentally used to  manufacture sulphur resin, which has many uses in the  construction industry. The explosion injured six workers, two of  whom are reported in very critical condition, two in critical  condition, and the rest will be under medical observation for  the next 24 hours.    Marta Sanchez Castellanos, a chemical engineer and  technologist at the corrugated roof factory, was caught in the  explosion and suffered third-degree burns, eye injuries, and  loss of consciousness. Mario de Armas Ligo, a specialist in  mechanical plant plastics, is also in a critical condition in  the intensive care burn unit at the Manuel Ascunse Domenech  Hospital. Osvel Alvarez Basurto, a chemical engineer, and Angel  Miguel Diaz, a pilot plant operator, are in critical condition,  according to the team of specialists in charge of them. The two  patients who present no major complications are Ricardo Cid  Sanchez, an instrument maker, and Carlos Fonseca Pino, a  technician in the boiler plant, who was hit by resin particles.    The explosion destroyed part of the pilot plant's roof. The  reactor's mixing vat, which weighs approximately 20 kg, landed  at a distance of 40 meters. The explosion is being  investigated, although everything seems to indicate it was the  result of poor handling techniques.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG MIX  </P> <P> As a member of the National Task Force on Presenting &amp; Touring the  Performing Arts, I can say the issues raised in "The Big Mix" (Feb. 5) are the  cultural issues being discussed in think tanks across North America. I would  add, however, it is important to go beyond ethnicity to acknowledge the art of  lesbians, gays, the elderly, the homeless.  </P> <P> TIM MILLER  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSTEAD OF GRIPING ABOUT DIFFICULTY OF LURING EXECUTIVES HERE, FIRMS SHOULD  RECRUIT LOCALS  </P> <P> The Feb. 16 story, "It's Hard to Draw Executive Talent to the Southland,"  missed some very important points. The main one is that there is a large and  growing pool of unemployed executives already here as a result of the numerous  plant closures, reorganizations and consolidations in recent months.  </P> <P> These displaced executives already have homes here that they purchased before  the most recent rounds of skyrocketing real estate prices. They also have  adjusted their psyches to the traffic, earthquakes, culture and politics, and  their lungs to our air. They don't require $50,000 relocation packages.  </P> <P> Being one of these displaced executives, I can fully understand why the article  implies that the only worthwhile talent exists outside our area and doesn't  want to come here. The writer may have felt that this was the case, having been  so informed by the headhunters he interviewed.  </P> <P> Headhunters seem to avoid anyone who is unemployed as being some kind of a  burned-out loser, especially if he or she is 50 or older. Their mode of  operation seems to be to raid the client's competitors. Perhaps this builds  their business since each time they fill a job they create an opportunity for  another headhunter. That way they perpetuate the game of musical chairs  indefinitely.  </P> <P> The Southland's chief executives would be well advised to eliminate these  relocation problems and hire the top executives that are readily and locally  available.  </P> <P> KENNETH A.

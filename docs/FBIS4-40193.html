			<p>BFN     [Text] Four State Duma committees today held hearings on  problems of safety in the handling of radioactive waste. In  Russia today there are 14,500 enterprises where there are over  700 sources of radiation. In the opinion of the State Committee  for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the most  dangerous enterprises are those attached to the Ministry of  Defense and the (Ministry of Atomic Energy). At our request,  Nikolay Yegorov, first deputy minister of atomic energy,  comments on this.    [Begin Yegorov recording] Those storehouses where, at  present, radioactive waste is being dumped or stored do not  satisfy contemporary requirements, in other words those  requirements that were made following the Chernobyl disaster and  which are in accordance with international requirements. But  radiation safety at these storehouses is being monitored and I  think -- from my point of view -- it is normal. Present-day  requirements stipulate that storehouses should be protected from  air attacks, from natural disasters -- earthquakes and a number  of other extreme factors. These storehouses do not comply with  these requirements because when they were designed such norms  did not exist. [end recording]</p>

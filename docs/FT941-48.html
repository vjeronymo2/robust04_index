			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: BTA suspended in anti-Banesto move Portugal's Stock Exchange Commission (CMVM) yesterday suspended shares of Banco Totta e Acores (BTA) following moves by the central bank to curb the influence of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the crisis-hit Spanish bank which has a substantial equity stake in BTA. Banesto and an associate investor own some 50 per cent of BTA. The CMVM said the shares had been suspended indefinitely because of moves to limit the voting rights of Banesto and its associate to 25 per cent. Banesto's direct and indirect holdings in BTA contravenes Portuguese legislation limiting foreign ownership of the bank to 25 per cent. Banesto's voting rights were reduced ahead of BTA's annual general meeting today and before the conclusion of separate investigations into the legality of the Spanish bank's shareholdings in BTA by Portugal's attorney-general, the central bank and the CMVM. The suspension appeared to be aimed at halting speculative trading after control of BTA had been thrown in doubt by the central bank measure, analysts said yesterday. The Portuguese government has said it wants to return BTA to Portuguese control, and at least two Portuguese businesses have lined up bids to take control. The central bank said its measure did not reflect on the financial stability of BTA, which it described as prudently managed with an adequate level of capital.</p>

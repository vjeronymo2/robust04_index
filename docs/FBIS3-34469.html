			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Bosnia and West's Civilization Claims"] </F>   [Excerpts] The recent massacre in Sarajevo clearly exposes  the extent of the Western states' collusion through  procrastination and by delaying a decision to stop the criminal  actions against the Muslim people of Bosnia.    "Protect us, or let us defend ourselves!" This is the  message the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government is trying to convey to  the international community. The message is urgent and what  makes it even more urgent is the recent massacre in Sarajevo.    Everyone knows the locations of the heavy artillery killing  the innocent in Sarajevo. These posts can be seen with ordinary  binoculars from the center of the Bosnian capital. There exist  the deadly guns seen on television screens by hundreds of  millions of people throughout the world. Despite all this, we  are told that the United Nation has launched an investigation to  determine the source of the shell which killed 55 people while  they were buying their daily food. The investigation will be  similar to scores of investigations conducted before. That is,  it will produce no results, or it might produce a result but the  international community will then hasten to put it quietly away  on the top shelf.    Everyone knows who is in control of these deadly guns. The  peoples of the world watch the murderers giving interviews on  television screen every evening. UN diplomats embrace the same  murderers in cocktail parties and in diplomatic corridors.  Despite all this, we are told that the United Nations is  planning to conduct an investigation to identify the  perpetrator. [passage omitted]    The tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina has become one of the  questions that are of historic significance. That is, the  questions which expose the true positions by stripping the world  order of its claims to civilization and proving that it is based  on respect for force, and force alone.    In Bosnia-Herzegovina we see the real Europe. And in it the  present world order, which is supposed to be based on respect  for international law, has been exposed. So rescuing  Bosnia-Herzegovina is not merely rescuing a war-torn state from  suffering and possible extinction: The question raised now is  rescuing the international organizations, especially the United  Nations, and rescuing the future of international relations  throughout the globe.</p>

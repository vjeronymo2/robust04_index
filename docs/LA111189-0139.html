			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY TOPS NO. 1 EL TORO  </P> <P> If memories linger, Capistrano Valley High School's 22-21 victory over El Toro  Friday certainly was a haunting flashback.  </P> <P> If you care to go back in time, it was the same score by which Capistrano  Valley defeated El Toro two years ago and then forfeited when Capistrano Valley  was charged in a well chronicled spying incident.  </P> <P> The game of the year turned into a blast from the past as the county's two best  teams played for the South Coast League championship and the No. 1 ranking in  Orange County before 6,000 at Capistrano Valley.  </P> <P> By the time El Toro's Ken Romaniszyn missed a 35-yard field goal attempt with  16 seconds remaining, most of the fans and players were pointing to the  scoreboard that looked strikingly familiar.  </P> <P> "Does that score remind you of anything," asked Damon Psaros, Capistrano Valley  nose guard. "It couldn't be any sweeter, 22-21. How sweet."  </P> <P> Sweeter still, the victory gave Capistrano Valley (10-0, 5-0) its first  undefeated season in the school's 12-year history and the top seeding in the  Division III playoffs that will be announced Sunday at the Southern Section  office in Cerritos.  </P> <P> El Toro (9-1, 4-1) will have to settle for second and likely the second  seeding. El Toro had problems putting its right foot forward, missing four  field goal attempts and an extra-point attempt as Brad Hulse and Romaniszyn  failed to connect.  </P> <P> "The kicking game was the difference," said Eric Patton, Capistrano Valley  coach. "This was one of the greatest victories in the history of the school.  One of the most exciting games I've been associated with."  </P> <P> Hulse missed on field goal attempts of 45, 31 and 30 yards before El Toro Coach  Bob Johnson called for Romaniszyn with the game on the line and El Toro  trailing, 22-21.  </P> <P> Romaniszyn attempted a 35-yard field goal following an interception by teammate  Brian Haas, but his kick was short and Capistrano Valley had the league title  and the No. 1 ranking.  </P> <P> "The other guy had missed a few, so I decided to try Romaniszyn," Johnson said.  "He missed, but give Capistrano Valley the credit. They beat us and they  deserved to win.  </P> <P> "I thought when Haas intercepted the pass, we had another chance to pull out  the win. But we got killed all night by flags. We had a touchdown called back  and two other potential scores killed by three chop blocks (blocking below the  waist). We haven't had that called all year."  </P> <P> El Toro dominated the line of scrimmage and tailback Jerome Oakman gained 141  yards in 20 carries. Oakman's performance was nearly matched by Capistrano  Valley back Paul Shaheen, who gained 121 yards in 16 carries.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley played most of the game without Psaros, its best defensive  player. Psaros was ejected with 9:06 remaining in the first half for allegedly  swinging at an opponent. El Toro continually ran plays up the middle with  Psaros missing at nose guard, taking a 14-6 lead at halftime.  </P> <P> The third quarter was wild, with the teams scoring three times in a  three-minute period. Capistrano Valley tied the score, 14-14, when Shaheen  scored on a 75-yard run, but El Toro roared right back.  </P> <P> El Toro quarterback Steve Stenstrom connected with Kevin Rowe on a 66-yard  touchdown pass on the first play after the kickoff to give the Chargers a 21-14  lead. But Capistrano Valley wasn't finished.  </P> <P> Running back Chris Adams, who has missed most of the season with lower back  problems, scored on a two-yard run and then added a two-point conversion run  that ultimately was the difference in the game.  </P> <P> Afterward, Patton tried his best to downplay the past, but the numbers said  otherwise.  </P> <P> "You guys are all wrong to bring up the past," Patton said. "That's history.  We're living right now. I'm sure a couple of kids remember it, but we don't  talk about it. It's in the past."  </P></p>

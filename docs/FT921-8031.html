			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Manpower cuts losses in fourth quarter to Dollars 20m MANPOWER, the temporary employment business which was taken over by Britain's Blue Arrow but has now redomiciled in the US, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 20m, down from a loss of Dollars 60.2m in the same period of last year. The figures included Dollars 19.5m of goodwill amortisation and Dollars 10m of restructuring charges compared with Dollars 20.1m and Dollars 51.5m respectively in the same period of 1990. After-tax earnings, excluding amortisation and restructuring, came to Dollars 9.5m, down 16.2 per cent from the Dollars 11.3m of 1990. Corporate revenues were Dollars 709m, down from Dollars 766m. For the full year, earnings excluding amortisation and special charges totalled Dollars 29.4m, down 50 per cent from 1990's Dollars 59.6m. Mr Mitchell Fromstein, president, said the 1991 results reflected severe US and UK recession in the first half and a modest US recovery in the second half. The company felt the worst was behind it, in that sales levels compared with the previous year had improved modestly but continuously since mid-summer and it expected the trend to continue for the first quarter of 1992.</p>

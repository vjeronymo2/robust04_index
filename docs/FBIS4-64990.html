			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paul Cambon: "General Zeroual Deadlocked"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Algerian Finance Minister Ahmed  Benbitour arrived in Paris on Sunday [8 May]. He had talks  yesterday with Edmond Alphandery, his French counterpart, and  was the guest at a dinner given by the treasury chief, who is  also chairman of the Paris Club. He is due to continue his tour  in Brussels, London, Washington, and Tokyo. His aim is to  prepare for his country's appearance before the Paris Club,  probably at the end of May, with the aim of rescheduling  Algeria's debt, which is estimated to be around $26 billion.  The appearance before the Paris Club is now possible because  Algiers signed its letter of intent with the IMF on 10 April,  making provision in particular for a 40-percent devaluation of  the dinar, the elimination of some subsidies on basic products,  the liberalization of foreign trade, and the autonomous  management of public enterprises.    This agreement still has to be ratified by the IMF. In  financial circles, it is estimated that this point should  shortly be settled, thus opening the doors of the Paris Club. It  is only after the rescheduling of the debt that Algeria can rely  on bilateral or multilateral financial support. France could  extend an agreement totaling 6.3 billion francs for 1994, like  the one which was granted in 1993.    The European Union is due to release ECU150 million, the  residue of a package of ECU400 million granted in 1991. The  decision in principle to release this money was made on 16  April. This should be implemented technically on 16 May during  the council meeting of the Twelve's economy and finance  ministers. On the same day, the Commission should make  complementary proposals regarding financial aid.</p>

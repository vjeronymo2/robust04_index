			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUDGET PLANS WOULD ALLOW MORE POLICE;  </P> <P> FINANCES: CITY MANAGER WOULD ADD 14 OFFICERS AND SEVEN CIVILIAN POSITIONS. THE  MAYOR WOULD ADD 10 MORE OFFICERS.  </P> <P> More police officers would be hired under a $1.7-billion city budget that  continues to dip into the city's meager surplus funds and calls for city  departments to cut spending by 1%.  </P> <P> Long Beach's soaring crime rate and community complaints about police services  left a mark on the city manager's 1990-91 budget proposal, which would add 14  officers and seven civilian positions to the police force.  </P> <P> Mayor Ernie Kell, in a turnabout, is suggesting that the city dip even further  into its surplus funds and add 10 officers beyond the 14 recommended by City  Manager James Hankla.  </P> <P> Last year, Kell was adamant that reserves not be used for long-term costs, such  as police staffing. He persuaded the City Council to instead spend a portion of  the 1989 budget surplus on sidewalk repairs, a move for which he has been  criticized in this spring's mayoral race.  </P> <P> But caught in a runoff race amid continued rises in the crime rate, Kell this  year wants the council to spend nearly $1 million more than Hankla is  recommending for police staffing and is suggesting that two of the new officers  be assigned to anti-graffiti duties.  </P> <P> The call for more police comes on top of a June 5 ballot proposal that would  create a new property tax levy to expand the 677-member Police Department by 75  officers.  </P> <P> "I want to make it clear that those proposals to increase the number of police  officers in no way supplant the need for another 75 officers that we are asking  the voters to approve on June 5," Kell wrote in in his budget letter to the  council this week. "Long Beach needs both . . . to put enough officers on the  street to fight crime and improve response time to citizen calls."  </P> <P> The General Fund portion of the budget, which pays for basic city services,  would increase 4.8% to $287 million, while the total budget would jump 22% to  nearly $1.7 billion. Much of that spending is earmarked for self-supporting  departments over which the council has no control, such as the Harbor  Department.  </P> <P> Aside from extra police services, Hankla's spending plan also calls for minor  expansions in a variety of other areas. A nurse would be hired for the city  jail, several nursing and laboratory positions would be added to the city  health department, staffing will be slightly increased for senior citizen  programs at city parks, and a $217,000 literacy program would be started by the  public library system.  </P> <P> Under two pilot projects, 50 city vehicles would be converted to burn  compressed natural gas rather than gasoline, and trash dumpsters would be  purchased for automated garbage trucks.  </P> <P> Of the 14 police positions recommended by Hankla, four would be assigned to the  airport and would be paid for out of airport funds. The seven civilians would  be hired to free the same number of officers from desk duties, allowing them to  work on crime investigations. The park ranger program, under which armed park  rangers patrol city parks, would also be expanded with the conversion of three  part-time positions to full-time slots.  </P> <P> About $240,000 was also added to the budget to continue anti-gang programs.  </P> <P> General Fund income will fall short of expenses by about $4.4 million, forcing  Hankla to turn to end-of-the-year reserves to make up the difference. Under  Hankla's plan, all but $1.4 million of the reserve fund would be spent in the  coming fiscal year -- in addition to the $2.5 million the city must by law hold  in reserve.  </P> <P> Kell's proposal to hire even more police would further whittle the reserve,  leaving just $400,000 in surplus funds at the end of the coming fiscal year.  </P> <P> To find money for programs, Hankla is asking all his departments to cut their  spending by 1% in the coming year and cut their use of the city vehicle fleet  by 10%, for a total savings of about $1.7 million.  </P> <P> A number of city fees would also be increased, including charges for city  garbage collection, marina slips, oil production, paramedic ambulance service  and public health licenses.  </P> <P> The department cuts will not require any layoffs, and Hankla said the public  shouldn't notice any difference. "There will be no noticeable service cuts as a  result of the budget," Hankla said at a budget briefing for the press Monday.  </P> <P> "If this was a perfect world and our crime rate was going down and not up, I'd  probably like to be sitting on about a $9-million reserve," Hankla said.  </P> <P> Reductions in federal revenue sharing and drops in the city's once-bountiful  oil income have taken their toll on the city's budget, which is also hurt by a  relatively small sales tax base.  </P> <P> Glancing quickly at the budget, council members said they generally supported  the push for more police.  </P> <P> "That's what I favor, rolling up our sleeves and doing what we can to maximize  our (police) coverage," Councilman Warren Harwood said.  </P> <P> "My feeling is that if we had been doing this for the last 10 years, we  wouldn't be in this situation," said Councilman Les Robbins, saying the city  never should have allowed the ranks of the police force to thin to the point  they have.  </P> <P> As for the skimpy reserve funds, Robbins said: "It is real risky. But I don't  know what choice we have."  </P> <P> Councilman Clarence Smith also supported more spending on police, but he  lamented the absence of more recreation funding in the budget. "I think it's  going to cost us more money if we continue to deny young people the chance to  be involved in creative activities."  </P></p>

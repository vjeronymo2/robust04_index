			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the </F> Bulgarian Army General Staff, by Major Krasen Buchkov; place and  date not given: "Champagne for Bill Is Being Chilled"]    [Text] [Buchkov] Mr. Army General, how do you explain the  Armed Forces and Defense Bill being adopted at the first reading?    [Petrov] The adoption of the Armed Forces and Defense Bill  with a substantial majority is absolutely normal when one takes  into consideration the fact that it guarantees the country's  security structures -- the Bulgarian Army, the Border Troops,  the Troops of the Ministry of Transportation, the Construction  Troops....    The adoption of the bill was anticipated by all soldiers and  our entire public. This is not a secret, narrow departmental  bill, but a document of national importance that unites the  ideas and visions of the Armed Forces' future.    I was not surprised by the fact that the bill was adopted in  an ostensibly rapid manner after constructive debate and  discussion. This actually means that the people's  representatives have deeply grasped the problems of our national  security, skillfully dealt with the specific subject, and  precisely and clearly expressed their positions.    [Buchkov] What does the Army gain from the adoption of the  Armed Forces and Defense Bill by parliament?    [Petrov] First of all, the bill determines the Armed Forces'  place and role as a stabilizing factor in the period of  transition and in our democratic civil society. It also  guarantees Bulgaria's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Second, the bill ensures the Armed Forces' functional  character, structure, and development. It regulates legally the  relations between the various organs of the Armed Forces'  leadership and improves, to a large degree, the status of the  military.    Naturally, the mere act of adopting the bill will not ensure  the high social status of the military. However, it is the  legal guarantee of the military personnel's security. The  military deserve their bill, because they, and indeed, all  Bulgarian society, endured a lot until the bill was adopted.    [Buchkov] How do you expect events to develop at the  National Assembly during the second reading?    [Petrov] Against the background of the deputies' statements  during the first reading, I expect that some of the bill's  postulates will significantly improve during the second reading.    [Buchkov] Where do you see the "hazards" of the bill that  was adopted at the first reading?    [Petrov] This is a basic bill that determines the general  tenets of the Armed Forces' construction. Additional bills will  be adopted later on; for example, bills on alternative service,  the military personnel's status, the Bulgarian Army, the  economic foundations of defense, and so on. At present, the  bill has no postulates about the status of military education  establishments. This aspect must be clarified. In other words,  more bills that spring from the Armed Forces and Defense Bill  will be adopted.    [Buchkov] Mr. Army General, is it time to open the champagne  bottles?    [Petrov] Not yet. Let it chill. If all goes well, we will  soon clink glasses.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S UNVEILS BUDGET PLAN  </P> <P> Yes, President Bush's "Good Start on the Environment" (editorial, Feb. 10) is  indeed a welcome change in attitude from the recent past, and it is a relief to  know that he is willing to postpone the proposed oil-lease sale off our coast.  </P> <P> However, it must be recognized that the California coast is anything but a  pristine territory; wherein the Wildlife Refuge on the north coast of Alaska is  precisely this -- pristine. That the President is ready to degrade Alaska's  Wildlife Refuge is evidence that he will abandon environmental progress any  time it conflicts with private exploitation of public resources; and this is  hardly environmental progress for its own value.  </P> <P> We need a kinder and a wiser concept of the ecology than the President evinces.  </P> <P> NORMA JOHNSON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

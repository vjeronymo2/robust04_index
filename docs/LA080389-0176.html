			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: HAWAIIAN GARDENS;  </P> <P> RECALL EFFORT FALLS SHORT  </P> <P> An effort to recall Councilwoman H. M. (Lennie) Wagner has ended because her  opponents failed to obtain enough petition signatures to force a special  election.  </P> <P> The effort was led by Art Perez, a member of the city Public Safety Commission  and an ally of Councilwoman Kathleen Navejas and her husband, Carlos, both  former mayors.  </P> <P> Perez and his forces needed to collect 895 signatures over a 60-day period.  They collected 940, but 257 were declared invalid by the Los Angeles County  registrar-recorder's office, said City Clerk Carol Dorfmeyer.  </P> <P> Wagner, who is serving her first term, ended up the only target in a recall war  that broke out in the city last February and at one point involved every member  of the council. The other members managed to pacify their political opponents  and recall efforts against them evaporated, but Wagner's opponents persisted.  </P> <P> "Naturally, I feel relieved," Wagner said this week, "because when you try to  do a really good job, it hurts you to think there are people who don't realize  how hard you work."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIALITE TELLS PLAN OF SUICIDE, NOT MURDER;  </P> <P> TRIAL: BETTY BRODERICK TESTIFIES SHE PLANNED ONLY TO TALK TO HER EX-HUSBAND,  THEN KILL HERSELF. INSTEAD, SHE SHOT HIM AND HIS WIFE TO DEATH.  </P> <P> Saying she intended to kill herself because she "had no life left," La Jolla  socialite Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick testified Wednesday that she crept  into her ex-husband's house, stole into his bedroom and fired the shots that  killed him and his new wife.  </P> <P> Sobbing as she recounted the shootings, Betty Broderick said she planned only  to talk to her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick, and to kill herself, "to splash  my brains all over his . . . house," when she entered his bedroom before dawn  last Nov. 5.  </P> <P> After a bitter divorce that took four years and left her without her husband,  custody of her children or an equal share of Daniel Broderick's considerable  assets, she felt as if she "was dead, been defeated, couldn't fight anymore."  </P> <P> In the dark room, standing in front of her ex-husband's bed, where he was lying  with his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, Betty Broderick said she saw  motion. But she said she remembers almost nothing else from that point on about  the shootings, not even firing her gun.  </P> <P> "They moved, I moved and it was over," she said.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick, who appeared to be holding back tears for hours during a  second full day of testimony at her murder trial, did not hold them back as she  recalled the shootings.  </P> <P> In the audience, her children, her family and her ex-husband's family cried,  too.  </P> <P> Kim Broderick, her eldest daughter, who testified last week against her mother  and who sat Wednesday on the prosecution side of the courtroom, wept with two  of her aunts and an uncle, Daniel Broderick's sisters and brother.  </P> <P> Lee Broderick, Betty Broderick's second child, who sat on the other side of the  courtroom, behind the defense table with Betty Broderick's brother, also  brushed away tears.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick, 42, is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of her  ex-husband and his wife. If convicted, she could be sentenced to life in prison  without parole.  </P> <P> Daniel Broderick, 44, was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and a former  president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Broderick, 28, was his office  assistant.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick has pleaded innocent and has been held since the day of the  killings -- when she turned herself in to police -- at the Las Colinas Jail in  Santee. She said Wednesday that in the weeks after she was jailed, she realized  she was "happy to be locked in a dark, little, safe room where nobody could get  me."  </P> <P> When her trial began last week, defense lawyer Jack Earley conceded that Betty  Broderick fired the shots that killed her ex-husband and his second wife. But,  according to Earley, she did not have the premeditation the law requires for  first-degree murder because she only intended to kill herself when she crept  into the couple's home.  </P></p>

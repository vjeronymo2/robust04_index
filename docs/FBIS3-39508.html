			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by </F> "special" correspondent Philippe Lamair; place and date not  given; Karadzic speaks in English with superimposed French  translation -- recorded]    [Text] For the first time in several days, a civilian in  Sarajevo was killed by a sniper today. There were no other  infringements of the cease-fire, however. Neither was there any  sign from the Serbs, who are maintaining their position,  although NATO has made it clear that the ultimatum would not be  extended beyond the Sunday [20 February] midnight deadline. Our  special correspondent in former Yugoslavia, Philippe Lamair, met  with Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs.    [Lamair] [Question not heard]    [Karadzic] If all that NATO is trying to do is make us  withdraw our artillery without also controlling the Muslim  infantry, then there will be a strategic imbalance and the war  will continue. I believe the threats should stop and diplomacy  should go forth. If the international community treats both  sides on equal footing, then there will be a peace accord. If  the sanctions against Serbia are lifted, for example, then the  Muslims will sign a peace [agreement], not before.    [Lamair] [Question not heard]    [Karadzic] I believe that the United States wants to flex  its  muscles, humiliate Russia, and scare other countries. NATO is  just like a young man who has lost his job; he is flexing his  muscles, he is showing that he can hit anyone. It is obvious  that they can hit us. We are only 4.5 million people, so they  can hit us very easily. But it will be a moral disaster for the  NATO countries. You will see, in the event there are air  strikes, many NATO countries will distance themselves  immediately from this immoral move.</p>

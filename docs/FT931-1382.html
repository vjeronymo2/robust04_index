			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Benefits for Russia will take time: Free trade zone plan seen by the Twelve as a 'political signal' of support for the reform programme RUSSIA would take longer than did Poland, the Czech and Slovak republic and Hungary to reap benefits from trade liberalisation with the European Community, trade specialists said yesterday. The slow response would largely be due to internal economic disorder, they said. New figures about to be released from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva show that the economies of central and eastern Europe have seen strong export gains to the EC - up about 20 per cent in 1992 after a 12 per cent rise in 1991. East Europe's imports from the EC grew even faster, however, showing that at present the economies in transformation are offering better market opportunities to EC exporters than vice versa. 'Exports especially to the EC grew quite substantially,' a Gatt official said. 'It is tempting to impute a causal relationship between the improvement as last year's market opening agreements (with Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republic), but no detailed investigation has been possible.' This improvement contrasts with an overall fall in exports from central and eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States of 10 per cent to Dollars 85bn. Agreements with the three eastern European economies providing better access to the EC market went into force in March last year. Quotas were set on food exports, textile products, steel and chemicals - all sectors where strong export gains might have been expected. Potential gains have also been reined in by anti-dumping actions against steel exporters from the region late last year. Strongest growth in exports to the EC was seen for the Czech and Slovak republic, which saw exports leap by 40 per cent, with Bulgaria seeing a 24.5 per cent gain. By contrast, CIS exports stagnated. In any 'Europe agreement', Russia would probably hope for better openings for its raw materials, especially oil and gas. It would probably face less protectionist resistance than the eastern European economies did to many of their manufactured exports, though controversy over fish, alumina and non-ferrous metals cannot be ruled out.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Trade of western Europe with eastern Europe and CIS, 1991-92                     (Annual percentage change in value)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Exports to                                             Imports from  1991     1992                                          1991      1992  -1.0    14 .0  Bulgaria                                26.0      24.5  21.0     63.0  Czech and Slovak Fed.

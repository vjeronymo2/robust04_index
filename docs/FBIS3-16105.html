Kozyrev and Christopher Face Difficult Conversation in  Vladivostok"]    [Text] The Vladivostok meeting between the Russian foreign  minister and the U.S. secretary of state scheduled for 14 March  comes at a time of coolness in relations between Moscow and  Washington, which not so long ago appeared cloudless.    There are several reasons for this. The first is the  December elections, which brought victory for the  national-communists and reminded the Americans that  unpredictable Russia remains a potential enemy of the West and a  threat to security in the world. Second, Washington cannot fail  to be concerned by the changes which have appeared of late in  Kremlin policy: the proclamation of the former USSR republics  to be a zone of Russia's special interests, the unwillingness to  withdraw troops from Latvia and Estonia, and resolute support  for the Bosnian Serbs. "After defeat at the elections, the  Russian authorities decided to adopt the opposition's slogans.  For a while it has been difficult to determine to whom certain  remarks in the sphere of foreign policy should be attributed --  Kozyrev or Zyuganov," a Western diplomat accredited in Moscow  noted.    The third factor provoking the crisis between Russia and the  United States is the success of Russian diplomacy in the  Balkans. Having secured concessions from the Serbs and thereby  averted military action by NATO, Moscow has proclaimed its  status as a great power with whose opinion the West has to  contend. The situation in Bosnia will be one of the main  questions on the agenda of the Vladivostok meeting. "If Moscow  and Washington manage to work out a joint stance, substantial  progress can be expected over a Bosnian settlement given the  influence which we have over the Serbs and which the Americans  have over the Croats and the Muslims," a Russian diplomat  dealing with the Balkans believes.    The subject of the Arab-Israeli conflict will probably arise  in Vladivostok too. Kozyrev's sensational visit to Tunisia and  Israel testifies to the seriousness of Russian diplomacy's  intentions in the Near East. For two years everybody forgot  that the Madrid conference on a Near East settlement had another  cochairman apart from the United States -- Russia. Washington  has borne the full burden of mediation between the Jews and the  Arabs, and suddenly -- like a bolt from the blue -- Moscow comes  forward with the unexpected idea of holding a new peace  conference.    To all appearances, Christopher will use the meeting with  his  Russian colleague to make it clear to him that the United States  will tolerate the revival of Moscow's old ambitions on the  territory of the former USSR and even, to a certain extent, in  the Balkans, but it by no means follows from this that it is  prepared to accept a return by the Kremlin to its traditional  role of defending the Arabs and fighting against Zionism in a  region which Washington considers to be a zone of its own vital  interests.    The participants in the Vladivostok talks will not let  ex-President Richard Nixon's scandal-dogged trip to Moscow pass  unnoticed. The Foreign Ministry came down firmly on the side of  Boris Yeltsin, who reacted angrily to the former White House  chief's contacts with the diehard opposition. "Nixon would have  gone on to meet with Anpilov, Barkashov, and Vasilyev from  'Pamyat,' and then ask for an audience with the Russian  president.... Yeltsin's reaction was quite proper. We are  entitled to expect respect," a high-ranking Russian diplomat  said.    Moscow will also demand respect for its interests in "the  near abroad." And although the United States has long since  defined its approach in respect of the Baltic countries and is  unlikely to yield to pressure from Moscow, Washington's plans in  the sphere of Ukraine are not entirely clear. Kozyrev will try  to clarify how far the reports that the United States intends to  look upon Kiev as a counterweight to the increasing influence of  Moscow correspond to reality.    Despite the abundance of delicate topics, the Russian  Foreign  Ministry will strive to avoid confrontation with Washington. In  Vladivostok Kozyrev is unlikely to focus attention on  differences of opinion, and he expects the same of Christopher.  "There are no major reasons for exacerbating relations between  Russia and the United States. The policy of strategic  partnership proclaimed by Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton remains  in force," IZVESTIYA was assured by an informed source on  Smolenskaya Square.</p>

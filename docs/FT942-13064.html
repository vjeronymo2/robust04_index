			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / South Africa Votes: Expatriates join in creating real homeland Outside their embassy in Trafalgar Square, the queue of South Africans stretched around the block. Their wait to enter the polling booths was lightened by cheers and chanting as anti-apartheid luminaries arrived, and by a dose of spring sunshine which would not have been felt amiss in the Cape. The line, one of dozens in cities around the world yesterday, comprised visitors to London and expatriates. The all-race poll was the final step in eradicating that bleak and previously numerous third category: no one needed any longer to call themselves exiles. Although the embassy was only one of seven polling stations in the UK, nearly 8,000 voters were thought to have passed through its doors alone. One of their number was Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, who pronounced the election 'a miracle - I truly believe it has been miraculous.' Afterwards, in an embassy library with walls bearing the coats of arms of colonists Dutch and British, and shelves of bound records of the white parliament since union in 1910, the 80-year-old archbishop said he would 'never ever forgive the evil of apartheid'. While branding as 'traitors' those whites who opposed change, he said a new administration, led by Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, for which he had voted, 'must be a government of all South Africans.' The first South African to cast a vote yesterday, in Wellington, New Zealand, was Ms Nomaza Paintin, a niece of Mr Mandela. South Africans form one of the largest immigrant groups in New Zealand. There was an upsurge of last-minute interest among the South African community in Australia, which at some 60,000 ranks alongside that of the UK. Local newspapers there and in other countries had run advertisements on behalf of the Independent Electoral Commission publicising the poll. The 700 or so South Africans in Hong Kong turned out in such force that the consulate ran out of ballot papers. Among those who managed to vote was Ms Elizabeth Dikgale, a domestic helper who is the only Zulu resident in the colony. 'South Africa is a golden country, and now we can get back to golden times,' she said. The 20,000 or so Jewish South Africans who have emigrated to Israel find themselves caught between two peace processes, each of which has taken a heavy toll in violence. But as one in the long queue to vote at Tel Aviv Show Grounds put it: 'If the whites and blacks in South Africa can get it together, we should be able to do it here too.' Pockets of South Africans elsewhere in Africa were also able to vote, even though full diplomatic relations with much of the continent do not yet exist. The polling station for Kenya was a sports club in the outskirts of Nairobi where Mrs Nomtha Nkolombe, a 62-year-old physiotherapist who left Cape Town 30 years ago, said: 'It is an opportunity both my parents missed.' In New York, two polling stations were set up in tents on a lawn outside the United Nations building. One white voter maintained: 'Every South African I know will be voting today. This is one hell of a vote.' That much is indisputable. It was taking two to three hours in the Trafalgar Square queue yesterday to get to vote. Some, however, had been waiting all their lives.

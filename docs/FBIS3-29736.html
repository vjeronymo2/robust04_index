The letter to the U.S. President said the U.S. Government's  pressure and threat against people's Korea are not aimed at  solving the problem peacefully but at rendering it complicated.    Noting that a proper solution to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula is that the United States comes out again to  the negotiating table with people's Korea, it demanded that the  U.S. forces and nuclear weapons be withdrawn from South Korea  and the double-standard policy be renounced in dealing with  international issues.    The letter to the United Nations secretary general voiced  solidarity with people's Korea subjected to threat and blackmail  and called on him to make responsible efforts for the  discontinuation of such provocative moves increasing tension.    It noted that the United States must be forced to end the  presence of its forces with nuclear arsenal in South Korea, stop  the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and come out to  talks, a proper way for a fair and comprehensive settlement of  the crisis.    The letter to the board of governors of the IAEA pointed out  that the primary cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula is the presence of the U.S. Forces with nuclear  weapons in South Korea.    It urged the IAEA to free itself from the U.S. pressure in  the campaign against people's Korea, refrain from applying  double standards in dealing with the nuclear issue and take a  responsible action.</p>

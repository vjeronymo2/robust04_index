			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRAMA AND PATHOS MARK A GREECE ADRIFT  </P> <P> Drama in a historic vote of censure in the small hours of the morning. Pathos  at a funeral in the afternoon rain. Such were the political signposts Thursday  in a country on hold.  </P> <P> Greece, the divided and unstable kin of a united and powerful Europe, is  adrift, searching for a new course.  </P> <P> An improbable government of conservatives and Communists, formed after  no-winner June elections, announced Thursday that, as planned, it will resign  next week to clear the way for new elections Nov. 5.  </P> <P> These elections could restore political direction to Greece, but there is no  assurance that they will.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unchecked Terrorism  </P> <P> A caretaker government of political personages will handle day-to-day affairs  until November in a country where, for more than a year, the government has  failed to effectively address economic trouble, unchecked terrorism and  Greece's relations with the United States and its partners in the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Community.  </P> <P> Conservatives and Communists say their short-term pact to seek "catharsis" for  sins of the political past bore fruit early Thursday when Parliament made  Andreas Papandreou, Greece's Socialist leader, the first prime minister in  Greek history forced to defend himself against charges of criminal misconduct.  </P> <P> The small Athens stock market surged to record highs Thursday in the aftermath  of the parliamentary action. If there was a new sense of confidence, a  counterpoint to the need for national leadership, it was implicitly underlined  at the sodden funeral Thursday afternoon of a conservative politician slain  Tuesday by Marxist terrorists who, over the past 14 years here, have slain  Greek and American alike with impunity.  </P> <P> Large, respectful crowds applauded the police-flanked black hearse bearing the  body of Pavlos Bakoyannis as it glided through the wet streets of downtown  Athens. Bakoyannis was a son-in-law of conservative New Democracy leader and  would-be prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis.  </P> <P> New Democracy outpolled Papandreou's Socialists in June by 44% to 39% but fell  six seats short of a majority in Parliament. This forced an alliance with the  also-ran Communists.  </P> <P> In the spring of 1988, Papandreou, who was married and approaching 70, fell  publicly -- some said scandalously -- in love with a former flight attendant  half his age. Papandreou's attention wandered from the affairs of a government  whose massive corruption he is now formally accused of abetting. Then he fell  sick and traveled to London for heart surgery and a prolonged convalescence.  </P> <P> In the policy vacuum that has continued since the June election, Greece has  suffered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Massive Deficit  </P> <P> Inflation of nearly 16% a year is almost four times the European Community  average. This, plus a massive public deficit and a painful foreign debt that  are Papandreou legacies, will probably demand economic austerity in 1990.  </P> <P> There are conservative expectations that the criminal charges of  influence-peddling and bribe-taking against Papandreou will prove to be mortal  political wounds.  </P> <P> Still, Papandreou has support among Greeks who agree with him that the  conservatives and Communists were less interested in justice than in destroying  him and his Socialist movement.  </P> <P> Many voters, as they demonstrated in June, are undismayed by the spectacle of  public scandal. At the grass-roots level, many are more interested in the  roads, schools and hospitals that came during Papandreou's rule.  </P> <P> In the wake of the punishment his opponents have meted out to him, Greek  analysts see no chance that Papandreou could win the next election. But it is  possible, they say, that the conservatives could lose it by failing to win an  outright majority, thereby prolonging the Greek drift.  </P></p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Zeneca moves to individual pay Zeneca, the chemical and pharmaceutical company, has decided to end collective bargaining with unions representing 8,200 white-collar staff in its UK plants. The company has given union officials six months' notice of its intention to abandon company-wide negotiations on pay and conditions of service including hours of work, holidays, working arrangements, shifts and security of employment. From next April, the pay of Zeneca's staff will be determined through assessment by local management of individual performance, ending the old system of annual across-the-board cost-of-living awards in addition to merit review rises. Zeneca's move has come as a shock to union leaders. Earlier this week they met Mr David Barnes, the company's chief executive, to discuss the new strategy. They told him the overwhelming majority of white-collar staff in Zeneca was opposed to the end of collective bargaining and urged him to test their views by holding an independent survey. In a statement to the staff, the five unions involved accused the company of 'blatant ideological opportunism'. The statement said: 'It represents the reversal of every assurance given to the unions and every statement made by the company . . . It has been done in an underhand way and against all the principles of consultation which have developed at national level over many years.' The company said less than 30 per cent of white-collar staff belonged to a trade union. Unions could still represent their members in the company on disciplinary and grievance issues as well as health and safety. 'We wish to continue to have an open dialogue with the unions,' it said. Zeneca said it had no intention of ending collective pay bargaining for manual worker grades. 'We have no experience of operating a merit pay scheme with them,' it said.</p>

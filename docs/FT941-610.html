			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Horsham pays CDollars 600m for controlling stake in Trizec Horsham, the investment group controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk, has cast a vote of confidence in the North American property market by agreeing to invest CDollars 600m (USDollars 454m) in Trizec, the continent's biggest publicly-traded real estate developer. Horsham will acquire a stake of at least 43 per cent in Trizec, ousting Toronto's Bronfman family as the controlling shareholder. The deal is conditional on completion of a capital restructuring which Trizec began last August, involving about CDollars 1.5bn of its CDollars 4.8bn debt. The agreement marks another step in the rapid decline of the Bronfman empire, which was once the colossus of Canadian business but has lost control over the past 18 months of flagship assets in the forest-products, brewing, financial-services and packaging sectors. With a war chest of more than USDollars 1bn, Horsham has been looking for an investment to complement its controlling interests in American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, and Clark Refining and Marketing, a US mid-west oil distributor. Horsham made a foray into the German property market three years ago by buying a large commercial site on the outskirts of Berlin. However, development has been slower than expected. It said the investment in Trizec was based on a view of the company's long-term prospects. Trizec's future would be enhanced by access to Horsham's international contacts and its expertise in innovative financing techniques. Trizec has stakes in 85 properties, mostly office buildings and shopping malls, covering 54m sq ft. More than three-quarters of its properties are in the US. Debenture holders and other creditors have so far rejected Trizec's restructuring proposals, and have threatened to demand accelerated payment of their securities. The company this month obtained a court order which prevented senior debenture holders from enforcing their rights pending the outcome of talks with Horsham. Horsham will advance an initial CDollars 500m, which will be used to retire a large portion of Trizec's senior debentures. The remaining CDollars 100m will comprise 50 per cent of a planned CDollars 200m rights offering, whose proceeds will be used to strengthen Trizec's balance sheet. Trizec will issue warrants exercisable for 20 per cent of the new shares over four years. Horsham will take up 43 per cent of the warrants. Trizec expects to draw up a new debt-restructuring proposal by the end of April, with the aim of putting it in place by June 30. Mr Kevin Benson, Trizec's chairman, said yesterday the deal would allow Trizec to offer shares to some debenture holders, but to offer 'a substantial portion of cash' to others who have been reluctant to accept equity in exchange for their debt securities. The company indicated it would ask the courts for a further period of protection from debenture holders while it draws up an information circular and arranges votes by various classes of creditors and shareholders.</p>

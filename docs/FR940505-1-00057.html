			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For example, the Amendments contain new and highly specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> targets for Reasonable Further Progress. Section 182(b)(l) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments requires plans under the Act to provide for VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions reductions of at least 15 percent by 1996, and section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 182(c)(2)(B) requires an additional 9 percent emissions reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every three years after 1996. Each of these sections contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detailed instructions for calculating the creditability of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions. Sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA does not believe that these progress requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are applicable to its FIP obligation, EPA has concluded that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wise policy to achieve some degree of progress during the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding the attainment dates. As a result, the FIPs do establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incremental reduction targets for the purpose of ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment by the applicable attainment date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, the State of California has become delinquent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting a few requirements in the new Act, thereby giving rise to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new EPA FIPs obligations under the new Act's deadlines. FIPs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address these deficiencies, which primarily involve submissions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RACT catch-ups and emission statements, are not yet due. EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address these FIPs in separate rulemakings as they become due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. FIPs may use new provisions providing additional flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since EPA has concluded that the new law applies to its FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation, EPA may avail itself of new provisions of the law that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnish additional flexibility in designing implementation plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ninth Circuit in its opinion recognized that EPA could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take advantage of increased flexibility in the new Act. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Court noted that EPA now has authority under new section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 182(e)(5) to approve some parts of the South Coast ozone SIP that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it had disapproved in 1988.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coalition for Clean Air, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  971 F. 2d at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 226. Similarly, as explained below, EPA believes it may invoke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 182(e)(5) in designing its FIP to obtain greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility to anticipate new control techniques or the improvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of existing techniques. To the extent that EPA invokes such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretionary provisions of the new Act, it will satisfy any new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prerequisites prescribed in those sections. For example, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained below, in order for EPA's FIP to obtain the benefit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the latitude granted by section 182(e)(5) to rely on measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipating improvements in technology, the FIP must address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress requirements of that section which otherwise would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been inapplicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in more detail below, EPA in its FIPs is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying the new law's classifications for each ozone nonattainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, and, for Sacramento, the provision for ``bumping'' up an area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a new classification. As with section 182(e)(5), where EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relies on a new provision for added flexibility, it intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfill any conditions imposed on the exercise of that authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that its FIPs must weave a complicated path  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the old and new laws, and that its FIP obligation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily a hybrid of old and new. This complexity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unavoidable, however, because of the anomalous nature of the task  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA faces: EPA must cure a failure under an old Act, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repealed, but administer the cure under new law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

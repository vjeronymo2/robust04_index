According to the study Iniden conducts every month, the  figures give obvious evidence of Shining Path's weakening  condition.    The report says that the main reasons behind this weakening  are the constant deployment of security forces and the outburst  of violence in September, the first anniversary of Abimael  Guzman Reinoso's capture.    There were 19 deaths as the result of terrorist actions  during November, while in October there were 70 victims.    This means that deaths due to terrorism dropped by 85  percent. Most incidents occurred in Lima, Ancash, and Huanuco  Departments.    A total of 478 individuals lost their lives as a result of  the political violence in the country during the year.    The collapse of Shining Path terrorism is visible in the  Upper Huallaga region (San Martin-Huanuco). In that region 202  of President "Gonzalo's" followers recently surrendered under  the terms of the Repentance Law.    Iniden reports that last month the police captured 240  alleged terrorists who were later sent to the appropriate police  departments for further investigation. A considerable number of  terrorists were sent to Lima and other regional jails.    It is estimated that there are 600,000 displaced people  throughout the country. In Ayacucho, 52,500 families left their  homes and lands as a result of terrorist violence; in Junin  17,000 families had to leave their homes; in Huancavelica 14,500  families left the region; and in Apurimac 13,000 moved out for  the same reason.    A good number of these families have begun to return to  their  lands as a result of the decreasing level of violence.</p>

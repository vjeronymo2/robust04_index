			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (5): EC Commission sweeps away fog of confusion - To consumer groups' chagrin, manufacturers' commercial polices were not criticised / Pricing IN July the EC Commission blew away another big patch of the fog of confusion and suspicion which has long surrounded manufacturers' new car pricing structures within the EC, writes John Griffiths. It did so by requiring manufacturers to publish their first pan-European price lists, showing what similar models cost in individual EC states. The Commission's declared aim in causing the lists to be published - at six-monthly intervals and with the next to be based on November 1 prices - is to 'improve price transparency' for consumers wanting to shop around the EC for the best bargains available. For consumer groups which had long claimed that prices in some countries, notably the UK, were too high, the first list - and the Commission's comments on it - did not quite vindicate their stance. The list showed that some big differentials do exist. However, while there were isolated cases of variations of more than 40 per cent, most were either within or not far outside the EC's own guidelines. These state that maximum price differentials should not vary by more than 18 per cent in the short term and by more than 12 per cent over a longer period. To the consumer groups' chagrin, the Commission identified exchange rate fluctuations as being a big factor in the divergences and refrained from criticising manufacturers' commercial policies. A principal contention of consumer organisations within the EC is that the motor industry is using its restricted distribution system - employing exclusively franchised dealers - to stifle competition. They claim that the system keeps prices higher than they would be in the case of a retailing 'free-for-all' in which cars were available from almost any retailing outfit wishing to sell them, as is the case with white or brown goods. The motor trade and industry, which argues strongly that the complexity and safety aspects of cars require a specialised sales and service system, is allowed to operate its exclusive dealer systems under a specific block exemption from normal Treaty of Rome competition rules. However, its current exemption from the rules expires in June 1995 and the Commission has indicated that, after making due allowance for exchange rate changes, it does expect to see its guidelines more strictly observed if the industry wants the exemption renewed. For that reason, in many ways the second list in November will be more important than the first list in providing the first clear-cut figures on price differential trends. The first list reflected prices, as of May 1, of 55 European and 17 Japanese models. They were - and will continue to be - based on recommended retail prices, adjusted for equipment differences and given in local currencies both before and after tax. Supplements for options such as air conditioning and power steering are given, as well as the premium for right-hand-drive models for the UK market. An index of differentials is arrived at by converting local currency prices into European Currency Units (see chart). Among small cars, variations of up to 24 per cent were found - in the case of Fiat's Cincequento - between the most expensive market, France, and the cheapest, Spain. In the large saloon category, Ford's new Mondeo 1.6LX saloon was found to be 23.9 per cent more expensive in Germany than in Italy and Ireland, the cheapest markets. At the executive car level, BMW's biggest variation was of 22 per cent, in the case of its 730i V8 model, in France, with the UK being the cheapest. Overall, the lists showed that for 92 per cent of mini cars on the list, such as Fiat's Cinquecento, price disparities were less than 20 per cent. The differential was less than 20 per cent for 89 per cent of medium-sized family cars and 89 per cent of luxury cars. In all other market sectors except 'people carriers', four-wheel-drives and sports cars (collectively averaging 69 per cent), about four-fifths fell below the 20 per cent differential level. As regards consumer group claims that UK prices are particularly high compared with leading continental European markets, the price lists showed it to be an expensive market on some small cars, middling for many family cars - and often the cheapest market for luxury cars. Almost certainly, the Commission will find a further degree of convergence. Manufacturers and importers have, for example, been pushing down retail list prices in the UK. The fact that the lower 'official' prices of themselves will have done virtually nothing to change actual transaction prices will not prevent the EC 'convergence' figures looking better. The cuts have been achieved mainly by reducing dealers' official margins,from a typical 15-17 per cent to 10 per cent. Because it is has been almost a matter of routine for dealers to give discounts of 10 per cent or more, the only real effect is to reduce their scope for discounting. In some cases, however, the downward pressure on list prices is real. Volkswagen, for example, is determined to capture a larger share of the UK market, having this year taken over UK distribution from Lonrho. To help do so it has cut 11 per cent from the prices of diesel models; substantially more than the 5 per cent reduction on its dealers' margins. And Ford, with its traditional UK market leadership now under strong challenge, was obliged by market pressure to cut prices of its Mondeo model by a real 6 per cent - the dealers' margin was already only 10 per cent - only two weeks after its launch. Not surprisingly, the European industry has sought to make political capital out of the Commission's acknowledgment of the big role played by currency movements. What has been demonstrated conclusively, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), is that it is unrealistic to make meaningful price comparisons - let alone have 'harmonised' prices - when some currencies have been so volatile. Between July last year and the middle of May, the main EMS currencies - German, French, Belgian, Dutch and Danish - rose 22 per cent against the lira (briefly touching 32 per cent in April), 20 per cent against the peseta, 17 per cent against sterling and 15 per cent against the Portuguese escudo. 'Manufacturers - particularly non-local manufacturers - cannot be expected to make instant double-digit price changes,' the ACEA contended. The price lists themselves have a lot of inbuilt compromises. They do not take account of the widely varying discounts available in individual markets. And while excluding Denmark and Greece, because local taxation - of more than 100 per cent - is seen as excessively depressing pre-tax prices, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal are included even though national taxation in each can add 50 per cent to the cost of a new car. In these countries, too, manufacturers have a strong incentive to keep pre-tax prices down in order for tax-inclusive prices not to be beyond the reach of ordinary consumers. The Commission implicitly has accepted that such tax regimes in themselves are an undesirable obstacle to the convergence it is seeking from manufacturers. It has indicated that it will put pressure on the governments involved to reduce such distortions. But if such governments are feeling such pressure, there is as yet no visible sign.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             EC EUROPE RETAIL PRICE COMPARISON AS AT MAY 1ST 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Belgium  Germany   Spain    France   Italy  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiat Cinquecento 900           111      126      100       124     103 Renault Clio RL 1.2            117      124      102       120     100 Opel Corsa 1.4 3dr             119      133      101       122     101 Ford Fiesta 1.1CLX             120      129      107       126     100 VW Polo Fox                    125      147      112       131     100 Nissan Micra 3dr               110      115      100       113     102 VW Golf CL 60PS 5dr            120      122      113       118 Opel Astra 1.4 5dr             116      124      108       116     101 Nissan Sunny 1.4LX 4dr         102      109        -       102       - Opel Vectra 1.6 4dr            126      132      118       122     111 Ford Mondeo 1.6CLX             118      124      102       112     100 Honda Accord 2.0LS 4dr         110      109      109         -     102 Audi 80 115PS                  116      124      114       127     100 BMW 316i 4dr                   106      111      105       113     100 Mercedes 200E                  108      106      110       105     100 BMW 730i V8                    116      120      115       122     111  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Eire      Lux    Nethlds   Portugal   UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiat Cinquecento                 -      108      116       114     116 Renault Clio RL 1.2            113      117      118       102     116 Opel Corsa 1.4 3dr             105      119      121       100     124 Ford Fiesta 1.1CLX             112      120      123       112     122 VW Polo Fox                    138      128      146       132     135 Nissan Micra 3dr               110      110      107       109     107 VW Golf CL 60PS 5dr            117      115      118       115     132 Opel Astra 1.4 5dr             103      115      116       100     115 Nissan Sunny 1.4LX 4dr         100      102      100       106     112 Opel Vectra 1.6 4dr            113      126      123       100     118 Ford Mondeo 1.6CLX             100      118      108       109     104 Honda Accord 2.0LS 4dr           -      110      100         -     108 Audi 80 115PS                  125      116      120         -     115 BMW 316i 4dr                   102      111      110       117     106 Mercedes 200E                  101      111      106       115     100 BMW 730i V8                    111      116      119         -     100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AID Chart 93/36 Prices Indexed - lowest cost market = 100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EC Commission  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS SCORE LAST 6 GOALS, ROUT CRUNCH  </P> <P> When the Sockers' goal-scorers begin playing defense, the team usually begins a  string of victories.  </P> <P> "And that usually doesn't start until the playoff," says Ron Newman, the  Sockers' coach.  </P> <P> It started early this year. In fact, it started midway through the second  period of Thursday night's game against the Cleveland Crunch and led to a 9-4  Major Indoor Soccer League victory.  </P> <P> The Sockers evened their record at 8-8 and moved to within 1 1/2 games of MISL  West leader Dallas, which suffered a 5-1 loss at home to Baltimore Thursday  night.  </P> <P> "It was a very strange game," Newman said. "I put a very offensive team out  there, and talking to the players before the game, we knew we could put the  ball in the back of the net. We just didn't know if we could defend enough."  </P> <P> After the first quarter, it didn't look as though the Sockers could defend at  all. Cleveland led, 4-3.  </P> <P> But they regrouped and scored the game's final six goals. Zoran Karic and Cacho  each scored two.  </P> <P> Cacho started the string 2:31 into the second quarter, and 10 minutes later,  Waad Hirmez scored to put the Sockers ahead for good, 5-4. It was Hirmez's  eighth goal of the year and fourth game-winner, tying him for the league lead  with Chico Borja of Wichita and Billy Ronson of Baltimore.  </P> <P> There were no big heroes on defense, Newman said.  </P> <P> "We just worked a lot harder from top to bottom (of our roster) to keep their  players from getting the ball," he said. "When we do that, that's when we look  good."  </P> <P> In fact, Kevin Crow, last year's MISL defender of the year, did not get a block  for his second consecutive game and is still four short of becoming only the  third player in league history to reach the 600 level. But Brian Quinn, a  midfielder, had three.  </P> <P> Branko Segota had three assists to tie Juli Veee as the Sockers' all-time  points leader with 467.  </P> <P> Goalie Victor Nogueira improved to 4-4, though he had a season-low seven saves.  </P> <P> The Sockers continue their trip Saturday night at Eastern Division leader  Baltimore.  </P></p>

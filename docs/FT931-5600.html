			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Fund managers 'beat markets' THE AVERAGE UK pension fund manager outperformed the domestic equity markets last year, half of them by one percentage point or more, according to the WM Company, a pension fund performance measurement service. The average fund in the WM survey earned 20.8 per cent on UK equities investments, the best performance for more than a decade. Meanwhile the FT-A All Share Index rose 20.4 per cent last year. The WM survey measured the performance of 2,500 pension funds with a combined market value of Pounds 285bn. Mr Peter Worrington, marketing director of WM, said that much of the outperformance comes from UK fund managers underweighting in the shares of Wellcome Plc, whose share prices are fully reflected in the FT-A Index but only half of whose shares are actually available in the market. UK fund managers also earned returns which outstripped stock market indices in north America, continental Europe and Japan for the first time. Typically, UK fund managers have underperformed in foreign markets by some margin. Of all categories of assets, overseas bonds outperformed all others in 1992, returning 29.1 per cent over the year. Mr Worrington noted that the shift into overseas bonds started only 18 months ago and that this category now accounted for 4 per cent of the assets of the average fund. Much of the expansion into overseas bonds has occurred at the expense of domestic bonds and about a quarter of all funds surveyed held no UK bonds.</p>

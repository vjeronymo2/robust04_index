			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: IBM to sell remaining interest in Rolm SIEMENS, the German electronics company, has agreed to acquire International Business Machines' 50 per cent interest in Rolm Company, the marketing and services arm of Rolm Systems, a California telecommunications equipment manufacturer. In 1989, IBM sold Rolm's manufacturing operations to Siemens but retained 50 per cent ownership of the marketing and service operation, which became a separate company. With IBM's exit, the two Rolm companies will now be consolidated, Siemens said. The sale reflects IBM's recent determination to focus its efforts on its own areas of expertise, while forming strategic partnerships with outside companies to gain access to related technologies. This is in sharp contrast to the expansionary mood in 1984, when IBM acquired Rolm, a pioneer in the market for private branch exchange equipment. At the time, the acquisition was hailed as the beginning of a broad merger of the telecommunications and computer markets that could result in IBM competing head to head with telecommunications giants such as AT&amp;T. In the event, Rolm failed to live up to IBM's expectations and slumped into losses. IBM, which paid Dollars 1.5bn to acquire the company and spent an estimated Dollars 1bn to support its losses and development costs, sold most of its interest in Rolm to Siemens for Dollars 1.15bn, three years ago. Yesterday, terms of the sale of IBM's remaining interest in Rolm Company were not disclosed. IBM and Siemens said the two companies would continue to maintain 'close, co-operative development and marketing efforts'. 'While this announcement represents a change in ownership, it does not affect the excellent relationship we have with IBM,' said Mr Peter Pribilla, president and chief executive officer of Rolm. 'Co-operative development efforts through the IBM/Siemens technical operating committee will continue to play an important role in our relationship.' In France, IBM and Siemens are co-operating in the manufacture and development of semiconductor memory chips. Siemens said Rolm will in future operate under a single-management structure and join Tel Plus Communications as part of Siemens' Private Communication Systems division.</p>

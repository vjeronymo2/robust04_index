			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum Program Length  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations would also add requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the minimum length of an eligible program. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 481(b) of the HEA, a proprietary institution of higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education or a postsecondary vocational institution must, to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible, provide an eligible program, as defined in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 481(e) of the HEA. Proposed &sect;668.8(d) would implement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition. The proposed definition would supplant the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory definition of a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> six-month training program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in 34 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 600.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 481(e) of the HEA provides for three types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible programs. The first type of eligible program is one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that must provide at least 600 clock hours, 16 semester or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trimester hours or 24 quarter hours of instruction offered during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a minimum of 15 weeks. The program must provide undergraduate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training that prepares a student for gainful employment in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized occupation. The program may admit as regular students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons who have not completed the equivalent of an associate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second type of eligible program is one that must provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 300 clock hours, 8 semester hours, or 12 quarter hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of instruction offered during a minimum of 10 weeks. The program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must provide training that prepares a student for gainful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment in a recognized occupation and be a graduate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional program or admit as regular students only persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who have completed the equivalent of an associate degree. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first time, this type of program may qualify for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all Title IV, HEA programs, not just the FFEL programs, as under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third type of eligible program would qualify for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL programs only. It must provide at least 300 but less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 600 clock hours of instruction offered during a minimum of 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks. The program must provide undergraduate training that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepares a student for gainful employment in a recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupation, and admit as regular students some persons who have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not completed the equivalent of an associate degree. This type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of program must also satisfy regulations of the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing placement rates, completion rates, and other criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These rates and criteria are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Qualitative Factors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 481(e)(2) of the HEA requires the third type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible program to have a verified completion rate of at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 70 percent and a verified placement rate of at least 70 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with the Secretary's regulations and to meet other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria specified by the Secretary in regulations. Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.8(e) would implement these provisions. Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.8(e)(2) would require an institution to substantiate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation of its completion and placement rates by having its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent auditor who prepares its compliance audit report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under &sect;668.23 verify the accuracy of the calculations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that the auditor's assurance of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations would be a reliable independent substantiation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary also believes it is practical for an auditor to check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this information, inasmuch as he or she is already on site to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform the institution's required compliance audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.8 would include formulas in paragraphs (f) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) for calculating the appropriate completion and placement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates. The Secretary believes a single methodology is desired,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and invites comments in this area. The Secretary notes that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM implementing the Student Right-to-Know provisions in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 485(a) of the HEA, which addressed the calculation of completion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or graduation rates, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 10, 1992 (57 FR 30826). The Secretary will be publishing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second NPRM for implementation of the Student Right-to-Know  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions shortly after publication of this NPRM to further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address this calculation. The Secretary would also like to know  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if any proposals relative to the Student Right-to-Know Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding graduation and completion rate calculations should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used instead of the methods proposed here. The proposed formulas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be based on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Award Year <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All calculations would be based on enrollments, completions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and placements during an award year. Thus, an applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion or placement rate would be the rate as it existed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of a particular award year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Calculation of Completion Rate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) An institution would base its calculation on the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of regular students who were enrolled in the program during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award year. The rate calculation is based on regular students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because those students by definition intend to complete a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. The Secretary believes that inclusion of other students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not provide an accurate picture of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The institution would subtract from the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular students the number of those students who, during that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award year, withdrew from, dropped out of, or were expelled from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program and were entitled to and actually received in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely manner in accordance with &sect;668.22(i)(3) a refund of 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of their tuition and fees (less any permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative fee) under the institution's refund policy. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that the inclusion of students who have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received a 100 percent refund at an institution would unduly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalize the institution because these students would not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participated in the academic component of an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. These students are excluded from the calculation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because there would not be a loss of Title IV, HEA program funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Department of Education if the institution has refunded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all tuition and fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The institution would subtract the number of students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who were enrolled in the program at the end of that award year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The institution would determine the number of regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who, during that award year, received the degree,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate or other recognized education credential awarded for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successfully completing the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

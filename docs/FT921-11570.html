			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: France announces FFr5bn in export credits to Kuwait FRANCE is to grant Kuwait FFr5bn (Pounds 510m) worth of export credits to boost trade between the two countries, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, said yesterday. Mr Beregovoy, speaking at the end of a two-day visit to the emirate, said France had agreed to allow the Kuwaitis to set up an investment company in France to help channel more of its money into the French economy. He gave no further details about the new company. Kuwaiti nationals would be exempt from a French wealth tax to boost private investment in France in a similar concession already granted to Saudi nationals, he said. Mr Beregovoy said Kuwait had invested FFr8bn in France but that this was not enough.</p>

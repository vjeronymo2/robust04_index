			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> LEONARDO TRIO IN SOUTHLAND DEBUT AT SUNNY HILLS CENTER  </P> <P> Chamber ensembles, like fine wines, generally require a certain maturation  before their full potential comes to fruition. At the tender musical age of  five years, the Leonardo Trio not only bestows sweet pleasure but hints at even  more delectable music-making in years to come.  </P> <P> Frank Martin's rarely heard "Trio on Irish Folk Tunes" opened the group's  Southland debut concert Sunday at the Sunny Hills Performing Art Center.  Whether the piece was programmed in honor of the Swiss composer's centennial or  not, the group convincingly captured the requisite flavor of the title without  short-changing the nuances inherent in the 1924 work.  </P> <P> Even when it came to familiar composers, the Leonardo chose musical roads less  taken: for Beethoven, not the "Archduke" or "Ghost" trios, but Opus 70, No. 2  in E-flat. Its four movements (all in moderate to quick tempos) emerged  dominated by the least likely characteristic associated with the composer's  music: unabashed lyricism.  </P> <P> Despite a Baldwin piano that stubbornly refused to produce any songful sounds  in its upper register, Cameron Grant compensated with discreet pedaling and  subtle voicing. Cellist Jonathan Spitz displayed nothing but the richest tone  in all registers, particularly burnished in the lower range. And if an  occasional thinness of sound blemished the violin artistry of Erica  Kiesewetter, her gift for persuasively blending with her colleagues proved the  more lasting impression.  </P> <P> Only judiciously gauged tempos will allow this work to make a cohesive whole,  and it was here the ensemble revealed a special quality. By turns dance-like in  the first movement, relaxed in the second, tender in the third and  full-throttle in the finale, the trio took full measure of the piece and  consistently supplied sensitive touches to motivic details.  </P> <P> But in Mendelssohn's Trio in C-minor, the group failed to convey such a  consistently rarefied atmosphere. Certainly the composer's instructions  regarding energico and con fuoco were never in short supply, and the Scherzo  provided the mercurial element one expects; yet, in the end, the whole was not  greater than the sum of its parts.  </P> <P> The capacity audience received one encore: a vivacious romp through the  "Pantoum" movement of Ravel's Trio in A minor.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Saul Sanchez; from the "Upon Awakening" newscast; </F> passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] Socorro Diaz Palacios, deputy government secretary,  stated yesterday the government has information on the identity  of the individuals leading the armed group operating in Chiapas  State.    [Diaz] "Concerning the Mexicans, some are activists  connected  to guerrilla groups dismantled in the 1970's."    Commenting on leaders who are foreigners, she said they may  have gotten experience on guerrilla warfare in countries south  of Mexico. Diaz said the capture of individuals who come from  that region and their level of training lead to that suggestion,  saying that a Nicaraguan and, apparently, a Guatemalan are under  arrest.    [Diaz] "The aggressor armed group has received the support  of certain ideologues and clergymen from different denominations  that act on their own. They have organized cadres and the  interiors of their villages, allowing them to go from convincing  rural residents to recruiting and training them subsequently in  subversive and terrorist practices." Diaz reported that  summoning orders are being issued for people allegedly tied to  these criminal activities. She added that the armed group has  15 training centers; six of them are located in Las Margaritas,  five in Ocosingo, two in Sabanilla, one in Altamirano, and one  in Chanal.    [Diaz] "They have regulations and internal discipline, as  well as different instruction handbooks covering the use of  weapons, planning of attacks, combat strategies, security and  communications systems, and disciplinary measures. Procup  [Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party]  literature was found in their camps, which they support by  distributing its publications."    The rebels accompany their methods to recruit personnel with  threats to the effect that they will take away properties or  expel from the community those who are reluctant to join  criminal activities. The official said there were instances in  which children were kidnapped to induce their parents to join  the guerrillas.    [Diaz] "Co-opted or pressured groups devote their efforts to  the building of training centers. These families prepare food  to meet the needs of this radical and violent group."    She added that, based on the information that exists, it is  believed there are three kinds of operation bases.    [Diaz] "They are located in inaccessible terrain, hidden by  foliage. Reaching those sites requires walking three or four  hours on partly exposed paths in areas densely vegetated."    Militants have been strategically deployed to penetrate all  of southern Chiapas. When they take control over a region,  municipal, productive, and educational activities are neglected.    [Diaz] "The so-called militia or militant squads operate as  a  paramilitary apparatus. Each squad consists of one sergeant,  one corporal, one radio operator, one health provider, and 20  militants." These rebels possess .22-caliber rifles, 5.56-mm  AR-15 rifles, .30-caliber M-1 carbines, and different kinds of  shotguns, pistols, and revolvers. These weapons are  manufactured in the United States, the United Kingdom, and  Russia, and especially used by guerrilla units. Diaz said they  are operating with sophisticated radio communications equipments.    [Diaz] "Their radio communications equipment has between 23  to 40 transceiver channels, and they operate from 2400 to 0600."  The official said it has been possible to detect part of their  key code and record transmissions.    [Diaz] "The transmissions base station from the subversive  general garrison goes by the identification code name of Cicara,  which apparently stands for the so-called El Caracol Instruction  Center [Centro de Instruccion El Caracol], located in the town  by that same name of Las Margaritas."    The deputy government secretary said although social demands  have been met, the subversive groups' operations have increased,  adding that last year on three occasions Mexican authorities  learned that aggressor groups were preparing violent actions.  She acknowledged that authorities acted with unusual calm and  flexibility. Diaz read a 28-page report prepared with  information supplied by the National Defense Secretariat and the  Attorney General's Office.    [Diaz] "The so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army is  an  extremist, violent, professional, and well-trained organization;  its profile is highly ideological and uses a language that is  characteristic of extremist guidelines."</p>

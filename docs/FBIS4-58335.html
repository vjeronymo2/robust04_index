			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Reinhold Schenk, German ambassador to Iran, </F> by unidentified HAMSHAHRI correspondent in Tehran "on the eve of  Tehran Mayor Karbaschi's visit to Germany"; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [HAMSHAHRI] Why is it that  Germany, with its highly developed economy and resources, finds  it so difficult to accommodate foreign refugees while we have  sheltered several million and have not encountered any racial  problems? Does affluent Germany not have our level of economic  and cultural prowess?    [Schenk] There are various beliefs prevailing in Germany.  One school of thought is that we should forge ahead as a  multicultural society, and that is why we should accept those  who are in Germany into our society. We can give them German or  dual nationality; and steps have been taken in this regard.    There are others who believe that we have a long way to go  to  a multicultural or multinational society. However our policy is  to seek a middle course. We have accepted the foreigners who  have resided in Germany for many years and we have bestowed  legal rights on them. [passage omitted]    [HAMSHAHRI] Has Germany made any effort--as it should--to  boost cooperation with Iran?    [Schenk] Under its First 5-Year Plan, Iran cooperated  extensively with Germany. I should state that the credit  envisaged for Iran, and the insurance that had been approved by  the Hermes Insurance Company is the third highest after Russia  and Brazil. Iran, where Germany has accepted a guarantee of 14  billion German marks, is in third place.    I believe we do have quite extensive mutual cooperation. At  present, talks are under way regarding repayments and extending  the reimbursement period. The main issue in these talks is to  extend the period for repayment of short-term loans. There are  no particular problems with regard to the repayment of long-term  loans.    Cultural exchanges are also in progress. For example, the  third Iran-Germany session on human rights under Islam and the  West will be held in Iran next spring. Larijani's visit to  Germany was very successful. He has much credibility as far as  we are concerned and is an articulate person. He met some old  acquaintances in the course of his visit, such as Hans  Dietrich-Genscher, whom he knows very well. Talks were held  with Larijani on all bilateral issues. In addition, regional  issues, and matters pertaining to Central Asia, the Persian  Gulf, and the Arab-Israeli issue were discussed, in addition to  an extensive range of other issues.    [HAMSHAHRI] Regarding the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,  some people believe that Germany's swift recognition of Croatia  and Slovenia aggravated civil strife in Yugoslavia. In  addition, what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not  concealed from the eyes of the Germans. Has Germany, with its  80 million people and such a high level of economic potential  [preceding word in English] performed its human obligations to  the optimum?    [Schenk] The present situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not  just a source of shame for Germany but the whole world. Germany  has extended humanitarian assistance so far; we are among the  biggest helpers of Bosnia-Herzegovina. From the legal point of  view, it is not possible for us to intervene militarily in  accordance with our Constitution. As far as intervening under  the NATO aegis is concerned, that depends on the Security  Council.    However, terminating the conflict by military means seems  almost impossible. That is why we and other Europeans are  seeking to end the conflict by political means. Some useful  measures have been taken in this regard.    [HAMSHAHRI] Do you have any particular opinion you wish to  express?    [Schenk] I think it is possible to live a comfortable life  in Iran. Tehran is a progressive city and one can live here  safely. Foreigners are residing here happily. Tehran is a very  clean city with far more security than many capitals of the  world and is teeming with life.</p>

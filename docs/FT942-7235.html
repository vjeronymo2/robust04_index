			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Bankers Trust withdraws Dollars 100m credit to Austrian bank Bankers Trust of New York and five other international banks have withdrawn credit lines from Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft (Bawag), a leading Austrian bank under investigation for irregular offshore investment practices. Bankers Trust said it withdrew a Dollars 100m line of credit from Bawag last week because it was uncomfortable with the bank's dealings with a Bermuda-based hedge fund operation run by Mr Wolfgang Flottl, the son of Bawag's chief executive, Mr Walter Flottl. The credit line was used to cover Bankers Trust's exposure in its foreign exchange trades with Bawag. Meanwhile, a confidential interim report by investigators from the Austrian National Bank named five other international banks - Credit Lyonnais and Paribas of France, Commerzbank and BHF of Germany and Republic National Bank of New York - as having withdrawn credit lines from Bawag. Austrian news magazines revealed last month that Mr Walter Flottl had secretly directed up to Sch22.9bn (Pounds 1.3bn) more than a tenth of the bank's total balance sheet, to offshore investment companies controlled by his son. The bank, which had been carrying out these operations for more than six years, subsequently repatriated the entire amount. Mr Tom Parisi, head of public relations at Bankers Trust, said that in spite of the repatriation, 'we felt that the credit profile of the bank had been adversely affected by this exposure to the hedge fund'. Noting that Bawag's executive committee had not been fully informed of the loans to companies run by Mr Flottl's son, and that a large part of Bawag's earnings seemed to have been derived from this activity, Mr Parisi said: 'We just didn't like the smell of it.' The Austrian central bank investigators concluded that the liquidity of the bank left 'no grounds for concern', but they could not yet confirm 'whether Bawag has any further financial obligations resulting from these credit transactions'.

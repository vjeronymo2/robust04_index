			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Seeking better health for less money: Some countries spend twice as much on medicine as others, to no effect THANKS TO vast discrepancies in the amount spent on pharmaceuticals, some European governments are spending twice as much on medicines per capita than others without achieving improvements in their relative life expectancies. Prescription medicine sales through pharmacies during the first six months of this year were only Dollars 46 (Pounds 30.40) a head in Britain. That compared with Dollars 108 in France and Dollars 78 in Germany, Italy and Belgium, according to figures compiled by IMS International, the market research group, and the Financial Times. The discrepancies in per capita spending were not caused by differing prices for patented drugs. Prices for drugs in France are among the lowest in Europe, while those in the UK are among the highest. Nor are they caused by significant differences in the incidence of diseases or the age structure of the populations. Rather, the main differences in spending between European countries are caused by variations in the volume and type of drugs prescribed. These variations in prescribing are huge. French doctors prescribe five times as many items as British doctors and six times as many as their Danish counterparts, according to a recent study by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. Similarly, the differences between EC nations' drug spending for therapeutic areas are striking. France spent Dollars 27 a head on cardiovascular drugs during the first six months this year, compared with Dollars 19 in Germany, Dollars 17 in Italy and Dollars 8 in the UK, even though the UK has one of the highest rates of heart disease in the world. For asthma, France spent Dollars 13 per head, compared with Dollars 10 in Belgium, Dollars 9 in Italy, Dollars 8 in Spain, Dollars 5 in Germany and Dollars 3 in the UK. Moreover, many of the drugs prescribed in high-volume markets such as France and Italy are of little proven efficacy. A recent Italian survey estimated 10 of the top 50 products sold in that country offered no therapeutic benefit. The study rated a similar number of France's top 50 as useless, compared with six in Germany and none in the UK. All but four of the top 50 products in the UK were internationally recognised as effective. Many of these useless medicines are produced only on a national basis and offer at best symptomatic relief. Take the market for asthma, for example. France spends four times as much on respiratory drugs as the UK, according to IMS. But one leading asthma treatment group reckons the unproven palliative treatments and cough remedies commonly prescribed in France for asthma should be excluded from data. Once this is done, the UK market is actually larger than the French, worth Pounds 341m compared with Pounds 131m. The UK's National Health Service drugs bill is kept down through government measures such as doctors' indicative budgets, prescribing lower doses of products such as antibiotics, and widespread use of cheap, off-patent generic medicines. Zeneca, the UK pharmaceuticals group, estimates that 72 per cent of British prescriptions for its former top-selling product, the heart-drug Tenormin, are given to patients as cheap generic versions. That compares with 1.6 per cent in France and almost none in Italy. Admittedly, comparisons between the UK and continental countries may not be entirely fair. The UK may well be underspending on medicines. The UK's drugs bill is also kept low by extremely poor take-up of expensive, innovative medicines which could be of benefit to patients. This is partly because of British doctors' conservative prescribing habits. Glaxo, the world market-leader in anti-ulcer treatments, estimates recent treatments known as proton-pump inhibitors make up only 25 per cent of the UK anti-ulcer market, compared with 50 per cent of the French market. Similarly, the low spending by the UK on cardiovascular medicines is partly because of the poor uptake of cholesterol-lowering drugs. A recent survey by Merck of the US showed that only 17 per cent of UK patients visiting doctors had had a cholesterol test and of these only 1 per cent were given cholesterol-reducing drugs. That compared with 65 per cent of French patients, of whom 17 per cent were treated with medicines. For all the discrepancies among prescribing in EC countries, there appears to be little correlation between drug consumption and life expectancy. This is broadly true for all medical expenditure, although there may be different class distributions concealed by the average figures. Life expectancy at birth for males in France, the country with the highest per capita spending on medicines, is 73 years, compared with 73.5 years in Italy, 73.2 in the UK, the nation with the lowest spending, and 72.6 in Germany. Meanwhile, Germany and Italy have introduced measures this year to limit spending on drugs through eliminating non-effective medicines.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        THE USELESS DRUG LEAGUE                 A=effective B=second-line C=useless*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Top 25 products       Top 50 products                  by value of sales     by value of sales                   A      B       C      A      B       C  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Italy            11      7       7     25     15      10 France           16      4       5     26     14      10 Germany          19      5       1     35      9       6 UK               24      1       0     46      4       0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *A: therapeutically effective on basis of international literature.

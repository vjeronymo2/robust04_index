			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Letter: How to help industry without cutting rates Sir, The impression that nothing can be done to help British industry until interest rates fall is astonishing - the more so now that interest rates might even be increased. Let us initially assume that the public sector borrowing requirement must not increase. The government should raise public spending in a manner which maximises domestic output and employment per pound spent as soon as possible. Public spending in any event tends to have a relatively low import content, so that less leaks into the stimulation of foreign output than is the case with personal consumption. Simultaneously, it should declare that taxes will be increased from next year - other than those which would raise business costs; the additional revenue would be partly at the expense of reduced personal savings but mainly at the expense of reduced consumption - which has a relatively high import content. The aim would be to ensure a balanced budget increase (that is, a fiscally neutral one) over the coming 18 months - or longer. The net effect would be a stimulation of domestic output. One might even drop the assumption or requirement of fiscal neutrality and go for a straight increase in public spending without a wholly offsetting increase in revenue, but for a limited period.

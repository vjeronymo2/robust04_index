			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yun He: "Modern Farm Techniques Promoted"] </F>   [Text] China is encouraging farmers to adopt four crucial  production techniques this year.    The techniques can help meet the government's 1994 target of  3.5 percent growth in agricultural output, the Ministry of  Agriculture said.    The techniques involve applying fertilizers to the subsoil,  improving crop seeds, controlling bollworms and preventing  diseases among prawn and livestock, and processing feed with  straw and stalks.    Vice-Minister Hong Fuzen said the ministry is expecting  foreign investors to bring advanced management skills and  equipment to help spread this technology.    Hong said that at least two new generations of crop seeds  should be developed during the rest of this century to push up  farm production.    By the year 2000, he said, better seeds should account for  at  least 40 percent of the annual increases in agricultural output.    In the use of fertilizer, the central government will strive  toward three major targets during the next five years:    --By 1998, subsoil fertilizer should be used on 66 million  hectares of farmland, or 60 percent of China's grain acreage.    Hong said that only 12 million hectares are now fertilized  by  machine, adding that the figure is expected to rise to 46.7  million hectares by 1998.    --The technology for applying nitrogenous fertilizer should  spread across the countryside, and 40 percent of fertilized  farmland is to be treated in this way.    --By effectively using fertilizer, the per hectare yield of  wheat is expected to increase by 300 kilograms; of maize, by 375  kilograms; of soybean, by 225 kilograms; and cotton, by 225  kilograms.    With advanced technology, farmers are also expected to  reduce  their use of fertilizer by 180 kilograms per hectare by 1998,  Hong said.    He reiterated that another crucial task is the vigorous  development of pesticides to prevent animal and shrimp diseases  and wipe out bollworms, both of which brought disaster to  farmers last year.    In three to five years, Hong said, another 141 model  counties  will be designated to play leading roles in the development of  feed-processing technology using straw and stalks, providing a  stimulus to animal husbandry. At present, the country has 59  model counties.</p>

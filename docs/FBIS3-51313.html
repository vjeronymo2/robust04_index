He  accused Lula of not having a consistent program for Brazil. The  minister believes Lula will not achieve the presidency and  warned that a PT government "would ruin many good things," as  happened in the [former President Fernando] Collor government.    "I cannot see Lula's proposal. What kind of model does the  PT want for Brazil? Everything is very confusing, very  ambiguous. Is it going to be a big Nicaragua? A Cuba? There  is nothing," the minister said.    Cardoso made his attack against Lula on the night of 15  January when, after distributing food to those suffering from  the drought in the interior of Pernambuco State, he continued  with his agenda as a candidate with the recording of a radio  program. The minister tried to indicate that he does not fear a  confrontation with Lula, and he even minimized the PT  candidate's popularity, stressing that poll results do not have  very much significance.    Regarding the support given to Lula during the 1989  campaign,  Cardoso indicated that that was another time, and that the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] considers the PT's program  incompatible. He stated that he had decided to support Lula  only in the second round because he did not want to vote for the  right and also in view of the electorate's demands.    "It is not that Lula is an evil person. The trouble is that  he does not have a program."    Cardoso again admitted the hypothesis of running for  president and that he considers it absurd that some groups  already have given up on him as a candidate because they believe  he should remain at the head of the Finance Ministry in order to  supervise the economic stabilization program. He admitted that  at this time there is no sense in discussing candidacies; he  stressed that he is concentrating on the task of stabilizing the  economy and that he is certain he is acting responsibly.    "None of my actions have been motivated by the idea of  becoming a candidate. What I refuse to say is that I have to  reject the idea if the plan is successful. My political rights  were taken away from me by the military. Are my political  rights going to be taken away from me because I can achieve  success? I do not play with that type of demagogy," he warned.    Before participating in the radio program, the minister had  a  closed meeting with Deputies Roberto Freire (PPS [People's  Socialist Party]), Maurilio Ferreira Lima (PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party]), and Jarbas Vasconcelos (PMDB), the  mayor of Recife. The meeting served to smooth over the  disagreements, which had worsened with the attrition that led  Freire to leave the government leadership in the Chamber of  Deputies, between the minister and Freire. An alliance between  the PSDB, PMDB, and the PPS also was discussed. The minister  also took the opportunity to inform himself about the election  climate in Pernambuco, and he expressed his support for Jarbas  Vasconcelos in his bid for the state's governorship.    The minister also met with PSDB militants and once again  explained how the fight against inflation is being carried out.  At PSDB headquarters, Cardoso met a group of government  officials fired during the Collor government, and he was booed  when he reaffirmed the position of Planalto Palace regarding the  vetoing of the draft bill that guarantees the re-hiring of fired  government officials.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Lloyd's losses of Pounds 3bn forecast Lloyd's of London may report losses for 1991 of more than Pounds 3bn, Chatset, the company that monitors the insurance market, said yesterday. This figure would take total losses for the past four years to more than Pounds 8.5bn. Lloyd's is due to publish its 1991 results late next month or early in June. 'The indications must be that the overall loss will be around Pounds 3bn, and it is not inconceivable that this figure will be exceeded,' said Mr Charles Sturge, co-editor of Chatset. The company said the losses had been caused mainly by a deterioration of 'open years' such as the underwriting years of 1988, 1989 and 1990 which saw a series of natural disasters including the Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea and serious oil spills elsewhere in the world. These disasters hit the 'excess of loss' reinsurance spirals, and have led to a series of legal disputes in which Names, the individuals who back the market with their wealth, have taken action against market professionals. Chatset said that results and estimates of insurance syndicates for the 1991 underwriting year had not deteriorated and were still likely to be Pounds 1.2bn or slightly lower. 'However, very serious deterioration has taken place on the old years,' it said. It added that a survey of about 30 per cent of syndicates with open years showed an average deterioration of 28.6 per cent in 1993. If applied to the other 70 per cent, the overall deterioration for open years to be announced would be Pounds 2.1bn. Mr Sturge said: 'The old years are very unstable, and to make an accurate prediction about the 1991 result is well nigh impossible.' In February, a ballot among Lloyd's 22,000 Names rejected a Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement. Lloyd's made the offer to try to head off the wave of litigation by Names. Errors-and-omissions insurers, which cover agents against legal awards for negligence, would have provided nearly half the Pounds 900m.</p>

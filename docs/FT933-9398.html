			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The GOLD price recovered some of last week's heavy losses yesterday as Swiss and Far Eastern buyers returned the the market. It closed at the London bullion market at Dollars 382.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars 5.75, after meeting resistance at Dollars 383. Base metal markets were generally easier at the London Metal Exchange. ZINC remained under pressure following Friday's breach of the Dollars 900-a-tonne barrier for three months metal and investment fund liquidation drove the price to a fresh six-year low of Dollars 880 at one stage. The COPPER market was also lower, although nearby premiums remained. Final business for the three three months position was at Dollars 1,933 a tonne, down Dollars 12 from Friday. At the London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE futures continued Friday's retracement in early trading. But roaster buying was encountered at Dollars 1,100 a tonne for the November position, which closed Dollars 28 up on balance at Dollars 1,142 a tonne. Traders said the rise was mainly due to the absence of any aggressive selling rather than any fresh fundamental news. Attention in London continued to be focused on near September options which expire on August 18. Compiled from Reuters</p>

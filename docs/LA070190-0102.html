			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ARTISTIC GLEAM IN THE EMERALD CITY;  </P> <P> ITS FRONTIER IMAGE FADING, SEATTLE HAS BECOME ONE OF THE HOTTEST CULTURAL  CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY  </P> <P> The morning after last month's Tony ceremonies, the artistic director of the  Seattle Repertory Theatre headed home from New York with a Tony award for  Outstanding Regional Theatre. But that wasn't all Daniel Sullivan brought back  to Seattle. He also brought a couple of well-known Seattle Rep fans with him.  </P> <P> Playwrights Wendy Wasserstein and Herb Gardner -- whose Tony-winning plays "The  Heidi Chronicles" and "I'm Not Rappaport," respectively, started at the Rep --  were delighted to be enlisted by Sullivan. Both were perfectly willing to fly  to Seattle, help Sullivan persuade his board to add another theater -- a  smaller, versatile hall of about 280 seats -- and catch a plane home the next  day.  </P> <P> "Every playwright and director I know wants to come here to work," Wasserstein  told the Rep's annual meeting. "The best time I ever had in the theater was at  Seattle Rep," echoed Gardner. "Imagine thinking of the Tony not as completion  but as a starting gun for this second theater."  </P> <P> Why not? That's how people here think. "It's a frontier town," explains  Sullivan. "There's an optimism about possibilities. We don't feel we're  formed."  </P> <P> All you have to do is look around.  </P> <P> A few blocks from the waterfront, Robert Venturi's new $60-million home for the  Seattle Art Museum is heading toward a 1991 completion. Security Pacific Corp.  will open a 5,800-square-foot art gallery down the street later this year,  while A Contemporary Theatre, one of the city's oldest theaters, is raising  funds for its $10-million home nearby. The Pacific Northwest Ballet is adding  new rehearsal and classroom space, and a blue-ribbon task force just concluded  that the Seattle Symphony needs a new concert hall.  </P> <P> And that's just expansion upon Seattle's existing cultural base.  </P> <P> With the Goodwill Arts Festival set to start here Monday, thousands of visitors  will soon learn what people here already know: Seattle has become one of the  hottest arts centers in the country. The Emerald City isn't just bringing in  terrific international fare for a few weeks. It is emerging as a year-round  model arts community.  </P> <P> Start with Seattle's gorgeous setting amid lakes and mountains. Add in two  awards as the nation's most livable city, and new investments and attention  from Pacific Rim nations. It was only a matter of time until a well-educated,  sophisticated influx of new residents both prodded and profited from the city's  long-term commitment to the arts.  </P> <P> Art collectors Vivien and Richard Weisman moved here in February, invited 10  people for dinner and spent the next two weeks honoring invitations to cultural  activities from every person at the table. John Getzelman says that immediately  after his arrival here as Security Pacific Northwest chairman, "chairmen of  competitor banks and other senior business people came to see me personally to  get me involved in the arts." After less than two years, Getzelman is on the  symphony's executive committee, and his wife, Rita, is on the opera board.  </P> <P> This is a city that makes arts a priority. Low-income housing and the Seattle  Art Museum expansion were on the same 1986 ballot, and both passed. Murals,  sculptures and other artworks grace police precincts, electrical substations,  even manhole covers. And in a recent issue of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's  weekly entertainment guide, there were 28 auditions listed for everything from  actors and choral singers to classical guitarists.  </P> <P> "There are more season ticket holders to theater here than to the Seahawks,"  says Paul Schell, port commissioner, attorney and Goodwill Arts Festival  co-chair. In the 25 years that he's been here, says Schell, "Seattle's become a  city as opposed to a big town. It can hold its head up with some of the finest  cities in the world. We're not the biggest, but we're certainly interesting. I  think we marched to a little different drummer than the rest of the country  because we've been isolated so long."  </P> <P> They sure aren't isolated anymore. While the numbers of Southern Californians  headed here may be exaggerated -- and Schell says the net gain here is very  small once you subtract all the Seattlites headed south -- the area's lure is  clearly apparent. Former agent and film executive Mary Alice Kier, who is now  selling real estate here, says she is actively looking for homes for five  Hollywood colleagues.  </P> <P> "I lived the fast-lane life of a development executive in Hollywood," says  Kier, starting her second screenplay since moving to a Seattle-area suburb last  fall. "I ate out every night in wonderful restaurants and went to terrific  parties. I was going to art galleries and plays, but I was just speeding  through. I think the galleries and theater here are top-rate, and real basic  people, not just Hollywood types, support them."  </P> <P> Watch theaters fill here, suggests Peter Donnelly, director of the city's  Corporate Council for the Arts. "You see people in black tie, but you also see  people putting backpacks under their seats. The arts are what people in Seattle  do. . . . The climate is cool and overcast, and people like to go out. Sitting  in a concert hall or theater is like sitting around a campfire and telling  stories."  </P> <P> Most people trace Seattle's arts boom back to the 1962 World's Fair. Not only  did the fair give people here a stronger sense of the world beyond, but it left  behind an auditorium that became the opera house and a theater that first  housed the Seattle Repertory Theatre. The public was so ready that when Seattle  Rep opened in the fall of  </P> <P> 1963, about 9,000 season tickets were sold to performances by a theater company  that had not yet presented a play.  </P> <P> For decades now, the city's arts administrators have worked together to develop  audiences and funding. "In the early days, we felt if we didn't hang together,  we'd hang alone," says Donnelly, who landed here in 1964 as a Ford Foundation  management intern, then helped lead Seattle Rep for 20 years. The city's arts  leaders started meeting every Friday back in the '70s to share information, and  a dozen of them -- running everything from the opera to the children's theater  -- are still meeting regularly.  </P> <P> People here believe in cooperation -- the words consensus and process punctuate  nearly every conversation. In the early '70s, they worked together to push  through a government-sponsored program allocating funds for public art that  continues to be a model for cities and states around the country and even to  help defeat a recall of pro-arts Mayor Wes Uhlman. More recently, arts people  worked with other community activists to save the Pike Place Market near the  waterfront, to keep billboards off the intrastate and to hold down the heights  of downtown buildings.  </P> <P> "There are more (private) art collections between 59th and 72nd on Park Avenue  than in all the Northwest," says Patterson Sims, Seattle Art Museum associate  director and curator of modern art, who arrived here in late 1987 from New  York's Whitney Museum of American Art. "But these (in Seattle) are collectors  who feel very commited to this part of the country. They realize that the  impact their holdings can have within public institutions is absolutely  enormous."  </P> <P> Many of the major patrons 25 years ago are still the arts' biggest backers  today. But cultural founding father Bagley Wright, whose name graces the  Seattle Rep's current home, says the newest financial players here are  corporations. Even at the Center on Contemporary Art, a downtown avant-garde  institution, executive director Katherine Marczuk reports that corporate  contributions quadrupled last year and have doubled again this year.  </P> <P> Everyone points to a strong, well-educated middle class, which provides  patronage as well as audiences. The Seattle Opera had 5,000 donors last year,  but only 615 of them gave  </P> <P> more than $250. And for the 1,800 donors to the state's Artist Trust, an  organization that gives away fellowships to artists, most gifts are in the  $25-to-$35 range.  </P> <P> The "typical" Seattlite, Donnelly says, "goes to Monday night symphony, stays  home Tuesday, goes to theater on Wednesday and a restaurant on Thursday. On  Friday, there's dance or opera and Saturday, the Pike Place Market. Sunday they  sail or ski, and on Monday they start all over again."  </P> <P> The rain doesn't hurt, of course. It stays light here until after 9 p.m. these  days, and sunshine can apparently affect theater attendance. "We've had Sundays  where it's cloudy in the morning, and the phone keeps ringing with people  making reservations for that night," says Mark Murphy, program director of On  the Boards performance space. "But if the sun comes out at 2 p.m., those same  people call back around 5 p.m. canceling their reservations."  </P> <P> It's obviously more than the weather, however. Seattle Arts and Lectures, which  presents talks and interviews with authors, opened here two years ago and sold  out 82% of its 1,200 seats its very first season.  </P> <P> "There must be 300 software companies over in Bellevue," says Norman Langill,  executive producer of the Goodwill Arts Festival, "and that's a lot of brain  power. After 20 years here, I also think people just expect creative things to  come out of the Northwest."  </P> <P> These people are insatiable. Half the seats for an eight-hour seminar scheduled  this weekend for the Seattle Opera's new production of "War and Peace" were  gone by early June -- at $20 apiece. Donnelly says when he was in the dentist's  chair recently, his dentist critiqued plays at the six theaters where he was a  subscriber. "When I asked how come he didn't have subscriptions to (the other  two major theaters)," Donnelly says with a laugh, "he said he had to leave time  for music."  </P> <P> As might be expected, audiences and patrons like that are very attractive to  artists, writers, dancers and others. This is, after all, the region that  spawned dancers Robert Joffrey and Mark Morris, artists Mark Tobey and Morris  Graves.  </P> <P> At Artist Trust, which has been handing out money to individual artists here  since 1986, executive director David Mendoza says the greater Seattle area has  the seventh-largest concentration of artists in a major metropolitan area, and  the state of Washington has the 12th-largest concentration.  </P> <P> While the picturesque Puget Sound area has always been attractive to visual  artists, Mendoza says the region's pioneer public arts programs also "send a  message that there is interest and support for artists in this part of the  country." Seattle's Art in Public Places program manager Diane Shamash reports  2,000 annual requests for information, and she shepherds tours for 50 groups of  visitors each year (including, in May, a group from the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art).  </P> <P> Consider the fate of a prominent Henry Moore sculpture here. A few years ago,  new owners of a downtown office building sold the Moore sculpture out front to  a collector in Japan. Word got out, and hundreds of people called both the  Seattle Arts Commission and the mayor's office to lobby against the private  sale. There was so much pressure on the U.S. companies involved that that they  bought back the sculpture for considerably more than they sold it for.  </P> <P> While housing has started to become more expensive here as elsewhere, the area  is still economically hospitable to artists. "It isn't a center like Los  Angeles or New York, but the life style and beauty are the trade-off," says  Seattle-based ceramic artist and teacher Patti Warashina, a well-known sculptor  who has shown work in Europe and Japan. "You can have a house and a yard and  you don't have to be rich."  </P> <P> Actors reflect similar sentiments. Glenn Mazen, featured in Kevin Kling's play  "Lloyd's Prayer," closing today at A Contemporary Theatre, says that over the  past 23 years he has raised five children here. "I couldn't raise a family and  live and work in New York," says Mazen. "I have to supplement my income with  commercials, voice-overs and film work, but we have a very good market here and  it's beginning to expand."  </P> <P> Episodes of ABC's "Twin Peaks" were shot in Snoqualmie, about half an hour out  of town, and "The Fabulous Baker Boys" made the most of downtown Seattle as  well as of Michele Pfeiffer. There are 322 Actor's Equity members here, and  Sullivan says film and other work "is healthy -- it keeps them here." Adds  Contemporary Theatre literary manager Steven Alter: "There's so much good  talent here that actors think the street is paved with Equity contracts. I  lived in Minneapolis, I lived in L.A., and it's happening here."  </P> <P> Playwrights agree. Pulitzer Prize-winner Wasserstein came here, for instance,  to nurture her play "The Heidi Chronicles" "in a safe environment for its  beginning." And colleague Gardner says people coming to his play "I'm Not  Rappaport" here "really looked like they wanted to be there. At the first two  previews, I said, 'I remember these people. They're the people you write plays  for.' "  </P> <P> Funders ask how many theaters are enough, says Donnelly, "and I tell them it  takes at least seven or eight theaters to keep (our professional actors)  working. It takes the symphony, opera and ballet to keep 170 or 180  professional musicians living here. And the benefit (of all that) just begins  with their contributions to the symphony or theaters. They also live in  neighborhoods and give music lessons, form chamber groups and otherwise  influence people."  </P> <P> Artists are good for Washington state, explains Artist Trust's Mendoza, who  headed back home to Seattle after eight years in New York: "Their production  doesn't pollute, and tourists seem to like them."  </P> <P> About a year ago, recalls Seattle Symphony music director Gerard Schwarz, he  and his counterparts at this city's other big cultural institutions were all  participating in a panel discussion on the local arts scene. And one of the  things they discovered is that every one of them had come from New York City.  </P> <P> "We all came here for the cultural environment," says conductor Schwarz,  formerly music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and still music  director of the New York Chamber Symphony and Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart  Festival. Acknowledging the incredible views of Puget Sound out his living room  window, the maestro says, "We're all lucky to be in such a beautiful place. But  quite frankly, I stay here because of the cultural environment."  </P> <P> Seattle's strong arts profile isn't entirely new, of course. The Seattle Opera,  for instance, ranks as the nation's seventh-largest opera company and has long  been well-known internationally as well as nationally. Its "Ring" cycle is  reviewed regularly in London and Frankfurt, and the rest of its season has  begun to get similar recognition.  </P> <P> But snaring nationally recognized artists such as Schwarz can't hurt. Under  Schwarz, for instance, the Seattle Symphony is turning out about 10 recordings  a year, and in 1989 it received three Grammy nominations.  </P> <P> The arrival of Seattle Art Museum curator Sims and big-league art collectors  like the Weismans have also widened the sights here in the visual arts. While  emphasis continues on regional art, and particularly glass art produced by  students and teachers at the nearby Pilchuck Glass School, Seattle Art Museum  President Virginia Wright expects more attention to international contemporary  art once the new museum is complete.  </P> <P> Leaders such as Schwarz or Sims also "provide a connection to a larger  community," says veteran Seattle art dealer Linda Farris. "When you bring in  world-class (leaders), it raises everybody's perceptions of an art form."  </P> <P> Emigration isn't all at the top either. When On the Boards, a cutting-edge arts  group, held its yearly artists meeting, half the artists, playwrights and  choreographers in the room had been there less than six months. And at the  similarly untraditional Center on Contemporary Art, 10 times as many artists  came in looking for a place to show their work this past year as in the prior  year.  </P> <P> "The people who moved here in the '60s would have been counterculture, and in  the '70s and '80s, environmentalists and people wanting a more livable city,"  says Sims. "In the '90s, it's all that plus a thirst for a sophistication about  culture."  </P> <P> Already the newcomers are having an impact. Unlike many other cities, where  half or more of an art dealer's sales may be to out-of-town collectors, Farris  says that most galleries here make 80% of their sales to local or regional  collectors. "While there are still just four or five major contemporary  collections here, the big change is in the tier just below them, which was  lacking before."  </P> <P> The same is true at the opera. For the last "Ring" cycle, in '87, says Seattle  Opera general director Speight Jenkins, 50% of the audience was from out of  town. "But I expect that when we do it again in 1991, the audience will be  60/40 from here because of all the new people. We are not now, nor will we ever  be, the Seahawks, but if you bring in 100 newcomers, maybe 15 will have a  passing interest in opera and five will be fanatics."  </P> <P> Seattle is no New York or Los Angeles clone, however. Much patronage is done  privately, and new residents point out the lack of "scene" restaurants, social  coverage and indeed social-climbing. Sims says when he found out that Barney's  in New York opened a store here, "I wondered where people would wear all those  hyper-elegant clothes." And describing the hoped-for new concert hall, maestro  Schwarz says quickly that "it won't be ostentatious. We want a beautiful hall  that services the music brilliantly but we don't need a glitzy one."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will success spoil Seattle?  </P> <P> The state's film and video office gets at least one call every single day from  people across the country who are looking for jobs here, and increased  Hollywood interest is expected to result in the opening of a city film office  within a year or so. There is also discussion of a new performing arts center  for the "East Side" -- the upscale communities of Bellevue, Kirkland and  Redmond on the other side of Lake Washington -- as well as ongoing development  of a theater district in nearby Tacoma.  </P> <P> Opera impresario Jenkins, for one, says three times in less than an hour that  he readily welcomes new audiences and money from California and elsewhere.  Opera board members even held a fund-raiser in February in Palm Springs where  Jenkins spoke and gave 80 people a preview of "War and Peace," their big-budget  entry in the Goodwill Arts Festival.  </P> <P> But not everybody is pleased with all the change. Judy Malmgren, an  epidemiologist who was born and raised here, questions whether A Contemporary  Theatre's future downtown home amid skyscrapers could rival its current  suburban setting where "in the summer you walk out to green trees and  good-smelling warm air. They're going to a corporate setting and I don't like  that."  </P> <P> She also doesn't much like all the crowds at the monthly open houses at the art  galleries. Looking around her at the people pouring into a Pioneer Square  gallery on a recent Thursday evening, she complained that "it used to take me  15 minutes to get here, but tonight it took 45 minutes to get here and find a  parking place, and these people are all strangers. I liked it the way it was."  </P> <P> At Seattle Rep, Sullivan says the Rep's success in sending plays to New York  means he spends "a lot of time deflecting the interest of producers wanting to  start plays here. Our workshops are also a little more tense -- now it's sort  of make-or-break with playwrights and that's kind of a shame. "  </P> <P> Some organizations have also expanded too fast. Pioneer Square Theatre went out  of business last year not long after expanding from one to three theaters.  Empty Space Theatre took over one of the Pioneer spots after being similarly  undercapitalized and over-extended in its big, new home. And other mid-sized  and smaller houses reportedly also sometimes encounter trouble meeting Equity  payrolls.  </P> <P> "We tend to do things a little slower," says Melissa Hines, managing director  of the Empty Space. "We are being jostled by people with new money into  accelerated growth and expansion that we would otherwise be more cautious about  and scrutinize more."  </P> <P> All the success is also putting incredible demands on existing institutions. At  the opera house, for instance, conductor Schwarz says that despite subscriber  preferences, there are not enough Saturday nights available for a subscription  series. The orchestra can only do one of its rehearsals onstage rather than in  a rehearsal hall, and it has to turn down major visiting orchestras because no  opera house dates are available.  </P> <P> Schwarz' new concert hall, budgeted at $54 million if built today, may profit  from new monies offered by the National Arts Stabilization Fund. Seattle is one  of five areas in which the nonprofit fund is operating a long-range financial  program to stabilize 10 of the city's core arts organizations. The fund has  already made million-dollar grants to the Pacific Northwest Ballet and Seattle  Art Museum and will distribute $5.5 million more over the next few years.  </P> <P> While the 10 organizations that may qualify for the fund have budgets ranging  from $634,000 at the Group Theatre to $8.7 million at the opera, most are  fairly large organizations. Large organizations also get a big chunk of Seattle  Arts Commission money, and here, as elsewhere, Seattle's large and small arts  organizations don't always exist in perfect harmony.  </P> <P> This is particularly true when funds are finite. Money may be coming in here  from corporations and foundations, says Richard Andrews, director of the  University of Washington's Henry Art Gallery, but the number of corporate  headquarters and major foundations in Seattle is limited. "There's not an  enormous well of money in Seattle that we can tap endlessly, and we have to  confront that."  </P> <P> One possibility, of course, is increased efforts to tap Pacific Rim  corporations already fueling other segments of the Seattle economy. At the  Seattle Art Museum, for instance, both president Wright and curator Sims say  they plan to approach Japanese and Hong Kong collectors and others for support  of their new Asian art museum. The museum's current home in Volunteer Park will  be renovated as an Asian art center once the much-larger museum facility opens  downtown.  </P> <P> Seattle's favorable position in terms of Pacific Rim trading also counters the  city's long-felt feelings of isolation. Arts people here readily acknowledge  the problems of not being conveniently on the way to anywhere, nor in the  artistic mainstream for artists needing to keep abreast of exhibitions or  performances in their field. Although, says Andrews, "one of the strengths of  the arts here has been that you're thrown on your own devices, and that  challenge attracts a certain kind of person."  </P> <P> Museum administrator Andrews, for instance, was raised in Los Angeles, later  came here and ran the Seattle Arts Commission's public arts program, then left  for Washington, D.C. to head the National Endowment for the Arts' visual arts  program. But he came back again, he says, because "the assets in this community  far outweigh the problems and challenges. I was offered a job I wanted in a  city that is still in the process of defining itself, and where I could be part  of a very active and progressive arts community.  </P> <P> "The historic feeling here has been that a rising artistic tide will float all  the ships," says Andrews. "In less than 30 years, we have developed the basic  audience, the basic levels of support and the artistic staffs to achieve a high  level of artistic quality. The Goodwill Arts Festival has us all stretching  ourselves artistically, and our continued challenge is to sustain that stretch  into the future."  </P> <P> Times librarian Doug Conner contributed to the research for this article.  </P> <P> </P></p>

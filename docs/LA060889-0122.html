			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH ACCUSED OF ALTERING DRIVER'S LICENSES  </P> <P> An 18-year-old high school senior from Irvine has been arrested on suspicion of  doctoring as many as 250 driver's licenses, usually to change birth dates, a  business that allegedly netted him $1,000 a week, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Irvine police estimated that Paul Howard Schwartz had altered the licenses,  mainly for teen-agers in Orange and Los Angeles counties, since January.  </P> <P> Police said Schwartz altered driver's licenses to specifications for $60 a  license.  </P> <P> "In our undercover operation, we ordered six new IDs from him, telling him that  they were for a criminal who needed new identification, and he made them for  us," Sgt. Leo Jones said.  </P> <P> Police Tuesday arrested Schwartz, a University High School senior, on suspicion  of counterfeiting state documents, a felony. He was released to his parents,  Jones said.  </P> <P> Schwartz said Wednesday night, "From what I hear, the police's press release  about this is pretty inflated, but I really don't care to comment."  </P> <P> The youth faces more than 100 felony charges -- one charge "for each fictitious  license produced," Jones said. State law provides for up to a year in prison  for each conviction of a charge of "counterfeit of a state seal."  </P></p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Lessons of the debt crisis ALMOST 10 years ago Mexico declared a moratorium on debt service, whereupon the contagion spread. It was a time of panic, an occasion for improvisation. Ten years later, with private capital flowing into Latin America, commercial banks reeling from losses closer to home, and industrial countries mired in recession once more, the 'debt crisis' seems history. But it has left much behind: problems still unsolved, lessons learned, and lessons unlearned. Improvisation worked. The collapse of the financial system that threatened did not occur. Notwithstanding the endeavours of the commercial banks, it has still not occurred. The case-by-case approach to the problems of indebted countries has also succeeded. Those who have made serious efforts to adjust, like Mexico, thrive; those that have not, like Brazil, wallow in failure. Yet everything was not done well. It took too long to recognise the nature of the problem and still longer to move from palliatives to remedies. For this - indeed, for most of the serious errors - blame falls heavily on the industrial countries. It is the developing countries that have had the hardest lesson: in the 'lost decade', per capita income in Latin America fell by close to a fifth. But the lesson has, for the most part, been learned. 'Good policy' - non-inflationary budget finance, positive real interest rates and openness to trade and foreign direct investment - matters. It was possible to get away with less than this in an environment of low real interest rates. In a more unfavourable environment, it was not. Only countries as efficient as South Korea survived high levels of external indebtedness unscathed. The lesson to be learned about commercial banks is, it appears, that they never learn their lesson. Each time commercial banks have been offered the chance to trade their way out of past losses, they embrace new ones. The threat of third world debt has receded. New threats have taken its place. The immediate response of the industrial countries to the crisis was successful. But they bear much responsibility for its creation and for the inordinately long time it took to resolve. The inflationary policies of industrial countries generated the negative real interest rates of the 1970s that made borrowing so attractive. The sudden volte face in US monetary policy under Paul Volcker then triggered the debt crisis. It was industrial country fiscal deficits which kept real interest rates painfully high, their refusal to recognise that illiquidity cannot be distinguished from insolvency which meant that organised debt reduction came only seven years later, and their protectionism that militates against the unilateral moves towards economic liberalism of many developing countries. It is now well known that countries politically incapable of meeting their liabilities need some sort of bankruptcy procedure that ensures all creditors share the losses. Will that lesson be applied soon enough to the problems of the former Soviet Union? It is evident that the poorest countries must rely largely on concessional official assistance. Will this lesson be applied to Africa on a large enough scale? It is clear too that the market must be allowed to work. Will it be allowed to, however, not merely by the poor, but even when it causes political pain  -as over the question of farm trade reform, now the chief obstacle to global trade liberalisation - by the rich?</p>

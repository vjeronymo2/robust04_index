			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / People: Lord Rodgers to chair ASA The UK's self-regulatory body controlling advertising standards - the Advertising Standards Authority - has appointed a new chairman to replace Sir Timothy Raison when he retires at the end of his four years on January 1 1995. The new chairman is to be Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, former member of parliament for Stockton-on-Tees, later Stockton North, between 1962-83. He held a variety of cabinet posts in Labour governments. More widely known as Bill Rodgers, he was a long-standing member of the Labour party until in 1981 he defected to be a founder member of the Social Democratic Party along with Shirley Williams, David Owen and Roy Jenkins. In 1987 he gave up being the SDP's vice-president to take a Pounds 65,000 a year job as director general of the Royal Institute of British Architects, a post he held until February this year. Rodgers, 66, is now a Liberal Democrat and was created a life peer in 1992. During the SDP's party conference in 1987 he was reported as saying that 'politics is a painful, damaging and often cruel business'. With such a background, monitoring legality, truthfulness and decency in the world of advertising should be a piece of cake.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- The armed forces cannot exist  as one of major elements of Russian statehood without a  minimally sufficient and steady financing, Major-General  Vladimir Osadchiy, representative of the Russian Defence  Ministry, told ITAR-TASS. A military budget to be discussed in  its second reading at the State Duma hearings on Wednesday may  become the last one for the army and navy, he stated.    Osadchiy said deputies in State Duma factions and committees  are being intensively coached and calculations by Sergey  Glazyev, who found additional sources of revenue to finance  defence spending, are being severely criticised.    General Osadchiy believes that Tuesday's press conference of  Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Federation Council committee on  security and defence, is to demonstrate the Federation Council's  stand once again.    The Council declared for an increase in military  expenditure,  taking into account both inflation and an utter necessity to buy  hardware and arms, pay money allowance to servicemen, and cater  for soldiers and seamen.    If the State Duma on Wednesday fails to heed the Federation  Council's recommendations, this military budget may become the  last one for the armed forces, for they would not be able to  exist as one of major elements of Russian statehood without a  minimally sufficient and steady financing, General Osadchiy said.</p>

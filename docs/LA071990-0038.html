			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: CHEESECAKE CAN ALSO MEAN MAIN COURSE  </P> <P> Although both carrots and cheese, when linked with cake, would seem to connote  a dessert, this dish is nothing of the kind. It's a savory first or main course  that, when made a day ahead and served cold, makes an ideal hot-weather lunch  or dinner.  </P> <P> SAVORY CARROT CHEESECAKE  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter  </P> <P> 1 medium sweet onion (Vidalia, Maui or Texas Sweet), chopped  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups grated carrots  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon lemon juice  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil or 2 teaspoons dried, crumbled  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons fresh minced oregano or 2 teaspoons dried, crumbled  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese  </P> <P> 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese  </P> <P> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 2 large eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> Melt butter in large skillet over low heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion  is tender and translucent. Add carrots and continue to saute, stirring well to  blend.  </P> <P> As mixture begins to dry, add lemon juice and stir well to coat. Stir in basil,  oregano, ginger and salt. Remove from heat.  </P> <P> Combine ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses with electric hand mixer until  smooth. Beat in eggs until well combined. Stir in carrot mixture thoroughly.  </P> <P> Lightly grease 6-inch springform pan. Spoon cheese mixture into pan and smooth  top. Place in oven, with pan of water on shelf below.  </P> <P> Bake at 375 degrees 50 minutes or until top has browned and knife inserted in  center comes out clean. If top browns too soon, cover with foil.  </P> <P> Turn heat off, open oven door and let cheesecake stand 15 minutes. Remove from  oven and serve immediately, or let cool to room temperature, refrigerate and  serve chilled. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P></p>

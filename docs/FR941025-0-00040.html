The current flammability standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X is codified at 16 CFR Part 1615 and the standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 is codified at 16 CFR Part 1616.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 13, 1993, the Commission issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the possible amendment of its flammability standards for children's sleepwear. 58 FR 4111. On that same date, the staff also issued a stay of enforcement of the sleepwear requirements against certain garments. 58 FR 4078. That stay went into effect when it was published on January 13, 1993. The staff is extending the stay of enforcement as previously issued while the Commission considers the proposed amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the NPR which is published elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the staff has noted that many garments currently in the marketplace and labeled as ``playwear'' or ``underwear'' are suitable for use as sleepwear and are being used as sleepwear in a substantial number of cases. Pending Commission consideration of amendments to the sleepwear standards, the Compliance staff is extending its stay of enforcement against the following garments. The staff will continue not to enforce the sleepwear requirements against garments currently being used as sleepwear that are labeled and marketed as underwear if those garments are relatively free of ornamentation and are skin-tight or nearly skin tight. Such garments may be either one or two piece garments and typically are manufactured of a fabric such as rib knit, interlock knit, or waffle knit. The stay also continues to cover garments that are essentially identical in design, material, and fit to such ``underwear'' garments. Examples of the types of garments covered by the stay are illustrated on pages 4 and 6 of the Supplemental CPSC Staff Guide to the Enforcement Policy Statements of the Flammability Standard for Children's Sleepwear (1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the staff continues to stay enforcement against these garments under its sleepwear standards, these garments must comply with the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles, 16 CFR part 1610. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 17, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Sadye E.

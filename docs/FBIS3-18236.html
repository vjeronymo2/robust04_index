			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Names New, Old And Famous at the </F> Elections"]    [Text] Rome, 22 Feb (ANSA) -- A television quiz show  champion; actors; ex-soccer stars; relatives of famous  magistrates, industrialists and sports figures; a polemical art  critic and a controversial photographer; journalists and army  officers; judges and stylists; discredited members of  traditional parties striking out on their own: these are some of  the faces new and old that Italians will see lined up in the  race for the March 27-28 elections.    The first vote to take place under new first-past-the-post  majority rules, which will assign 75 percent of parliamentary  seats, last night officially got off to a start when the  deadline expired for the presentation of candidates.    The leading contenders -- the Progressive caucus on the  left,  National Alliance on the far right and the ephemeral alliances  forged by Forza Italia claiming a stake to the center -- will be  fighting tooth and nail not only against other "big guns" but  also against a variety of smaller parties not everywhere allied  in the same fashion, including former Christian Democrats (now  called People's Party), Pact for Italy, Democratic Alliance,  secessionists in northern autonomous regions, one-man  single-issue parties, Communists and Greens, Catholics,  populists, hard-line Fascists and disguised members of the old  order.    Forza Italia, created by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, has  forged an alliance in the north with the League and, in the  center and south, with National Alliance, both with the goal of  defeating progressive candidates.    But the toughest battles will be fought in a few major  cities  considered strategically important for the nation's political  chess-board: Bologna, Rome, Naples, Milan, Genoa, Venice,  Florence, Bari, Palermo.    Bologna, for decades the power base of the left, has  attracted all the high-power names attempting to wrest control  away from the Left Democrats and Communist Refoundation. The  majority system candidates' list in Constituency 14 in fact  includes Left Democrat Secretary Achille Occhetto, Ferdinando  Casini (League-Forza Italia, together with conservative  Christian Democrats) and the highly controversial advertizing  wizard and photographer of the Benetton clothing maker, Oliviero  Toscani (running under the party of former Radical Party leader  Marco Pannella).    Running for votes under the proportional system (for the  remaining 25 percent of votes) in Bologna will be Socialist  Party Secretary Ottaviano Del Turco and former Anti-Mafia  magistrate Giuseppe Ayala (both Progressives).    In Bologna's Emilia Romagna region the Progressives will run  Libero Gualtieri, former chairman of the parliamentary  investigative commission on the Ustica case, while proportional  voting will see renowned actor Paolo Villaggio (with Pannella),  Green MP Gianni Mattioli, Nando Dalla Chiesa (son of the police  chief murdered by the Mafia in 1982), Northern League leader  Umberto Bossi, National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini, trade  union leader Giorgio Benvenuto.    Rome, too, has attracted big guns: Budget Minister Luigi  Spaventa is running with the Progressives against Go Italy  creator Silvio Berlusconi himself and against Alberto Michelini  of the so-called Center Pole. Another constituency in the  capital will see Fini again, against Costanza Pera of the Center  and Eduardo Missoni of the Progressives.    Progressives running under proportional rules in Rome  include  Chiara Ingrao, daughter of the former Communist veteran Pietro  Ingrao, again Giorgio Benvenuto and Social Catholic Alfredo  Carlo Moro, younger brother of Aldo Moro, the ex-prime minister  and Christian Democrat leader kidnapped and murdered by the Red  Brigades in 1978.    In Milan, home of the Northern League, Bossi will face off  against Franco Bassanini of the Left Democrats and former soccer  champion Gianni Rivera (Pact for Italy). The proportional  constituencies in neighboring Mantova include former  anticorruption pool investigating magistrate Tiziana Parenti  (Forza Italia) and actress Ilaria Occhini (Pannella).    Fourteen parties are running for the Senate in Milan,  including the Party of Natural Law, the Popular Democrats and  the Robin Hood Justice Movement.    Moving down to Naples, where 300 candidates are running  under  19 tickets, Lower House Speaker Giorgio Napolitano will try for  reelection and Franca Chiaromonte, daughter of the Left Democrat  MP who died last year, will try for election under the  proportional system. Among the proportional list candidates are  Education Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino, National Alliance MP  Alessandra Mussolini (granddaughter of the Fascist dictator),  Silvio Berlusconi, Ottaviano Del Turco and Marco Pannella.    In Sicily, Palermo was the only city to elect Network  candidate Leoluca Orlando mayor on the first ballot in November.  There, two former Christian Democrats, Calogero Mannino and Rino  Nicolosi, are running for the Senate in nearby Agrigento and  Catania, respectively.    In western Sicily Anti-Mafia judge Antonino Caponnetto and  Alfredo Galasso of the Network will be running, while in eastern  Sicily former Defense Minister Salvo Ando' has announced he will  not seek reelection.    Two curiosities in Sicily: film director Franco Zeffirelli  is  a candidate for Go Italy in Catania, while National Alliance has  Enzo Majorca, who for decades held the water depth world record  for unassisted diving.    Actor Paolo Villaggio is running under the majority system  for the Lower House in Genoa, where other candidates vying for  proportional seats include Lower House deputy speaker Alfredo  Biondi, former army chief of staff Eugenio Rambaldi (Pact for  Italy) and the former champion of the television quiz show,  Rischiatutto, Enzo Bottesini, running as expected with Go Italy.    In Tuscany a large number of candidates are journalists but  include Vittorio Cecchi Gori, president of the Fiorentina soccer  club (Pact for Italy), the Siena University rector, Luigi  Berlinguer, Environment Minister Valdo Spini and again Bossi and  Villaggio.    Turin will see among its candidates Mariella Scirea, widow  of  the famed soccer star, running with Go Italy, but will also  include Transport Minister Raffele Costa, Labor Minister Gino  Giugni, former Environment Minister Carlo Ripa Di Meana and the  chairman of the Anti-Mafia Commission, Luciano Violante. Then  there will also be former Defense Minister Valerio Zanone,  Franco De Benedetti (Progressives), brother of Olivetti Chairman  Carlo De Benedetti and the president of Azione Cattolica,  Alberto Monticone.    Bari, too, will have a former soccer star, Gianni Rivera  (Pact for Italy), on its list of candidates, along with Massimo  D'Alema of the Left Democrat Party and Vittorio Sgarbi (Forza  Italia), the art critic-turned-political commentator who  everybody apparently loves to hate. The former Carabinieri  Police chief Antonio Viesti is also running with the Pact.    The southern Puglia region will list several members of  traditional parties who decided to run on their own after the  onslaught of kickbacks scandals: Socialist Costantino Dell'Osso,  former Christian Democrat Industry Undersecretary Luigi Farace,  former Social Democratic Defense Undersecretary Antonio Bruno  and former Christian Democratic MP Giuseppe Caroli.    Roman Prince Francesco Sforza Ruspoli is running with a  party  called Southern Wind -- Viva Zapata for a post in the Puglia  regional council.    Venice will have Christian Democrat Rosy Bindi, Left  Democrat  Walter Veltroni (chief editor of the daily L'UNITA'), Elisabetta  Gardini, former Republican minister Bruno Visentini all facing  off under the majority system, along with journalist Lucio  Manisco (Communist Refoundation).    The president of the Northern League, Franco Rocchetta, is  running under a ticket called Pact for Freedom, created by the  League, Forza Italia and the conservative Christian Democratic  Center.    In Catanzaro, Calabria, art critic Sgarbi and former  Communist Tiziana Maiolo are both running with Forza Italia,  which is also supporting Gerardo Sacco, nicknamed "the goldsmith  of the divas," in Crotone. The Pact for Italy and the People's  Party together are backing the candidature of Arturo De Felice,  head of the Calabria Criminapol, in Lamezia Terme, while the  Progressives are supporting Simona Dalla Chiesa, daughter of  Nando Dalla Chiesa.</p>

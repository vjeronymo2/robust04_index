			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Indonesian timber group plans Dollars 200m flotation BARITO Pacific Timber, one of the world's largest wood products companies, plans to go public with a Dollars 200m share offer that values the company at about Dollars 2bn. The company, which will float later this year, is the flagship of the Barito Pacific Group led by Mr Prajogo Pangestu. BPT has banking, real estate and petrochemical subsidiaries, as well as 2.46m hectares in timber concessions of its own and access to a total of 5m hectares. This latter figure represents almost 8 per cent of Indonesia's natural production forests. The company, set up in 1976, estimates its assets at Dollars 1bn, although this excludes the full value of forestry concessions which, under Indonesian law, remain the state's property. Last year BPT recorded a gross profit of Dollars 114m on sales of Dollars 380m. For 1993 the company forecasts sales of Dollars 599m and a gross profit of Dollars 309m. Although exact figures are not available, company documents show first-quarter sales this year of nearly Dollars 90m and a gross profit of about Dollars 50m. The surge in profits will result, company officials say, from a restructuring of debt, estimated at Dollars 560m, and a sharp increase in the world price of timber. BPT exports 95 per cent of production to Japan and Taiwan. The company also confirmed it had recently made a private placement of shares, amounting to a 20 per cent stake, to Taspen, the largest state pension fund. While Indonesia, with the third largest natural forests in the world after Brazil and Zaire, has a competitive advantage in wood products, brokers attribute BPT's growth in part to Mr Pangestu's political connections. Bankers say it was Mr Pangestu who in 1990 helped cover losses of Dollars 419m suffered by Bank Duta, majority-owned by three charitable foundations chaired by President Suharto.</p>

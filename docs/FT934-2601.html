			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sanderson scores 19% rise Sanderson Electronics' success by proxy was boosted last year as Sheffield Wednesday, the football team it sponsors to the tune of Pounds 250,000 a year, reached the finals of both the FA and Coca Cola cups. Now the company, a software house specialising in open systems applications, has scored a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 3.32m for the year to September 30 as the group achieved its 10th consecutive year of revenue growth. Mr Paul Thompson, chairman, said the increase in profits had been achieved despite difficult trading. Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 25.4p (24p) despite a higher tax charge, and the dividend, already paid, is 9.9p (9p). The interim dividend for 1993-94 is unchanged at 5.4p. Turnover was 10 per cent higher at Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 21.4m). The company has now reduced its shareholding in General Automation of the US from 49 per cent to below 19 per cent and a further reduction is likely in line with Sanderson's strategy of concentrating on its core UK business. Gearing has been cut to 90 per cent (147 per cent); interest fell from Pounds 461,000 to Pounds 267,000.</p>

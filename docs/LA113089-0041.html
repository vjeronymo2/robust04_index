			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The Scene: A kickoff party for Fred Hayman's new cologne for men, 273. For  those who think that real men don't wear fragrance, Hayman held the affair in  the testosterone-soaked atmosphere of Gold's Gym in Venice. Quite a sight to  see Beverly Hills business types mingling and cheek-kissing among weight  lifters whose biceps were as big as the average man's head.  </P> <P> Who Was There: Only men were invited, read the invitation, but the rules seemed  to be waived -- if the woman in question was a world-class bodybuilder. There  were lots of muscle men and muscle women inside, along with Gary Collins, Jack  Carter, Casey Kasem, George Peppard, fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell,  restaurateurs and chefs Jacques Camus, Patrick Terrail, and Jimmy Murphy.  Everyone received a bottle of cologne on the way out.  </P> <P> Dress Code: Each guest was sent a mustard yellow 273 T-shirt and urged to "come  as you are," which made for some interesting fashion combinations. Hayman  himself accented his T-shirt with a bright yellow double-breasted blazer and  gray sweat pants. Photographer Alan Berliner wore his T-shirt under a tuxedo  jacket, while others sported everything from three-piece suits to leather  jackets.  </P> <P> Chow: A fresh oyster bar kept guests shucking. Waiters circled the workout  gear, bearing hamburgers, hot dogs, and pizza. At the bar, guests demonstrated  their machismo by grabbing long neck Budweisers out of a silver bucket and  drinking the beer out of the bottle.  </P> <P> Pastimes: Incoming guests were sprayed with cologne by men in Gold's Gym tank  tops. Inside one could listen to a strolling mariachi band, or watch  weightlifters go through their paces on serious workout machines that look like  they were designed by the Marquis de Sade.  </P> <P> Noted: Mr. Blackwell topped his T-shirt with a black coat that looked  suspiciously like that favorite four-letter word of animal activists: Mink.  (Was it or wasn't it? Only his furrier knew for sure.)  </P> <P> Quoted: Did all the XY chromosomes in the air mean that 273 was the most macho  fragrance in Beverly Hills? Fred Hayman laughed. "It's one of the most macho,"  he said. "An elegant kind of macho. It's very secure here. An ordinary  fragrance couldn't come to Gold's Gym, could it?"  </P> <P> Triumphs: In this day and age, when the launching of a new perfume is treated  with the gravity one associates with the announcement of the Salk vaccine, it  was refreshing to be at a party with such a sense of humor. Even Hayman got  into the spirit of things, sitting in the back of his yellow and black  Rolls-Royce as two muscle men hoisted up the back of the car with him inside.  </P> <P> Glitches: There was no club soda or designer water at the bar, proving that it  is possible to be too macho.

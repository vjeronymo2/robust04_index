			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Trade surplus rises to DM61bn Germany's foreign trade surplus in 1993 was almost double that of the previous year, according to revised figures released yesterday by the federal statistics office. The trade surplus was DM61bn (Pounds 25.2bn) in 1993, compared to DM33bn in 1992. Exports have been revised upwards by DM24.6bn to DM628.5bn, while imports have been increased by DM22.7bn to DM567.6bn. The surplus of foreign trade has been revised upwards by DM1.8bn. The improved trade surplus will have a positive impact on the balance of payments deficit, which since 1991 has exceeded DM30bn each year. The balance of payments deficit last year totalled DM35.3bn, a rise of DM0.8bn on the previous year. Italian retail sales rose 7.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 from a year ago, according to Istat, the state statistics office. In the quarter, Istat's index of retail sales registered 105.3 compared with 97.7 in the same period of 1993. The rise in January to March 1994 followed an increase of 5.8 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter of 1993. Dutch consumer spending rose 1.7 per cent in volume terms in April compared with the same month of 1993, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Nicola Mancino by Giuseppe </F> D'Avanzo; place and date not given : "Even the Mafia Has its  Candidates"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [D'Avanzo] Is the  center growing?    [Mancino] Yes, and it does not surprise me. The center is  the only grouping that can offer the voters a homogeneous and  solid program line. This is certainly an advantage with respect  to the inconsistencies of the Right and the Left. You cannot  stop in front of a door marked "Electoral Coalition." People  want to know with whom and how it is intended to govern. Both  the Right and the Left have little to say about this. They have  made too many mistakes.    [D'Avanzo] Too many mistakes. What are they?    [Mancino] On the Left, Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic  Party of the Left, PDS] has committed a very serious strategic  error. He decided to embrace within his coalition -- for the  sake of exclusively numerical necessities -- a party that has  not abandoned its plan to reestablish communism in Italy and  that proclaims to the four winds that, although the Soviet  system made some fundamental mistakes, the nature, the Marxist  framework of its social order must still be defended.    [D'Avanzo] So what is his strategic error?    [Mancino] That is soon said. The attempt at an upward social  leveling has failed in every corner of Central and West Europe.  The raising of the weaker social classes to a higher level is  part of a culture that our country cannot accept.    [D'Avanzo] So much for the Left. What are the Right's  mistakes?    [Mancino] However many efforts [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi may make, it remains clear that the MSI [Italian  Social Movement], even in the new form of the National Alliance,  cannot coexist with the League in government, even disregarding  the conflict that exists between the former's specific appeal  for the country's unity and the latter's calls for federalism.  If you look at the programs of the Right, you will find them  full of demagogy. It will not be easy for those gentlemen to  govern.    [D'Avanzo] In the conflict between [Northern League leader]  Bossi and Berlusconi, the smarter one seems to be Bossi, who has  made his calculations on the basis of individual constituencies,  not on the basis of opinion polls. He can now say: Of the 320  constituencies in the north, 200 will be mine.    [Mancino] Yes, Bossi certainly is the smarter one. He is  trying to overcome the irritation of coexisting with Berlusconi,  the loss of territorial hegemony. Bossi is certainly more  strategic, Berlusconi more tactical.    [D'Avanzo] But Berlusconi has no doubts about victory.    [Mancino] I would not be so sure, if I were in his shoes.  The country has to decide whether a gentleman who owns a large  proportion of the television stations, newspapers, and sectors  of production can be impartial when it comes to deciding what  kinds of economic measures Italy needs. I think that the  Italian people are intelligent and that they will seek a third  person who is able to manage the country's interests, not his  own interests.    [D'Avanzo] However, this third option, the center, does not  seem to be playing a prominent part in this election campaign at  all.    [Mancino] The campaign is taking place with a deliberate  understanding between two antagonists: The Left shouts about  the danger of a swing toward authoritarianism, while the Right  shouts out in fright about a left-wing government. But who  believes in this split between two poles? It is a distorted  arrangement that after the elections will have to relinquish its  extreme wings in order to be able to govern. That is when it  will be necessary to take account of the center.    [D'Avanzo] How many seats will the center have in  parliament?    [Mancino] I am no soothsayer. What I do say is that if the  numbers so permit, we will govern; if not, we will go into  opposition.    [D'Avanzo] With whom would you govern?    [Mancino] If an intermediate constituent phase were to prove  necessary, we would do our part.    [D'Avanzo] On what conditions?    [Mancino] On condition that the two poles separate at each  extreme in order to agree on a program including institutional  reform.    [D'Avanzo] With Ciampi as prime minister?    [Mancino] Although everyone judged him merely a technocrat,  Ciampi has shown himself to be a shrewd and responsible  politician. Having worked with him, I can say that he has not  shown himself to be exclusively concerned with pursuing a merely  monetarist policy.    [D'Avanzo] It is very likely that you will be the last  Christian Democrat minister to occupy your present post for a  long time...    [Mancino] If that does happen, I do not think that anyone  would be distressed, neither I nor my party.    [D'Avanzo] So perhaps we could take stock calmly of the  damage done by the DC [Christian Democratic Party] at the  Interior Ministry.    [Mancino] I am willing to take stock of the damage done, if  we also mention the good points...    [D'Avanzo] For instance...    [Mancino] To have consolidated democracy in the country at a  time when there was a rifle in every home.    [D'Avanzo] Very well, and what about the demerits?    [Mancino] Neglect of the increasing growth of organized  crime. We failed to see in time that the Mafia was turning into  a holding company.    [D'Avanzo] Do you not think that it is insufficient to talk  in terms of neglect, in view of the fact that one former  minister, Gava, is accused of associating with the Mafia and a  former prime minister, Andreotti, is accused of homicide and  Mafia activities?    [Mancino] If you think that neglect of such dangerous  phenomena is a small matter...    [D'Avanzo] In other words, you do not believe in [Mafia  boss]  Riina's kiss.    [Mancino] No, I do not.    [D'Avanzo] Minister, Sisde...    [Mancino] I will not discuss Sisde. I have done nothing else  for the past five months. That is enough, I am tired of it.  Misinformation obscures everything. I am accused of having  failed to carry out checks. What was I supposed to do? Was I  supposed to monitor things even before I became minister? When  I did become minister I brought back 14 billion lire to Sisde's  treasury, in accordance with the method determined by a judge.  I immediately informed the prime minister, Giulio Andreotti,  and a fortnight later [Sisde chief] Malpica was dismissed.    [D'Avanzo] But you are accused of having organized the  shelving of the inquiry...    [Mancino] That is untrue. The truth is that Malpica boasted  to his accomplices of my help and who knows what else. There  was no such help, nor could there have been.    [D'Avanzo] Malpica talks about certain meetings...    [Mancino] No. When confronted by other witnesses, Malpica  withdrew his statements about a meeting at the Quirinale Palace  [president's office], a meeting at the Foreign Ministry, and a  meeting with [police chief] Vincenzo Parisi. All that remained  was a telephone call. Well, that telephone call did take place.  I told Malpica to do what he thought right...    [D'Avanzo] [former Sisde chief] Broccoletti's defense  attorney Marazzita, told CORRIERE DELLA SERA: "The fact that  Mancino took 100 million lire a month is probably consistent  with his personality..."    [Mancino] What kind of answer do you expect me to give to  this Marazzita, who agreed to do a few little jobs for [former  Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi? Even though he sent  me a telegram of apology, I have already instructed my lawyers  to defend my honor...    [D'Avanzo] Are you suing him?    [Mancino] That is not decided. Maybe I will demand a billion  lire in damages from him. That will teach him how to act as an  attorney.    [D'Avanzo] Nevertheless, the Sisde trial...    [Mancino] I do not want to talk any more about Sisde... I do  not feel like the interior minister; I feel like a politician,  and I want to engage in politics again... When I came here the  situation was disastrous. Falcone had been killed, and  immediately afterward the Mafia killed Borsellino [both judges]  too. We were in disarray. Since then we have succeeded in  setting matters in order again. I will not now repeat things  and statistics which everyone should remember. The wanted  persons arrested, the operations, the arrests, the  investigations...    [D'Avanzo] On the subject of the Mafia, Occhetto has issued  a  warning: They are threatening the trade unions. Is the Mafia  still active, despite its defeats?    [Mancino] When you build something new, it is no surprise  when the old returns to life, violently. The Mafia does exist,  and it will continue to play a leading role now too by  guaranteeing support to certain political groups.    [D'Avanzo] Which?    [Mancino] It is said that in Sicily the tendency is toward  Forza Italia. But there is not only Forza Italia. There are no  certainties, but I am told that the Mafia will back new  political groupings and small, newly formed lists.    [D'Avanzo] Craxi too has issued a warning of his own. He is  talking about arrests, attacks, and murders. Is this a warning  or intimidation?    [Mancino] I do not want to go too far in rejecting Craxi's  forecasts, because we cannot assume that we are dealing with a  reckless person... I can say, however, that we have arranged  for the necessary vigilance and strengthened our protection.    [D'Avanzo] Are you happy even though there are people at  large that want to kill [Judge] Di Pietro?    [Mancino] The latest warning in his regard is a  controversial  matter and still remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, it  is true: There are some indications that must not be ignored.  The protection around Di Pietro has been very thorough for some  time, and it was further stepped up some time ago.</p>

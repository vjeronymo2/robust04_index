			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Roquefort sale decision likely within six weeks THE future of Roquefort, one of France's most famous cheeses, should be decided within the next six weeks when Nestle, the Swiss food group, concludes negotiations to sell its majority stake in Roquefort. Nestle, which earlier this year acquired a controlling 57 per cent stake in Roquefort as part of its successful takeover bid for Perrier mineral water, has been approached by a number of prospective purchasers including Besnier, Bongrain, Entremont and Bel, four leading French cheese producers. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group which is already a leading player in the European food sector, is also believed to have indicated interest in acquiring control of Roquefort, which is valued at between FFr1bn (Dollars 209m) and FFr1.5bn.</p>

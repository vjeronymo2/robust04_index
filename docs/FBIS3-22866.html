			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News" program] </F>   [Text] It has been disclosed that a retired Russian  Pacific Fleet nuclear submarine sank near a wharf in a port on  the outskirts of Vladivostok in mid-February. Although there is  no nuclear fuel aboard the submarine, it is equipped with  nuclear reactors. As a result, there are fears about the danger  of radiation pollution in the surrounding seas.    According to information given to NHK by concerned people in  Moscow and Vladivostok, it is a November-class retired nuclear  submarine, which was commissioned during the 1960's and belongs  to the Russian Pacific Fleet. In mid-February the submarine  sunk in water three meters deep near a wharf, where it was  anchored, at a ship-repair yard in Tajima Bay [as heard], which  is located in eastern part of Vladivostok. The site of the  accident is now covered with thick ice. All that is visible of  the submarine is its conning tower. The submarine is supported  all round by ice so there is currently no danger of it tipping  sideways.    There is no nuclear fuel aboard the aging submarine, which  was waiting to be scrapped. However, it is still equipped with  two nuclear reactors. As a result, concerned people say there  is a danger the surrounding seas may become polluted with  radiation when the ice starts to melt and the submarine tips  sideways allowing water to enter the reactors.    Eight years ago there was an accident, dubbed Chernobyl, in  Tajima Bay in the Maritime Kray in which a submarine sank and a  large quantity of radiation leaked. There was reportedly an  explosion in one of the nuclear submarine's reactors during work  to replace nuclear fuel rods.</p>

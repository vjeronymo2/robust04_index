			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MALASHOCK COMPANY AT LYCEUM SPACE  </P> <P> Former Tharp dancer John Malashock choreographs as if each piece were his last.  </P> <P> Even when his ideas are all over the map -- as they are in his new 25-minute  quartet, "Departure of the Youngsters" -- Malashock's sense of creative  brinkmanship generates excitement. And the dancing itself swoops and lunges  with enormous force from one unsparing confrontation to another.  </P> <P> Introduced Thursday at the Lyceum Space in Horton Plaza on a program of  otherwise familiar works, "Departure" focuses on the outcasts of society, with  mime and gesture motifs that suggest drug addicts and the homeless as well as  the physically handicapped and mentally ill. Malashock identifies fiercely with  their pain but, most of all, his piece seems to be about power and  manipulation.  </P> <P> Against a moody wash of woodwinds and percussion composed by Mark Attebery, one  or two of the dancers repeatedly enact rituals of anguish interrupted by others  who attempt to subdue and control their behavior but, increasingly, commit acts  of extreme brutality.  </P> <P> In one sequence, Malashock is literally shaken out of his near-catatonic  isolation and then abandoned. In another, Kate Lounsbury (a watchful authority  figure in the piece) and Malashock trap and terrorize Maj Xander. As they hold  her down, it isn't hard to imagine a straitjacket -- just as their hands  shooting past her face evoke the violent pulse of shock treatments.  </P> <P> Our helplessness in the face of human misery is powerfully depicted here, along  with the ruthless mindset that can evolve when humane attempts at social  engineering fail.  </P> <P> But Malashock is more committed to engulfing you in an experience than in  explaining his purposes. So, inevitably, there are moments of confusion (ours,  if not his) -- passages that even the combined skills of Xander, Lounsbury,  Debbie Toth and Malashock himself cannot untangle -- along with concepts that  seem part of another piece entirely.  </P> <P> Cultural analysts will recognize in Malashock the key characteristics of New  Romanticism: the exaltation of emotion over intellect (or form), an obsession  with the hopelessness of human relationships, the need to consume yourself in  your art. Malashock thus belongs to the generation after postmodernism, and  though he is still very young as a choreographer, nobody in Southern California  is growing as fast.  </P> <P> Malashock Dance Company performs through Sunday in Horton Plaza, and "Departure  of the Youngsters" is scheduled to be seen in Los Angeles on a "Dance  Kaleidoscope" program in July.

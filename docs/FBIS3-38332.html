			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Renzo Rosati: "But Will the Left Really Win?"] </F>   [Text] Although the polls make the progressive front  the favorite, the center is gaining strength, Lega's numbers are  dropping, and many voters are undecided.    The left will win--with a plurality of the votes--and the  new  government will be controlled by the PDS [Democratic Party of  the Left]. "This will mean that Carlo Azeglio Ciampi returns to  Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]," Davide Visani,  coordinator of the PDS secretariat and the number three person  at Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters, Rome] told PANORAMA, "so  that he can complete the transition to the new Republic. His  administration, however, should no longer be institutional in  character but political, and therefore our ministers and our  allies of the progressive front will be present in it." The PDS,  he said, would even want some of its current adversaries to  serve in the administration. "Specifically, representatives of  Mino Martinazzoli's Italian Popular Party [PPI] and Mario  Segni's Pact for Italy," Visani explained. "We draw the line  with regard to the Lega, Silvio Berlusconi, and the MSI [Italian  Social Movement]."    This time, at Botteghe Oscure, they are true believers. The  slogans are ready for the election campaign: "Defeat the  Blundering Right" and--more simply--"Now." The left's posters  bear a logo: no flowers or doves at all, just a logo. Someone  conceived the idea of stitching together a gigantic banner  bearing the pictures of Enrico Berlinguer and Palmiro Togliatti,  to be hung on the balcony; but to play it safe they may go back  to the usual drapery with the oak tree. "Today, however, we are  setting out on the road to victory," Visani adds.    Will the left--led by the heirs of the PCI [Italian  Communist  Party]--really be governing the Italy of the Second Republic? To  judge by the polls, that would appear to be the case. The major  research institutes consulted by PANORAMA--CIRM [Italian Center  for Market Research], SWG [Integrated Research Service], and  Diakron (see accompanying tables)--indicate that the left has  done very well in the initial surveys and is predicted to win as  much as 40 percent of the total vote. A share that ranges from  18 to 24 percent would go to a centrist group led by Segni;  between 26 and 36 percent to a center-right front that includes  Lega and Berlusconi's Forza Italia; and between 10 and 13  percent to the National Alliance of MSI Secretary Gianfranco  Fini.    There are many unknown quantities, however. "The principal  unknown quantity," declares Renato Mannheimer, an expert on  election trends, "is the fact that almost half of the population  has not yet decided for whom to vote. Until a few years ago, the  undecided were often those who wanted to keep their choices  secret. Today, however, the indecision is genuine, and the  forecasts could be turned upside down." CIRM Director Nicola  Piepoli agrees. "The proportion of undecideds--which I put at  around 30 percent--could overturn the forecasts. Moreover, these  people change their minds from time to time. Today, they are  aligned with the left, but within a week they could be lining up  with Segni and Berlusconi." In the opinion of Roberto Weber,  director of the SWG of Trieste, this uncertainty stems primarily  from two sources. "The election alliances are an unknown  quantity," he said. "So far there is only one coalition, that of  the left. The center and the right are not getting together.  Then there is the question: Who will be the candidates, and what  will they say to the people?"    Other unknown factors also adversely affect the forecasts.  First of all, the surveys are still being conducted by the old  proportional method rather than by the majority method; they  accordingly indicate the orientation of public opinion at the  national level but do not predict the effects within the  majority constituencies. There is one exception: Diakron of  Milan--which works for Forza Italia--has already developed a  model that translates the poll responses into parliamentary  seats and has applied it to the most recent CIRM poll presented  on 10 January in MILANO, ITALIA (see accompanying table). "In  fact," explains Diakron's Managing Director Gianni Pilo, "we had  already used a scenario similar to that of CIRM." Based on this  scenario, the left would elect 370 deputies--an absolute  majority--and could therefore govern alone.    Is this a credible forecast? Visani dismisses it out of  hand.  "It is a device used by Berlusconi to terrorize the public," he  says. "Terrorism? How so?" Pilo retorts. "It is rather that the  survey takes into consideration only the variable that is most  favorable for the left, namely, a scenario in which the  progressives are united while the Catholics are separated from  the other moderate forces. We have obtained different  percentages, however. If the moderates were to form a coalition,  they would win an additional hundred or so seats and thereby  overturn or equalize the results."    Here, then, is another element of uncertainty. It would not  be a battle between two opposing forces--left versus right,  social democrats versus free-enterprise democrats--but rather a  three-way contest among a left coalition; a Catholic center that  is basically heir to the DC [Christian Democratic Party]; and a  center-right coalition. It would, in fact, be a four-way  contest, if you add the rightist forces of Fini. "But then we  would find ourselves again with the same old parties!" declares  the former assistant editor of IL GIORNALE, Federico Orlando.  His is a voice that is certainly not suspect, in view of his  support for Segni and of his resignation--together with that of  Indro Montanelli--in a dispute with Berlusconi.    How are the parties organized? For a two-way contest or for  a  fragmented contest? And can a party that falls behind get back  on top? "The PDS is unquestionably in an advantageous position,"  agrees Stefano Draghi--for years the PCI's campaign strategist  and currently PDS group leader in the Milan municipal  government--who spent the summer in London studying the British  electoral system in the British Library, "at Table G-17," he  says, "where Karl Marx wrote DAS KAPITAL." "We are at the center  of the left," he explains. "We are not yet facing an adversary  who represents the leadership of the right. We are able to field  high-quality candidates. We have the capacity to increase our  membership. We are present throughout Italy: in the areas where  we are strong, we shall have the Oak Tree [symbol of the PDS]  with its thickets. Elsewhere, we shall support our allies."  Specifically, however, how is the PDS conducting its campaign?  The task force [preceding two words in English] that is  coordinating the campaign is composed of Visani himself; Mauro  Zani, the official in charge of organization; Massimo D'Alema,  leader of the PDS deputies; and Giuseppe Chiaranti (a D'Alema  ally) and Umberto Ranieri (a Migliori ally), respectively leader  and assistant leader of the PDS senators. Ranieri, however, is  under investigation in connnection with the Naples subway  contracts.    "The coalition of the left," Visani says, "will range from  the Democratic Alliance [AD] to Communist Renewal. In the  north--where we are competing against the Lega--we hope to  involve former DC members as well. There will be an accord with  respect to the platform, but not with respect to the  government," he explains, so as to avoid embarrassing Rete and  Communist Renewal, which are opposed to Ciampi. "The leaders  will test their strength within the majority constituencies," he  adds. Some candidates are already being considered: Achille  Occhetto and Nilde Iotti in Rome and D'Alema in Bari. In the  Milan electoral districts, the progressives will run the  clinician Renato Boeri; Rete leader Nando Dalla Chiesa; and the  industrialist Franco Morganti. For his part, Dalla Chiesa would  like to sponsor the candidacies of the journalists Giampaolo  Pansa, co-editor of L'ESPRESSO, and Corrado Stajano. "Nothing is  definite," Visani says. The PDS will then propose a mechanism to  ensure that the results in the majority constituencies will be  reflected proportionately on all the tickets of the left. It  remains to be seen whether the allies will agree to this or  whether they will view it as a "protective coating." Communist  Renewal, in fact, boasts of its strength in Turin, Milan, Rome,  and Tuscany, and Rete does the same with respect to the south.  "And we," says AD's Walter Bordon, "are a decisive factor in  Trieste, in Genoa, and on the Adriatic coast."    What is happening on the other fronts? On Thursday, 13  January, Segni made another overture to Lega. There are many who  swear that, in the end, not even Segni will be able to remain  aloof from a clash between right and left. The battle plan will  be presented at a meeting to be held on 5 February in the EUR  [Roman Universal Exposition] convention center. At the present  time, his organization is in good shape in Latium, Tuscany,  Campania, Lombardy, and Venetia as well as in Sardinia where  Segni will be a candidate in the Sassari district. The  representatives of the Pact for Italy will be chosen by a system  of primaries and self-promoted candidacies supported by citizen  petitions. Segni believes that the rift between Berlusconi and  Montanelli--and the pope's appeal to Catholics--may have  increased his support by 2 percent. This theory is contradicted  by Diakron, which says, "Nothing has changed."    The polls, however, indicate that the center is growing in  strength--and that the Lega is in decline. "What is being  revealed," says Weber, "is a party that benefited from the old  system of proportional representation--a party that has been  unable to find charismatic candidates." It is a void which the  leaders of Forza Italia say they are ready to fill, and they  have selected the electoral districts in Venetia, Liguria, and  Piedmont in which to run their own candidates by agreement with  the Lega. In the south, Berlusconi's movement is seeking to ally  itself with the lay Catholic centrists. SWG and CIRM are not  generous toward Forza Italia, but Mannheimer does not agree. "In  my opinion," he says, "it has a 10 to 15 percent share of the  electorate."    A poll conducted by SWG for FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA, however,  indicates that if the prime minister were chosen by direct  election, Berlusconi would get 25.8 percent of the vote,  compared to 22 percent for Segni and 18.6 percent for Occhetto.  This time, however, the great national festival will be  fragmented into many local contests. "Only 18,000 families will  be needed to elect one deputy," Piepoli points out. A study made  by SCR [expansion unknown] Associates marketing [preceding word  in English] agency offers advice. "The candidates," it says,  "should base their campaign on the personalization of their  message, on direct communication, and on their ability to  attract the attention of the media. A strong effort will be  needed to establish genuine rapport with the public." SCR  estimates the cost of the campaign at 320 billion lire, with  approximately 4,000 candidates in the field. The ceiling  established by law is 100 million lire per candidate. "It is an  investment that should be entrusted to experts," SCR says.  Door-to-door canvassing, electoral marketing [preceding word in  English], and American-style consultants are making their debut  in Italy. In the end, will these techniques enable the left or  the right to win?  <H5>  [Box, p 17] </H5> <H5>  A Comparison of Forecasts </H5>   We present separately the results of the three most recent  voter polls conducted by public opinion survey institutes,  together with the unofficial PDS forecasts (all data are in  percentages). In the week preceding 10 January, CIRM interviewed  a total of 4,129 persons. The SWG survey--valid as of 4  January--is based on 5,600 interviews. Diakron--which works for  Forza Italia--conducted its poll between 7 and ll January.  Noteworthy in the CIRM survey is the seesaw performance of Forza  Italia (which stood at 10 and 16 percent in the two previous  surveys). SWG provides a comparison with October: the figures  for the PDS are stable; the AD-Greens-Rete coalition, the Pact  for Italy-PPI alliance, and the National Alliance show increases  while Communist Renewal and Lega show decreases (Forza Italia  was not included in the survey). In Diakron's previous  survey--which was conducted between 13 and 21 December--the PDS  received 19.3 percent, Communist Renewal 4.8 percent, the PSI  [Italian Socialist Party] 2.1 percent, Rete 4.0 percent, the  Greens 5.4 percent, and the AD 2.8 percent (for a total of 38.4  percent attributable to the left coalition); the PPI 6.9 percent  and the Pact for Italy 11.5 percent (for a total of 18.4  percent); and Forza Italia 10.4 percent, Pannella 2.7 percent,  Lega 15.1 percent, and the Laics 3.0 percent (for a total of  31.2 percent attributable to the center-right coalition); and  the National Alliance 11.2 percent.    Although the PDS has not yet set up its own polling system,  the expert Stefano Draghi is developing a new model. Its  forecasts do not differ greatly from those of CIRM and SWG: the  progressive coalition is credited with 40 to 42 percent, with  the PDS accounting for half of the total. The Greens show an  increase, Communist Renewal remains stationary at 6 percent,  while the AD accounts for the smallest share of the coalition's  total. Among the coalition's adversaries, the Lega registers a  decline--to approximately 14 percent--and likewise Forza Italia  which, after having surpassed 10 percent, "is on a downward  curve." The centrist forces of Mino Martinazzoli and Mario Segni  register an upward trend--to 20 percent--while an increase to 15  percent is forecast for the National Alliance.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CIRM Poll                                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PDS                                   |23                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Renewal                               |6                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Greens, Rete, AD, Other allies        |11                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Subtotal                              |40                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PPI/Pact for Italy                    |23                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Subtotal                              |23                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lega                                  |16                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Forza Italia                          |6                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other forces                          |5                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Subtotal                              |27                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National Alliance                     |10                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Subtotal                              |10                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SWG Poll                                                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PDS                                   |20                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Renewal                               |5                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Greens, Rete, AD, other allies        |12                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |&gt;

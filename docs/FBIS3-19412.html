			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This afternoon the Spanish foreign minister  explained the fishing agreement that was reached last night in  the European Union. [Javier] Solana says that it was the most  difficult negotiation in his life. He added that Spain had to  fight alone to defend its interests, and that with this  agreement our fishing fleet is truly integrated into that of the  Community.    In order to finish the enlargement negotiations a compromise  still has to be found regarding the most difficult topic,  institutional reform, the minority blocking vote. Concerning  this issue, Solana hopes to reach an interrim and balanced  formula. Over to Pedro Fernandez Cespedes.    [Fernandez Cespedes] Good evening. The Spanish foreign  minister believes it probable that there will be an agreement  next Tuesday [22 March] concerning the blocking minority because  he hopes that a compromise formula will succeed. It will be  somewhere between that of the other Community members who favor  the figure of 27 votes to block a Community decision and the  Spanish position which goes along with the 27 votes but wants to  keep the figure 23 for certain topics as long as the 23  represent three countries with more than 100 million Community  citizens.    There are difficult days of negotiations ahead, days when  Spain will be alone says the minister, Javier Solana, but the  negotiations are going to be full of hope.    [Begin Solana recording] We have a constructive spirit, we  want to defend our interests and a certain type of European  construction. But we are working constructively. If the others  also work in this constructive fashion, I am sure we will find a  solution. [end Solana recording]    [Fernandez Cespedes] Javier Solana believes that Spain is  now  stronger after the fishing negotiation with Norway, a  negotiation that has proved useful for Portugal too. He  believes that we have met with the understanding and the respect  of our Community partners and that we do not have to trumpet our  triumphs as Norway does, because we are not under pressure of a  referendum.    [Begin Solana recording] We do not need that. We can speak  clearly, without exaggerating or making a song and dance about  it all. We have negotiated well, we did as well as possible.  We tried to defend the interests of our country and I think we  have managed to do so. [end Solana recording]</p>

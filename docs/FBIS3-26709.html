Party  committees and government at all levels must attach great  importance to rural work and show genuine concern for the  livelihood of the peasants to protect and further mobilize their  initiative.    From 5 to 9 February, Wen Jiabao called on peasants in  impoverished villages, areas around the reservoir, and Yu  nationality villages in Gutian, Bingnan, Zhouning, and Fuan  Counties. He inquired of cadres about the peasants' livelihood  and agricultural production conditions.    Wen Jiabao said: This year will be crucial for reform of the  economic structure. The fundamental tasks in the countryside  are: To conscientiously implement guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  Central Conference on Rural Work; stabilize the party's basic  policy for rural areas; deepen rural reform; further mobilize  the peasants' initiative to promote rural economic growth and  increase their income; to promote social stability in rural  areas; and to lay a solid foundation -- and create an excellent  environment -- for the smooth implementation of the major reform  measures and the sustained, healthy, rapid development of the  national economy.    Wen Jiabao stressed: China is a big agricultural country  where peasants account for 80 percent of the population.  Exercising effective leadership over work in rural areas and  strengthening the role of agriculture as the foundation of the  national economy will have a direct bearing on the overall  situation of economic construction and on the overall stability  of society. Leadership at all levels in charge of rural work  must always have the peasants in mind, show concern for them at  every turn, depend on them in everything, and seek to increase  the benefits of the peasants in everything they do. We should  respect the peasants' creative spirit, pay close attention to  their immediate interests, help them solve their difficulties in  daily life, and do a good job in guiding, protecting, and  mobilizing their initiative. At present, we should do all we  can to promote the rural economy, increase the peasants' income,  continue efforts to reduce burdens imposed on peasants, improve  public order in rural areas, and provide technical and  information services to peasants. We must care about the people  in old revolutionary base areas, areas inhabited by minority  nationalities, poverty-stricken areas, disaster-ridden areas,  and areas around the reservoir, and help them in making  arrangements for production and livelihood.    Wen Jiabao said: The season for spring plowing is around the  corner. We must prepare well for spring production by helping  the peasants formulate and implement production plans and by  organizing ample supplies of means of agricultural production  like chemical fertilizers, chemicals, farm machinery, and diesel  oil in order to reap another good harvest; and to ensure amply  supply and stable prices of vegetables, grains, and edible oils.</p>

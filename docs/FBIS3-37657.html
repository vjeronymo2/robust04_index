Churkin made the statement in Moscow Friday [18  February] upon his arrival from Yugoslavia.    The Russian initiative has made it possible to settle the  crisis around Sarajevo, said Churkin.    At the same time Churkin did not rule out the possibility of  new problems for a political settlement around Sarajevo. Among  them he named the likelihood of acts of terrorism. Churkin  believes inadmissible the situation when the responsibility for  the explosion at the Sarajevo market was immediately put on the  Serbs. But, Churkin said, he would not like to whitewash the  Serbs, since the Serbs launched hundreds of missiles against  Sarajevo.    The second danger is that the Moslems may improve their  positions and even launch a large-scale offensive. This danger,  believes Churkin, is not great since this could be a challenge  to the world community.    The third danger, he believes, is that some NATO officials  think that it is necessary to hold talks and make air strikes  simultaneously. Churkin believes this point of view is wrong  and may break the negotiations. However, he said, the stand is  not prevailing.    Churkin also denied the rumours on the possible deployment  of  the Russian troops in Macedonia and said that the possibility  had not been discussed and was not on the agenda.</p>

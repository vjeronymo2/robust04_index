			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Why Rover has had to lead a dog's life Deals versus relationships haslong summed up the contrast in styles between the Anglo-American corporate culture and the powerful industrial economies of Germany and Japan. Now, with the global securities markets awash with American money and Germany and Japan both deep in recession and, arguably, facing a secular loss of momentum, the dealmakers are coming into their own. That is one important aspect of the sale of Rover to BMW. Honda's partnership with Rover has apparently worked amazingly well,enabling the British company to revolutionise its production facilities and upgrade the quality of its products almost beyond recognition. But it was always a risky route for Honda, a second-line Japanese company that could not afford the direct entry to Europe which Nissan and Toyota preferred. Now British Aerospace wants to deal its way out of the car industry, for reasons which seem scarcely more understandable than the motives which prompted it to deal its way in five years ago. It has made a good profit out of the trade - no doubt sufficient justification. Ironically Honda is being supplanted by a company from Germany, from a corporate culture which, like that of Japan, has relied heavily on cross-shareholdings and semi-formal relationships. BMW itself insisted in 1990, for instance, on buying a small stake in Rolls-Royce to cement symbolically the two groups' aero-engine partnership. But Honda's 20 per cent stake in Rover has given it little security. It could be that BMW is becoming influenced by its international institutional shareholders, just as Daimler-Benz, in more straitened financial circumstances, agreed to seek a New York listing and adopt US accounting standards last year. Portfolio managers like to have clear-cut investments; messy relationships and cross-holdings do not fit into this picture at all. This deal will extend BMW's status as a European motor stock (though its German focus may be blurred slightly) and will enable BAe to be more clearly positioned as an arms and aerospace group. The share prices of both BAe and BMW rose sharply. We can expect many more transactions of this type in future. There are almost unlimited market funds available to support divisional deals between companies, although stock market valuations are so high that it is rarely possible for companies to consider full-scale takeovers - that is, buying shares directly from investors. Where Rover itself will come out of this is another matter. The car group has been financially abused on an amazing scale over thepast 30 years: pushed by the British government into unworkable mergers, then nationalised, eventually denationalised into transitory British ownership when anAmerican deal seemed politically too controversial, but finally sold to a German company for a quick turnround profit. It's a dog's life, it seems, if you are called Rover. Does Rover's exit symbolise the failure of the British system of corporate ownership and governance? After all, BMW was itself in a desperate state in the early 1960s, but was transformed. Now it is just one of three big German-owned motor groups, whereas the UK will in future have none. Theinstitutionally-owned British stock market simply moved off in a different direction to the German market, which historically, at least, was more under the control of industrial interests and banks. The industrial climate in the UK had to change fundamentally before big motor companies became easily manageable. However, British shares on average have delivered exceptional returns over the past 10 or 15 years, better than those of German companies. Two of those three German car groups have been making big losses. Certainly the British corporate culture is open to short-termist criticism: the British have reasoned that the only way to make money out of cars is to wheel and deal in the companies that make them. However, the price in practice has not been the loss of a British car manufacturing industry, just the loss of control. As German companies come more and more under the influence of global investors, the question is where exactly that control is passing to. The Germans, as well as the Japanese, need to reassess their relationships.</p>

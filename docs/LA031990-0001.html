			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> $10-MILLION LITTLE BOY;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: SERIOUSLY ILL CHILDREN LIKE RICHARD HALL WILL BE ABLE TO GET HELP  FROM TOP SPECIALISTS WHEN A NEW DIAGNOSTIC CENTER OPENS MARCH 26.  </P> <P> Richard Hall, the $10-million boy, doesn't pay much attention as the doctors  seated in the auditorium at Ventura County Medical Center listen in awe to the  story of his difficult, terribly expensive struggle against life-threatening  birth defects.  </P> <P> Richard, after all, is only 6 and, as his father, Navy Lt. Bert A. Hall, puts  it, "He's pretty much recovered by now. Mainly, we just have to watch him."  </P> <P> Richard's story is one of a family's determination to save a child's life. It  also helps illustrate the need for a center in Ventura County where seriously  ill children can be diagnosed by top specialists from throughout Southern  California.  </P> <P> Such a facility will open March 26 -- the County Medical Center's Pediatric  Diagnostic Center, at 3400 Loma Vista Road in Ventura, across the street from  the medical center's main building.  </P> <P> At least 18 pediatric specialists from the UCLA and USC medical schools,  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and other highly regarded universities and  hospitals will visit the new center regularly to advise patients and their  physicians. The visitors' expertise will include cardiology, allergies, plastic  surgery, neurosurgery and child psychology.  </P> <P> On Jan. 24, 1984, when Richard was born 10 weeks early at VCMC, no such program  existed here. Richard, who could neither breathe nor take nourishment  unassisted, had to travel thousands of miles, mainly to Los Angeles and San  Diego, often for examinations that could have been conducted locally had the  new center existed.  </P> <P> "Mainly, Richard had two things wrong with him," said his mother, Maria, 33, as  the family was interviewed after a meeting with members of the hospital staff.  </P> <P> "First, he had a laryngeal cleft, or a hole in the voice box area. Second, the  wall was missing that was supposed to separate his trachea and his esophagus.  The trachea carries air to the lungs; the esophagus carries food to the  stomach.  </P> <P> "Before we were through, he had to have 18 operations, mostly at Children's  Hospital in San Diego. At first, the surgery was to keep him alive by inserting  tubes in him. Later, there was a series of operations to repair the missing  wall and cleft.  </P> <P> "In the first two years, our medical bills totaled about $5 million. That's  when we quit counting. Today, they must come to at least $10 million." Most of  this, she said, was paid by the family's military health insurance. A state  agency, California Children's Services, took care of the rest, sometimes by  persuading doctors and hospitals to reduce their fees.  </P> <P> Richard's father, Bert Hall, 39, an aircraft maintenance officer at Point Mugu  Naval Air Station, where the family lives, said that, because of Richard's  weakened lungs, he caught pneumonia about 50 times.  </P> <P> "And about as often as that he quit breathing, and my wife and I had to bring  him back with cardiopulmonary resuscitation," Hall said.  </P> <P> For three years, Hall said, neither he nor his wife got much sleep. "We stayed  up all night listening for mucus to collect in Richard's throat. Sometimes it  happened six times an hour. We'd rush in and clear it out with a little suction  machine. If we didn't, he'd choke."  </P> <P> Even Richard's brother, William, now 10, learned to use the suction device so  he could lend a hand.  </P> <P> Now, Richard's primary treatment is medication prescribed by Dr. Christopher  Landon, director of the new diagnostic center and head of pediatrics at VCMC.  Richard has recovered to the point where he's in kindergarten at Laguna Vista  Elementary School in Oxnard, where his brother, William, is a fourth-grader.  </P> <P> Landon was so eager to open the new diagnostic center -- it's in a  3,000-square-foot building that formerly housed a physical therapy facility --  that he took out a personal loan to finance the center.  </P> <P> "Eventually, the county will pay me back out of hospital bed fees," he said.  "I'm not concerned about that."  </P> <P> Landon estimated that more than 10,000 children a year will be treated and  diagnosed in the new center. A clinic that formerly served half as many  patients is being phased out, he said.  </P> <P> Landon and the Halls credited a Navy pediatrician, Cmdr. Michael Hurwitz, with  guiding the family through much of the maze of hospitals and specialists with  which they dealt. For his part, Hurwitz, who is stationed at the Naval  Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme, praised the Halls for being  "marvelous -- and that includes William."  </P> <P> "I'm sure," Hurwitz added, "the Halls would have been saved a great deal of  travel, distress and risk if we'd had this new diagnostic center at the time.  In a case like Richard's, you can do some consulting by phone, but the  specialists really need to see the child in person."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- A Japanese auto industry  leader Thursday [17 March] reacted strongly to a remark by U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in which he sought government  guarantees of Japanese automakers' plans to expand purchases of  U.S. auto parts.    Yutaka Kume, head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association [AMA], told reporters that Kantor's comment, made  earlier in the week, would dampen Japanese carmakers' efforts to  help put Japan's trade ties with the United States back on a  normal footing. Referring to a remark by International Trade  and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai calling on Japanese  automakers to quickly make public their auto parts purchase  plans, Kume said it is an individual corporate problem and not a  government issue.    Kume, who is also president of Nissan Motor Co., Japan's No.  2 automaker, said the government should not comment on  carmakers' plans, as this tends to cause misunderstanding.</p>

He said, "We look at  the situation as very serious. To find a way out from this  crisis as soon as possible, the government should do whatever is  in its power." Yamagishi also indicated he would ask the  government to formulate Japan's own action program containing  market liberalization measures, and measures to expand domestic  demand to reduce the trade surplus in March as a measure to  effect a new turn in Japan-U.S. economic negotiations.    Regarding the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks, Yamagishi said, "I respect the fact that Japan said no to  the United States (its demand for setting numerical targets),  but we need measures to reconcile Japan and the United States as  soon as possible. We certainly hope the government will  continue to work on this."</p>

(Cablelabs) of the United States to develop  digital signal transmission technology for North American cable  television systems. The agreement calls for the two parties to  join hands in developing and standardizing a technique called  16VSB -- vestigal sideband -- which is suitable for high volume  data transmission, the leading audiovisual equipment maker said  in a press release.    Digital signal transmission technology is viewed as a key  element that will play a part in the next-generation digital  CATV network, it said.    Under the agreement, Pioneer will be responsible for  development of transmission technology and special  semiconductors, and Cablelabs will provide technical facilities  and testing assistance, the company said. Pioneer said it  expects results by the spring of 1995.    Cablelabs is a research and development consortium of Cable  Television System Operators representing more than 85 percent of  cable subscribers in the U.S.    The U.S. cable television industry is moving forward in  building a next-generation CATV system for the so-called  "Information Superhighway" championed by the administration of  President Bill Clinton.</p>

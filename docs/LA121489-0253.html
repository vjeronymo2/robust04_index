			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BUCHWALD'S SUIT COMING TO TRIAL  </P> <P> Trial was scheduled to get under way today in a $5-million lawsuit filed by  humorist Art Buchwald against Paramount Pictures over the film "Coming to  America."  </P> <P> According to the lawsuit filed in November, 1988, the motion picture was  inspired by and based upon a movie treatment written by Buchwald.  </P> <P> The Pulitzer-prize winning columnist and author claims he created the concept  in 1983 about a handsome, wealthy and spoiled young African king who comes to  the United States.  </P> <P> The columnist claims the story line called for the king to lose his title and  money to his brother in a coup, forcing him to live in an American ghetto and  work in a fast-food restaurant. During his stay, he falls in love with a  beautiful woman and makes her his queen when he is reinstated as the monarch of  his country.  </P> <P> But actor Eddie Murphy, who starred in the movie, has said he came up with the  idea for "Coming to America," which grossed more than $128 million in 1988. The  film is about an African prince named Akeem who comes to New York, lives in a  slum, gets a job at a fast-food restaurant, meets the woman of his dreams and  returns to his country, where he marries the woman.  </P></p>

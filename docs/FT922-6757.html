			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Czechoslovakia makes bold leap to people's capitalism: In a couple of months two out of three citizens will be shareholders in ex-state enterprises IN THE basement of the federal statistics office in Prague, at the end of a dark corridor littered with empty cardboard boxes, a computer is busy calculating the wishes of 8.5m people. Throughout the summer, the large Digital computer will be allocating the shares of more than 3,000 state-owned enterprises to Czechs and Slovaks who earlier this year subscribed to the mass privatisation scheme launched by the Czechoslovak government. In the space of a couple of months, the unique scheme will turn two out of three citizens into shareholders and make more than half the country's state-owned enterprises private. The rule of the game is speed: the aim is to privatise fast, using book value to set the price of an enterprise's equity and to create a mass of shareholders who, ideally, will then exercise control over the enterprises. If it works, policy-makers say, the model privatisation handbook for former communist countries will be able to be written, based on the Czechoslovak experience. But a number of problems could arise as the scheme unfolds. Since last autumn, government officials in Czechoslovakia have been turning grey trying to unravel a myriad of privatisation projects. In the Czech republic alone, 10,000 projects for 2,500 enterprises have been prepared at government request by managers, deputy directors, employees or outside investors. The average enterprise is expected to offer about 60 per cent of its equity to the voucher programme. But enterprises may offer up to 97 per cent with a minimum of 3 per cent of their equity set aside for the restitution fund. This fund compensates former owners who were illegally expropriated by the communist regime. There are also various forms of partial privatisation, including direct sales to a local or foreign investors, public auctions or sale to other parties such as employees, management or municipalities. A total of 292.6bn korunas (Dollars 9.7bn) in equity will be distributed in the form of vouchers. Of this amount, 185.3bn korunas belongs to enterprises in the Czech republic and 93.5bn to Slovak enterprises with the remaining 13.8bn representing equity in properties owned by the federal authorities. This equity will be distributed to 8.5m citizens who subscribed to the scheme by buying a book of vouchers for 1,000 korunas, the equivalent of a week's salary for the average employee. In nominal terms, every voucher book should be worth 30,000 korunas in equity, calculated on a book value basis. Actual values however could differ significantly once market prices are established. Last Monday, voucher holders begun choosing the shares they want to receive. A first allocation of shares is planned early next month in instances where the demand for shares matches the offer of vouchers. Enterprises for which the demand surpasses the supply of vouchers by more than 25 per cent, however, will be re-offered for higher bids. A total of five bidding rounds is planned and the whole process could take until the autumn. Confused by the choice of enterprises and often lacking basic information, two-thirds of investors have entrusted their vouchers to private investment funds who which will select enterprises for them. More than 400 funds have been created in recent months to benefit from the privatisation programme but the bulk of vouchers are concentrated in the 10 biggest. The most popular funds belong to the Czech or Slovak banks, but other funds set up by private entrepreneurs have successfully wooed a large number of voucher holders by offering a guaranteed ten-fold cash return in a year's time. Such promises have raised eyebrows in government circles, however, and could provoke a liquidity crisis if the newly-privatised shares have to be sold to raise the cash to honour such promises and meet operational costs. In an economy where quality assets are rare, the pressure to sell could endanger the nascent stock market. It could also allow foreign investors to buy equity cheaply - a possibility that could meet political resistance at a later stage. A functioning, liquid secondary market will be needed to allow shareholders to concentrate their stakes and build up controlling stakes in enterprises. This stage will be crucial to facilitate the much-needed restructuring of Czechoslovak enterprises. The speed of the privatisation process has met domestic resistance, with critics claiming that the government should have allowed more time for restructuring. But Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister who is the political godfather of the Czechoslovak privatisation programme, recently summed up the argument for speed. Any strategy, he said, was better than leaving enterprises in the current paralysing grip of 'pre-privatisation agonies' where they were accumulating debts with other enterprises and selling vital assets just to pay wage bills as the enterprises crumble around them.</p>

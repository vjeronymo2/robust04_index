			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BENEFIT GALA HERALDS ART FAIR  </P> <P> The fourth International Contemporary Art Fair opened Wednesday night at the  L.A. Convention Center with a gala preview that could only have taken place in  the turbulent art world of 1989.  </P> <P> Three of the most important developments this year in the world art market were  mirrored there: skyrocketing prices for blue-chip collectible art, the toll  that AIDS continues to take in the American art community, and controversy over  government funding for the arts.  </P> <P> Opening night was a benefit for the Los Angeles Pediatric AIDS Consortium, a  collection of clinics and hospitals that treat mothers and children with  acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> "Freedom of expression in this country is under attack," Mayor Tom Bradley said  in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Art fair director Brian Angel greeted guests and  benefit chairman Doug Cramer presented an award to Councilman Joel Wachs, who  fought for passage of a city endowment for the arts and an end to AIDS  discrimination in the city. Also honored were British artists Gilbert &amp;  George, whose contributions to the fight against AIDS included $1 million  raised from one exhibit alone.  </P> <P> Inside, art collectors moved quickly from booth to booth.  </P> <P> "We've seen a lot of stuff we love -- all with signs that say Sold," said  collectors Peter and Eileen Norton, taking a snack break at the fair's lavish  buffet. Fair organizer Charlie Scheips was more sanguine, sipping a drink and  dealing with constant interruptions from his walkie-talkie.  </P> <P> "The hard job is over," he said, "and now it's time to have a party."  </P></p>

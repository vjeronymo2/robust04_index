			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Whirlpool Corporation stated that it is standard practice to spray condensate produced by the evaporator onto the condenser coil. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 9). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because most, if not all, manufacturers incorporate the spraying of condensate into their room air conditioners, the Department did not analyze condensate spray as a design option. Baseline models for each of the product classes are assumed to include condensate spray in their designs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Improving the air system efficiency can be accomplished either by increasing the fan or fan motor efficiency. In a room air conditioner, both the evaporator and condenser fans are driven by one fan motor. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that increases in air system efficiency are limited because of the following: Configuration constraints due to the compact design of room air units; standardization of air system components because the industry's supply comes almost entirely from a single vendor; lower fan motor efficiencies that occur because the room air unit design is optimized at fan speeds other than the point of maximum motor efficiency; and air system designs which must limit noise levels. In addition, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that fan motor efficiency is not expected to increase significantly by the year 1995. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also stated that reductions in restrictions to air flow can be made only by increasing the space available for air flow. Major increases in cost would be associated with such a change as it would necessitate an increase in the chassis of the room air conditioner. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 16&hyph;19). Whirlpool Corporation repeated much of what the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated and, in addition, stated that the use of separate fan motors would require significant redesign and increase the product cost. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 11). Natural Resources Defense Council said that DOE should add improved air flow past coils as a design option. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy recommended that DOE treat fan and fan motor efficiency separately. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its analysis of increasing the air system efficiency, the Department analyzed only improvements that could be made to the fan motor. The data from fan manufacturers did not provide information on the effect of different fan types on air system efficiency in a room air conditioner application. Therefore, the Department did not analyze improvements due to changes in the fan efficiency. The Department agrees with the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's comment regarding restrictions to air flow. Increasing the space available for air flow can be accomplished only by enlarging the chassis size. In the analysis of increased coil face areas where the cabinet size had to be increased, increases in system efficiency were assumed to be a result not only of the enlarged coil, but also the improvement in air flow resulting from the larger cabinet. Therefore, improvements in the air flow past the coils are inherently considered in the analysis of increased coil face areas. The Department utilized data obtained from fan motor manufacturers to determine efficiency increases and the associated incremental costs for improving the efficiency of fan motors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation commented that most room air conditioner manufacturers use rotary compressors. Improvements beyond the currently available efficiency of 11.0 energy efficiency ratio are expected to be small. They also stated that higher efficiency scroll compressors might be suitable for larger capacity room air units. But use of scroll compressors would significantly increase the cost of room air conditioners. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 19, 20; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 11). Natural Resources Defense Council said that DOE should disaggregate the design option of improving the compressor efficiency into motor efficiency, volumetric efficiency, reduced mechanical resistance in pumps, and alternate compressor designs. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department took into account data from both room air conditioner and compressor manufacturers when determining the available efficiency increase in compressors. The data indicated that most room air conditioners use rotary compressors and that the maximum energy efficiency ratio for compressors of this type is 11.0. Other compressor types were also analyzed. New technologies for reciprocating compressors with capacities exceeding 17,000 Btu/h have pushed energy efficiency ratios past 11.0. These reciprocating compressors were considered for the two largest capacity classes of room air conditioners. Scroll compressors were also considered, but for the compressor capacities in the range used in room air conditioner units, energy efficiency ratios did not exceed 11.0. Compressor manufacturers indicated that there is a high probability that compressor energy efficiency ratios ranging from 11.5 to 12.0 would be available by the year 1995. Based on this information, compressor efficiencies of this magnitude were analyzed by the Department. In response to Natural Resources Defense Council's comment, compressor manufacturers increase compressor efficiency by improving the performance of these individual components. Data for the impact of component improvements are not available but, component improvements are reflected in higher compressor energy efficiency ratios. Therefore, the Department is analyzing the compressor as a whole rather than attempting to analyze individual components. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Markets: Psychology gains the upper hand - London If you want a nice, restful weekend, please turn the page. Still here? Steel yourself for the chart on the right and some of the analysts' comments that follow. Equities took an unnerving turn for the worse this week in London and New York. Thus far in the markets' eight-week fall, most analysts had resorted to rational explanations: key conditions, notably US monetary policy, had changed; the markets would quickly accommodate and stabilise at lower levels, they argued. But psychology has now taken the upper hand, squelching fundamentals. Falling share prices seem to have gained an ominous momentum of their own. The rumblings are louder on Wall Street than in the City but the UK markets are still taking their lead from the US. The FT-SE 100 index racked up a net loss of 42.6 points on the week closing at 3,086.4. It has now given up its entire 440-point gain since last November's budget. Gilt prices, however, drawing some comfort from a successful auction of floating rate bonds, edged a little higher. This is prime time for pundits. Nick Knight, Nomura's London strategist, said the FT-SE 100 was heading for 2,800. Robin Aspinall, of Panmure Gordon, had been forecasting that level since last November. 'It seemed a phenomenal distance away only a few weeks ago. Now it doesn't' On Wall Street, Ms Elaine Garzarelli, Lehman Brothers' influential equities analyst, said the Dow Jones industrial average was only halfway through a 15 per cent correction. Wall Street prices duly tumbled. 'Investors go through three phases in a stock market decline: complacency, concern and capitulation. We have just entered concern. Capitulation is ahead,' said Byron Wein, a leading US analyst with Morgan Stanley. Retail investors in particular are vulnerable to losing their nerve. On both sides of the Atlantic, they had swarmed into equities as interest rates fell. Now rates are rising and equities falling, some will be tempted to preserve slender gains, or forestall further losses, by selling shares. Stability has to be achieved at some point, but how far down is the bottom of the market? The accompanying chart shows what happened to the FT-A index of European stocks in the corrections 1987, 1990 and so far this year. Mark Howdle, chief European strategist at JP Morgan, does not believe the drop will be anywhere near as steep as 1987 when a financial bubble burst, or even 1990 when the Gulf War unseated markets. But he thinks the current bottom could be another 5 to 10 percentage points below here. The pattern is instructive. About a month into a downturn, stock markets usually manage a feeble rebound, then continue to fall for another month or two. After that, they bump along for many more months trying to build a firm enough psychological and fundamentals base from which to rally. Aspinall, one of City's most irascible bears, agrees with the pattern but believes the bottom will be even lower. He has long advocated that the run up in stocks last year was liquidity driven. Now that the 'cascade of cash' is dwindling, stocks have a long way to retreat. 'Valuations are are still too high in my view of the world. Low inflation and low growth are not good news for equities.' Those analysts trying to hang on to fundamentals point, for example, to the 4 per cent historic dividend yield which the Footsie will offer if it falls to 2,900. But even so, they admit, a change in psychology would also be needed before enthusiastic equity buying resumes. 'It's been a horrible quarter,' said Mark Tinker, an equity strategist at James Capel. What equities need is a firm gilts market to stabilise them. This support could materialise in the coming weeks when institutional investors begin to implement their second quarter strategies. Pension funds, for example, are likely to find attractive gilts' near 8 per cent yield. 'If gilts can provide a prop, the equity market can go back to concentrating on fundamentals and its own dynamics.' The most dramatic turn of the week within equities came in the property sector. After several months during which the sector traded at a very unusual premium to net asset values, it reversed to its more normal discount. A number of property flotations were caught in the shift of sentiment. Capital Shopping Centres, priced at a 13 per cent premium when the sector was at a 20 per cent premium, had a rough first day of trading. Its shares closed 22p below their offer price of 230p. Similarly the Rugby Estates float was priced on Thursday well below its initial target price. The glut of property floats will cause some of the more opportunistic ones to abandon their market plans or at least sharply scale back their pricings. On the takeover front, GKN upped its offer for Westland from 290p to 335p and promptly bought control in the market. From the start of the battle, it had seemed only a matter of sweetening the bid a little since GKN started with a 45 per cent stake in the helicopter maker. The best quarter-end news, though, came from the stock-pickers. Forget the markets, chose the companies, they argue. In fact, 23 of the 100 stocks in the Footsie ended the quarter ahead. Leaders were Arjo Wiggins up 19.3 per cent, British Aerospace 18.2 per cent, Ladbrokes 16.6 per cent and Reuters 11.1 per cent. For those who even got the stock-picking wrong, Kingfisher was the worst performer, down 26.5 per cent, National Westminster Bank was off 24.7 per cent, HSBC Holdings 23.2 per cent and Guardian Royal Exchange 22.5 per cent.</p>

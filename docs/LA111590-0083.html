			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS ;  </P> <P> FIRE AT COMPLEX TO DELAY NEW SCHOOL  </P> <P> A massive fire at a Thousand Oaks luxury apartment complex will delay  construction of a $4-million elementary school in central Thousand Oaks, school  officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Most of the proposed school's 600-student population is expected to come from  The Knolls complex, where a fire last Saturday destroyed 22 buildings and  caused damage estimated at $12 million.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to revise our enrollment projections," said Ali Kiafar,  director of planning and facilities for the Conejo Valley Unified School  District. "Construction will definitely be postponed."  </P> <P> The unnamed school was originally planned to be ready at the earliest by  September, 1992. Exactly when the school will be constructed is contingent on  rebuilding the destroyed apartments, district officials said.  </P> <P> Neither officials of Regis Homes Corp. in Newport Beach nor Lang Ranch Co. in  Thousand Oaks, co-owners of the project, could be reached for comment Tuesday.  Kiafar said he plans to contact company officials later this week to discuss  the matter.  </P> <P> Developer fees, required of new housing in the area, will pay for building the  elementary school, which would serve kindergarten through sixth-grade students.  The school, to be located at the corner of Whitechapel Place and Knightsbridge  Avenue, will be equipped for computers in each classroom and will include an  in-house cable system and a science lab.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] After returning from a visit to the U.S., Estonian  Prime Minister Mart Laar, on Monday [25 April], pointed to his  meetings with U.S. Defence Minister William Perry and UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali as the most influential  during his visit.    Laar told a press conference, on Monday, that his meeting  with Perry was extremely efficient in discussion of situation of  Estonian defence forces, borderguard and the Baltic peacekeeping  battalion to be formed. He pointed to Perry's statement that  the U.S. will not let anyone "dictate in what amount and with  whom it will develop security policy cooperation". He added  that U.S. concern about Estonian-Russian interstate negotiations  was illustrated by the fact that Perry expressed clear support  to unconditional Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by August  31, 1994.    Laar said that during his meetings in the U.S., he discussed  possible arms deals but no concrete plans to buy arms have been  made yet. He said that we had to better define our defence  forces conception to decide what kind of arms Estonia needed.  He added that arms aid programmes will be discussed more  closely at the forthcoming visit of a NATO delegation.    As to his meeting with UN Secretary General, Laar said that  Butrus Butrus- Ghali adopted a very strong position as to  Russian troop withdrawal. "If it is clear in May that Russian  troops do not move and no preparations to troop withdrawal take  place, Ghali asked to turn to UN to apply mechanisms that are in  UN disposal," Laar said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Spain's foreign minister made a statement a few  minutes ago which makes clear the acceleration of diplomatic  efforts. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes was with the foreign  minister. Good afternoon.    [Cespedes] Good afternoon. The foreign ministers of the  European Union [EU] and of the member countries of the UN  Security Council are in telephone contact today, Sunday [6  February], to set in motion a series of measures for the city of  Sarajevo.    [Begin Javier Solana recording] I can tell you that out of  the frustration and grief which we all feel we are going to try  to do everything possible to set in motion a series of measures  that will enable the siege of Sarajevo to be lifted. We must  carry out the operations directed toward raising the siege of  Sarajevo within international law, and therefore it will surely  require another resolution from the UN Security Council. [end  recording]    [Cespedes] The legality of these measures will have to be  taken up at tomorrow morning's meeting of European Union foreign  ministers in Brussels. A meeting of the Atlantic alliance will  also be convened in the Belgian capital so that the military  commanders can give the green light to any operation. When this  work is done, there would be a return to the UN Security Council  to take the appropriate decisions. At this point Minister  Javier Solana says he cannot specify what the raising of the  siege of Sarajevo would consist of or the origin of the attack  on the market in the Bosnian capital. For Minister Solana, and  we quote him, there is no doubt about the responsibility.    The foreign minister is not in favor of lifting the arms  embargo on the Bosnians so that they can defend themselves from  attacks, both Serb and Croat. According to Javier Solana, this  would be a new (?element) which would add fuel to the fire.</p>

Vice President Koreaki Hagihara, 66, and Director Juichi  Konishi, 59, allegedly conspired to give the money to Ishii, 69,  as a reward for favorable treatment in the awarding of public  works projects, informed sources said.    Investigators from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors  Office also raided the Osaka and Tokyo headquarters of Obayashi  and other related sites in a search for evidence of suspected  illicit payments.    Obayashi President Takao Tsumuro apologized for the  controversy but denied the company's involvement in the scandal.    Obayashi is Japan's fourth largest construction firm in  terms  of sales, following Shimizu Corp., Kajima Corp. and Taisei Corp.    The sources said the Osaka-based company is suspected of  giving Ishii 10 million yen in October 1992 after asking him for  favorable consideration in its bid for an 8.2 billion yen  project to construct a waste incineration plant in Sendai, the  capital of Miyagi Prefecture.    The alleged bribe was also intended as a reward for his  efforts in awarding such projects as building a subway station,  the sources said.    The money is believed to have been received on Ishii's  behalf  by his aide Mitsuo Moriya, deputy secretary general of the  Miyagi Prefectural chapter of the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), who is under indictment in a separate bribery case  involving former Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro Honma.    Investigators suspect that Ishii, as mayor of Sendai, may  have received a total of 140 million yen in payments from eight  construction companies, including Obayashi, for alleged  favorable consideration on project bids, the sources said.  Ishii resigned as mayor soon after he was arrested last June.    In a related development, informed sources said Obayashi's  wholly owned subsidiary allegedly paid some 30 million yen in  rental payments for a Tokyo office of senior LDP politician  Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.    The subsidiary shouldered about 500,000 yen a month for five  years starting from December 1983, the sources said.    Mitsuzuka, former chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs  Research Council, has been elected as a House of Representatives  member from a constituency in Miyagi Prefecture.    Commenting on the arrest of Obayashi's executives,  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said he thinks the series of  arrests of top executives of general contractors represents "a  structural problem" in the country's construction industry.    Igarashi stressed the need for fundamental reform of the  industry.    After the arrests of the senior Obayashi officials, several  municipal and prefectural governments announced they will  suspend nominating the company as a bidder in public works  projects.    Kanagawa Prefecture and the city of Yokohama, south of  Tokyo,  decided to suspend nomination of Obayashi as a bidder for three  months until April 17.    Okayama Prefecture and Kitakyushu City, western Japan,  imposed a four months' ban on the company's participation in  public works bids.</p>

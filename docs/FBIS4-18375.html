			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle] </F>   [Text] The EU [European Union] agreement does influence the  way the voters look at Norwegian membership in the EU, according  to a poll Opinion has done for AFTENPOSTEN.    The poll was taken from Monday [14 March] to Wednesday this  week. There are noticeable differences in the replies given  before the agreement had been concluded (Monday and Tuesday) and  after the EU agreement with Norway finally became a reality  (Wednesday).    The poll was conducted with 1,000 interviewees, 680 of whom  were interviewed on Monday and Tuesday. Of these 680, or 51  percent, said no to Norwegian membership in the EU, 28 percent  said yes, and 21 percent belong to the don't-know group.    The picture is quite different with the 320 who were  interviewed on Wednesday. There continues to be an undeniable  majority for no -- 43 percent -- but 35 percent do say yes to  Norwegian membership in the EU. It is interesting to note that  among the voters who were asked after the EU negotiations had  been concluded, there still is a large group of undecideds: 22  percent.    The overall numbers are quite clear, though: Following  recent months' polls where the no side has been dropping and the  yes side advancing, the March opinion poll shows a different  trend. The yes side dropped by 6 percent from February (from 37  to 31). The no side advanced by 1 percent (from 48 to 49). The  dropouts from the yes side have joined the undecideds. In  February 15 percent said they were not sure how they would vote  in a referendum, in March 21 percent were not sure.    The background data of the March poll show increased  uncertainty among the voters, in spite of the intense focus the  media has put on the EU negotiations in recent weeks. The  explanation would appear to be that the EU thriller is confusing  to the voters.    A very interesting trend as the battle for the voters  intensifies is that more and more voters are abandoning their  surefire stands both on the no and the yes side of the issue.  More people are choosing the options "probably no" and  "probably yes."    In February 24 percent said "definitely yes." Now 16 percent  are saying this. On the no side 37 percent said "definitely no"  one month ago. Now 34 percent are saying this. Taking a  long-term view, we find that absolute certainty is on the  decline: Ten percent fewer said "definitely no" in March than in  November (44 vs. 34 percent).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Hong Kong by staff reporter: "Chinese Central </F> Authorities Instruct External Propaganda Departments in All  Localities to Strictly Enforce Regulations on News Covering  Activities of Reporters From Outside the Mainland"]    [Text] Recently, the external propaganda departments in  all localities received a central instruction on strictly  enforcing regulations on the news covering activities of  reporters from outside the mainland. Hong Kong and Macao  reporters must first be approved by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch  and invited by local authorities before they can go to the  mainland to cover relevant news. Reporters not passing such  procedures must not be received.    HSIN PAO was told by officials of the relevant departments  in  a number of provinces and municipalities that in the past  although there were regulations controlling activities of  reporters from outside the mainland, many provinces and  municipalities were still willing to receive such reporters and  arrange news covering activities in order to give broader  publicity to the local investment environment. The local  authorities did not care whether the reporters came with the  approval of the authorities concerned. However, after the Xi  Yang incident, the external propaganda departments of all  provinces and municipalities received a central instruction  which required them to strictly enforce regulations on  activities of reporters from outside the mainland. Hong Kong  and Macao reporters should first achieve the approval of the  XINHUA Hong Kong Branch and the invitation of the local  authorities before they can cover news inside the mainland. If  any Hong Kong and Macao reporters conduct news covering without  such approval, their activities are illegal and must be banned.    Mainland officials also indicated that the number of Hong  Kong and Macao reporters who applied to cover news on the  mainland recently decreased obviously. In particular, after Xi  Yang was sentenced to imprisonment, many provinces and  municipalities received almost no applications to cover news  from Hong Kong and Macao reporters.    As for some Hong Kong reporters' boycott of covering news on  the mainland, some local officials there said that the Hong Kong  reporters should not take such action, which would certainly  affect their future work inside the mainland. In the past, when  the local governments of the mainland invited Hong Kong  reporters to cover news, they often named the institutions and  the reporters being invited. If reporters who were invited  refused to go or if the mass media organs changed people, the  mainland institutions that issued the invitations would have to  seek endorsement from the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch again. Now,  as some Hong Kong reporters openly signed the boycott statement,  it is believed that they will be facing more restrictions from  the mainland authorities concerned in the future if they are  still invited or if they themselves take the initiative in  applying to cover news inside the mainland.    Officials in some south China cities said that because Hong  Kong people viewed the case of Xi Yang from an angle different  from the viewpoint of mainland people, they quite understood why  Hong Kong reporters signed the boycott statement. However, they  also hoped that Hong Kong reporters would act more sensibly and  would not affect their future work. So far, many provinces and  cities have not received the namelist of the reporters involved  in the boycott from the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Georgia poll warning ELECTIONS tomorrow in the former Soviet republic of Georgia are expected to return Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, as head of the republic's parliament - while an increasingly bitter civil war rages in the northern autonomous republic of Abkhazia and the country descends into chaos. Mr Shevardnadze yesterday appealed to the United Nations Security Council, in an open letter, to set up a war crimes commission to look into possible atrocities being committed in Georgia by Abkhazian secessionists. Meanwhile, Georgia's political leaders last night warned of terrorist attacks in the capital of Tbilisi, aimed at stopping or destabilising the elections. In Sukhumi, the Abkhazian capital, refugees continued to besiege the airport fleeing from the threat of an attack by Abkhazian forces. The elections are contested by a plethora of parties, with the former communist 'Peace' bloc in the lead, but with some 20 expected to take seats in the Georgian legislature. Mr Shevardnadze is the sole candidate for the post of parliamentary leader. Mr Shevardnadze was due to meet Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Vladislav Ardzimva, the Akbhazian leader, for talks on Tuesday on a naval ship off Sukhumi. However, the Russian news agency Itar-Tass yesterday reported that Mr Shevardnadze was expressing last-minute reservations about the meeting.</p>

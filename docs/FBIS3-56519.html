Addressing a press conference after the  government session on 11 January, the premier pleaded that the  government was taking account of the danger of expansion of  Russian capital, taking measures and keeping the situation under  control. While keeping tabs on the activities of major  monopolies of the neighbor country in the national economy,  however, the government does not intend to interfere in specific  deals. Answering a question about possible restrictions on  Russian capital in Estonia, Mr. Laar said that there was no need  for that. It would be a rash act for Estonia to bar the inflow  of capital, investments, and the creation of joint firms with  businessmen from any country in the East or in the West. "This  would be disastrous for us," he underscored. In this connection  the prime minister sharply criticized the president's call to  support Estonian capital exclusively. "I am not idolizing  Estonian capital," he stated quoting the Chinese aphorism about  cats of different colors: white or black, it doesn't matter if  they catch mice. "We are only against major monopolies" that  would be able to gain inordinate influence here.    As for Russia, it is second to Finland today as Estonia's  trading partner, as regards import and export, according to the  Estonian Finance Ministry. Commodity circulation in the third  quarter of 1993 amounted to nearly 1 million cronas. Russia's  share in Estonian export reaches 20 percent and nearly 19  percent in import. Estonia boasts a small but positive balance  in its trade with Russia. Cars are in first place in importance  in the overall export structure of Estonia. In the first  quarter this export item accounted for 185 million cronas; in  the second, 230; and in the third, 320. Buying cars in the  West, Estonian firms keep about a third of them, selling the  greater part in the East at a profit. There is a small stream of  cars flowing in from East to West (Zhiguli and Moskvich cars).  This is, according to Sergey Trofimov, chief specialist of  Estonia's Finance Ministry, quite normal business: buy low and  sell high.    In fourth place is fuel: 174 million cronas in the third  quarter of 1993. This business is also quite legitimate.  Estonia buys fuel from Russia and resells it at a profit in the  West. Notably, Russian firms often ask Estonian firms to act as  brokers.    The fifth position is taken by nonferrous metals. Their  export in the third quarter was worth 170 million cronas. The  amount of these metals imported by Estonia, according to Mr.  Trofimov, was worth several tens of million of cronas. Where  does the metals for export come from? First, from pilfering  inside the country. Second, it is being smuggled out of Russia.  Notably, both countries make money in the process. True, in  Russia it is private persons rather than the state. But this  situation is likely to change after Russia takes full control on  its side of the border.    And finally, on 11 January, the Estonian Government  confirmed  a treaty with Russia on cooperation in the area of  standardization, certification, and metrology, which would also  promote trade between the two countries.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Management: Healthy resolutions - Health Check / Tangible benefits of giving up what one enjoys Ask a doctor to suggest New Year's resolutions and the answer is depressingly predictable. Giving up what one enjoys and taking up what one does not is hard until there are tangible benefits. So just how soon can one expect returns from giving up smoking, taking up exercise and eating more healthily? In the case of smoking, it depends on the end-point you choose. At post-mortem, no ex-smoker's lungs ever match the healthy pink hue of the life-long non-smoker's. But lung function usually improves within weeks or months of stopping, while shortness of breath and coughs gradually recede. The risk of lung cancer falls gradually once the habit is ditched. However, new research from Hope Hospital, Salford, shows that the risk of lung cancer in ex-smokers, even if they gave up years ago, remains higher than in those who never smoked. On the other hand, some benefits are seen quickly. Personal freshness improves almost immediately, while giving up smoking in early pregnancy reduces the risk of miscarriage, growth retardation and stillbirth. Taking up exercise is demoralising if stiff muscles result, but there are many later benefits in cardiovascular fitness, mobility, muscle strength and even mood. Exercise may also help prevent cancer of the prostate, breast, or bowel, though data are inconclusive. Exercise has a well-documented effect on blood cholesterol, increasing the good fraction known as HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and therefore reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. How much exercise? The usual advice is to take 20 minutes of brisk exercise three times a week, checking first with your doctor if unused to activity or worried about fitness. Recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine and others suggest that less vigorous exercise five times a week is enough. A brisk daily walk of 2km may do the trick. Exercise usually takes weeks of commitment to make a difference, but improvements continue for months or years. Studies even show that, in some people, coronary artery changes are reversed after a year's regular exercise (but see your doctor first). November saw the publication of the Coma (Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy) report on cardiovascular disease. Its recommendations for healthy eating include eating more fibre and starchy carbohydrate - as a nation we still take too much fat and sugar. It also recommends eating oily fish twice a week, replacing the breakfast fry-up with cereal and/or toast, and eating more fruit and vegetables. Fortunately, no single food is wholly good or bad. Variety and moderation are important. Although they did not feature in the Coma report, anti-oxidants are worth knowing about. They include vitamins C and E, folic acid and beta-carotene (the precursor of vitamin A), and combat free radicals, which probably cause cell mutations, and the changes of ageing. Collectively, anti-oxidants are found in green leafy vegetables, carrots, whole grains and fruits, and there is some evidence that a diet rich in anti-oxidants does help prevent cancer and heart disease. How quickly does a healthy diet work? In most people, changes in fat intake result in measurable effects from three weeks. The consequences of taking more anti-oxidants are less clear. Crash diets should not be part of the plan. Rapid weight loss does not usually stay off, and those whose weight fluctuates seem to be at greater risk of heart disease than those with stable weights. A final recommendation for 1995 is based on evidence that people who enjoy life are healthier and may even have better immunity to infection. So above all have a Happy New Year.

According to Mr. Poniatowski, who spoke on RTL [Luxembourg  Radio and Television], "the figures mentioned in the report were  not discovered or revealed by the judge, but were officially  transmitted by the PR treasurer," Jean-Pierre Thomas. "The  report," the Eure deputy continued, "does not reveal anything  new on the issue of political party financing. It is known that  before 1990, all political parties were obliged to find  operating funds in a way which was not always conventional.  Since 1990, the advantage of the law is that all accounts are  now clear." Mr. Poniatowski summarizes the behavior of the  judge, which he qualifies as "very serious," as follows: "Let  us smear, smear, and some of it will always stick, even if the  smear is absolutely unfounded."    On 29 March Alain Madelin, companies and economic  development  minister and PR vice president, also stated to RTL: "Was the  Republican Party's financing in line with the laws on party  financing? The PR's response is yes. Let justice do its job.  As far as I am concerned, I have absolutely nothing to do with  PR financing. Because of this, I have confidence in the  judicial system of my country. I bear the responsibility for the  Republican Party, and I assume it totally."</p>

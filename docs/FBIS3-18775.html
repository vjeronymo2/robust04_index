EU foreign ministers  failed to approve the budget reform that would base  contributions in direct proportion to gross domestic product  levels and in inverse proportion to VAT [value-added tax] rates.    Italy said its reform of the calculation by which GDP [gross  domestic product] is calculated put it at a disadvantage in  relation to other EU countries that have not yet carried out  that change in the way production levels are estimated.    According to Italian representatives, that discrepancy could  cost Italy 1 trillion lire yearly in EU budget contributions.    Italian sources also cited the outstanding dispute between  Italy and the EU on milk quotas, arguing these could cost Italy  between 2.5 and 5 trillion lire if quotas remain at present  levels. Italy believes the EU has not moved quickly enough on  agricultural reform where the Mediterranean products are  concerned, and that further negotiations are needed on  agro-monetary realignment.</p>

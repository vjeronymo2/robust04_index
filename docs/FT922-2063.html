			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: IBM to market components to rivals INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is for the first time actively seeking to sell its semiconductor technology products to outside customers. As part of the new marketing strategy, it has set an ambitious target of achieving annual chip sales of Dollars 500m over the next three years. IBM, the world's largest chip-maker, has until recently consumed internally all of the output of its large chip plants. Previous sales to third parties have been modest, occurring mostly in response to specific requests from customers. The new semiconductor marketing strategy represents a marked departure from past practice. It is the latest example of an effort by IBM to raise Dollars 3bn in annual revenues from sales to original equipment manufacturers by next year. IBM's entry into the semiconductor market potentially creates a powerful new competitor for other chip-makers. However, IBM is not expected to compete in the market for standard commodity chips. Instead, it will focus on 'high value-added products' in which it has a technological advantage. Such products include IBM's thermal conduction modules, a core packaging technology used in its mainframe computers. 'Everything made by the technology products division, of which the semiconductor operations are a part, is on the table,' said IBM. The company is confident that selling a key component to competitors will not damage its position in the mainframe market. 'Customers don't buy IBM's mainframes only because of this technology,' it said. Other factors, such as software, product quality and pricing were distinguishing factors, the company said. Excess capacity in semiconductors is one reason for the decision to sell to third parties. Technological improvements alone have brought annual production gains of 20 per cent to 30 per cent, the company said. 'We have reached a point where IBM's internal consumption cannot consume all its output.' IBM's entry into the semiconductor market adds a new twist to the ongoing trade battle between the US and Japan in the computer chip field. Currently, IBM's sales in Japan are excluded from the US government's preferred method of calculating the foreign share of the Japanese market. The US has argued that IBM is a special case because it does not sell to outside customers. If IBM were included in calculating foreign semiconductor sales in Japan, the figure could increase by close to 2 percentage points, bringing it to about 16.5 per cent, much closer to the 20 per cent target at the centre of the tense trade row.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Employees of BNF given vote go-ahead Employees of British Nuclear Fuels who are also members of Copeland borough council have been given dispensation by the Department of the Environment to vote in committees on matters relating to BNF's business. Last month the council was advised by a QC specialising in local government law that councillors should not vote on planning applications by their employer or their spouses' employer. Nine Copeland councillors who are BNF employees at its Sellafield nuclear processing plant, and another three whose spouses work for BNF, sought dispensation. The department has ruled that, provided they declare an interest, the 12 can vote in committees on applications by BNF or UK Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste disposal body. But they are not allowed to vote on these applications at full council meetings, although they may speak.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hilclare declines to Pounds 59,000 Hilclare, the USM-quoted designer and manufacturer of electronic security and lighting products, suffered a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 194,000 to Pounds 59,000 for the year to March 31. The figure was impacted by an exceptional bad debt of Pounds 59,000 which was incurred after the year-end but provided for within the results. Sales improved to Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 2.99m) but gross margins fell from 30.4 per cent to 26.3 per cent. Earnings declined to 2p (5.8p) but the dividend is a same-again 0.5p.</p>

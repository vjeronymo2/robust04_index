			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> BURROUGHS PUTS SAN GABRIEL AWAY  </P> <P> Using its superior quickness and balanced scoring, Burroughs High rolled over  San Gabriel, 77-57, Thursday night at Burroughs to remain undefeated in the  Foothill League.  </P> <P> In the early going it did not appear that the Indians would win so handily as  the Matadors (3-15, 0-6 in league play) played stingy defense and trailed only  40-35 at halftime.  </P> <P> San Gabriel's Dean Smith closed the gap to 22-20 on a 4-foot shot with 2  seconds left in the first quarter. It was not until late in the second quarter  that Burroughs (14-5, 6-0) began to pull away.  </P> <P> "We wanted to hold them down to our level and cause a lot of turnovers early,"  San Gabriel Coach Tim Knight said. "They are superior to us in every way, and  unless we do this we'll get beat."  </P> <P> Center Tom Clemens scored a team-high 18 points for Burroughs, which is ranked  10th in the Valley by The Times. Guard Marnie Calderon added 16 points. ROCKY  PINHEIRO  </P></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Arts: Giselle - Ballet in Antwerp Five years ago Belgium had three ballet companies. In Brussels, Maurice Bejart reigned with his Ballet du Vingtieme Siecle as dance guru to Europe. French-speaking Wallonie had its own Ballet Royal, and Flanders an equally Royal Koninklijk Ballet. But Bejart went to Lausanne, and in 1988 Mark Morris arrived for a three-year stay in Brussels' Monnaie Opera. In 1990, the death of the Ballet de Wallonie's director brought the end of the company, and today only the Royal Ballet of Flanders remains to uphold the ideals of classical dancing. (In Brussels, Anna Teresa de Keersmaekeer's free dance now occupies the Monnaie stage; elsewhere other Belgian modernists flourish - not least Wim van der Keybus). Flanders' Royal Ballet is based in Antwerp. It was founded in 1969, and it has been directed for the past six years by Robert Denvers. Denvers has given the company a sure identity based upon 19th century traditionalism, modern full-length works, and shorter creations from Balanchine, Tudor et al. The troupe's image is of a serious and disciplined ensemble of 55 dancers - Denvers is also a celebrated pedagogue - and performances during the past few years, in serious stagings of La Sylphide, Don Quixote, have been marked by a clear and well-mannered classic style. (The dancers, who come from many countries, seem united by Denvers' teaching, and by his high technical expectations). Last week-end saw the first performances of the company's new Giselle in Antwerp's Opera House. The staging, produced by Denvers and the Cuban ballerina, Menia Martinez, pleases by its clarity. There is little of that fuss of Victorian quaintness which is supposed to evoke 'Romantic style', and is more like epidemic winsomeness. Nowhere are there those anxieties and caprices that tell of producers' imposing their 'vision' upon the ballet, as in the risible Giselle at the Paris Opera with its witless Breton setting. The Flanders version lets the dance speak (the text is sound, and seems based upon a Kirov model), and is blessed in its simplicities. Roger Bernard's designs - practical, well-made cottages and graves set against pale back-cloths; pretty costumes - are efficient, and designed for touring, since the company travels extensively. The abiding impression is of a Giselle that is clearly placed within the great Russian traditions of the ballet. (My one cavil is that the lines of wilis in Act 2 come between the lovers and the cross on Giselle's grave which must protect them from Myrtha). The sense of tradition was clear in the interpretations of two young ballerinas whom I saw. Lorena Feijoo is 21 years old, Cuban, and a born Giselle. She is slender, with a gently commanding technique - balances hover; steps poise and hang upon a breath of air - and she brings a total concentration upon the drama. Apprentice Giselles tend to run amok in the mad-scene. Miss Feijoo played it with a control of effects that was never studied, but, like her dancing, seemed the expression of a naturally eloquent and elegant temperament. As the wili Giselle her poses, the turn of her head, a floating delicacy in step, told of a role whose pathos (and whose prodigious demands) she already understood. It was a reading most touching, and most promising. Her Albrecht was Chris Roelandt, strong and considerate as a partner, and proposing a sympathetic character whose decencies are seen in his good manners and exemplary attention to his ballerina. A second Giselle  - of the five whom the Flanders Ballet are to present - was the Bulgarian Nadia Dimitrova. Here was a young artist whose training had, like Feijoo's, already placed her in the best traditions of the role. Her Giselle was lively in temperament as in step. Quick accents, quick feelings, told the story in the first act - perhaps slightly self-consciously so. As the wili, Dimitrova compelled attention by the purity and generosity of her line, and by her evident desire to show phrases of movement as a kind of bel canto. Her Albrecht was the Cuban danseur Julio Arozarena, a vivid performer with a bright edge to his dancing. The support from the company was alert, attractive, at both performances. The nocturnal dances of the second act were led by two impressive Myrthas: Enrichetta Cavalotti and Lucinda Tallack-Garner (who has a space-devouring jump). The peasant pas de deux, in the broadly flowing Bolshoy version, was brightly cut by Hiroko Sakakibara and Francois Petit. And, how good and how rare to report, the Adam score was a vital component in the drama. It was played (in John Lanchbery's edition) with evident affection by the orchestra of the Flanders Opera under the young conductor Koen Kessels. Mr Kessels understood the music's shape, its dramatic purpose, its Romantic force: he gave a notable display of musicianship. 'Giselle' is sponsored by Kredietbank, GB and VTM Television and tours Belgium during February and March</p>

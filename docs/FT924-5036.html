			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / The Long View: Playing the percentages HAVING DEALT with inflation by means of a two-year cold shower in the European exchange rate mechanism the government now feels able to move on to tackle today's more pressing problems, like rising unemployment and lack of economic growth. Unfortunately old habits - of which inflation is a persistent British one - die hard. Yet there is a surprising diversity of opinion over the seriousness of Britain's inflation after a substantial devaluation. Some economists are relaxed, seeing no dangers in the monetary statistics, and expecting inflation of no more than 1 to 3 per cent over the next year. Other pundits, however, see inflation (currently 3.6 per cent on the October reading) picking up next year to 5 or 6 per cent, where it would stay in 1994. This would, of course, be above the government's 1 to 4 per cent target range. The Society of Business Economists seems to want it both ways, projecting this week that the Retail Price Index will rise by only 2 per cent in 1993 but by 6 per cent in 1994. As for the financial markets, the inflation rate implied by the gap between the yields on fixed interest and index-linked gilts is about 5 per cent, significantly higher than the 4 per cent just before Black Wednesday. As always, it depends on precisely what you mean by inflation. Recent falls in interest rates are serving to reduce the headline rate of inflation because of the impact of lower mortgage outgoings. By next spring, assuming a further one-point cut in bank base rates, the cost of money could be as much as 4 1/2 percentage points less than a year earlier. That might not all be passed on to housebuyers, but the corresponding reduction in headline inflation might be as much as two full percentage points, before dwindling later in the year. But then interest rates might easily rise again, producing a sharp flip upwards in the headline rate. At least there will be no great new push from pay inflation over the next year. It looks as though average earnings growth will subside from 6 to perhaps 5 per cent. This would still be a bafflingly high figure in any but a British context, considering the rate at which unemployment is rising. But given the fall in the number of jobs and the possibility of a modest recovery in gross domestic product the cost of labour per unit of output may rise only slightly. However, pay has risen much too fast for several years now. Average pay has climbed by 7 per cent in real terms since 1988 although the British economy is not producing any more than it was then. No wonder that the economic numbers simply do not add up. There has to be a cut in real incomes which will come about through rises in prices and indirect taxes. Already food prices are jumping because of adjustments to the green pound. One economist, Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming, has warned of the wider potential impact of January 1 price lists as all kinds of import price rises are pushed through. In September the main problem was the devaluation against European currencies but some of those are being forced down too; the problem has shifted to the dollar against which sterling has come down by a quarter since August and by nearly 20 per cent since the beginning of the year. This affects not just imports from the US but also a wide range of dollar-priced commodities and many manufactures from the Far East which have a dollar link. Import penetration is heading towards 30 per cent of the goods consumed in the UK, and the overall trade-weighted devaluation has been 15 per cent. The monetarists tend to brush this aside. Monetary growth has slowed, to 5 per cent on the M4 basis. But it is not easy to assess what is a non-inflationary rate of monetary growth. In the late 1980s the M4 growth rate of 16 per cent or so only partly came through to inflation because of rapid economic growth and a structural shift of savings into deposits (which were not really to be regarded as spending money). In the 1990s the shift is likely to be the other way, as savings are withdrawn and invested in assets outside the M4 definition, such as gilts or National Savings products. Given that economic growth is slightly negative at present you could argue that any M4 growth above zero could give warning of future inflation. Meanwhile the narrow money aggregates are beginning to accelerate. For myself, I believe that imported price pressures will keep underlying inflation at 5 per cent next year, to which you can add at least a percentage point from the indirect tax rises which the government will be forced to implement next spring (there is already a warning of higher taxes on motorists to pay for the recent abolition of car tax). However, the mortgage interest effect might hold the headline rate at something near 4 per cent. Beyond that, the risks multiply. Inflation is not going to get seriously out of control while the recession lasts, but what about the impact of a recovery? Indeed, there is a chance that sterling will be forced much lower next year, certainly against the dollar, as the British government seeks to stimulate a sluggish growth rate. The 1993 balance of payments deficit, officially forecast at Pounds 15 1/2 bn and put by others at over Pounds 20bn (we would be living beyond our means to the tune of around Pounds 1,000 per family) could prove dangerous. At this stage it is hard to see a way through the maze. If we are to find a non-inflationary route we will certainly need stronger institutions than we have now, and clearer guidelines than Norman Lamont's eclectic pot-pourri of money growth ranges, inflation targets and house price indices. In 1993 the inflation statistics may be more misleading than usual, and in 1994 they could produce some unpleasant surprises. We may wish we could find another cold shower.</p>

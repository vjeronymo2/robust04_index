			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> International Lease Finance Corp.'s 1988 profit dropped 15% to $43 million. The  Beverly Hills firm said the results were due in part to lower gains on flight  equipment marketing and delays in deliveries of aircraft from McDonnell Douglas  and Fokker. In addition, tighter competitive conditions existing at the time of  certain lease transactions during 1987 resulted in lower overall operating  margins for 1988, the firm said.  </P> <P> Tables, Page 4  </P></p>

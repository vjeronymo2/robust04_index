			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Vice </F> Chancellor Erhard Busek by Robert Hochner in Vienna -- live]    [Text] [Hochner] Chancellor Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor  Busek have meanwhile prepared for our interview in the  chancellor's office. I welcome both of them. Good evening, Mr.  Chancellor and Mr. Vice Chancellor.    Can one deduce from your readiness to come to this interview  that the reports from Brussels 10 minutes ago are correct --  that the membership treaty with the European Union [EU] has been  concluded?    [Vranitzky] Yes, these reports are correct. I am very  relieved. The hard and persistent work has paid off. I would  like to thank and congratulate our government colleagues in  Brussels, who really did superhuman work over these past hours  and days in Brussels. I also thank the members of provincial  governments, the social partners, and the many officials and  other associates and helpers who accompanied them. We have gone  through a very important stage in a project, the importance of  which can hardly be overestimated, and now we will immediately  -- over the next few hours and days -- take the next necessary  steps regarding the implementation in Austria -- that is,  government motions, draft laws, and the other things that are  necessary in this connection.    [Hochner] Mr. Vice Chancellor, you are standing beside the  chancellor and you have just smiled very obviously. Is this  just relief that an agreement has been achieved or is this also  satisfaction with the compromise that has been accomplished?    [Busek] First of all, one has to say that the details of the  past hours or minutes have a bit obscured the view on the whole.  After all, the whole is Austria's step into the European Union,  which gives us more security, more market opportunities, more  prospects for the future. My smile was directed at that,  because with this, we have opened up a future for us, which  gives us the most varied opportunities to make the best of it.  I believe we should not overlook the forest in view of the  individual trees that we have watched during the most recent  negotiations -- a forest gives us hope and provides us with  opportunities for development, because it is better to be in the  European Union and to follow a path together instead of  remaining alone.    I think this is one of the main considerations, and this is  also the question we are going to ask the Austrians -- namely  which way they want to follow. A lot of things will still have  to be done in this respect. I already know there will probably  be one point or another where someone will know better and say  this or that should have been achieved in addition. However, I  believe one has to see the whole picture here. It is indeed a  historical step we are taking -- just as we followed the path to  freedom in 1955 with the State Treaty, we have now followed a  path that will, as Austrians and for our homeland Austria,  provide more opportunities in the future.    [Hochner] Mr. Chancellor, the conclusion of the agreement  with the European Union has required compromises -- compromises  in agriculture and also regarding the Transit Treaty. What  would you tell those critics who do not see the whole picture --  the goal of joining the European Union -- but say: The Austrian  Government has toppled over here; it should not have made these  compromises?    [Vranitzky] I would simply tell those critics the Austrian  Government has not toppled over and it should indeed have taken  and had to take this step, clearly pursuing the goal we had set  for ourselves. This toppling over that is so often mentioned  must first be proved, and this will be extremely difficult to  prove. This is one point. The second point is we now must  begin to work out the next steps together with the Austrian  people.    We have brought home a result. A high percentage of the  Austrian people are in favor of Austria's following this path  into a common Europe. However, there is also quite a  considerable percentage who are undecided or even against that.  It is necessary now to work out, together with the Austrian  people, this conviction and this positive attitude so the number  of those citizens, who have not yet decided to follow the path  together with those citizens who have already decided, goes  down, so we can achieve an agreement and a unification of  interests, a unification of comments and attitudes. This is far  more important now than dealing with those on the political  scene who have always been against it.    Both the Greens and Haider's Freedom Party of Austria came  out today against EU membership, and this was assessed as a  surprise. For me, it was not a surprise at all. For the past  months and years they have been against it. Therefore, no one  should be surprised if opposing voices come from this corner.  This is obviously part of the political conflicts we will have  to go through in the future. The most important issue, however,  is that we must win over that partner who has the actual say in  the referendum, and that is the Austrian population.    [Hochner] Mr. Vice Chancellor, during the last stage of  these negotiations, the Austrian Government -- the coalition --  acted with a cohesion it rarely showed during the preparations  for these negotiations. I just recall the latest discussion  about second residences. Is there not a danger that this  cohesion has been lost when it is now necessary to explain the  results of Brussels to the Austrian people so they vote yes in  the referendum?    [Busek] We have achieved a goal together in a good style in  the negotiating delegation and also in tackling our task here in  Vienna together. You may be quite certain that we, as the  government parties, will not lose sight of the goal -- namely  leading Austria into a good future. We have a lot of work to  do, accompanying the treaty and, of course, in implementing it.  I believe narrow-minded pettiness will be inappropriate here.    I believe we will also have to call on all our colleagues  to act in this manner. Of course, there is one or the other  question that will be mentioned then. However, it is true such  agreements are never perfect but also have the character of a  compromise, with which all sides have to live.    However, these things must recede into the background in  view  of the fact we have opened up a good, new future for us, and we  must take all measures to accompany this development. I may say  we have already achieved some things parallel to the  negotiations in Brussels and in Vienna, which we will implement  accordingly. I am very optimistic in this respect, because if  we do not recognize the dimension of this issue, we will, I  believe, fail the political task. And in this respect, one can  already see the cohesion of the two government parties, despite  all the differences we have now and then. However, we are not a  unified national party but two different parties that form one  government. I would really like to see an alternative to that,  because from what you hear from the opposition parties nowadays,  you cannot form a common government.    [Hochner] A penultimate question to both of you: The  approval by the Austrians at the referendum is not  preprogrammed, even though some polls indicate that. What would  happen in politics if the Austrians were to come out against the  membership treaty that was negotiated by the Austrian Government  in Brussels?    [Vranitzky] Well, if this is the penultimate question, I am  already curious about the last question. My answer to your  penultimate question is that I do not at all expect that the  Austrian people will not want to follow this path, which the  Austrian Government has worked out. This would probably also  mean not joining the other peoples in Europe, and just today we  have seen and heard on television and on the radio that the East  European neighboring states are vehemently pushing into the  European Union. Just imagine a situation in which West Europe is  united and East Europe joins in, and somewhere in no-man's land  there is Austria. After some years, the citizens would  certainly say: This government did not live up to its  responsibility. We will certainly not give them any reason to  say that.    [Hochner] Mr. Vice Chancellor.    [Busek] Well, what is going to happen if.... Let us assume  that the people vote yes, then what are you going to do with  this question?    [Hochner] Then I have to ask the opposition parties. You  are right.    The last question is nothing mysterious but just involves  technical matters because the day is a bit hectic and my  colleagues from the domestic policy department have asked me for  it.    When will the Austrian Government give a press conference to  brief the public about the actual result of the negotiations?    [Vranitzky] Well, in view of the interest the Austrian  public has been taking in that, you can imagine we will  certainly be asked sufficiently and extensively about this  matter, and we will certainly face up to this task tomorrow --  together with those of our colleagues who will return from  Brussels during the night.    [Hochner] Thank you gentlemen, and good evening.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Zhirinovsky's 'ray' of despair Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra-nationalist, yesterday said his threat that a secret 'death ray' would be used to defend the Serbs, in the event of western military intervention against Bosnian Serbs, was not a joke, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. In talks with Serb leaders, including Mr Slobodan Milosevic, he gave no details about the alleged weapon, but said he would be testing it overnight in Brcko, north-east Bosnia.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Government unaware of dire state of manufacturing Sir, I should not have been surprised that in his speech to the Confederation of British Industry ('Lamont vows to defeat inflation', May 20), the chancellor of the exchequer devoted less than one quarter of his closely argued diatribe to address the problems of British industry. It seems that the government has yet to learn that the state of manufacturing industry is dire. Transparent misleading manipulation of growth figures, using 1983 as a base, will not disguise the awful state endemic in British industry. A one and a half club industry policy will not help Britain in its competitive struggle with the rest of the world. No amount of 'Pattenised' Thatcherism will substitute for a progressive strategy to galvanise the efforts of industry. The Treasury may not yet have worked out the opportunity cost of the property boom and bust to Britain. What is needed at the Treasury now is a fourth secretary, together with the chief economic financial and economic secretaries, in charge of day to day industry/Treasury co-ordination with the DTI and the country. It may be necessary to have a Plowden mark two with a wider remit, to examine the whole recent performance of the Treasury with respect to the British economy. Changes to farm out the disastrous forecasting job will not be enough. Macroeconomic policy is simply not a subtle enough tool to deal with the complexities of modern industrial policy, when countries are active in forwarding their own strategic industrial goals. Any one deeply involved in manufacturing will recognise that the future is outside Britain, and will continue to move their effort abroad under the present regime. There is no time to lose.

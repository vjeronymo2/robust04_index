			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel: When it pays to check your policy If you were dispatched on a business trip at an hour's notice, would your medical bills be covered if you had an accident? Even if you were given more notice, would you check the cover offered by company travel insurance? Managers of small companies and the self-employed need to be particularly careful that accidents or losses abroad do not leave them out of pocket. Insurers say a growing number of people are taking out annual travel insurance policies, which provide cover for any number of trips in a year and eliminate the need for last-minute arrangements. Columbus, the specialist travel insurer, says sales of annual policies rose 39 per cent over the past year. For anyone who travels regularly, an annual policy is often cheaper than buying insurance for each trip separately. Most annual policies cover business trips, but do check - a few, such as NatWest's and Abbey National's, exclude them. There is usually a limit for each trip of two or three months; a few cheaper policies impose an overall annual limit for time spent outside the UK - about 150 days. Premiums for a single person vary from about Pounds 75 to about Pounds 140. Most annual policies provide at least Pounds 1m cover each for medical expenses and personal liability. Differences on other details - such as cancellation and curtailment, legal expenses, compensation for delays, and lost or delayed baggage - can be marked. Cancellation cover ranges from Pounds 1,000 with Columbus's most basic policy to Pounds 12,500 with the American Express Premier policy. Some insurers offer a choice of cover. If you never go outside Europe, why pay extra to cover potential hospital bills in the US? And if your home contents policy covers personal belongings outside the home, why pay to cover luggage a second time? Bradford &amp; Bingley building society gives a 20 per cent discount to Pounds 79.60 to anybody whose luggage is already covered. Anyone planning to ski or go scuba diving should check the small print. Most annual policies include limited skiing cover (usually 17 days a year), but some exclude it. Most annual insurance can be extended to cover your spouse and/or children for less than the price of another individual policy.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                  ANNUAL TRAVEL INSURANCE POLICIES  -------------------------------------------------------------------                           Premium*    Trip         Other Insurer                   (pounds)    limit        options  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Accident &amp; General          130       90 days      F American Express             79.50    91 days      F, L, P Barclays                     97.50    90 days      F Bradford &amp; Bingley           99.50**  90 days      F, L BUPA                        130       91 days      F, L Club Direct                 139       90 days      B, F Columbus                     79       60 days      B, F Crispin Speers              140       60 days      B, E, F, P First Direct                 75       91 days      F Frizzell                    111.78     3 months    E, F, L Home &amp; Overseas             109       30 days      F Midland                      75       91 days      F N &amp; P                        75       90 days      F, L Thomas Cook                 125       60 days      F Wexas                        98.50   10 weeks      F  ------------------------------------------------------------------- *individual, comprehensive worldwide cover for holiday and business travel.

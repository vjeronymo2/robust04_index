			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Council tax hurdle ahead for Howard THE MOST immediate chal-lenge facing Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, will be to achieve a smooth lift-off for the council tax, which is due to replace the poll tax in April next year. The irony of this will not be lost on Mr Howard, for it was he who supervised the passage of the poll tax through parliament during his stint as housing and local government minister. He now has less than a year to ensure that the council tax does not become a political millstone around Mr Major's neck, as the poll tax became for Mrs Thatcher. His past record is unlikely to endear him to the local government leaders whose co-operation is essential to making a success of the council tax. However, one influential Labour council leader said last night that he hoped Mr Howard would be prepared to work for an improvement in relations between central and local government. Mr Howard will himself become a sort of unelected mayor for London through his chairmanship of the government's new cabinet sub-committee which is to co-ordinate planning and policy for the capital. He will also convene a new private-sector forum to promote London as a business, tourist and cultural centre. An early decision will have to be made on whether to cap poll-tax levels for 15 to 20 councils which have exceeded government guidelines on local spending. In the longer term Mr Howard will be responsible for seeing through the work of the Local Government Commission which will eliminate a tier of local government in England and Wales and redraw local-authority boundaries. The environment secretary's role in regenerating inner cities is to be enhanced, with additional responsibilities transferred from the Department of Trade and Industry. The Conservative manifesto pledged an extension of the City Challenge approach which distributes resources by competitive bidding between councils. With a second round of bidding closing this month, Mr Howard will have the opportunity to set his own priorities in selecting the 20 winners. Mr Howard can expect a surge in transfers of local authority housing to housing associations and housing action trusts. With the election of a fourth Tory government, many Labour councils will set aside ideological scruples and seek such transfers, which will be the only way of bringing significant new investment into run-down council estates. On environmental issues, the government is committed to establishing a new agency to bring together existing bodies such as the National Rivers Authority and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution.</p>

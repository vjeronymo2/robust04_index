			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fiat passes payout after record loss Fiat, the Italian industrial group, yesterday announced the biggest loss in its 95-year history, and decided not to pay a dividend on ordinary shares for the first time since 1947. The worldwide economic downturn, in particular in Fiat's core automotive market, drove the group into a net loss of L1,783bn (Dollars 1.05bn) in 1993, compared with a profit of L551bn in 1992. However, the group pointed to signs of recovery in the first quarter of 1994, when it recorded a profit of L30bn, compared with a loss of L222bn in the equivalent period. Sales rose by 11 per cent to L14,750bn in the first three months of this year, and the company has drawn hope from faint signs of an upturn in the car market. 'The task which faces the group in all its elements will continue to be extremely severe (in 1994),' Fiat said yesterday, although the group placed hope in its technological strength and cost-cutting. The Milan stock market had largely discounted the possibility of heavy losses before yesterday's announcement, which was made after the close of trading. Since the beginning of the year, Fiat's shares have been among the best performers on the Milan market as investors have speculated on a recovery and the early success of the group's new Punto range of small cars. Fiat's shares closed at L7,068 yesterday, down 1.1 per cent on the day. Fiat's operating losses reached L839bn last year, compared with a profit of L237bn in 1992. The central operating division, Fiat Auto, lost L1,756bn, having only just broken even the previous year. Losses deepened at Iveco, the truck and industrial vehicle subsidiary, to L501bn, compared with a 1992 loss of L122bn. The company said it would ask shareholders at their annual meeting in June to approve a potential increase in the group's maximum nominal share capital to L10,000bn from L5,000bn. The group stressed this did not mean it was planning to raise more cash immediately, but explained that last year's complex rights issue, which raised L5,000bn, took the company up to the limit of its issued share capital. The net loss of L1,783bn, recorded after taxes of L340bn and heavy interest charges, was slightly better than many analysts had predicted, but it was flattered by an extraordinary gain of L300bn on the sale of the company's 58 per cent stake in La Rinascente, the Italian retailer, last autumn. However, Fiat pointed out that the divestment of La Rinascente had deprived the group of profits and turnover and worsened its debt position. Group turnover in 1993 was stable at L54,556bn compared with L54,640bn. Fiat's net debt increased to L5,247bn on December 31, 1993 from L3,849bn at the end of 1992.</p>

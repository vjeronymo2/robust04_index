			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Battle for Foster's heads for the courts THE BATTLE for effective control of Foster's Brewing group, the Melbourne-based international beermaker, is heading for the courts. This emerged yesterday when the National Mutual Life Association (NML), Australia's second-biggest institution, launched a court challenge to the appointment last month of receivers to International Brewing Investments (IBI), the Foster's group's main shareholder. In the Victoria Supreme Court, NML claimed the appointment, made by BHP on June 2, was unlawful and injurious to NML. NML's action followed a request from Wardley Australia for payment by NML of more than ADollars 105m (USDollars 78.9m) under standby commitments which formed part of IBI's financing. The standby, known as the CLIF agreement, also involves the HongKong Bank. Wardley Australia manages the CLIF agreement on behalf of a group of banks known as the Vextin syndicate, owed ADollars 1.2bn by IBI, with security ranking ahead of BHP. The moves are seen as the beginning of manoeuvring by IBI's creditors to improve their position ahead of any asset sales by a receiver. BHP has been negotiating since it appointed receivers to IBI to buy out the Vextin syndicate. But speculation has increased that Vextin may opt to appoint its own receivers. Yesterday's events threaten to further impede already slow attempts to resolve the IBI/Foster's situation. Both HongKong Bank, on behalf of the Vextin syndicate, and BHP said last night they would vigorously defend the NML action which they described as erroneous and without substance. The action raises the possibility that IBI, controlled by Melbourne businessman Mr John Elliott, could yet emerge from receivership.</p>

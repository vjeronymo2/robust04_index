			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol [no dateline as received] -- Mykola  Mykhalchenko, the head of the Ukrainian president's service, who  is now in Simferopol, held a news conference on 7 April. He  told journalists that the appointment of the president's  representative in Crimea was caused not only by the latest  decrees by Yuriy Meshkov, but also by the resolutions of the  Supreme Council of Ukraine that stipulate that the  representation be introduced and a president's representative  appointed in one month's time. The aim of the appointment is to  remove opposition between Ukraine and Crimea.    Mykola Mykhalchenko reported that the Ukrainian president's  representative in Crimea will supervise the fulfillment of the  Constitution of Ukraine on the territory of the Crimea Republic  and the fulfillment of the law on the delimitation of powers  between the state power bodies of Ukraine and the Crimea  Republic. He will be Ukraine's top official in charge of  foreign political issues and will coordinate the actions by the  power structures. The head of the Ukrainian president's service  also pointed out that, in compliance with the law, the president  and the Supreme Council of Crimea could sign agreements in  economic and cultural spheres, and establish trade missions.  However, the law does not envisage that they should perform  diplomatic functions.</p>

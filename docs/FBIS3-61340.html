			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary </F> Arman Kirakosyan, a first deputy minister of foreign affairs of  the Republic of Armenia, by unidentified RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA  correspondent; place and date not given: "Relations Within the  Framework of the CIS Are Among Our Foreign Policy Priorities"]    [Text]    [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] Mr. Kirakosyan, among the foreign  policy issues that fall within your job responsibilities,  relations with CIS countries are of considerable importance.  From this standpoint, our readers would be interested to know  how our relations with these countries are organized and  developing, first and foremost with Russia, since we have to  acknowledge that any event in Russia in one way or the other  reverberates in the Republic of Armenia, especially affecting  its internal and foreign state of affairs.    [Kirakosyan] That is, of course, a very broadly defined  question. Nevertheless, I will try to provide an exhaustive  answer and, naturally, I will start with the Russian Federation.    Today, when international relations are in a period of  transition and a trend is in the making toward the creation and  development of more new unions, including a broad process of  cooperation on a mutually beneficial basis, Armenia assigns a  priority to Russia in its foreign policy. In its relations with  the countries in the region, the Russian leadership is  unquestionable.    Now the period of defining the positions of the two states  with respect to each other seems to be behind us, and we finally  have come to a mutual understanding. I especially want to draw  your attention to the fact that we have to approach the process  of bilateral relations between Armenia and Russia seriously.    In the current situation, it is important to coordinate  foreign, economic, social, military, and domestic policy in the  direction of leading the republic out of the economic and energy  crisis, which will ensure external and internal political  equilibrium and a successful course of economic transformations.    In our relations with the Russian Federation, we base our  actions first and foremost on the national and state interests  of Armenia, which are aimed at economic development on a  mutually beneficial basis.    Diplomatic relations between the Russian Federation and the  Republic of Armenia were established in April 1992. President of  the Russian Federation B. Yeltsin on 26 May 1992 appointed V.  Stupishin as ambassador plenipotentiary and extraordinary in  Armenia. Before that, on 29 December 1991, an agreement between  Armenia and Russia, "On Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual  Security," was signed in Moscow.    The Republic of Armenia has trade and economic agreements  with the Russian Federation for 1992-1993. In addition, we have  signed more than 30 other agreements with the Russian  Federation, and a number of projects are in the development  stage. All of this overall must help to create favorable  conditions for market relations between Armenia and Russia, with  the aim of preserving and developing existing economic ties,  drawing on already signed agreements on coordinating the actions  in the development of the fuels and power generation sector,  industry, transportation, communications, and so on.    Thus, we can say with certainty that the Republic of Armenia  does not have as intensive and comprehensive ties with any  foreign country as it has with the Russian Federation. It is  quite obvious that in the Republic of Armenia's foreign policy,  Russia occupies an important place. And this is logical, since  it reflects the trends and traditions that exist between our  countries and peoples.    Now let us look at the factors that stand in the way of  developing Armenian-Russian relations.    For a variety of reasons, economic ties between the Republic  of Armenia and the Russian Federation are currently noticeably  disrupted; nevertheless, fluctuations in the political and  economic life of Russia echo in our republic. The latest  confirmation of this is freeing prices for bread and fuel, an  unexpected exchange of the USSR State Bank and the Central Bank  of the Russian Federation banknotes of 1961-1992 issue, and so  forth.    One should assume that the existing close economic ties  between the two states are a long-term factor, which is to a  considerable degree necessitated by the absence of appropriate  alternative infrastructures, and this circumstance must be taken  into account in developing the foreign policy course of the  Republic of Armenia.    Alas, we have not yet made the effective steps that need to  be made in the sphere of developing relations with the Russian  Federation. A Republic of Armenia Embassy still has not been  opened in Moscow, which, naturally, would be appropriate for the  current stage of development of bilateral relations. The current  form of Armenian representation in Russia corresponds only to a  small extent to international norms and logic-dictated relations  existing between independent states. Its functional disparity  currently does not afford us the ability fully to conduct  relations with embassies of other countries in the world, the  number of which in Moscow equals the number of these countries'  representations in the United Nations. Such things as monitoring  the implementation of previously signed agreements and treaties,  as well as the analysis of promising projects aimed at further  deepening and expansion of Armenian-Russian relations, not to  mention the enormous opportunities to stimulate the republic's  economy, remain outside the activities of the permanent  representation. Creation of consular representations of the  Republic of Armenia in important key points of the Russian  Federation also is progressing slowly. Moreover, a wrong trend  is developing in the matter of forming representations: we base  our decisions on the assumption that representations are needed  first and foremost in places where the greatest number of  Armenians live, so that we can resolve their problems in Russia.  This undoubtedly is an important task. We should not forget,  however, that the main task of representations is not in working  with the [Armenian] community--it is in facilitating the  development of relations between the Russian Federation and the  Republic of Armenia, in particular, in those areas where the  community has a certain economic, political, and social  potential.    Speaking of the need for the fastest possible creation of  legal and treaty foundations for multilateral cooperation, which  could have a decisive influence in leading us out of the  economic and energy crisis, we should pay attention to the  actual ratification by our Supreme Council of a number of  bilateral agreements and treaties. Among them is a fundamental  document--the agreement between the Republic of Armenia and the  Russian Federation "On Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual  Security."    In our opinion, the next factor is the influence of the  Russian Federation, which, both within the framework of  undertakings of the UN and CSCE and by its direct participation,  could play a perceptibly positive role in the resolution of the  Karabakh crisis. The deepening and development of comprehensive  relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Russian  Federation may help to establish good-neighbor relations between  Armenia and the countries with which it shares borders.    As to the CIS' inter-state structure, almost all its  members,  including the Russian Federation and the Republic of Armenia,  want a qualitatively new level for the CIS, a single economic  and cultural space.    In this context, development of relations with all CIS  countries is as important as of those with Russia. This should  include both restoration of economic, social, and cultural ties  and development of relations with the Baltic countries.    [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] How are our relations developing with  the countries of the East-European part of the  Commonwealth--Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova?    [Kirakosyan] The absence of active relations with these  states also is the result of our rather inflexible approach.  However, lately the state of affairs has improved markedly in  this respect, too. For instance, in February of this year we  opened a diplomatic representation of the Republic of Armenia in  Kiev; we are preparing a visit of the Armenian president to  Ukraine, where a large package of important documents will be  signed.    Finally, diplomatic relations have been established with the  Republic of Belarus. We will soon set up a diplomatic  representation in Minsk; an interim charge d'affairs of the  Republic of Armenia has been appointed to the Republic of  Belarus. We are working on mutually beneficial treaties and  agreements.    "Armenia-Ukraine" and "Armenia-Belarus" societies have been  established in Yerevan; they are engaged in strengthening  friendly ties between our peoples.    We still have a long way to go with respect to Moldova. We  have established close trade and economic relations with it.  However, for a variety of reasons, we cannot yet speak of  comprehensive relations.    [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] Mr. Kirakosyan, in your opinion, does  not the new Economic Union hamper the independent development of  CIS countries?    [Kirakosyan] Meetings among the prime ministers of three  Slavic republics--the Russian Federation, the Republic of  Belarus, and Ukraine--have taken place lately; these meetings  were marked by active discussions. As a result of negotiations,  a joint statement has been signed on urgent measures with  respect to acceleration of economic integration.    In connection with this agreement, opinions have been voiced  that the CIS has not lived up to expectations, and that by  taking this step, the stronger Slavic states are trying to shed  the less developed members.    Commenting on the results of this meeting, I can say that  this is a logical step which does not contradict the idea of the  CIS. Moreover, this step was taken further to its logical  conclusion by the three Slavic states in Moscow, at the  conference of heads of CIS states (which took place in the end  of September of this year), where an agreement was signed to  create the Economic Union, whose purpose is to serve only one  practical goal--creating a single market. Such a union has  become a necessity, since the former USSR republics can sell  most of their output only to one another, and in many instances  can produce the final product only with the help of one another.    The creation of such a union is logical; it is happening in  other regions of the world as well and does not in any way  hamper the independent development of CIS countries or keep them  from establishing and strengthening independent economic  relations with some or other country.    This union in the future envisages a great volume of work  both inside the CIS and in bilateral relations. In particular,  the parties to the agreement must ensure the compatibility of  taxation systems, establish visa-free travel, and so on.    Accepting the necessity of unified guiding principles of  economic relations, they expressed a willingness to bring  national legal codes into conformity with the criteria of the  aforementioned agreement and international law. It is also  envisaged to create joint bodies of administration, while  decisions affecting the Economic Union will be adopted only on  the basis of consensus.    [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] What is your appraisal of our  relations  with Transcaucasus states?    [Kirakosyan] The Transcaucasus region is in the center of  special attention. It is no secret that the security and  well-being of Armenia and the Armenian people depend to a large  extent on the situation that exists in this region, on the  correlation of different forces and interests, relations with  Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Iran. Bilateral relations with  neighboring countries are important. In this respect, it is hard  to overestimate the place and role of Georgia.    We need today to rethink Armenian-Georgian relations from  the  standpoint of national and state interests. First of all, we  should not forget about the more than half-million-strong  Armenian diaspora in Georgia, whose fate concerns us today. We  hope that the current authorities in Georgia will conduct a  farsighted policy of goodwill with respect to their citizens of  Armenian descent.    Much has been said about vitally important communications  that go through the territory of Georgia. I only want to add  that all transit shipping, including petroleum products and gas,  is being done on a mutually profitable basis. Unfortunately, it  is for this reason that the explanation for the frequent  robberies on transportation and the explosions on the gas  pipeline most likely lies in the instability and  crime-engendering situation inside Georgia than in its "ill  intents." When the region becomes relatively stable, an equal  level of our countries' economic development will finally allow  us in the future to cooperate in the sphere of joint production  and distribution of products and may in the future lead to the  desired economic integration.    In particular, a serious legal basis has been established  for  us to develop our relations along civilized lines. As is known,  during the meetings of heads of our states and governments (in  May and June of this year), about 30 treaties and agreements  were signed, including a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and  Mutual Security; an Inter-State Declaration of Economic  Cooperation; agreements on transit freight shipping, as well as  on cultural, scientific, and humanitarian cooperation; and other  documents. Each party set up government commissions to  coordinate their implementation.    The continuing political instability; the deepening of  Abkhazian-Georgian confrontation; and a certain polarity of  opinions regarding the ways to settle it--this is how,  unfortunately, we have to characterize the existing situation in  Georgia.    In these extreme conditions, several months ago an Armenian  Embassy was opened in Georgia, whose task is to serve the cause  of further development of Armenian-Georgian relations. There are  four diplomats working there, headed by an interim charge  d'affairs. A number of organizational issues with respect to  ensuring normal work of the diplomatic representation have been  resolved. The embassy was able to launch active work on  resolving the tasks set for it; close relations have been  established with the bodies of authority in the republic, as  well as with diplomatic representations accredited in Georgia.  They inform the Republic of Armenia's Ministry of Foreign  Relations in a timely manner on the events in the neighboring  republic, present their forecasts, and submit proposals aimed at  resolving emerging problems and developing relations between our  countries.    Many people are currently worried about the prospects for  future relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, especially  considering that the latter now has become a CIS member. I want  to say right away that our republic had no objections to  Azerbaijan's joining the CIS, and expressed hope that this  circumstance will become a stimulus for a peaceful resolution of  the Karabakh issue, the problem that represents the only  obstacle on the road of normal neighborly relations between  sovereign independent states. However, the latest events show  that the shortsighted, obstructionist actions of Azerbaijan's  current authorities do not leave any hope for achieving peace in  the near future. Numerous official statements by Yerevan and  Stepanakert and their foreign policy agencies, their acceptance  of a new cease-fire schedule, are proof of the desire on the  part of Karabakh to cease military actions.    We support the peacekeeping efforts of the UN and the CSCE,  as well as government, state, and public figures of a number of  states, who have taken upon themselves an important mission--the  fair resolution of the problem and establishing peace in our  region.    [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] How are our relations with Central  Asian states developing?    [Kirakosyan] After the collapse of the Soviet empire,  Central  Asia began to attract major powers of the world like a magnet.  The United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Great  Britain, as well as Korea, India and Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and  a number of other states, began to fish for their "miracle fish"  in Central Asian soil, which holds fabulous wealth.    Armenia also has its own direct interests in this region. As  is known, we still get our gas from Turkmenistan. We are, of  course, interested in the oil and grain, metals, cotton, and  relatively cheap food that the Central Asian states have in  abundance. Of course, had the roads been open, the situation  would have been different, since these states also are  interested in a number of goods produced in Armenia--electric  bulbs, electric motors, cable, chemicals, cognac and wine,  various technologies, electronic equipment, and so on. Through  the territory of Armenia, Central Asian states have a gateway to  Turkey (and from there on to Europe), as well as to Black Sea  ports. Armenia, in turn, through the Central Asian states would  have a gateway to the countries of Southeast Asia and the Far  East. As you can see, our relations with the Central Asian  republics are no less important. These relations are not always  smooth: old traditions are still strong in these states, and  they exert a strong influence in the sphere of state and  economic management.    Over the past year, we have established diplomatic relations  with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The  aforementioned and a number of other reasons still keep  Uzbekistan from establishing diplomatic relations in accordance  with international norms not only with Armenia, but also with  other CIS states. Uzbekistan is the only state of the former  USSR with which Armenia still has not established diplomatic  relations (actually, with exception of Azerbaijan).    With Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, we have signed protocols  on  cooperation between ministries of foreign affairs. Finally, we  signed long-term inter-state agreements with Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan (with the latter during the recent  visit of President L. Ter-Petrosyan). Dozens of economic  agreements and treaties have been signed and are operating at  different levels. The Embassy of the Republic of Armenia has  already been functioning in the capital of Kazakhstan, Almaty,  for several months. The interim charge d'affairs of the Republic  of Armenia at the same time represents our state's interests in  Bishkek. The embassy at this point has a minimal staff, but it  already is working actively.    We plan to open an embassy in Ashgabat before the end of the  year.    In short, we have a lot of things to do in the future, and I  can say that the Central Asian region will always remain at the  center of our attention.</p>

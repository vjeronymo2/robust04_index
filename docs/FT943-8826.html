			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / International Company News: IBM rethinks plans for PowerPC chips International Business Machines has backed away from plans for heavy promotion of PowerPC microprocessor technology, developed with Apple Computer and Motorola, as a replacement for the Intel chips that dominate the personal computer industry. The reversal raises questions about IBM's declared strategy to make PowerPC standard architecture for a broad range of its products. It may also be a setback for IBM's partners in the development of PowerPC microprocessor chip. Intel, the world's largest chip maker, will in contrast undoubtedly benefit from IBM's apparent reluctance to enter into a PC technology marketing battle. Rather than pushing customers to accept the new technology, the IBM PC division will 'let the customer decide', said Mr Rick Thoman, IBM senior vice-president and the new head of IBM's PC business. Mr Thoman is a long-time colleague of Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive. The two worked together for 22 years, at American Express and RJR Nabisco, prior to joining IBM. 'PowerPC technology has capabilities that don't exist in the current technology in terms of speed,' said Mr Thoman. 'But there are obvious negatives for PowerPC because it does not have an established base of application software.' Mr Thoman's public ambivalence toward PowerPC is in sharp contrast to the heavy promotion of the technology by other divisions of IBM, including IBM Microelectronics, the semiconductor division which manufactures PowerPC chips. His position also represents a change of strategy for the IBM PC division. Last November, just before Mr Thoman joined the company, IBM's PC marketers launched an unprecedented effort to promote PowerPC at Comdex, the biggest PC industry trade show, but there are clearly advantages in avoiding a marketing battle that could undermine sales of its Intel-based PCs. Mr Thoman said PowerPC may have greater significance in the high-end and mid-range systems parts of IBM 'which still generate the bulk of IBM's revenues and profits'. But without a solid base in the personal computer market, the future of PowerPC technology seems uncertain.</p>

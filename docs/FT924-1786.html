			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Petrofina deal with Saudi investors in jeopardy PLANS by Petrofina, Belgium's oil company, for the Dollars 500m sale of half of its US refining and marketing assets to private Saudi Arabian investors could be jeopardised by the reluctance of the Saudi government to sanction the deal. If the Saudi deal does not go ahead by the end of the year - a deadline set by the company - it raises the possibility Petrofina may put its paints division up for sale in order to repay some of its debt, accor-ding to industry analysts. Petrofina's 86 per cent-owned US subsidiary, Fina, has been involved in talks with the Saudi investors for about 18 months. The sale would include 50 per cent of the company's two refineries at Port Arthur and Big Spring in Texas as well as its small chain of petrol stations and chemicals plants. Petrofina does not produce enough oil in the US to service its refining operations and the rationale behind the sale is that Saudi Arabia would provide crude oil to feed the refineries. However, the company is still not sure whether the deal will go ahead. Petrofina, which announced on Monday it would halve its dividend pay-out this year due to significantly lower profit forecasts, has seen its debt to equity ratio increase to just over 50 per cent this year. The company's shares fell sharply on the Brussels bourse yesterday as investors expressed their surprise at the extent of the dividend cut from last year's BFr561 a share. The stock recovered slightly during the afternoon to close down BFr500 at BFr7,490. Mr Francois Cornelis, Petrofina's chief executive officer said on Monday the company expected to see sharply lower profits for this year following the effect of the recession on its businesses. The company indicated yesterday that 1993 would also be an extremely difficult year and it was not expecting to see an upturn in the western European economy until towards the end of next year. Mr David Stedman, oil equity analyst at Daiwa Europe, expects the company to post a net profit of BFr7.3bn (Dollars 226m) this year, less than half last year's level of BFr16.3bn. 'It will inevitably be a poor year next year,' he said. 'They have a range of good quality assets, but no one in their position could turn it around in such a short time.' Petrofina's refining, marketing and chemicals assets are concentrated in Europe and the US which have borne the brunt of the recession. The company has almost no exposure to the Far East - where oil demand has been growing throughout the recession in Europe and the US. The company announced it was slashing its capital expenditure from BFr52bn this year to BFr40bn next year, but it would continue to focus on its core investments, including the completion of deep water facilities at its Antwerp refinery and further development plans in the North Sea. Petrofina faces potentially large investment costs for its 30 per cent stake in Norway's Ekofisk field where the authorities have called for safety standards to be improved. This could involve the commissioning of a completely new oil platform at a cost of over Dollars 1bn to the field's partners. World stockmarkets, Page 37</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold steadies after touching 3-month low - Market report The GOLD price steadied after sliding overnight on Japan's announcement that it was planning to sell about 90 tonnes of melted-down surplus gold coins. In London the price hit a three-month low of Dollars 375.45 a troy ounce at the morning fixing before ending at Dollars 376, down Dollars 1.60 on the day. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER was generally steadier but seemed content to trade within a fairly static Dollars 1,900-Dollars 1,920 a tonne range for three months delivery. London Commodity Exchange May COCOA futures closed Dollars 12 up in London up at Dollars 930 a tonne and traders thought fresh buying might be triggered if it broke above Dollars 937.

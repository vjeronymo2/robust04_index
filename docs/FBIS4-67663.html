			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hao Xinping [6787 2450 1627]] </F>   [Summary] Although China has attained significant  achievements in controlling malaria, schistosomiasis,  filariasis, and black fever, not much has been studied on the  scope of distribution, rules of spreading, degrees of damage of  the more harmful parasites. In 1986 the Ministry of Public  Health launched on unprecedented large-scale study on parasitic  infection. According to the report given in the "National Survey  on Distribution of Human Parasites," 62.6 percent of Chinese  people are infected with 56 kinds of parasites, among them, 19  are protozoa, 16 flukes, 12 nematodes (eelworms), eight cestodes  (tapeworms), and one thornheaded worm. The Taiwan thornbelt  fluke found in Fujian, tiny spinous fluke and narrow testis  thornmouth fluke found in Anhui and Fujian, are the two first  time-reported parasites, and the Fujian spinous fluke is a  newly-discovered species in China. There are more unidentified  newly-discovered parasites found in every province. According to  the report, among 147,7742 [as printed] people surveyed, 10.315  percent are infected with protozoa, 0.573 percent with flukes,  0.195 percent with cestodes, 59.022 percent with nematodes, and  43.33 percent of the surveyed population are cross-infected with  two or more kinds of parasites, some are even infected with nine  kinds of parasites. Some children under five years old are  already infected with six kinds of parasites. Higher roundworm  (46.999 percent), hookworm (17.166 percent) and whipworm (18.796  percent) infections are also reported in the above surveyed  population. The data indicate that in China, by estimate, about  531 million people are infected with roundworms, 194 million  with hookworms, and 212 million with whipworms.</p>

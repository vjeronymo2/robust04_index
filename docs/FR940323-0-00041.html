			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation has not been changed; as written, it closely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tracks the statute. Programs will provide child care assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to participants who need it in order to participate; they will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine on a case-by-case basis whether individuals are eligible. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective participant with extremely undependable child care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could certainly argue that he or she would not be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate without child care benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Health Care.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2522.250(b)) One commenter stated that the regulations should clarify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AmeriCorps participants should not be asked to pay premiums or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deductibles, that the health care plan should include preventive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pregnancy care, as well as eye and dental care and workers compensation, and that there should be a 1&hyph;2 month delay in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility, since attrition is highest during this period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation will issue written guidelines setting forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required specifications of the AmeriCorps health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> package. These comments will be taken into consideration in the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies at that time. In addition, the health care section of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations has been rewritten to provide greater clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2522.250 has been revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State Priorities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2522.410(b)(1)(i)) One commenter argued that States should be encouraged to adopt priorities that fit within the national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priorities. The commenter felt that this would facilitate a comprehensive, focused national service effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation agrees that requiring States to adopt national priorities might create a more focused national effort, but this change was not made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the Corporation strongly believes that it was Congress' intent to maintain a large degree of State autonomy with formula funds. States are in the best position to judge which needs are most pressing within a State and thus what the State priorities should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program types.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended for inclusion in the regulations additional provisions relating to the needs of inner cities. Specifically, the commenter recommended adding an example to &sect;2522.110(b)(1) of a community service program in a high unemployment, high need urban area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also suggested that the provision describing a program for economically disadvantaged individuals (&sect;2522.110(b)(3)) be expanded to add a requirement that it meet the employment needs of low income people and the business development needs of inner city neighborhoods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes have not been made. The program types included in the regulations are all taken directly from the statute. More importantly, as discussed in the January 7 preamble, a program does not necessarily have to be listed as a program type in &sect;2522.110 in order to receive a grant. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation has designated any program that meets the minimum program requirements listed in &sect;2522.100 as eligible to apply for a grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Higher education cap.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters argued that the regulations should restrict to 10% the percentage of a State's educational award formula allotment that institutions of higher education may receive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation declines to regulate on this issue. Which programs are proposed for funding in the State formula allotment, and how any available educational awards are distributed among them, is up to the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ineligible service activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (&sect;2520.30) A number of commenters suggested that the Corporation revise the treatment of provisions prohibiting lobbying by participants in the course of their service. A number of commenters argued that the list of prohibited activities was too large and went beyond the statute. Some commenters stated that the proposed regulations would have an overly restrictive impact on programs and participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation believes the service activity restrictions will not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative impact on programs or participants and that the list will keep programs focused on service that has direct and demonstrable results. However, the Corporation does not intend to limit the right of individuals to engage in any of the prohibited activities voluntarily and on their own time. Accordingly, the regulations have been amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2520.30 has been revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Selection criteria.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested rewriting the AmeriCorps selection criteria so that replicability and sustainability are more closely linked with innovation, rather than listing innovation, replicability and sustainability as separate criteria. Another commenter suggested adding a selection criterion which would consider the extent to which programs promote diversity, community-building and citizenship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulatory selection criteria have been drafted broadly to allow for flexibility from year to year and therefore are not being changed. The fiscal year 1994 selection criteria contained in the applications will stress the extent to which programs are likely to achieve the three desired impacts: ``getting things done,'' improving the lives of participants, and strengthening the ties that bind communities together.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal agency eligibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarification in &sect;2523.20 on whether ``cabinet-level department'' would include an executive agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive agencies are eligible. The regulations have been revised, replacing ``cabinet-level department'' with ``Executive Branch Agency or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2523.20 has been amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (15)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Approved partnerships.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarification of the term ``approved partnership or consortium'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in &sect;2523.60. Specifically, the commenter asked for an explanation of how a partnership or consortium is approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Partnerships will be approved by the Corporation as part of the application process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2523.60 has been amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (16)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program requirements addition.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (&sect;2522.100) One commenter suggested that the Corporation add a requirement that AmeriCorps programs provide career counseling to participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation did not add this as a program requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because programs are already required under &sect;2522.100(k)(1) to provide support services to participants who are making the transition to careers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (17)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National nonprofit eligibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested clarification of the eligibility of national nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations to apply for funding through subgrants, as well as directly from the Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

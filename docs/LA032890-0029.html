			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> State Farm Insurance has agreed to award an undisclosed sum to the parents of  an 8-year-old Imperial Beach boy who died after he was accidently shot and  killed in a neighbor's house this month.  </P> <P> The settlement was for injuries the boy suffered in a car accident more than  two years ago.  </P> <P> Charles B. Pederson, a La Jolla attorney representing the parents of the child,  Richard Krecklow II, released a statement that said, "The Krecklows and State  Farm have agreed to settle all claims for personal injuries sustained by  Richard Krecklow on Dec. 7, 1987, prior to his unfortunate death. . . . The  parties have also agreed that the terms of the settlement will remain  confidential."  </P> <P> John Cross, a State Farm division claims supervisor, said Tuesday that the  agreement with Pederson was reached a week ago.  </P> <P> Pederson had said in an earlier interview that, the day before the boy was  shot, his parents had accepted a $225,000 offer from State Farm to settle the  auto accident case. But the insurance company, Pederson said, had told him it  wanted to reevaluate the settlement because the boy was dead and the settlement  had never been approved in Superior Court.  </P> <P> The youngster was struck by a car while in a crosswalk at 3rd and K streets in  Chula Vista, Pederson said. The child was cut and bruised and had scars over  much of his body after being dragged 120 feet. The driver was insured by State  Farm.  </P></p>

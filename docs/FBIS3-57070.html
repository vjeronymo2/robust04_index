Linkevicius, who is a member of the LDLP faction himself,  was  appointed as defense minister last fall on the recommendation of  his faction.    On Thursday [20 January], the board of the LDLP faction  invited Linkevicius for a discussion. MP Arvydas Ivaskevicus,  member of the parliament's National Security Committee, called  Linkevicius' attention to "machinations" of high-ranking Defense  Ministry officials. The lawmaker said he obtained information  that the ministry unlawfully rents military facilities to  commercial structures.    The meeting's participants said they are concerned about a  high death and injury rate in the Armed Forces. "The Lithuanian  Army is a smaller model of the Soviet Army," Ivaskevicius said.    MP Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the National Security  Committee, said he is completely unsatisfied with the national  defense reorganization plan that was submitted to the president  behind the committee's back.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stipe Mesic, chairman of the Chamber of </F> Representatives of the Croatian Assembly, by Heni Erceg; place  and date not given: "Stalinism Is Being Restored in Croatia"]    [Text] [Erceg] Did you expect that in one moment it is  precisely Josip Manolic who would become an item on the agenda  of your party's Council?    [Mesic] The Council of the Croatian Democratic Community  [HDZ], just like the leadership of any other party, can and must  discuss all problems in foreign and domestic policy. And it is  not strange at all that the Council analyzed some of Manolic's  performances. However, the debate did not give a single  indication that the exclusion or punishment of Manolic might be  demanded. Only three members demanded that Manolic be excluded.  Everything else was within the limits of a principled debate.    [Erceg] Who are those three members?    [Mesic] Antun Vrdoljak, Ivan Milas, and Ivic Pasalic. At  the end, President Tudjman concluded that the Manolic case  should still be brought up in the Court of Honor. Even that  could be accepted as a part of the democratic procedure, and a  right of the party's chairman to make such a decision.    [Erceg] What was the debate at the meeting of the Council  like? Did you support Manolic's attitudes?    [Mesic] I referred in my speech to the attitude that the  issue of Bosnia was a difficulty for both the great powers and  the European Community, but now, when we have the Washington  agreement, everybody has to take the consequences for his or her  earlier policy, and that is it. When the president demanded  that Manolic go to the Court of Honor, I thought that would be  the end of the issue. Moreover, President Tudjman invited us all  to a lunch. I did not join them for the lunch, because a  meeting of the Assembly was to start at the same time. And then  everything, which is so far away from any democracy, started.  <H5>  Lunch at Tudjman's </H5>   [Ercog] When did you realize that the invitation to the  lunch was actually an invitation to something completely  different?    [Mesic] At the time when Manolic and I reached the Assembly,  the action of his removal from the office of chairman of the  Chamber of Counties was already going on, despite the conclusion  of the Council that the Court of Honor was supposed to meet only  later! When we arrived at the Assembly, we heard that some  signatures were being collected, and who was collecting them.    [Ercog] Who was collecting them?    [Mesic] Vrdoljak and Milas were engaged from the beginning,  and then Pasalic and Jure Radic joined them. The issue is about  an action that reminds me of a sort of enlightened bolshevism,  and I cannot accept that. For it means that, while we were  sitting in the Council, somebody sent a message that the action  should start.    [Ercog] Somebody means President Tudjman, does not it?    [Mesic] I do not know that, but if he had been against it,  he could have stopped it. He still can stop it, and call to  account those who took to themselves a right to ignore the Court  of Honor. Of course, the question is raised how that group in  the Assembly came to know what the HDZ Council had decided,  since there are no letters, written statements.... This means  that an underground connection provided the information, and all  that has nothing to do with democracy.    [Ercog] It is being claimed that 36 signatures have been  collected against Manolic.    [Mesic] Which method did they use to obtain those  signatures? Who charged them with doing that, and on whose  behalf? The Council did not make such a decision, while the HDZ  club is not the place where the policy of the party is designed.  Everything that was done is illegal, and somebody has to take  the consequences for that!    [Ercog] Do you share the opinion that there is a  parliamentary crisis in Croatia?    [Mesic] Basically yes, although it does not necessarily have  to continue, unless it is insisted upon. The cause of the  crisis is to be found in the fact that the internal conflict in  one party has reflected itself in the work of the parliament.  Of course, that may cause a deeper parliamentary crisis.  Because, look, a meeting of the Assembly has been announced for  Thursday, but prior to the meeting we have to get the approval  from the Chamber of Counties with regard to certain laws. If  the Chamber of Counties fails to meet, or its work is blocked  again, then neither will the Chamber of Representatives be able  to function, and the entire work of the parliament will be  called into question.  <H5>  Early Elections? </H5>   [Ercog] In that case, will early elections possibly be taken  into consideration?    [Mesic] If the crisis continues, early elections will be  inevitable.    [Ercog] Milas persistently maintains that the majority of  the parliamentarians lost their confidence in Manolic a long  time ago.    [Mesic] Everybody has a right to struggle for his or her  opinion, and to disagree with Manolic's opinion. A right of the  parliamentarians is also to say and undertake whatever actions  they want, but regardful of the Assembly procedure. However, we  have reached the stage where a university professor is used,  namely Smiljko Sokolj, who publicly, in front of the TV  audience, does not speak the truth, who misconstrues the essence  of the dispute. I am a jurist as well, and I have checked out  the document that the group demanding the removal of Manolic  brandished all over the place. All that is stated there is a  demand, written in a commanding manner, that a commission should  be called, while everything else are illegible signatures.  Civility, rather than law, demands that it should be written as  follows: We would appreciate it if a meeting of the Commission  were to be called... we propose that the following issue be put  on the agenda... and also that the deputies who make that demand  should put their signatures next to their typed names, so it can  be seen that those are authentic signatures. We are not living  in a dictatorship, for God's sake.... Instead, scandalous  violence has been applied that discloses the uniformity of  opinions. I said already 100 times that I shall never accept to  put up with the uniformity of opinions again, and now it is  being imposed on me again. And when I only think about who is  doing that....    [Ercog] Was it not natural, and what was obviously expected  by Manolic himself, that after the Washington agreement, those  who are responsible for the breakout of the Muslim-Croatian  conflict should be removed from political functions?    [Mesic] It would be normal if everybody were to take the  consequences for his or her earlier policies, because the people  are neither mentally retarded, nor are they politically  ignorant. The people know all too well which policy any of us  supported. I still stick to my principle that names should not  be publicly named, but I have a right to perceive certain  occurrences, and consequently, those who brought about those  occurrences as well.    [Ercog] Do you think that it is his public disagreement with  the policy of President Tudjman, particularly with the policy on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, that was fatal for Manolic? Do you  personally agree with Manolic?    [Mesic] Manolic is a man who had entered politics as a  principled fighter for democracy and the lawful state. If the  lawful state does not function, somebody has to be called to  account. The same attitude is also toward the Croatian policy  on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Manolic rightfully raises the question  of who made the decision on the opening of the concentration  camps in Bosnia. It is not sufficient to say that the other  warring faction also had such camps. That is no justification.  Let us see who made the decision. Who passed the regulations  on the behavior in the camps, who is to blame for the conditions  there? Who made decisions on that? Somebody had to make  decisions on that, as well as the decision that a conflict with  Muslims should be triggered. And when the conflict broke out,  why was not a way out sought in negotiations? No, the efforts  were made only to make the conflict escalate. All these  questions urged Manolic to demand that accountability for that  policy be established, and that the names of the guilty parties  be made public. He has never been in a personal conflict with  Gojko Susak, but all Manolic demands is that occurrences and  their protagonists be identified, and that they be called to  account.  <H5>  Vrdoljak's Announcement </H5>   [Ercog] Did you expect this attack against, until yesterday,  the second most important official in the country to happen?    [Mesic] First I have to say that Manolic is so independent  that he never consults with anybody. So it is first you and  your newspaper that learned about his latest performance, while  as for myself, I knew there would be reactions as soon as I read  the interview in the FERAL TRIBUNE. In the first place because  President Tudjman often emphasized that Susak is his best HDZ  member, and one of the best ministers. I supposed that the  president would try to protect Susak. However, the way in which  that group tried to make use of Manolic's criticism equals the  most magnificent moments of bolshevik persecutions at the time  of Stalin.    [Ercog] Why did not President Tudjman ever defend you and  your dignity from the attacks by your party colleagues in the  way he is defending Susak now?    [Mesic] You know, Branimir Glavas said of me that I was a  personification of evil, while -- conditionally said -- Vrdoljak  said, following my warning at a parliamentary meeting that he  ought to calm down, that he did not talk with the politically  dead. And nothing happened! Nobody calls him to account,  although I am the chairman of the parliament. Is that not  interesting? Which means, an entire group of HDZ members is  involved in the defense of one man by attacking Manolic, while  in view of everything else that other people were told -- and  many offensive things were said -- nothing has ever been done  about it.    [Ercog] Will the issue result in the creation of some more  room for hawks, and even for the possible continuation of purges?    [Mesic] I expect that the supporters of Manolic will be the  main target now. All those who want to square accounts with  somebody will be finding Manolic's supporters in their towns,  firms, neighborhoods,.... Just like at the time of the most  rigid communism. I am afraid of that, and it would be really  good if that could be possibly avoided.    [Ercog] Do you think that the time for doing away with you  has come?    [Mesic] I think it has. Particularly in view of the fact  that Vrdoljak has already announced that by calling me a  politically dead person, and he is usually very well informed.  <H5>  Many Are Intimidated </H5>   [Ercog] If Manolic still offers his resignation, will you  stay in the office of the chairman of the Assembly?    [Mesic] Manolic is not going to resign, and therefore I am  remaining in office.    [Ercog] There are many other mechanisms of elimination.    [Mesic] Yes, there are, but the democratic ones, and that  process is quite long, you know....    [Ercog] Do you believe that President Tudjman will stick to  his attitude in this situation, or is he going to make yet  another of his political turns?    [Mesic] I want to believe that the president will call to  account all those who have gone for such a vulgar way of  squaring accounts with opponents, and that the tensions will  ease off. If that were not to be that way....    [Ercog] Would you then join the party the foundation of  which has been announced by Manolic?    [Mesic] Manolic is a co-founder of the HDZ platform that  suited me at the time. If Joza [Manolic] proposes a new  platform that proffers much more, I will certainly think about  that.    [Ercog] What has been the reaction in the world to this sort  of onslaught on the Croatian Parliament?    [Mesic] I have received many inquiring letters from many  colleagues from the European parliaments, as well as from our  citizens from abroad. For all of them it has been quite  unexpected, and many feel intimidated. I told them the same as  I have told you. I repeat that a vulgar, bolshevik-style attack  has been undertaken against Manolic. I do not know who approved  it, but do not worry, I shall bring that issue up for discussion  at the next meeting of the HDZ Council.    [Ercog] Are you afraid of a possible turn toward  dictatorship?    [Mesic] I shall bring the issues we have talked about up in  the Council, and after that you shall see what kind of  conversation we shall be carrying on, and if we shall be able to  carry on any at all.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Each Blended Fund will treat its investment in each Portfolio of Core Trust as subject to the requirements of Guide 3 of the Guidelines for the Preparation and Filing of Form N&hyph;1A so that the level of disclosure in the prospectus will be governed by the level of its investment in the portfolio of Core Trust. Thus, a Blended Fund that maintains an investment in a Portfolio in an amount of less than 5% of its net assets will include a brief description of the Portfolio, whereas a Blended Fund that invests 5% or more of its net assets in a Portfolio will include a more detailed description of the Portfolio and its objectives, risks, and manner of operation. In addition, each Blended Fund will list the securities held by the Portfolios in which it invests and the amount and value of its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  interest in each such security in its reports to shareholders under section 30(d) of the Act and rule 30d&hyph;1 thereunder to the same extent as if the Blended Fund held the securities directly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The Blended Funds may invest directly in some securities also held by the three Portfolios. Applicants believe that it is unlikely that any Blended Fund will incur unnecessary brokerage costs because it sells a security at the same time a Portfolio buys the same security, or vice versa. First, the actual overlap between the various portfolios is very small. Moreover, all portfolios of the Blended Funds and the Portfolios are expected to have very low turnover ratios, making the possibility of opposing buy/sell orders even less likely. In addition, the Blended Funds and the Index and Small Company Portfolios will all be managed by the Bank, which will monitor for offsetting buy/sell orders. Although the Bank and Schroder do not share portfolio information in advance, applicants believe that because Norwest and Schroder employ substantially different criteria for their investment decisions, they would rarely engage in transactions in the same security on the same day. Indeed, the historical experience of the CIFs indicates the possibility is remote that two portfolios managers might enter buy and sell orders for the same security at the same time. A review of the portfolios of the component CIFs from January 1, 1994 to May 31, 1994 reveals only one occasion on which one portfolio sold a security on the same day another purchased the same security. The brokerage costs associated with this transaction were $142.00. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act provides that no registered investment company may acquire securities of another investment company representing more than 3% of the acquired company's outstanding voting stock, more than 5% of the acquiring company's total assets, or, together with the securities of other investment companies, more than 10% of the acquiring company's total assets. Section 12(d)(1)(B) provides that no registered open-end investment company may sell its securities to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than 3% of the acquired company's voting stock, or if the sale will cause more than 10% of the acquired company's voting stock to be owned by investment companies. Section 6(c) provides that the SEC may exempt persons or transactions from any or all sections of the Act when necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from section 12(d)(1) to the extent necessary to permit the Blended Funds' proposed investments in the Portfolios. Applicants believe that the proposed investment structure will not be subject to any of the abuses that section 12(d)(1) was intended to prevent. There is no risk that management of the Blended Funds will exercise inappropriate control over the management of Core Trust because (a) the Bank will be the investment adviser for all Blended Funds, as well as any Blended Funds, that may invest in the Small Company, International, or Index Portfolios of Core Trust; and (b) the Blended Funds and Future Funds will be the only investors in the Portfolios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. If large-scale redemptions by public shareholders require a major change in the level of investment by a Blended Fund in the Portfolios such that the Portfolios might be required to liquidate securities in their portfolios in such a manner that the shareholders in other non-redeeming Blended Funds would be prejudiced, the Portfolios may make the redemptions in-kind by distributing securities in its portfolios, rather than cash, to the redeeming Blended Fund. Such in-kind transactions would comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of rule 17a&hyph;7, except that the consideration for the portfolio securities would be shares in the Portfolio rather than cash. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants believe that the Blended Funds' investment in Core Trust will not result in significant duplication of the costs of distribution, portfolio management, fund administration, or operations. Core Trust shares will not be subject to any sales load or rule 12b&hyph;1 fees. The Bank will waive its advisory fee for serving as investment adviser to the Small Company and Index Portfolios of Core Trust and will reimburse the International Portfolio of Core Trust an amount equal to the advisory fees the Portfolio pays to Schroder, and Forum will not receive any fees for administering that portion of any Blended Fund that invests in Core Trust. Although there will be some duplication of custodial, transfer agency, and other expenses, applicants believe that the layering of these expenses will be minimal, and that the efficiencies that the Blended Funds should achieve in portfolio management and fund operations will result in net cost savings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. To a limited extent, the Blended Funds may invest directly in some securities also held by the Portfolios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants believe it is unlikely that any Blended Fund will incur unnecessary brokerage costs because it sells a security at the same time a Portfolio buys the same security, or vice versa.

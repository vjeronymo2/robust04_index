			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Observer: HBR's new team The rumblings at the top of the Harvard Business Review, flagship of the world's best known management school, are getting ever louder. The professionals are being brought in to transform a long-standing cottage industry into a major publishing venture. Laurance Allen, 47, an old FT hand who started our US publishing operation, is taking over as publisher of the 70-year-old bi-monthly (circulation 220,000) and T George Harris, 67, an ex-Time Life staffer and former editor of American Health and Psychology Today magazines, is the new editor. Bringing in a couple of publishing professionals is the surest sign that Harvard is intent on maximising the returns from its academic name. The Review has sales of around Dollars 25m and is unusual in that over half its revenues come from subscriptions and the rest is split between reprints and advertising. The unease of some Harvard business professors is understandable. The Review has not lost its way like Vanity Fair had. Admittedly, its reputation for being first with the latest management thinking has been challenged by the California Management Review (and also, among top executives, by the McKinsey Quarterly). But it is still a 'must' read for many executives, not only at the top of organisations but also down the hierarchy. The dilemma for successive editors of the Review has been how to increase its circulation - by making it less of a journal and more of a magazine - while retaining its definitive character and its academic respectability, at least at the Harvard Business School itself. The next editor is not a Harvard professor like the last two incumbents, Theodore Levitt and Rosabeth Moss Kanter. But the combination of his age, his record and his establishment connections - he is married to a Rockefeller - suggest that he is also not another Tina Brown.</p>

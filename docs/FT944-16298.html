			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / War of nerves carries a crippling price tag: Two generations of Kuwaitis have been cocooned from income tax Kuwait is once again bracing itself to pay a large part of the costs for the US - and British - military presence in Kuwait and the northern Gulf as a result of the latest confrontation with Iraq. But in spite of paying out, by its own estimates, Dollars 47bn - half its total reserves - to finance the cost of coalition forces liberating Kuwait in 1991, the government has barely started to educate the public, let alone convince the national assembly (parliament) that the days of a tax-free existence are over. On Wednesday Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the US, Britain and the six states of the Gulf Co-operation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) had agreed 'to share the cost of the joint effort and to set up a fund', which would assess the costs and agree the amounts to be paid by each. In practice, however, Kuwait is uneasily aware it and Saudi Arabia will be expected to come up with the lion's share, which will increase the longer US forces are stationed in Kuwait for its protection. Already, Kuwaiti newspapers are reflecting public concern about the extent and the permanence of Iraq's withdrawal. 'How soon, how far, how long?' ran the headline in Wednesday's Arab Times. Kuwaitis have concluded that this chapter in the war of nerves will continue for some time. If the last Gulf crisis cost Kuwait Dollars 47bn and Saudi Arabia some Dollars 60bn, this time around the figures may be in the low billions of dollars. 'Whatever has to be done will be done,' Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader, managing director of the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), said. The KIA manages Kuwait's reserves both in the State General Reserve, which holds all of the unrealisable assets such as historic and irredeemable loans to third-world countries, allocations to international institutions such as the IMF, and assets of Kuwait Airways; and the Reserve Fund for Future Generations (RFFG), which contains the quality and liquid assets. A recent report by the planning ministry put the total value of Kuwait's reserves for the fiscal year ending June 30 1994 at KD18.5bn (Dollars 61bn). Of this Dollars 23.1bn was in the general reserve, and the larger amount, Dollars 37.9bn, in the RFFG. According to Al-Shall Economic Consultants, KIA's investment income and asset appreciation last year added Dollars 6bn to the value of reserves. However, actual budget deficits for the last three years have amounted to KD1.57bn (Dollars 5.2bn) in 1992/93, KD1.2bn (Dollars 4bn) in 1993/94, and is projected at KD1.85bn (Dollars 6.1bn) for this fiscal year. Economists have pointed out that oil revenues, which make up 88 per cent of the total, are conservatively predicated at Dollars 12 a barrel; and further that annual defence costs of KD500m (Dollars 1.65bn) are for the first time included in estimated expenditures. Set against this is the likelihood this year of lower returns from KIA investments and the fact that budget defence figures represent only current expenditure, not capital costs for arms purchases. The defence reinforcement budget amounts to Dollars 11.5bn, to be spread over 12 years from 1992, at the rate of up to roughly Dollars 1bn a year. But the government has already spent or committed Dollars 4bn in two years. Defence expenditure now accounts for 70 per cent of total average oil revenue of the last two fiscal years. Commitments from this most recent crisis will mean still more outflows. The national assembly has consistently refused to countenance any suggestion of income taxes on Kuwaiti residents or any corporate tax on Kuwaiti companies. For two generations Kuwaitis have been cocooned. This latest crisis is beginning to concentrate their minds.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "Ten Organizations Were Refused </F> Registration"]    [Text] Riga, 10 May -- The Latvian Ministry of Justice has  refused to register approximately 10 social and political  organizations whose statutes do not correspond with Latvian  legislation.    As DIENA was informed by Maris Krumins, chief of the  department for registration of mass information media and social  organizations in the Ministry of Justice, this is not a large  number, in comparison with the total number of registered  organizations. Thus far, the Ministry has registered 763 social  organizations, 134 foundations, 306 sports organizations, and  35 political organizations.    Registration was denied on 19 July 1993 to the Latvian  Communist Union [LKS] headed by Igor Lopatin, on the grounds  that activities of a communist party in the Latvian Republic are  forbidden.    On 9 August 1993, registration was also denied to the  Latvian  Union for Protection of Veterans [LVTAS], whose leader is  Alberts Lebedevs. This organization was established, after the  activity of the Council of War and Labor Veterans, which took an  active part in the August coup, was forbidden on 10 September  1991.    The LVTAS statutes state that it is a social organization  uniting, on a voluntary basis, war veterans, retired and reserve  officers, and Russian Army military personnel as well as civil  staff of the military facilities, residing permanently in  Latvia, and their family members. This organization also was a  collective member of the Baltic Region Officers Union, which in  turn is a member of an Russian officers association forbidden in  Russia.    On 12 August 1993 the veteran organization applied to the  court with a complaint against the Ministry of Justice, for  refusing it registration. Until now, two court sessions have  been held, and the third is due in late May. At their third  annual conference on 19 March of the current year, the veterans  mentioned as their main goal the registration of their  organization. The organization is still active and comprises  3,300 members, as DIENA learned at the conference.    The Ministry of Justice has also declined to register the  recently established "League of the Apatrids [people without  homeland]" [LAL]. The Minister of Justice Egils Levits states  in the refusal that inhabitants who are not Latvian citizens  cannot carry out political activities in the Latvian Republic.  Nonetheless, LAL is setting as its goal the stimulation of the  activities of the noncitizens in Latvia. In their appeal, they  say that the goal of LAL is to integrate the noncitizens in  Latvia and to serve as their representative. At the meeting on  9 May, LAL disseminated a poll with the names of the candidates  for the representative organ of the League.    Besides the above mentioned organizations, the Ministry of  Justice refused to register a similar veteran organization in  Liepaja, the 11th regiment of dragoons organized by lieutenant  Mihail Ustinov, and the club for breeding "Gladiator" guard  dogs. Also the organizations bearing the same name as those who  already have been registered have been refused registration --  the second Liberal Party, and the second Latvian National  Independent Movement.</p>

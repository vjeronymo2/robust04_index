			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Books: Lawrence's writing in the raw - Anthony Curtis welcomes the original text of a famous novel SONS AND LOVERS by D H Lawrence, edited by Helen Baron and Carl Baron Cambridge Pounds 70, 675 pages SONS and Lovers was published on May 29 1913 by Gerald Duckworth and was the novel that established D H Lawrence as a writer of importance. But the text that has been in general use for the past 79 years is not the one that Lawrence, had he lived in an ideal world, would have wished to stand as the true text of his novel - or so the editors of this new edition tell us. Helen and Carl Baron have scrutinised the manuscripts of the earlier drafts (where the novel is titled Paul Morel) and the original sets of proofs corrected by Lawrence and have produced a text as close as possible to the one that they believe Lawrence would have preferred to have seen in use. That, as they realise, is a hypothetical criterion. If Lawrence could return from the dead to read the book under review he might conceivably have second thoughts and wish to continue to leave out material they have put back. There is, for example, the parallel case of T S Eliot, whose Waste Land first appeared in a text that had been drastically cut from the original version by Ezra Pound. The poet gratefully accepted these cuts as an improvement of his work and they have remained in force ever since. The first printed version of The Waste Land has not been superseded, even though the earlier and much longer uncut version was made available to the public after Eliot's death. But there is good reason to believe that, unlike Eliot, Lawrence was not at all happy about the cuts made by Edward Garnett for that first edition of Sons and Lovers and that he only agreed to them out of expediency. He desperately needed at this crisis point in his life - when he had turned his back on Eastwood and England and had gone to Germany with Frieda - to get his novel published, both for the sake of his reputation and to earn some urgently required cash. For his later books he would break free of Garnett's editorial yoke and would in most instances refuse to compromise on points of emendation and cuts requested by publishers. The changes imposed by Garnett come under two main heads: those made in deference to Mrs Grundy, and those made to give greater unity (in Garnett's eyes) to the ultimate shape of the novel. Mrs Grundy was a fictional Mary Whitehouse who emerged at the end of the 18th century and whose abhorrence of any hint of explicit eroticism in the text of a novel acted as a tyrannical restraint upon publishers and hence upon novelists, particularly in the late Victorian period. Mrs Grundy's views were rigorously upheld by the circulating libraries which were the chief commercial outlet for fiction-publishing in the UK until the 1930s. Many of the leading male late Victorian English novelists suffered grievously from Mrs Grundy. She was, for example, an important cause of Hardy giving up novel-writing. George Moore publicly took issue with her in his pamphlet Literature at Nurse, attacking her strictures while he defied them in novels like A Modern Lover. But it was left to Lawrence and Joyce to rout her totally. The editors of this new edition give several examples of the kind of changes Garnett made in his Grundyite capacity. One example will suffice. In the chapter 'Passion', Lawrence originally wrote: 'He bent forward and kissed the two white glistening globes she cradled.' This sentence has appeared hitherto as: 'He bent forward and kissed her, held her suddenly close and kissed her again'. It is good now in this edition to have the truly Lawrentian passage restored and this applies at many other points in the story. The question of unity is more controversial. The editors point out that Garnett, schooled in the mainstream tradition of the English novel, conceived of unity as a narrative that subordinated everything to tracing the fortunes of an eponymous hero or heroine. They also point out that Lawrence finally called his novel Sons plural and Lovers and that its unity comes from its detailed depiction of one family, a group of remarkably well-defined individuals, their interaction with each other and with those people outside who threaten the mother-dominated family's solidarity. The novel is, in spite of the earlier title, a novel about a family-group, its survival and ultimate break-up, not just a novel about Paul Morel, Lawrence's fictional alter ego. Thus William, Paul's older brother, competes for the reader's attention in the opening until his untimely demise - so harrowingly described in the chapter called 'A Death in the Family'. Mrs Morel's reaction to William's betrothal to the vacuous Lily, who gives herself such airs when she comes to stay with them, foreshadows Mrs Morel's attitude to Paul in his relations with Miriam. Garnett, keen to get on with the narrative, cut some passages relating to Will. A comparison between the two versions suggests that in the event Garnett was quite skilful and that nothing of really crucial importance was lost. The character of upwardly mobile Will, the first family member to rise within the system, renounce the pits as a bread-ticket, integrate himself into the metropolitan middle-class and make a disastrous liaison with a woman quite unsuited to him, has always been a distinct part of the whole picture. Here again it is good to have precious sentences and touches, making it even fuller rehabilitated. Even if we do not feel that the novel emerges in quite such a radically altered form as the editors imply, we can all be grateful for the appearance of this much more authentic text. The explanatory notes contain a wealth of information on everything from local Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire dialects to music hall songs, Biblical, classical and French literature, illuminating Lawrence's more obscure references. An Appendix reprints the Foreword to the novel Lawrence wrote in Italy in 1913 (not actually printed until 1932). There are also maps of the district in which the novel is set and a complete account of variant readings in the manuscripts. In other words, the Barons have done a highly professional job and the new text they have established here will be the one that all readers and students of D H Lawrence will need to use from now on. Before eyebrows go up at the price of this book, let me end by saying that there is also a 'trade' edition containing the newly-edited text of Sons and Lovers at Pounds 14.95. This is some 200 pages shorter than the one at Pounds 70 and lacks the editors' introduction and all the critical apparatus.</p>

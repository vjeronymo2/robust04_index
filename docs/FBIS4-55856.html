			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK]  held a news conference today presided over by Deputy Chairman  Dr. Fehmi Agani. A report by Skender Durmishi:    [Durmishi] Commenting on the possible ways for a solution to  the Kosova issue, the LDK deputy chairman told the reporters  that only a solution on the basis of the recognition of the  right to self-determination of the Albanian people of Kosova in  a form of political relations and institutional implementation  can be considered as acceptable solutions. All other forms of  solution, apparently easier, which are sometimes suggested in  the framework of Yugoslavia and Serbia, will only create new  forms for permanent crises and conflicts.    LDK Deputy Chairman Fehmi Agani briefed the reporters on the  importance of the meeting of Presidents Berisha and Rugova,  which testified to the identity of viewpoints and Albania's full  support to the solution of the Kosova issue through dialogue and  in the spirit of the fair demands of the people. Both chairmen  also encouraged the initiatives and efforts by Albanian  political parties in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] to achieve a common way of action.    Further on, Dr. Fehmi Agani highly appreciated Denmark's  understanding and readiness to assist in resolving the Kosova  problem. He greeted the initiative of 11 U.S. congressmen who,  in a letter sent to President Clinton, asked that the Kosova  issue be treated in the first summit on problems in former  Yugoslavia. In the letter, they asked solutions not only  through eliminating the discrimination and repression made  evident by all international organizations, but on the basis of  the right of the Albanian people of Kosova to self-determination.    In continuation of his comments on the present Kosovar  reality, Dr. Fehmi Agani pointed out that despite the Serbian  power attempts to create a false impression for the domestic and  international public on the reduction of tension and repression,  the Serbian repression and violence has continued in Kosova,  even with increased intensity.    Providing data and concrete names, Agani informed reporters  about numerous cases of raids, mistreatments, pursuits of  political prisoners, employees of our self-management  institutions, culture workers, etc.    Protesting all these cases, Dr. Fehmi Agani found out that  through such an increase of repression and despite its verbal  readiness to resolve the problem of Kosova through an agreement,  which has been confirmed several times, the Serbian power is  consciously ruining the preliminary conditions and main premises  for an eventual dialogue.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities give ground in poor trading THE UK stock market gave back about one third of its recent rally as its revival of confidence was challenged by a heavy fall in Tokyo equities and unsettling corporate results from Germany, the US and Britain. Adding to the gloom was the monthly report from the Bundesbank, whose defence of its high interest rate policy appeared to set the stage for Thursday's policy meeting. Then the Bank of England, in its Quarterly Bulletin, predicted only weak growth ahead in the domestic economy. There was little reaction, however, to the UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures for last month. It was a gloomy trading session in London, with stock index futures providing the lead to a thinly traded equity market. The FT-SE Index closed 21.4 down at 2,354.7, although it had rallied when the 2,350 area was challenged. Weakness in the US dollar took its toll of the overseas earning companies, with BAT Industries, Reed International and Rank Organisation all relinquishing ground. Increasing tensions in the Middle East failed to bring support for oil shares. Most of the bad news hit the stock market early. The 620-point setback in the Nikkei average made for a poor opening in London, which very soon had to come to terms with a sharp fall in German markets after Mannesmann, Germany's leading engineering group, disclosed that profits dropped by 89 per cent in the first half of this year. The hardest blow on the domestic front came from Sedgwick, the insurance broker, which announced sharply lower interim profits and cut its dividend, an action which sent tremors across the market. Selling of the September stock index contract, said to be by the London arm of a Japanese house, turned the underlying blue chips downwards. Trading volume was extremely thin but the market remained fixed on its bearish tack. A rally at midsession was blotted out when New York came in lower and Wang, the US computer manufacturer, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy laws. Once again, the September FT-SE contract led equities lower. Share prices extended their losses quite sharply towards the end of the session and the Footsie dipped to 2,351.9 before rallying in the final minutes of the session. Traders took a philosophical view of yesterday's fall, which was not entirely unexpected after the sharp rally in the Footsie over the previous two sessions. They also stressed that trading volume had never measured up to recovery proportions. Seaq volume reached only 361.3m shares yesterday, while Monday's total of 315.3m reflected only Pounds 643.1m in retail, or customer, business. Store and retail issues gave back some of recent gains, discouraged by the Bank of England's references to weak consumer spending. Building and construction shares, which had rallied after last week's reports of improved inflation prospects in Europe had prompted hopes that interest rates might soon be trimmed, turned down again yesterday.</p>

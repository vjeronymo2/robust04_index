			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Trade News: Bush senses new ideas in trade's atmospherics - Jurek Martin and Nancy Dunne on contrasting views of yesterday's Gatt talks in Washington ALL may have been sweetness and light on the White House lawn after the EC lunch yesterday. But before the president could host an evening barbecue for the Washington Redskins football team, US and European officials were putting conspicuously different spin on what had actually been agreed. On the US side, the Bush presidential campaign, which drives the agenda these days in Washington, had decreed this to be Trade Week, of which the meeting with the EC delegation along with the ever flickering hopes of rescuing the Uruguay Round were to be the centrepiece. In the event of total failure, US officials had carefully depressed expectations, blaming the impasse in Gatt, the president's highest trade priority, on the EC's inability to fit its internal farm reforms into the world-wide agriculture trade rules proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt director general. President Bush was thus able to squeeze some drama and good news out of the 2 1/2 hour meeting with the announcement that 'new ideas', presented by both sides, had convinced him that the EC was determined on an early settlement. In sum, this could be dressed up as a solid day's presidential work, looking after the affairs of the nation. The substance, however, was still seen by some in the administration to be a little wanting. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, pronounced herself 'more optimistic' than before - but only because 'the atmospherics were good'. But she admitted that after three years of wrangling over farm products there was not much new to be said. 'If you have variables, you can mix around, so it's an alternate way to proceed, I suppose that can be seen as a new idea,' she said. 'Several alternatives were suggested. I have thought of these ideas in the past and I will continue to think about them, and other combinations.' She stuck to the Dunkel text, which the EC is hoping to see modified, and said that if the EC cannot accept it, it must find some formula for achieving something equivalent. Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, on the other hand, really did seem to ooze confidence that something significant had been achieved, or at least attempted. Even his own Washington-based delegation, which had known little of his plans before his arrival, confessed to being surprised. At breakfast, Mr Delors had characterised what he would say to Mr Bush as 'modest'. If Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a far more important personage, had been able to achieve no breakthrough at Camp David in March, he could hardly be anything other than modest, he said. By mid-afternoon, mere modesty had been translated into 'new ideas' and then into a 'commitment' (not the words of the EC president, but of Mr Bush himself). Thus emboldened, Mr Delors was able to foresee the time when, the agricultural impasse with the US out of the way, everything in the Uruguay Round could then fall into place and be signed, sealed and delivered. To one close observer of Mr Delors, he has undergone something of a Damascene conversion in recent months. He now not only really does believe that a failure in the Uruguay Round would grievously harm the global economy but also that the Common Agricultural Policy, which blocks the agreement, needs total transformation. Thus, on this interpretation, he really did have something new to say to Mr Bush and apparently succeeded in impressing the president. However, actual negotiations, now that the political will has been established, will return to the murky worlds of 'blue boxes', 'green lights', 'peace clauses' and other obfuscations of the reality of the need to cut farm subsidies. Presidents, of Europe or the US, rarely get that deep into the negotiating woodwork.</p>

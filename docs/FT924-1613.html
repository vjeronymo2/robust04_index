			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Lords back MMC over bus combine GOVERNMENT attempts to reduce takeover activity and increase competition in the bus industry received unexpected support yesterday when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission won its final appeal in the Sheffield bus mergers case. Five law lords ruled unanimously that the commission had the power to investigate local bus company mergers under the terms of the 1973 Fair Trading Act. They restored a 1990 MMC recommendation that South Yorkshire Transport (SYT) should sell four rival bus companies it acquired in 1989. The decision will be a severe blow to private-sector bus companies hoping to build up their strength through acquisitions. Mr Richard Boardman, the Leeds lawyer who handled the case for SYT, said the decision 'opened the floodgates for thousands of other investigations' into small local mergers. The commission's report, which was accepted by Mr Peter Lilley, then trade and industry secretary, recommended that SYT should sell Sheffield and District Transport, Sheafline (PSV), Michael Groves and SUT on the ground that each merger might be expected to operate against the public interest. As a result of the acquisitions, SYT's share of bus miles in Sheffield increased to the point at which the commission said competition to SYT in Sheffield had, in effect, ceased. It said each acquisition could result in higher fares as well as lower standards, declining quality and frequency of service and less choice. The commission's decision was challenged by SYT on the ground that the commission had no jurisdiction to investigate the acquisitions because they did not affect a 'substantial part of the UK' within the context of the market-share test set out in the 1973 act. In March last year, the High Court overturned the commission's recommendation that the mergers should be reversed. It said the area of operation examined by the commission was not a 'substantial part of the UK' according to the meaning of the 1973 act. That decision was upheld by the Appeal Court in November last year. But the law lords said that where the task was to interpret an enabling provision, intended to confer on the commission the power to investigate mergers believed to be against the public interest, the court should lean against an interpretation that would severely limit the commission's jurisdiction. In deciding whether a merger affected 'a substantial part of the UK' and therefore qualified for investigation, the commission had to be satisfied that the 'part' was 'of such size, character and importance as to make it worth consideration for the purposes of the act'. The law lords ruled that it could not be said that the commission had misapplied that test in the present case. It therefore had power to investigate the acquisitions. The commission said yesterday: 'We are very gratified by the result.'</p>

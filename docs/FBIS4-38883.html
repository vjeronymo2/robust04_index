			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 105 (595) by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The election campaign officially began in Belarus on  Thursday, June 2, to last until June 22, one day before  elections to choose the republic's first president.    There are six contestants in the election race: the Agrarian  Party's leader Aleksandr Dubko, the Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Kebich, the former chief of an ad hoc anti-corruption  parliamentary commission Aleksandr Lukashenko, the Communist  Party's Secretary Vasiliy Novikov, the Popular Front's leader  Zenon Poznyak, and the ex-parliament's speaker Stanislav  Shushkevich.    They received their certificates of candidates at a formal  ceremony on Wednesday. In keeping with Belarusian legislation,  all of them have equal material, technical, and financial  opportunities in the election campaign, during which they can be  relieved of their office duties with their pay to be retained,  and so can be their canvassers. Each candidate is entitled to  up to 20 canvassers.    A nominee has the right to a free fare for all means of  transportation but taxi. He cannot be persecuted, arrested or  detained without the Central Election Committee's consent.    Local observers rate Kebich's election chances as best and  refer to the outcome of the last poll, in which more than 68  percent of respondents favoured a president that must support  monetary integration with Russia by all means. As is known,  Kebich is the initiator and consistent advocate of such an  alliance. In his last interview with Interfax he plainly  declared that if he won presidential elections, he would press  for putting the monetary integration agreement with Russia into  effect.    Analyzing what has helped Kebich's team to prevail at the  first stage of the election race, opposition experts point to  the active role played in his election campaign by state central  and local authorities.    Meanwhile, the Popular Front's leader Poznyak has no doubt  in  his victory, as his canvassers have declared at a  news-conference recently. They reminded journalists that  Poznyak had collected 230,000 signatures, the second best result  after Kebich. As Poznyak himself told newsmen, "although local  authorities resisted the collection of signatures for an  opposition candidate, he has enlisted more support for himself  than all other candidates in Minsk and some other industrial  centers."    However, as observers believe, his chances to win are slim.  According to the election poll, 61 percent of the electorate  believe that a president must not represent any political force,  and nearly 60 percent of respondents wished that a head of state  be a centrist.    Although the election campaign was launched on Thursday,  contestants had already exposed their views on the key issues in  the press and in public statements. For instance, Kebich  outlined his election program in an exclusive interview with  Interfax (see the Presidential Bulletin of June 1).    The Communist Party's nominee Vasiliy Novikov promises, if  elected, to do away with vouchers as means to privatize people's  homes and businesses since, in his opinion, such privatization  "has never justified itself."    He has told an Interfax correspondent that he "does not rule  out alliance with any candidate but Shushkevich and Poznyak, if  he goes through into the second round of elections."    He argues that "Belarus had the highest sovereignty only  within the Soviet Union." He also reported that "the Belarusian  Communist Party currently unites more than 25,000 people and has  branches in virtually all parts of the country."    "For ethical reasons," he did not name a candidate to the  post of prime minister in the event of his election victory, but  noted that the composition of the current cabinet and parliament  be preserved as much as possible. IF Note: As Shushkevich  earlier told Interfax, should he win presidential elections, his  cabinet be taken over by the National Bank's Chairman Stanislav  Bogdankevich. As is known, Bogdankevich has been repeatedly  censured by lawmakers and government officials for his  opposition to monetary unity with Russia and for some of his  decisions, including the May 18 National Bank's decision to  recognize "hares" (national banknotes) as the only legal tender  in Belarus pending monetary integration with Russia.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Corporate results lose impact as bourses follow Wall Street The intermittent and very recent ability of bourses to major on corporate performance was shelved again yesterday as the dollar weakened and Wall Street lost ground, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS ended little changed in domestic bond markets, but Wall Street's performance disheartened equity traders in the afternoon and the CAC 40 index ended 34.17, or 1.65 per cent lower at 2,034.91 in turnover of about FFr2.9bn. There was some consolation in company results. Elf Aquitaine produced lower profits but said that good results from chemicals had offset weak oil prices. The shares fell FF5.40 to FFr410.60 while its Sanofi, pharmaceuticals to perfumes subsidiary lost only FFr2 at FFr957 when it said that analysts' forecasts for 1994 were achievable. Meanwhile, Bouygues fell sharply after the construction group told analysts that it was still suffering losses from its property interests. The shares closed FFr26 down at FFr650. Banks fell after broad gains on Wednesday. CFF lost FFr38, or 3.8 per cent at FFr957 and BNP FFr8, or 3.2 per cent at FFr242.5. Alcatel Alsthom extended Wednesday's fall on renewed allegations of corporate misdeeds, ending FFr19 lower at FFr580. But Alcatel Cable rose FFr29, or 4.6 per cent to FFr656 on a study by the British Cable Television Association on pending investments in Europe. FRANKFURT ended the session with the Dax index 12.05 lower at 2,200.80, in no way surprised by the Buba decision. The real damage was done in the afternoon as US equities and bonds, and German bund futures slid on the latest US inflation data, the Ibis-indicated Dax sliding to 2,185.78. Turnover fell from DM8.3bn to DM6.4bn. Daimler-Benz, which rose DM3.50 to DM841 in further appreciation of Wednesday's first half results, succumbed after hours with a fall to DM831.40. Simlarly, Metallgesellschaft ended the afternoon down DM12, or 5.6 per cent at DM203 after a session fall of DM6 to DM205. On Wednesday, the company extricated itself from expensive links with Castle Energy of the US, but warned at the same time that existing provisions of around DM1bn would not be enough to cover its exposure. ZURICH was unable to maintain early strength and prices turned lower, as investors were disappointed by the half year statement from Sandoz and depressed further late in the day by Wall Street's early performance. The SMI index fell 17.2 to 2,628.4. Sandoz registered shares were SFr18 lower at SFr673 after the company's announcement that first half net profit rose by 2 per cent, compared with expectations of a 5-10 per cent advance. Roche, still benefiting from switching out of other pharmaceutical issues saw its certificates surrender SFr20 to SFr6,080. The group is to release first half results, including a net profit figure, tomorrow. Against the trend, Schindler climbed SFr150 to SFr7,600 and SMH picked up SFr3 to SFr169. Both moves were attributed to speculative buying. AMSTERDAM finished at the day's low after losses in bonds, and weakness in the London and Frankfurt markets depressed financial issues. The AEX index fell 3.33 to 416.11. Against the trend, VNU gained Fl 9.60 or 5.2 per cent to Fl 196.00 in response to its first half earnings which came along with a forecast of higher growth for the second half after the market closed on Wednesday. Boskalis Westminster, the dredging company, dropped 10 cents to Fl 41.90 ahead of its results, which were in line with expectations and which came after the market closed. BolsWessanen, the food and beverage group, remained under pressure losing another 40 cents down to Fl36.50 after its lower-than-expected half year figures. MILAN finished lower after a listless session which saw the Comit index lose 4.52 to 686.01, as the market awaited further developments on the budget and pensions. Investors were also digesting the the latest scrap between the coalition partners after Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, said that the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, wanted a snap election. Olivetti, which fell 5 per cent on Wednesday dipped another L8 to L2,115. However, it picked up from a day's low of L2,090 after the company ruled out a capital increase to finance a mobile telephones venture and said that first half turnover had risen by 7 per cent. MADRID fielded a batch of corporate results, encouraging and otherwise, but it was unable to ignore Wall Street and high domestic bond yields. The general index fell 4.90, or 1.6 per cent to 307.12 in turnover of just under Pta20bn. Banks did not like the bond yield focus, Argentaria losing Pta160, or 2.9 per cent at Pta5,330 and Bankinter Pta250 at Pta11,920. Among results, a big rise in profits from Iberdrola left the utility only Pta6 lower at Pta874 although Endesa dropped Pta170 at Pta5,680; but a small decline in half year profits left Dragados, the construction company, Pta90, or 4.1 per cent lower at Pta2,115. STOCKHOLM liked the Astra results which took the shares up SKr7 to SKr183. Mr Paul Krikler at Goldman Sachs said that the bank had added the stock to its priority list. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 6.70 to 1,459.20. WARSAW lost 4.9 per cent after Wednesday's 4.4 per cent drop, the Wig index closing 546.4 lower at 10,635.0 as brokers continued to hope for a technical rally.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 27 (ATA) -- The Greek paper STOKHOS  of April 13 carries at the head of the page a photo of a group  of armed militarymen which the newspaper refers to as "a unit of  our liberation army." The motto of this paper which you can  notice in each of its issues is the expression: "The only way  to establish peace in the Balkans is the Hellenization of the  entire Balkans." On March 2, 1994 the same paper warned for  "the creation of the units which would fight for the `defence'  of the North Epirus and the Hellenization in general."    In the reprinted photo, the eyes of the terrorists have been  covered in order that they be not identified. Hence, this  newspaper which makes a pure warmongering propaganda has full  knowledge of the activity of the terroristic groups and protects  them. What about the Greek Government, does it know anything  about these facts? According to STOKHOS, there are at least 8  units of the "liberation army." What is the Greek Government's  attitude towards them and towards such papers as STOKHOS, which  stir up war in the Balkans and declare openly their chauvinistic  aims?    It not only does not take any measure against them but on  the  contrary, in relation with the latest crime in Albania, Greek  authorities declare that the Albanian party did not present  facts at a time when the terrorists have posed for Greek papers.    Greece is a member of the EC and it knows well the  international laws especially that which does not allow the  changing of the borders through violence. Above the photo of  the terrorists, the STOKHOS had written: "Fear in Tirana From  the Strong Attack." The Greek andarts [as received] have once  learned well how much the Albanians have feared them but it is  clear that those who write in this paper are men who have never  known any bravery. To come and go at night, to kill people at  their back, this is their bravery. Anyhow it is good for the  Greek Government to act before criminals and terroristic groups  that come from its territory undertake other adventures, thus  not creating themselves the possibility of experiencing how  greatly the Albanians "fear" them.</p>

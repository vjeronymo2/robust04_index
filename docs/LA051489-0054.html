			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISASTER IN CARIBBEAN EDEN  </P> <P> The environmental disaster "Waiting to Happen in Haiti" (by Jean-Michel  Cousteau, May 7) is not waiting -- it has happened.  </P> <P> Once the "garden of Eden" of the Caribbean with lush forests and rich farms,  Haiti has been ravaged by a population explosion, exploitation, civil tyranny  and now deforestation and environmental degradation. Ninety-five percent of the  forests are gone. That trend all over the world is sending millions of people  across borders to escape from poverty, starvation and oppression. The United  Nations' World Commission on Environment and Development has warned that  population growth is outstripping food, agricultural and forest resources,  water and health and energy supplies.  </P> <P> Our giant population centers -- Los Angeles included -- are becoming wastelands  of pollution, traffic, people, crime and poverty. The Bush Administration and  Congress act as though none of this is happening here or anywhere else. Haiti,  one of our neighbors, is sending us a message for herself and others: "Help!"  </P> <P> LU HAAS  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

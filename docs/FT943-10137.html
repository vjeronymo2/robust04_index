			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Run your own scheme After leaving a public sector scheme, LESLIE McCLEMENTS took a lump sum transfer into a unit-linked personal pension. When the annual charges rose, he decided he could do better by himself and transferred the personal pension into a small self-administered scheme. He now reports on the progress of his pension portfolio. UK base rates were unchanged in the second quarter of 1994. However, medium and longer-term interest rates continued the increase which began in early February. Equities fell sharply in late May, declined further during June but largely recovered last month. By the end of July, the FT-SE-A All-Share index was 8.1 per cent down on its value at January 1. There is a growing consensus that base rates will rise later in the year. Increases in the narrow money supply, higher earnings, stronger economic growth and worries about inflation are expected to result in some monetary tightening. I believe that much of this has been anticipated in market interest rates for bonds. In consequence, I do not believe that the changed economic outlook requires a major portfolio adjustment at this stage. However, the fall in equities at the end of May created an opportunity to benefit from any subsequent recovery. I considered buying FT-SE 100 call options. These can be very volatile and the spread between selling and buying prices is wide. To be effective, I would need to follow the market closely at times of rapid change and this is not possible. Alternatively, several investment trusts have equity index loan stock which track the All-Share. In addition, Malvern UK Index Trust aims to mirror the index by investing in a representative sample of companies. At the beginning of April, my pension fund was fully invested. With 15 holdings it was becoming cumbersome and one of these, Exmoor Dual Income, was too small despite the 14.5 per cent yield. This investment trust has three classes of share (income, ordinary and zero dividend preference): they tend to be more volatile than comparable instruments where there are fewer categories of stock. As a first step in reducing the weighting of high income shares, I sold Exmoor Dual Income for 90.5p in late May, taking a 6 per cent loss on the middle market price at the beginning of 1994. To raise further cash, the two zero dividend preference shares (Exmoor Dual and Sphere) were sold for a small overall loss on the January valuation. All three sales yielded substantial capital gains - 25, 45 and 15 per cent respectively - on their purchase prices in early 1993. I invested most of the proceeds in Malvern UK Index Trust at Pounds 1.31. Following Northern Foods' results in early June, I sold this holding and reinvested in ACT, the software company, hoping for better medium-term growth. By the end of July, the portfolio had declined by 1.9 per cent of its value at the beginning of the year. This compares with a 5.9 per cent fall in the All Share index adjusted for gross dividend income. Bristol &amp; West Pibs (permanent interest bearing shares), ACT, Mucklow and Abtrust Preferred Income have shown the largest price falls since the New Year or since I bought them (see accompanying chart). In retrospect, the portfolio would have performed better if it had been more liquid early in the year when the market peaked. However, it is now in a strong position to benefit from any further recovery in the second half of 1994. An increase in base rates to 6 or even 6.5 per cent should have little impact on the interest-sensitive stocks - their prices could recover if short-term interest rates remain unchanged. In the meantime, the retention of these shares is justified by their excellent yields. The next few months should see the relisting of Queens Moat Houses and audited accounts for Artesian Commercial, the unquoted property company. Both events are expected to result in higher valuations. This, combined with the prospect of a continued market recovery, augers well for the end of the year.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Israeli warplanes conducted mock raids over the  Iqlim al-Tuffah Heights at 1345 today. The mock raids followed  earlier Israeli aggression on 'Arab Salim and Humin. The  aggression coincides with an Israeli warning broadcast by  Israeli radio today. The radio quoted a military spokesman as  saying: Troops may carry out a large-scale attack against  Resistance positions in the south and they are ready to carry  out their mission the moment they receive their orders.</p>

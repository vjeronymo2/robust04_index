			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko article under the "Commonwealth" rubric: </F> "Moscow Meeting Gives New Boost to Integration. The Economy and  Security Were the Main Topics of Discussion for the Leaders of  12 Countries"]    [Text] The presidents and prime ministers who gathered  last Friday in the capital of Russia, which chairs the  Commonwealth's councils, examined more than 35 issues. But  there were two main topics. First, ways to deepen the  participating countries' economic integration. Second, the  states' security and the guarding of the Commonwealth's external  borders.    According to Boris Yeltsin, it is a question, above all, of  a  package of decisions aimed at putting the Treaty of Economic  Union into practice. "Economic Union is the fundamental  principle of the Commonwealth," he emphasized. "The level of  integration of the CIS countries as a whole will depend, in the  final analysis, on progress in this area."    Implementing this idea, the participants in the Moscow  summit  approved two decisions of fundamental significance. They set up  the Economic Union Commission and gave the "green light" to the  creation of a free trade zone. Commenting on these agreements,  Vladimir Mashchits, Russian Federation minister for cooperation  with CIS countries, reported that it had originally been planned  to create a permanently functioning executive and coordinating  organ of the Economic Union -- the Interstate Economic Committee  -- and in this connection to abolish the Coordinating  Consultative Committee. The heads of government and experts,  however, agreed that it is necessary at present to preserve the  CIS Coordinating Consultative Committee, but to set up a  commission of professional economists under it. Its chief  function is to shape the Economic Union's activity and ensure  its efficiency. Vladimir Mashchits voiced the opinion that this  commission might, in time, be transformed into the Interstate  Economic Committee, which will essentially be a supranational  organ of the CIS.    A free trade zone is also being created to improve the  effectiveness of cooperation. The agreements that have been  signed provide, in particular, for the resolution of specific  tasks at the first stage of the gradual abolition of customs  duties, taxes, imposts, and nontariff restrictions in reciprocal  trade. Thanks to this, our experts believe, trade will develop  more intensively within the Commonwealth, and the single  economic area will become more attractive to foreign partners.    The financial sphere has not been overlooked either.  Approval was given here to the concept of the Payment Union of  CIS states, which makes it possible, in time, to arrange  uninterrupted payments on the basis of the mutual convertibility  of national currencies. It is proposed that participants in  trade deals will independently decide on the forms of  transactions, the currency of the contract price, and the  currency of payment, while the states must ensure the  convertibility of national currencies in respect of current  operations. All the member countries of the Payment Union have  pledged to adopt all the necessary acts and to pay the  appropriate sums into the charter fund of the Interstate Bank of  Multilateral Transactions before 20 May 1994. This bank will  commence practical work 1 July.    A new chapter has also been begun in the history of  military-political cooperation. The approval for the statute on  the Defense Ministers Council, which took into account the  structural changes that have occurred recently, was important  here. An information report by the chairman of the CIS  countries' Border Troops Commanders Council on the state of  cooperation in guarding the Commonwealth's external borders was  heard. A memorandum was signed on the states' participation in  guarding the external border in the Central Asian region.  Agreements were reached with Georgia and Armenia on Russia's  participation in guarding their external borders. A similar  agreement with Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus] was prepared.  The appropriate departments were instructed to draw up founding  documents on the creation of an aid fund for the Republic of  Tajikistan.    Even this short list of the problems resolved has shown  that,  to use Boris Yeltsin's words, "the Commonwealth states'  integration aspirations are starting to be turned into practical  deeds."</p>

On 27 March the party's third congress  nominated the well known dissident as candidate for president.    At the initiative of Lev Grigoryevich himself, the congress  demanded without too much talk that the results of the  "antidemocratic and rigged" elections for the Federal Assembly  be annulled and the amnestied coup plotters be put back behind  bars. Most important, the "communist" Chernomyrdin government  should resign and presidential elections should be called to  elect a new head of state.    It turned out that Boris Yeltsin is "soft as wax" and that  he  "has been continuing Gorbachev's line toward appeasing the  reactionary forces and has struck a secret deal with the  criminal Rutskoy and the fascist Zhirinovskiy." According to  Ubozhko, "Messrs. Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy go to the baths  together once a month, and after taking a steam bath they would  not mind playing a game of checkers." As a result, it turned  out that "the king does not have anything on," and what he does  is to sacrifice his allies, apparently confusing checkers with  give-away.    Any "infection," Lev Grigoryevich thinks, should be nipped  in  the bud by introducing presidential rule. He promises to mark  his coming to power by the immediate firing or even exiling of  all members of the old party nomenklatura who sabotage reform.  As for racketeers, he promised to get rid of them within a  month by arming all entrepreneurs to a man.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Lamont in talks on EC drink duty LEADERS of the UK drinks industry are to meet Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, today to discuss the government's approach to the European Commission's proposals for minimum duty rates on spirits. The issue, which has been the subject of intense argument for the past year, is expected to be on the agenda at a meeting of EC economic and finance ministers in Brussels on Tuesday. Protests from the industry in July last year persuaded Mr Lamont to withhold Britain's agreement to EC proposals for a minimum duty of Ecu 1,118 (Pounds 783) a hectolitre of pure alcohol for Scotch whisky, gin and other spirits. EC ministers agreed on a zero rate of duty for wine and a rate of Ecu 187 for beer. The proposed rate for spirits would have added about Pounds 2.50 to a bottle of whisky in southern European countries. Industry leaders believe such a move would also have hampered their efforts to reduce discriminatory taxation of products in other countries.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Pounds 800m in savings tax rebates unclaimed MORE THAN 6m people have failed to claim back Pounds 800m owed to them by the Inland Revenue, the Commons public accounts committee reported yesterday. The money relates to tax paid on savings accounts since the abolition of composite rate tax in April 1991. Most of the potential claimants are pensioners, children and married women not at work whose income is less than the annual allowance of Pounds 3,445 and so do not have to pay tax on interest earnings. They are eligible to receive interest income gross of tax. Thousands of other claimants with earnings below Pounds 6,000, who pay income tax only at the lower 20 per cent band, are also failing to claim back tax that has been charged on their accounts at a rate of 25 per cent. In its report published yesterday the committee says it notes the Revenue's efforts to encourage people to claim, and adds that it considers the Revenue 'should now establish the reason for the substantial shortfall in claims'. The claimants are owed an average of about Pounds 130 each, the committee's report says. In spite of official encouragement for people to claim, including extensive television and newspaper advertising, fewer than 1 1/2 m eligible people have applied for refunds. The report says the Revenue believed 'misunderstanding and a reluctance to get involved in form filling' were responsible for lack of claims. To complicate matters, a further 1m people have registered incorrectly, again due to 'misunderstanding'. Only five of the 24 Inland Revenue offices set up to deal with the expected claims for repayment are used for this purpose. Of the remainder, four have been closed and 15 diverted to other uses. The committee says it was worried by the 'waste of expenditure'. The report was also critical of apparent reluctance by the Revenue to investigate the tax affairs of farmers, who are suspected of widespread evasion. The Revenue told the committee that farming 'had its own special mysteries, and that there was a risk these could discourage the ordinary tax inspector'. The committee says: 'We do not regard this as an acceptable reason for not pursuing tax in what appears clearly to be a high-risk area.' The Revenue is also criticised in the report for duplicating repayments of corporation tax and petroleum revenue tax totalling Pounds 50.4m. The duplications were a result of 'serious systems' failures'. Inland Revenue: Account Matters. HMSO. Pounds 8.95</p>

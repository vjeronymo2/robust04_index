BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MUSTANG RANCH IN IRS HANDS  </P> <P> A judge today removed the federal government from the brothel business by  lifting a stay order that would have obliged a bankruptcy trustee to operate  the infamous Mustang Ranch brothel.  </P> <P> U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Thompson lifted the stay in a brief hearing,  opening the way for the Internal Revenue Service to foreclose on the brothel.  </P> <P> Bankruptcy trustee Jeri Coppa told Thompson that without the court's permission  to operate this weekend, she would be unable to assume responsibility for the  property. She asked that the IRS be allowed to foreclose.  </P></p>

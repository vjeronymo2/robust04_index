			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / GMB fails in water effort THE GMB, the main union in the water industry, yesterday failed to get Mr David Murphy, one of its officials, nominated to the board of North West Water at the company's annual meeting. The union is next week attempting to get an official nominated in two other companies - Anglian and Thames - with the help of a large number of employee shareholders. The GMB hopes that a 'worker director' will aid its campaign for better water quality and public accountability in the industry.</p>

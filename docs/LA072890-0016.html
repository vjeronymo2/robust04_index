			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE, BUT MANY SAY HE STILL HAS A PLACE IN THE HALL  </P> <P> Pete Rose doesn't belong in the Hall of Fame. He is a liar, cheat, and most of  all, a first-class jerk.  </P> <P> On the list of criteria to being elected to the Hall is integrity "on and off"  the field. I was at a card show a few years ago when Rose started to get loud  and use foul language in front of the kids until someone told him to keep it  down.  </P> <P> He might have had a few more hits than anyone, but he played twice as long as  the normal player. He lied to his fans and he lied under oath to the courts. He  shouldn't be allowed to step in another ballpark, as a player, coach or fan.  </P> <P> GARY SCHLEPER  </P> <P> Lomita  </P></p>

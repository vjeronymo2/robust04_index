			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter recommended deleting the reference to nonresidents in &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .230 under eligibility. The commenter maintained that due to the limited amount of funds available for this CHSP, funds should be utilized by tenants occupying eligible housing and that if a community shows a need to serve nonresidents, other sources of funding could be pursued to meet that need. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Nonresident elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and temporarily disabled are eligible to participate in CHSP at the option of the program management in consultation with project residents. The program management has the discretion to deny nonresidents participation in the program if their participation is not cost-effective or if it adds to the need for assistance under the program. Nonresidents who receive services under CHSP must pay a fee equal to the cost of the services provided. Nonresidents are not eligible for CHSP funds to subsidize their costs for services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Match  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The commenter states that the 50% match requirement for the grantee or eligible owner is excessively burdensome and may result in an inordinate amount of program failures. These program failures would have the ultimate result of doing harm to the program participants who relocate to the congregate housing locations in reliance on the programs. The commenter also states that the rules as written necessitate the inclusion of a great deal of estimated information in the budget. The commenter states that while service costs may be known, the likelihood of program failure increases because the number of participants, types of services to be requested and the ability of the participant to pay cannot be known until program startup.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 802(i)(1)(A)(i) of the National Affordable Housing Act requires that the cost for services under the CHSP be shared between the Secretary concerned and the grantee. The grantee shall provide 50% of the cost of providing the CHSP; the Secretary concerned shall provide 40% of the cost of providing CHSP; and fees from the program participant shall provide 10% of the cost. While HUD and FmHA agree that both participant interest and need are estimated at best, the budget information is necessary to establish a dollar value and limit for the application and to assist in the rating and ranking of applications for CHSP funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the 50% match requirement and the restrictions on what can be counted as in-kind service are barriers that the rule presents which causes its housing authority to be unable to participate in the program. The commenter suggests that in instances like its own where projects have limited resources that it be allowed to count the services already provided as in-kind match. The commenter also contends that local community services are already ``maxed'' out because housing authorities have been successful in having a number of services provided by community agencies and that the housing authorities prior to the grant period have already invested as much or more than the match requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 802(i)(1)(A)(i) of the National Affordable Housing Act requires that the cost for services under the CHSP be shared between the Secretary concerned and the grantee. The grantee or other third party is required to provide 50% of the cost of providing the CHSP; the Secretary concerned provides no more than 40% of the cost of providing CHSP; and fee from the program participant provides at least 10% of the cost. Match funds must account for 50% of the cost of services under the CHSP program. Only qualified supportive services are eligible services under the CHSP. Since section 802(k)(16) defines qualified supportive services as new or expanded services, match funds can only be used for new or expanded services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Non-Allowable Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commenter: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter states that the examples of non-allowable costs under the program include capital funding items. The commenter states that the failure to allow projects access to funds to cover capital cost will place projects at a disadvantage in developing a CHSP and may also discourage many nonprofit owners from applying and participating in the program. The commenter also states that during congressional consideration of NAHA, it supported Senate passage of a new and separately funded retrofit program to provide for modernization and retrofitting of elderly housing projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD and FmHA decided to disallow capital funding items because they were concerned the majority of the funds for supportive services would be used to fund capital improvements. Upon implementation of the retrofit component of the CHSP, modernization and retrofitting will be eligible activities. Due to the limited amount of funding available FmHA and HUD decided that the purposes of the program are best served by only funding the supportive services component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Program Participant Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter states that the regulations should include a provision that does not cap HUD's contribution for resident fee deficits. The commenter also suggests that the regulations should allow the CHSP to use other income sources to make up for any resident-fee deficit that arises because of the 20% cap on resident fees, or that arises because the local program match program permits only contributions. The commenter states that contributions should be permitted to count as part of the fee amount and that the regulations should be amended to allow a flexible sliding scale fee schedule for participants for whom 20% or even 10% of adjusted income is too costly or where 10% of the cost of a specific fee is too high. Commenter also states that there should be more flexible fee waivers to include participants who are at or below the poverty level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  .240 of the regulation has been revised to allow food stamps and other contributions or donations to be included as part of the 10% fee amount for program participants. In instances where the grantee finds that the fees for a participant are too high, the grantee can request a waiver of &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .240(e) of the regulation. Any waived fees are shared 50% between the Secretary concerned and the grantee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Retrofit and Renovations Component <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There were several comments and suggestions concerning the retrofitting and renovation component of the Congregate Housing Services Program. Several commenters expressed discontent with the decisions not to fund the retrofit and renovation component and the failure to implement regulations. Many stated that the retrofit component was an integral and critical part of the program. One commenter stated that HUD and FmHA had the authority and the flexibility to allocate some funding for retrofit in order to have the program in place for full funding later. There was a general concern for the Department's failure to develop interim regulations in order to implement retrofit once funding is made available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD and FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Since HUD and FmHA had very little guidance from Congress on the implementation of the program, they invited comments from the public on how the renovation and retrofit component should be implemented. They also invited comments on specific issues concerning this component. HUD and FmHA will use the responses received to assist in the drafting of regulations implementing the retrofit and renovation component at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

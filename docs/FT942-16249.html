			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / Ark Royal 'under fire' A left-wing Greek terrorist organisation yesterday claimed it had fired a rocket at the British aircraft carrier Ark Royal while it was docked in Piraeus harbour for maintenance work. In a call to a radio station, the group also claimed responsibility for attacks on Sunday night on two foreign insurance companies in Athens. A search of the vessel revealed no evidence to back the terrorist group's claim. However, Greek police later found two 3.5in rockets and two plastic pipes, apparently intended as launchers, in a timber warehouse near where the ship was docked.</p>

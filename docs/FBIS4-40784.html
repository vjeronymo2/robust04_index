			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladikavkaz, June 15 RIA -- A special 17-man strong  investigatory group of the public prosecutor's office and the  Ministry of the Interior of Northern Ossetia continue their  search of six Ingush hostages taken on May 19 in a suburb of  Vladikavkaz, the RIA correspondent was told by Colonel Taimuraz  Gamosov, head of the Leninskiy District Department of Interior  Affairs of the republic. Gamosov said that the round-up carried  out by the police in practically the entire republic had not  yielded any results. According to Gamosov, two chief witnesses  of the seizure of hostages, who could clear up a lot of things  (possibly even disclose their whereabouts) are currently hiding  for unknown reasons. Both are guards of economic facilities in  Northern Ossetia.    According to T. Gamosov's version, "the witnesses do not  want  to be involved in the complex intrigues that are woven today in  the state-of-emergency zone around the Ingush hostages, while  the destiny of the Ossetian hostages taken back on March 30 does  not interest anybody.</p>

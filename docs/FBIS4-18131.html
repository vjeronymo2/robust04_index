			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer Patrick Poivre-d'Arvor] We now go  live to correspondent Denis Brunetti, who has the latest from  Toulon on the accident that struck the Rubis-class submarine:    [Brunetti] [passage omitted] I have beside me Defense  Minister Francois Leotard, who came down to Toulon as soon as he  heard of the accident.    [Poivre-d'Arvor] This accident is the most deadly in recent  years in France, but there were two other incidents recently.  Last August, a Rubis-class submarine collided with a tanker,  and the Amethyste touched bottom at the beginning of this month.  Is this why you have decided to recall the three other  nuclear-powered attack submarines currently out at sea?    [Leotard] No, this is quite a normal measure designed simply  to check that all possible precautions are being taken, as  indeed they are every day. The two previous accidents that you  mentioned are accidents that were caused by errors in command.  The people responsible for these errors were immediately  punished. Today we are facing a tragedy that puts the Navy and  the nation as a whole in mourning. [passage omitted]    I would like to remind everyone that France's naval  presence--and in the Mediterranean, in particular--is a national  imperative. [passage omitted]    [Brunetti] Can you confirm to us that there is no risk of a  nuclear leak?    [Leotard] There is absolutely no risk on the nuclear front  in  this accident. There was a tear in a steam pipe, which has  nothing to do with the submarine's propulsion mechanism and  which has nothing to do, I would remind you, with nuclear  weapons--with which this kind of submarine is not equipped.  There is no risk. Let us not forget, however, that this has  been a terrible accident in which two officers and eight crew  members have been killed and which has plunged the Navy into  mourning.    We will start work on two inquiries--a judicial inquiry,  which has already begun--and an inquiry into the command of the  vessel. The naval chief of staff has announced this inquiry, and  its conclusions will, of course, be public. The French people  have to know who is to blame and know the technical reasons for  this tragedy.</p>

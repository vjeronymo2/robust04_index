			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Observer: Shaggy tail Eugene Rotberg, former treasurer of the World Bank, has a tall tale concerning a banker, a corporate treasurer and a dog. The banker and treasurer perambulate past a pet shop window and spy a dog for sale. The banker buys it for Dollars 5, then sells it to the treasurer for Dollars 10. A few days later, the banker wants it back, so he bids Dollars 20. The dog keeps changing hands until the banker buys it for Dollars 1m. Then the dog escapes from the bank and is killed by a car. The treasurer is furious: 'Couldn't you have been more careful?' he complains to the banker. 'Don't you realise how much money we were making on that dog?'</p>

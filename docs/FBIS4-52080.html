			<p>BFN     [Text] Talking to reporters at the National Assembly this  afternoon, Thanong Siriprichaphong, an MP from Nakhon Phanom  Province, insisted that he is innocent of all drug charges. He  is gathering evidence to clarify the issue with all parties  concerned:    [Begin recording] [Thanong] I consulted with the people in  Nakhon Phanom and the Chat Thai Party about resigning as an MP  as soon as I heard the news reports. They told me there was no  need to resign. I deny the charges; I insist that I am innocent  of all charges. As soon as I learned of the news, I contacted  my lawyer to fight the charges. I learned about the charges  from newspaper, radio, and television reports. The house and  the assets are not in my name. I am checking on what I am being  charged with -- maybe it has to do with failing to pay the house  mortgage. I am gathering evidence. I still do not know what I  am being charged with.    [Question indistinct]    [Thanong] I will clear the parliamentary issue. I will not  allow the image of the House of Representatives, the Chat Thai  Party, or the people of Nakhon Phanom to be damaged. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Beijing has recently  issued a set of regulations on the prevention and control of  occupational diseases.    Statistics show that in 1993, over 525,000 workers came into  contact with poisonous material leaks in more than 13,400  factories and enterprises in the city.    According to a 1993 survey, nearly 2000 people have  contracted with diseases caused by their work each year, an  annual incidence rate of 1.3 percent.    The new rules require new projects to meet hygienic  standards  set by the state. It also emphasizes the prevention measures.    The regulations define the responsibilities which relevant  departments should assume, such as diagnosis of and supervision  over occupational diseases.    Problems still exist in the city's 1,500 foreign-funded  enterprises.    Some companies have introduced production equipment but not  the corresponding safety facilities to prevent poisons in  workshops from doing serious harm to workers' health.    Some foreign businessmen, under the guise of maintaining  company security, do not disclose the chemical compositions of  prescriptions which contain harmful materials.    Several materials which have been banned or replaced by  substitutes abroad are still used in some Chinese joint ventures.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Russia arranges Karabakh ceasefire A breakthrough in the five-year-old conflict over Nagorno Karabakh, the Armenian-dominated enclave in Azerbaijan, may be in sight after a Russian-arranged ceasefire was agreed this weekend. Leaders of the two warring neighbours may meet early next month. The Azeri leadership said in the capital Baku yesterday that the defence ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia had agreed in Moscow with General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of the forces of both sides to predetermined positions. A complete withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijan would depend on further negotiations. The agreement followed fierce fighting between Armenians and Azeris in the region of Kelbadjar.

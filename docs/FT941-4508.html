			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation (24): Setting the pace - Implementation / Work flow is changing the way Britannia Building Society operates Britannia Building Society is working on a strategy for office automation which will put it at the heart of the society's operations, writes John Kavanagh. The strategy will be based on document image processing and work flow automation, which have already been used to redesign the handling of mortgage arrears and property recovery. Britannia, one of the top 10 building societies in the UK, was claimed by its supplier, Olivetti, to have been the first organisation in the UK to adopt document image processing. That was in 1986. The society, based in Leek, Staffordshire, and with 200 branches, is thought to have the biggest installation in Europe, with 180 workstations served by a Filenet system. Olivetti introduced the system in the UK and still sells it, although US supplier Filenet now has its own operation here. For the first few years, Britannia used the system purely for storing and accessing documents on screens instead of as paper files. Everything from the mortgage application form onwards, but excluding property deeds, is scanned in or entered as word processor files. All queries are dealt with through the system: original documents are no longer kept. Tax forms relating to investment accounts have been scanned in since they were introduced in 1991. The society would have needed extra staff to handle them manually but won agreement from the Inland Revenue that images would be acceptable. These paper storage and retrieval applications alone brought significant savings but the society is now also increasingly exploiting the automated work flow potential of the system. Early last year, Britannia transformed the handling of arrears, building it around work flow and on-line access to information. The changes made a 'significant impact', according to Mr Barry Foster, head of systems development. Well over Pounds 10m in arrears was collected in 1993 and a large percentage was seen as directly attributable to the new system. 'Previously we sent progressively serious letters, but we now work through telephone contact,' Mr Foster says. 'The department has been reorganised into teams, who work shifts so that they can call people at home in the evenings. 'Every night our ICL mainframe works out which accounts have gone into arrears and passes them to the Filenet system. All documents, such as correspondence, relating to each case are scanned in and the system can also retrieve accounts and other data from the mainframe, so staff have immediate access to all information when they call. Filenet keeps track of cases if they progress to litigation and recovery of the property.' Having fully automated the post-mortgage processes, Britannia is now looking at activities which lead up to a mortgage being accepted. 'We're piloting a PC-based sales system which will be the front-end to the entire process and installed at the point of first contact with the customer in the branches,' Barry Foster says. 'This means the whole process from customer contact to handling applications, completion, sending the payment and passing the data over to the administration system is being totally reviewed. The Filenet system will play a part in the redesign.' Other developments being considered include putting branches on-line to the document retrieval system and providing similar document handling and work flow facilities to insurance company Britannia Life. 'In all developments we have to be convinced of the benefits, because this is an expensive technology,' Barry Foster says. 'In addition, we've been installing more and more PCs instead of simple terminals as workstations to the Filenet system. The terminal response times have not been good - 10 seconds or more - and PC response times are quicker, because the PC can handle more of the processing. Response times have been the subject of more discussions with Olivetti and Filenet than any other issue.' The latest discussions are over the replacement of the ageing Filenet central processor - 'we want some assurances before we make the move but we're confident that there will be significant improvements,' Mr Foster says. 'Despite the response times, the system is still far faster than having to look for paper files.' System performance upgrades and strategy review are the main preoccupations of Barry Foster and his team at present. Their deliberations are likely to have a considerable impact on the future of the society. 'The society is going through very considerable change at branch level and in business redesign,' he says. 'Work flow will be an increasingly significant part of the strategy.' Filenet Filenet for document image processing and Workflo software for work flow automation, launched in 1985 and now on version 3.1, released in 1993. Supplier: Filenet, a US company formed in 1982. Olivetti launched its products in the UK in 1985 and Filenet set up a UK operation in 1991. Filenet's 1993 turnover was up by 14 per cent at Dollars 158m; the company has 900 staff world-wide, including 150 in Europe. Price: A typical system, including central processor, an optical disc jukebox and work flow software, costs around Pounds 100,000. Number of users: There are 35 customers in the UK and 730 world-wide.</p>

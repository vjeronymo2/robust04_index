			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: West backs Russian leader's action WESTERN leaders rallied behind President Boris Yeltsin yesterday, pledging their continuing support for the Russian leader after the surrender of his opponents in Moscow. The US found no fault with the suppression of the Moscow revolt. The operation in Moscow had been 'strategically planned and tactically executed so as to minimise the loss of life', said Mr Strobe Talbott, in charge of policy towards the former Soviet Union at the State Department. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, may go to Moscow later this month to demonstrate the 'business as usual' US approach. Earlier, Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said President Bill Clinton, who is in California, stood 'four square' behind President Yeltsin. 'Democratic governments have to defend themselves against force and clearly that's what Yeltsin has done.' In Luxembourg, the European Community backed Mr Yeltsin with an agreement in principle to hold an EC-Russia summit in November and to accelerate efforts to reach a new bilateral trade agreement by the end of the year. The strategy, agreed at a meeting of EC foreign ministers, rests on strengthening political support for pro-democracy forces in the run-up to Russia's parliamentary elections scheduled to take place in December, Brussels officials said. 'We are putting our money on the Yeltsin horse,' said one diplomat, 'because we have not got any other horse'. Britain, France and Germany led the push for Mr Yeltsin at the Luxembourg gathering yesterday. A joint statement deplored the loss of life in Moscow, but declared that 'elements hostile to the democratisation forces in Russia' carried 'a heavy responsibility for having deliberately provoked violence in the Russian parliament and in different parts of the capital'. In Bonn, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, said Mr Yeltsin had his 'full sympathy and support'. He identified a 'vital interest of Germany and the west in a continuation of the democratic reform process in Russia, as embodied by President Yeltsin'. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said in London: 'There should be no doubt that he (Yeltsin) has our total and unequivocal support for the action that he has taken.' He was speaking after talks with Mr Boris Pankin, the Russian ambassador. The Japanese government expressed full support for the reform aims of Mr Yeltsin, who is due to visit Tokyo next week. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, said Mr Yeltsin's reform efforts 'must not be blocked, and Japan's support for his efforts will be unchanged'. China was the only important power not to back Mr Yeltsin, painstakingly avoiding taking sides. 'We are deeply concerned about the recent bloodshed in Moscow,' the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. At the Luxembourg meeting of EC foreign ministers yesterday, Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external affairs, urged ministers to be more flexible in trade negotiations with Russia so that a deal could be wrapped up by the end of the year. The EC underlined yesterday it would want to discuss with Russia security issues and prospects for Nato enlargement, as well as bilateral trade at the proposed summit in November. Mr Yeltsin considers a trade and political co-operation pact with the EC to be a big prize, but talks stalled during the summer over several Russian demands which Brussels considers unrealistic. These include Mr Yeltsin's wish for the same treatment as emerging democracies in eastern Europe, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, rather than as a 'state trading' country such as China or North Korea, whose exports can be restricted under so-called safeguard clauses.</p>

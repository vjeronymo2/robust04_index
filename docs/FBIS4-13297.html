			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahd al-Rimawi] </F>   [Text] The Israeli war machine could not stand long in the  face of some youths from Palestine whose belief in God and  strong will made them decide to go for martyrdom.    The Zionist Army, armed to the teeth by the most  sophisticated U.S. weapons and with its most active intelligence  organs, was helpless. It could not prevent the Hamas Movement  from transferring its impressive, qualitative operations to the  heart of Israel in 'Afula, Hadera, Haifa, and God knows where  else.    In only a few days or weeks, the voice of weapons  overshadowed the hoarse talk about peace. Military and jihad  action outshone the idle talk of the negotiations and the dozens  of sessions and meetings that started more than two years ago in  Madrid and are still revolving in a vicious circle without  making any progress at all.    For all these reasons, the Israeli government, facing the  threat of collapse under the strikes of Hamas, chose to shift  its losing battle to the political level and to the Jordanian  arena.    War is a continuation of politics by using other means. The  opposite holds true. The Rabin government is trying at this  time to survive and stay in power by reactivating foreign  operations. These operations will be undertaken by the Mosad to  liquidate Hamas leaders in Arab states. The Rabin government is  also trying to export its crisis to the Jordanian arena, which  is liable to explosion if the government was forced to clash  with Hamas, which has strong support from Jordan's  political-Islamic street in general, and the Muslim Brotherhood  in particular.    Information available to Egyptian and PLO security agencies  indicates clearly that the Mosad's plans to assassinate Hamas  leaders abroad are now ready for implementation. This prompted  several Arab and Islamic states, including Jordan, to instate  heavy security measures to protect the Hamas leaders. Those  countries have also asked the Hamas leaders to observe maximum  caution.    Despite the fact that Jordan has rejected the Zionist logic  of threats and responded to the rude threats of Rabin and Peres,  Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has summoned Muhammad Nazzal,  Hamas representative in Jordan, and Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah,  the official spokesman of the Movement, to his office several  times. He asked them politely, but firmly, to take Jordan's  circumstances into consideration and halt any political or media  activity on its territory.    The U.S. ambassador in Amman had earlier asked the Jordanian  government to deport Nazzal and Ghawshah, in response to an  Israeli desire. The government, however, strongly rejected this  demand, proceeding from its concern about Jordan's national  sovereignty and the right to citizenship which Nazzal and  Ghawshah enjoy, since they bear Jordanian nationality. This is  in addition to the strong relationship between Jordan and Hamas,  since the 'Arafat organization snubbed Jordan in favor of a new  relationship with Israel.    AL-MAJD has learned from its own sources that the Interior  Ministry has seized the passports of Nazzal, Ghawshah, and other  Hamas members who have Jordanian nationality. However, no one  at the Hamas office in Amman could confirm or deny the news, in  reply to several queries by the AL-MAJD to the Hamas office,  having failed to contact Ghawshah and Nazzal, who are apparently  denying their presence to avoid answering reporters who are  following with extreme interest the developments of the  situation between the government and Hamas.</p>

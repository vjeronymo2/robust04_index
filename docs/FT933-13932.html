			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Revised rules on large trade disclosure LARGE TRADES on the London Stock Exchange will not have to be reported for up to a week after they are executed under new rules agreed yesterday by the Exchange's board, writes Norma Cohen. The rules, described as an 'interim measure', are nominally aimed at improving the liquidity in so-called second and third-tier stocks - those whose market capital ranks them in the bottom two thirds of all shares traded. The rules are also expected to boost the profits of the Exchange's marketmaking members who place their own capital at risk when they agree to buy large blocks of shares from clients without knowing whether they will be able to resell them quickly or profitably. The rules, set to take effect by the end of this year, will be in force for six to 12 months while regulators assess their effects. If there is no increase in liquidity among smaller stocks, regulators may ask the Exchange to scrap the rule. Under the rule, details of trades 75 times the 'normal market size' for transactions in any particular stock do not have to be published on the Exchange's SEAQ price reporting screen for up to five days after completion or until the marketmaker has unwound or hedged 90 per cent of the risk. All trades will have to be reported to the Exchange, however. For large stocks where underlying options are traded, this could include hedging with exchange-traded derivative instruments. Alternatively, it could involve the sale of the shares to a third party.</p>

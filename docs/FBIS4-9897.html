			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] An autopsy has revealed that the U.S. military man  who died while playing with a hand grenade had taken three types  of drugs. Dr. Juan Mateo Llort, director of the Forensic  Medicine Institute, has confirmed that a toxicological  examination on the body of U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Julio Ramon  Rivera, who died early Sunday, reveals he was under the  influence of three illegal drugs when he pulled the pin on the  grenade that killed him and wounded four other people. Based on  this conclusion, Dr. Llort will ask the U.S. Embassy in El  Salvador to perform drug tests on all Embassy officials. Dr.  Llort said Rivera died from multiple trauma caused by the  explosion of the grenade, which he handled recklessly.    [Begin Llort recording] Only a person under the influence of  drugs would have played with a live grenade, thinking it was a  toy. The three drugs found were 25 nanograms of marijuana, 276  nanograms of meta-amphetamine, and 440 nanograms of  phenobarbital -- a considerable quantity. [end recording]    The official U.S. Embassy report says Lt. Col. Rivera had  gone to the National Civilian Police in the Zacamil neighborhood  to meet his bodyguards who were being released.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] He was meeting some  of his bodyguards. That is when he received the grenade, which  exploded.    [Dr. Llort] Routine toxicological tests should be performed  on these kinds of people, who should be setting an example for  the rest of the country. [end recording]    Lt. Col. Rivera was second in command of the U.S. military  advisers who have been in the country for the past two years.  His body was flown in a C-130 plane to Puerto Rico, where he  resided.</p>

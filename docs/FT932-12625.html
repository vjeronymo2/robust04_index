			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Two jailed for oil bids racket TWO OIL industry information brokers were both jailed for three years yesterday after being convicted of bribing senior employees of British Petroleum to obtain confidential details of contract bids. Mr Josef Szrajber and Mr Paulo Sorelli sold information about rival bids to engineering companies competing for lucrative North Sea oil contracts. Mr Sorelli obtained the information and Mr Szrajber negotiated and received customers' payments. Last month both men were convicted at Southwark Crown Court, London, on seven counts of conspiring to defraud BP. Sentencing them yesterday, Judge Valerie Pearlman said: 'You quite deliberately, as a business, pursued a course of conduct where you obtained the information about the contents of sealed tenders so you could sell this information to other companies competing for the award of very lucrative contracts. What each of you did was strike at the very root of commercial probity and that has to be treated very seriously indeed.' They were responsible for helping companies win work worth a total of Pounds 100m. The value of the contracts varied from Pounds 625,000 to Pounds 50m. Working on a commission basis they received Pounds 1.7m between them. Mr Szrajber was fined Pounds 407,000 and Mr Sorelli Pounds 429,000 after it was agreed they had benefited to that extent. Both were ordered to pay Pounds 65,000 towards prosecution costs.</p>

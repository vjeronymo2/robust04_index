			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (8): Towards a world without paper / A look at the ways electronic data interchange is being put to work THE rapid growth in the use of electronic data interchange (EDI) by companies and other organisations to exchange information, particularly routine documents such as orders and invoices, is beginning to transform the traditional paper-based business transaction. EDI is a value-added network service which enables two organisations, such as customer and supplier, to exchange business documentation in a standard electronic form using their own computers linked through a service provider. It is one of the most dynamic applications made possible by computer networking and is expected to grow steadily in importance and eventually replace paper-based transactions in many business sectors. Typically, a standard business transaction such as an order is generated on a computer, printed out, sent to a supplier and then re-keyed into another computer. EDI provides an electronic 'short-cut' which is faster and often cheaper than paper-based transactions and reduces the need for re-keying data and therefore the risk of error. Orders or invoices sent by EDI can be placed and confirmed in seconds and one US study suggested that electronic trading can reduce the cost of processing a form by 90 per cent. By reducing the time taken to process a transaction manufacturing companies and retailers can reduce their level of stocks and adopt management techniques such as just-in-time inventory control. Trading information electronically can also help suppliers and their customers align their operations more closely to sales patterns and other variables, and lead to a closer 'partnership' between supplier and customer. In addition using EDI automatically sets up an 'audit trail' which enables an organisation to check and validate electronic documentation or bill a transaction between separate parts of the same organisation. These benefits have brought big growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it originated and in the UK, which is generally accepted to be the EDI leader in Europe. However, Ovum, a consultancy specialising in telecommunications market, suggested in a recent forecast that the rest of Europe is catching up fast. Two years ago, Britain accounted for 60 per cent of European EDI-users. Now, the proportion is down to 40 per cent. Between 6,000 and 7,000 companies and organisations in Britain are using electronic trading and the number is growing by more than 20 per cent a year. But there is still room for growth. Some recent estimates have suggested that only 3 per cent of business transactions in the UK are currently handled by EDI. International Network Services (INS) the biggest of the UK-based EDI services providers with an estimated 55 per cent market share, handles over 6m documents a month on its Tradanet service and says 100 new companies are joining it's 'EDI community' every month. Its customers include 78 of the top 100 UK companies, nine of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, 17 of the top 20 non-life insurers, 10 regional health authorities and four clearing banks. Other EDI network service suppliers in the UK include AT&amp;T Istel, which has a strong base in manufacturing industry, British Telecom, IBM, and SD-Scicon. Companies use these service suppliers because they provide a central 'post office' function, directing message traffic to the appropriate recipient and providing any 'data translation' needed between different computers or message standards. UK sectors which have pioneered the use of EDI include the motor and electronics industries and the retail trade, particularly the supermarket chains. The large scale usage by supermarkets in particular highlights the particular attractions of EDI to businesses with high volumes of low-value transactions and those involving fast-moving or perishable goods. Although EDI is still a relatively new use of networking technology some clear trends are emerging. According to Mr Colin Billinge, marketing director for INS, these include: Internationalisation. There is an increasing use of Edifact (EDI for Administration, Commerce and Transport), the emerging group of international message standards. Mr Billinge estimates that somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of INS's customers now have international links. Retailers led by Tesco and Boots, which have developed extensive domestic supplier networks using EDI, are now doing the same with overseas suppliers. Tesco started its international programme in January with MD Foods, its Danish dairy products supplier. Since then it has extended its use of INS-Tradanet overseas to include selected Belgian, German and French suppliers. By the end of this year it expects to have established EDI links with 50 or more overseas suppliers. 'Our aim is to extend significantly our electronic trading links with European business partners, initially for the transmission of EANCOM purchase orders, followed by invoices and other documents such as forecasts of expected demand,' says Mr Geoff Warburton, Tesco's controller. In Europe, where only about 2 per cent of EDI traffic is trans-national, this process is likely to be accelerated by the introduction of the EC single market at the end of this year. Mr Patrick Smith, Boots' EDI manager, says: 'The single market is providing us with the springboard from which to extend our electronic trading links to our numerous international suppliers. The benefits of international EDI are likely to be even greater than we have seen nationally to date, shrinking both time and distance, enabling us to ignore geographic boundaries.' Increasing Sophistication. Originally EDI tended to be used only for basic transactions like ordering and invoicing. However as familiarity with electronic trading has grown, so has the range of information transmitted over EDI links. Some EDI users are now using the system to exchange information, such as demand forecasts, with their suppliers. For instance Tesco, which has built a network of more than 1,000 firms communicating electronically, has begun to issue 13-week rolling forecasts of demand to some of its suppliers. By cutting the time between placing an order and delivery retailers and their suppliers can operate more efficiently, cut their administrative costs and keep stock levels to a minimum. Some EDI pioneers have even begun to introduce self-billing and automatic re-stocking of customers. Using EDI trusted suppliers can be authorised to deliver goods as their customers' stocks run low, without needing order messages. Meanwhile customers can invoice themselves and arrange payment through the banks, which are also starting to join in the EDI networks, thus eliminating the whole paper transaction cycle. Integration. EDI is being integrated into the fundamental business process. One effect of this is that there is a growing use of EDI to exchange 'unstructured data' for example design work or cad-cam drawings. EDI is also being integrated into existing internal electronic mail systems. Using EDI in this way enables a customer to link two incompatible Email systems, for example in different departments or divisions. Software such as INS- Ediswitch is being used by companies to provide both an internal data switch and a gateway to the outside third party services providing what Mr Billinge describes as 'the first complete 'one-stop shop' for electronic trading.' EDI is also gradually reaching a wider audience. Not only are new sectors, such as the book industry in the UK, beginning to adopt electronic trading, but customers are devising new innovative uses for EDI. EuroDollar, the UK's second largest daily car rental company, is using it to combat car crime. When EuroDollar purchases a new vehicle its details are sent electronically to HPI, a vehicle information specialist, to be stored in its Security Register. Over 16,000 motor dealers check the history of a used vehicle they are offered against the register. If the vehicle appears on the register, HPI warns the enquirer and the owner, so if EuroDollar receives an 'alert' from HPI, it knows one of its fleet is being illegally offered for sale and can take immediate action. Government departments and other public sector organisations such as the national Health Service are also increasing their use of EDI. Within the UK government, the Education Department is probably most advanced in its use of EDI and electronic messaging and all 117 education authorities have now been linked into its dedicated EDI network. Other departments, including the Home Office and the Central Statistical Office, are also examining the potential use of what has become known as administrative EDI - to differentiate it from the usual commercial uses of EDI. The growing use of EDI by both the private and public sector means that it is becoming increasingly important for even small suppliers to have access to an EDI network. Already many big UK companies have begun signalling to their suppliers that they must adopt EDI in the next few years if they want to continue trading together. EDI capability is rapidly becoming part of the cost of doing business.</p>

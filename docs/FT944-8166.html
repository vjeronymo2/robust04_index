			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (28): On the road to Prague There is a school of thought in the German investment community which believes that within only a few years most of the advantages of manufacturing investment in the Czech Republic will have withered away, writes Christopher Parkes. The Linde group and Jungheinrich, its rival in the lift truck business, are unconvinced. For a total investment of DM37m they recently opened a new purpose-built factory on a 40 hectare greenfield site in Moravamy, south of Brno on the Prague-Vienna road. The joint-venture Juli plant is now being equipped and staffed to manufacture between 80,000 and 100,000 electric lift-truck motors a year - once the task of a factory in Hamburg - in a classic example of the export of German jobs and manufacturing due to unfavourable conditions at home. The fact that from the purchase of the site to the start of production in June this year took only 16 months with none of the horrendous planning permission delays encountered in Germany was only one of the attractions. Since building electric motors is a labour-intensive job, the Brno pay rates of DM3 to DM5 an hour are a central factor, as is the 42 1/2 -hour working week and the standard allowance of two weeks' holiday. But Brno, renowned for its electro-technical department at its technical university and the local industry, also offers a wide range of workers and potential suppliers. Together, the new site and workforce provide a 'clean-sheet' start for a lean production project intended to cut the cost of motors by 40 per cent, reduce the number of motor variants from more than 70 to around 35, and homogenise design. At present virtually the entire process comprises assembling components imported from Germany, but the driving logic of the Juli process is for the parts to be supplied as cheaply and promptly as as possible. It can only be a matter of time before they, too, come from Czech factories.</p>

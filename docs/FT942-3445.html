			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Brussels sets price for Greek airline debt write-off Greece's transport minister, Mr Yannis Haralambous, faces a grilling today from the European Commission over the government's request to write off Dr491bn (Pounds 1.3bn) of debt incurred by Olympic Airways, the loss-making state carrier. Brussels is demanding considerable changes in return for its acceptance of the debt write-off and a Dr53bn capital injection over the next three years. Olympic would have to end its monopoly of ground handling facilities. It would also have to open up to other carriers profitable domestic routes to the Greek islands from next year rather than in 1998, the present date for deregulation of island routes. The government would no longer be allowed to set ticket prices or interfere in management. No further state aid would be permitted and the airline's loans could not be guaranteed by the state. The country's civil aviation authorities would have to speed up the issuing of operating licences to private Greek airlines, and let to compete head-on with Olympic on scheduled services. The three new airlines licensed to operate since deregulation was launched in 1993 are all registered as charter carriers, although they operate regular flights to Greek and European destinations. The Commission's proposals, outlined in a letter to the Greek government, go well beyond the measures foreseen in Olympic's restructuring plan, which as submitted in Brussels last month. Mr Haralambous is expected to argue that maintaining control of the ground handling operation, which brings in Dr30bn a year or 15 per cent of Olympic's operating income, is crucial to returning the airline to profit by 1997, as envisaged by the plan. However, other airlines complain that restrictive working practices and bureaucratic delays mean ground handling at Greek airports is more expensive and less efficient than elsewhere in the EU. Under the restructuring plan, Olympic has already agreed to freeze salaries for the next two years, cut loss-making long-haul routes, and eliminate 1,500 jobs through an early retirement programme. The airline projects operating losses of Dr24bn in 1994, with accumulated debt rising to Dr550bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Maputo by correspondent Barnaby Philips on the </F> "Focus on Africa" program]    [Text] Mozambican Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi told me  today that the Young Pioneers, who crossed from Malawi, are  still in the northern Mozambican Provinces of Zambezia and Tete.  Minister Mocumbi said that the Mozambican Government knows that  these men are armed because they were told this by a Young  Pioneer they captured in Zambezia Province. Minister Mocumbi  was adamant that his government is not dealing in trivial  accusations, but has solid evidence for its claims.    [Begin Mocumbi recording] What we are talking about is not  rumor. It is a fact that a group of armed people crossed from  Malawi to Mozambique. This is not a rumor at all. It is a fact  that has been acknowledged by the Malawian authorities. [end  recording]    The Mozambican Government does not know how many Young  Pioneers have crossed the border, but feels that the Malawian  Government is in a better position to provide this information.  Minister Mocumbi said that there was a possibility that Renamo  soldiers, who have been based in Malawi, also crossed into  Mozambique at the same time as the Young Pioneers. The  Mozambican Government is now considering taking the matter up  with Renamo, whom it has accused in the past of sheltering the  Young Pioneers. But Minister Mocumbi said the possibility of  using force to expel these men was, in his words, an option that  was remaining open.</p>

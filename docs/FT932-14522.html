			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Yeltsin has the edge as his referendum nears: Russia - Referendum THE final week of campaigning in the critical referendum on support for President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, on which radical reform in that country is thought to depend, opens today. The polls show a significant - but not overwhelming - lead for Mr Yeltsin. This indicates that the result of the referendum next Sunday will set off a new round of hostilities between the president and his opponents in the Russian parliament. Mr Yeltsin went to the historic city of Vladimir, east of Moscow, yesterday. There he took part in the Orthodox Easter procession and held talks with Alexei II, the Orthodox Patriarch. On Friday, he had secured a carefully orchestrated chorus of support from leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, meeting in Minsk. Seperate polls in Moscow, St Petersburg and in various Russian regions show between 50 and 60 per cent of those questioned willing to express their trust in Mr Yeltsin, but a smaller percentage was shown as intending to approve his economic and social policies. A Moscow poll by the Institute of Sociology showed 35 per cent approved the economic policy, while 27 per cent did not approve and 24 per cent had yet to decide. In St Petersburg, a poll by the Sociological Scientific Research Centre showed 56 per cent for Mr Yeltsin, with 28 per cent against - but with only 38 per cent supporting his economic programme and 39 per cent against. Polls taken by the Gallup organisation for the Russian government, over the past week and based on group discussions, show about 60 per cent support for Mr Yeltsin, continuing support for the creation of a market economy, but substantial scepticism towards the privatisation programme. Mr Yeltsin's supporters are calling for a 'yes' vote to three of the four questions in the referendum - to trust the president, to support his economic and social policies, and to call for early elections to a new two-chamber partliament. They are calling for a 'no' vote to a question on early presidential elections. Mr Yeltsin has said he will issue a decree tomorrow, which will lay down that only a simple majority of those voting will be required for victory to be declared in the referendum. The Russian parliament has decreed that a majority of the electorate is required - which the opinion polls show to be impossible, since only 60-65 per cent intend to vote. Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, said at the weekend that he understood the Constitutional Court would rule this week that the parliament's decree on the level of support needed was unconstitutional. However, Mr Yeltsin has said he will ignore any ruling of the Constitutional Court because he no longer trusts it. The parliament in the Russian North Caucasian republic of Chechnya has moved to impeach the republic's president, General Dzhokar Dudayev, a day after he had dissolved the legislature and declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew, according to the Interfax news agency. Mr Husain Akhmadov, parliamentary chairman, told the agency that Gen Dudayev was being impeached for 'trying to carry out a state coup.' The general, a former Soviet air force commander, declared Chechnya - then part of the larger Chechen Ingushetia - independent a year and a half ago. He imposed a curfew and dissolved the parliament after two days of demonstrations in the centre of Grozny, the Chechen capital, against falling living standards.</p>

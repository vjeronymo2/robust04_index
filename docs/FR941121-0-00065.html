An ``emergency'' means any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the early reductions source, including acts of God, which situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the early reductions source to exceed an emission limitation under the permit, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effect of an emergency <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such an emission limitation if the conditions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The affirmative defense of emergency shall be demonstrated through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) An emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the emergency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) During the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission limitation, or other requirements in the permit; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The permittee submitted notice of the emergency to the Administrator within 2 working days of the time when emission limitations were exceeded due to the emergency. This notice fulfills the requirement of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section. This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking to establish the occurrence of an emergency has the burden of proof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;71.26  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Permit issuance, reopenings, and revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Action on application.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A permit or permit revision may be issued only if all of the following conditions have been met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

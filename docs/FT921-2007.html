			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Tories promise to end Treasury's pre-Budget 'purdah' AN END to the Treasury's secretive grip on all Budget decisions in favour of more open debate within the cabinet about taxation and spending is being promised by senior ministers if the Conservatives win the election. Some members of the cabinet this week blamed the Treasury's insistence on pre-Budget 'purdah' for the faltering start to the Conservatives' general election campaign. Colleagues said the significance of the planned reforms of the Budget system had not been widely appreciated. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has announced that from next year all decisions on government spending and taxation - which are now split between the Autumn Statement and the March Budget - would be presented in a single December Budget. The reasoning behind the proposal is that the uniquely British tradition of separating decisions on government spending and revenue has obscured the choices to be made between spending increases and tax cuts. Mr Lamont said the process had intensified pressure for special reliefs and had contributed to an 'excessively complicated' tax system. Senior ministers outside the Treasury said that the chancellor and the prime minister appreciated that under the new system the cabinet and the House of Commons would gradually assume more prominent roles in tax decisions. At present, the chancellor informs his cabinet colleagues of his decisions only on the morning of the Budget. Until then they are in the dark about revenue and borrowing projections and cannot make informed judgements on the chancellor's options. The ministers said that because the planned change would sharpen the 'trade-off' between tax and spending decisions, the Treasury would be far less able to conceal what it was doing. The lag between the announcement in December of the expanded Budget and its implementation in April after the passage of the finance bill means that MPs will have more opportunity to force changes. Some cabinet members believe secrecy was a significant factor in a less-than-enthusiastic reception for the Budget on March 10. Mr Lamont's colleagues continued until the day of the announcement to fuel expectations of much larger tax increases because they were unaware of the sharp rise in borrowing.</p>

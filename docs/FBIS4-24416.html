			<p>BFN     [Text] Liu Huaqing, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  Standing Committee member and Central Military Commission vice  chairman, inspected Hubei Province 17-20 May.    During his inspection tour, Liu Huaqing visited the Wuchang  Shipyard, where he inquired about production and met and held  talks with cadres and workers; visited Wuhan's Changfei Optical  Fiber Cable Company Ltd. and the Donghu High and New Technology  Development Zone; visited Yichang, where he inspected the Three  Gorges Project on Zhongbao Island; and visited the Gezhouba  Power Plant, where he was briefed on the plant's construction  and management.    During his stay in Wuhan, Liu Huaqing met with locally  stationed military and armed police commanders. During his  inspection of Hubei, Liu Huaqing energetically called for  building a national defense industry characterized by high and  new technologies, speeding up the national defense modernization  drive, making the national defense industry submit to and serve  the central task of economic construction, and contributing more  to national economic growth.    Liu Huaqing stated: The old generation of revolutionaries  have all along been very concerned about the national defense  industry. They have not only offered brilliant expositions on  national defense development but have also personally supervised  a large number of key defense-related scientific research  projects. As a result, China has now joined the ranks of the  scientifically and technologically developed countries. Over  the past few years, under the leadership of the CPC Central  Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military  Commission, China's defense-related scientific and technological  undertakings have registered faster growth. In the years to  come, we should continue to carry out more arduous work,  constantly forge ahead, continually make explorations, and  strive to live up to each and every ardent expectation placed on  us by the old generation of revolutionaries in this connection.    Liu Huaqing pointed out: Having been tempered and trained  over the past several decades, China's defense-related  scientific and technical personnel and managerial personnel have  now become a professional contingent capable of doing hard work,  offering selfless devotion, and making more contributions to  China's national defense cause. With this highly competent and  commendable contingent, China's national defense modernization  drive definitely stands a very good chance of success.    Liu Huaqing maintained: China's national defense industry  should strive to keep abreast with the current rapid high and  new technological development, should organically combine  domestic scientific research achievements with advanced foreign  technology and equipment, should continually improve and upgrade  defense-related technology and equipment, and should more  efficiently implement the strategic principle of active defense.  In the years ahead, in order to ensure systematization,  integration, and reliability, we should set higher technological  requirements on and new goals for the country's defense-related  scientific research, should vigorously improve scientific  research management and quality, should avoid formalism and  fraud in scientific research, and should conscientiously and  meticulously conduct scientific research.    Liu Huaqing emphatically noted: Now that the whole country  is giving top priority to and taking economic construction as  the central task, the country's national defense industry should  unswervingly submit to and serve the overall interests of  economic construction and should actively support industrial and  national economic development in local areas.    Accompanying Comrade Liu Huaqing during his inspection of  Hubei were Xie Guang, vice minister of the Commission of  Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense; Wang  Shen, deputy commander of the Guangzhou Military Region; Hubei  Governor Jia Zhijie; Hui Liangyu, Hubei Provincial CPC Committee  deputy secretary and Hubei Provincial Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference Committee chairman; Qian Yunlu, Hubei  Provincial CPC Committee deputy secretary and Wuhan City CPC  Committee secretary; Xu Shiqiao, Hubei Provincial Military  District political commissar; among others.</p>

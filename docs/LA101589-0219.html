			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP  </P> <P> In a Sea View League game:  </P> <P> Newport Harbor 24, University 21 -- Newport Harbor High School Coach Jeff  Brinkley thinks his players might have learned some valuable lessons in the  league opener at Irvine High.  </P> <P> The Sailors were trailing 15-0 in the second quarter and then scored the next  24 points to improve their record to 5-1. University is 2-4 overall.  </P> <P> "We had a little success early on in the season," Brinkley said. "Maybe it came  too easy for our kids. But I think they learned their lesson, and we still won  the ball game. Sometimes you learn your lessons and lose the ball game."  </P> <P> Newport Harbor's rally was keyed by tailback Todd Farley, who carried 25 times  for 157 yards. Farley's 17-yard touchdown sprint in the third quarter was  followed by a two-point conversion that tied the game at 15.  </P> <P> Newport took the lead late in the quarter when quarterback Stephen Scheck (11  of 17 for 120 yards) hit a wide-open Matt White for a 45-yard touchdown.  Newport Harbor's first touchdown came on Ryan Abbey's 1-yard plunge just before  halftime.  </P> <P> University had built its 15-0 lead on a 35-yard field goal by David Jacobson  and two touchdown passes by Brian Vail (73 yards to wingback Victor Davis and  six yards to Thad Machnikowski). The Trojans scored with 3:50 remaining in the  game on Marc Walker's 1-yard run, but their final drive fell flat.  </P> <P> Brinkley's halftime talk with his players might have sparked the Sailors'  comeback. "I just told them that if we're gonna have a shot at a league  championship, then we've got to make up an eight-point deficit," he said. "They  responded." STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares drift lower in nervous trading WIDESPREAD hopes that Thursday's economic statement will be accompanied by a cut in UK base rates could not sustain the UK stock market yesterday. Although above the day's low, the FT-SE Index closed beneath the 2,700 mark regained only last week. The stock market confidently expects base rates to be reduced by at least one point, either as part of the government's economic statement or on the day following, when the October retail price index is likely to show year-on-year inflation down to 3.3 per cent. While most City analysts would be satisfied with a one-point reduction to 7 per cent, some responded to the call from the Confederation of British Industry for rates to be cut by two percentage points to 6 per cent. However, the City was nervous when sterling fell sharply in late dealings after the CBI's regional chairman warned of the risks posed by 'dramatic' interest rate cuts. Against this uncertain backcloth, equities abandoned initial gains and, with stock index futures also virtually on hold, drifted down to a loss of 8.5 on the Footsie at mid-morning. A modest recovery, together with a calm start to the new session on Wall Street, helped the London market later. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,695.4 for a loss of 7.3 on the day. Seaq volume slipped to 517.5m shares from Friday's 652.8m. Retail business was worth Pounds 1.2bn on Friday. Retail volume has been averaging more than Pounds 1bn daily for the past two months, indicating that London-based market firms have improved profitability during the final quarter of this year. Once again, volume in second line stocks exceeded that in the Footsie listed issues yesterday. Late trading saw several large blocks of blue chips traded, notably BAT Industries (1.8m) and British Gas (6.4m). However, strains on the securities industry remain severe and there were suggestions yesterday that two more City brokerage houses would announce a merger this week. Traders stressed that there was little selling pressure. The Footsie was held down by renewed falls among the international pharmaceutical stocks on worries that the new US president may tighten Federal spending on medical welfare. SmithKline Beecham suffered a bout of selling pressure. Reports that GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing group, is seeking to reschedule its bank debt unsettled Rolls-Royce and several other leading names in the aircraft industry supply business, and dire statistics on insolvency rates in British industry lay heavily across the manufacturing sector. Retail issues were helped by interest rate optimism but paid little heed to the latest data on UK consumer credit, indicating that UK consumers continued to pay down credit card debt in September. Confidence in prospects for a consumer-led boom to lead the UK out of recession remained fragile. Downgradings of UK companies by brokerage analysts continued to provide features as well as to restrain investor activity across the range of the market. Market strategists, however, agreed that the autumn economic statement is likely to bring the first evidence of the government's growth strategy and that this is expected to confirm the recovery trend in the stock market since September.</p>

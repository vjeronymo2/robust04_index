			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (13): Top of the growth league - Asian demand seems insatiable IF you have flown from London to Hong Kong recently, there is a good chance that down in the hold your luggage was nestling next to a consignment of cellular telephones. Exporting cellular telephones from the UK to Hong Kong and eventually China has become a lucrative sideline for cellular telephone dealers. Manufacturers already supply China directly, but demand far outstrips supply and dealers can make a lot more money selling a handset to a middleman in Hong Kong than to a UK mobile phone user. The cellular telephone has become a symbol of China's dash for prosperity, like it was in London and New York. The brick-like mobile phone that Michael Douglas used on the beach at dawn in the film Wall Street is a small object of desire in the Guangdong province next to Hong Kong - in spite of the fact that Motorola of the US, the maker of the telephone, has since brought out lighter, smaller models. China's cellular telephone users grew from 38,000 in January 1992 to 160,000 at the start of this year. There were over 200,000 subscribers by the end of June. All but five of China's 30 provincial state-owned telephone operators have cellular telephone networks, and the National Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has been besieged with requests from the provinces to finance network expansion programmes. So confident are they of future growth that leading cellular telephone suppliers such as Motorola, Ericsson and American Telephone and Telegraph have set up joint ventures in China to manufacture cellular telephone networks and handsets. While China has been singled out by the leading telephone companies as one of the most significant markets in the 1990s, opportunities are presenting themselves throughout south-east Asia, particularly in mobile communications. Licences to operate cellular telephone networks are being advertised in most countries in the region. Australia has awarded two licences within the last two years to operate digital networks based on the European GSM standard. A consortium of Cable and Wireless and BellSouth of the US won one licence, while the UK cellular telephone operator Vodafone is the largest foreign shareholder in the second licensee. McCaw Cellular, also of the US, is a shareholder in the Smartcom consortium in Hong Kong, which opened the colony's fourth cellular network in the spring. In Japan, the Tu-Ka and Digital Phone consortia which are building regional cellular telephone networks across the country, contain major Japanese industrial groups such as Nissan Motor and Toyota. BT, Cable and Wireless and Pacific Telesis are also shareholders. A number of licence opportunities are still being contested. Binariang, a Malaysian industrial group which has been awarded a licence to operate a GSM network, is in discussions with a number of possible overseas partners. Thailand's cellular operator, Total Access Communications, is doing likewise. Vietnam is contemplating the award of a licence, while South Korea started a licensing procedure but failed to finish it after the winning bidder returned its licence following a change of government and allegations of corruption. India awarded six regional licences last October, but a successful high court case brought against the adjudication committee by an unsuccessful bidder has threatened to overturn the awards. During 1992, the number of subscribers to cellular telephone systems in the 12 largest south-east Asia and Australasia markets grew by 50 per cent from 2.7m to 4m, according to figures published by the FT newsletter, Mobile Communications. It is the fastest-growing region in the world, outpacing Europe where the 12 largest markets grew by a comparatively sluggish 27 per cent, and the buoyant US market whose cellular population rose by 46 per cent over the course of the year. Japan accounts for 40 per cent of subscribers in the region, but has grown more slowly than some other Asian markets. This may change with the launch of new regional services using digital technology, and a change in the law from April 1994 when, for the first time, subscribers will be able to buy mobile telephones rather than have to rent them. Mr Andrew Bissex, who was posted to Hong Kong by UK cellular telephone group Vodafone to compete for licences, says any comparison between the markets for mobile communications services in Europe and south-east Asia is difficult. People do not seem to buy mobile telephones for the same reason as in Europe, he says. 'It doesn't seem to be related to tariffs,' Mr Bissex comments. 'It seems that the demand for cellular telephones is closely related to the size of the wealthy populations in urban centres.' Whereas in the UK, the majority of mobile phone users are tradesmen, in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, a large proportion are traders. 'They use cellular telephones because the local telephone service is so awful,' adds Mr Bissex. 'In many countries you can be kept waiting for up to six months for a telephone line.' Even when telephone lines are available, the quality of the service, particularly for international calls, can prove a headache. It is often easier to make an international call on a cellular phone where the operators have managed to secure preferential access to international telephone gateways. In Hong Kong and Singapore, telepoint services - which only allow outgoing calls and cannot be used in cars - have been successfully introduced after failing to establish themselves as alternatives to cellular telephones in the UK and Germany. Mr Bissex reckons this is due to the high population densities of these countries, which makes it relatively cheap for telepoint operators to build networks providing 100 per cent population coverage. 'In Hong Kong, you can clip a telepoint phone on your belt as you leave your apartment in the morning, and make calls as you walk to work and until you arrive at the office.' The telepoint phone can then be converted into a high quality cordless telephone for which normal tariffs apply. 'You can hardly imagine a similar sort of service being popular in Manchester,' says Mr Bissex.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               SE Asia and Australasia: cellular subscriber                      growth in the 12 largest markets  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Subscribers      Subscribers      Growth Country            (January 1993)    (January 1992)      (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia              559,000           336,000          54 China                  160,000            38,000         321 Hong Kong              233,000           180,000          29 Indonesia               31,500            16,000          97 Japan                1,614,700         1,251,000          29 Malaysia               207,000           135,000          53 New Zealand             93,900            69,200          36 Philippines             55,000            40,000          38 Singapore              111,000            70,000          59 South Korea            271,000           173,300          56 Taiwan                 428,900           198,900         116 Thailand               256,800           154,000          67  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                4,021,800         2,688,400          50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Financial Times Mobile Communications  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

FDA proposed to remove these substances because it had not, at that time, received any reports that these substances were in use as direct human food ingredients. The agency is withdrawing the proposal because of a report that these substances are being directly used in food. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> F. Owen Fields, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;207), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;254&hyph;9528. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate are listed in &sect;&sect;182.3109 and 182.3280 (21 CFR 182.3109 and 182.3280), as GRAS for direct food use as chemical preservatives at levels not exceeding 0.02 percent of the fat or oil content. Thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate are listed in &sect;181.24 (21 CFR 181.24) as prior-sanctioned ingredients for use as antioxidants in food-packaging material, and are permitted for use as antioxidants in &sect;175.300  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Resinous and polymeric coatings <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (21 CFR 175.300). In addition, indirect use of thiodipropionic acid is listed in &sect;178.2010  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Antioxidants and/or stabilizers for polymers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (21 CFR 178.2010). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 13, 1982 (47 FR 35240), FDA proposed to remove thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate from the list of direct human food ingredients that are GRAS. FDA stated that it was proposing to take this action because FDA had not, at that time, received any reports that these substances were in use as direct human food ingredients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA received three comments in response to its proposal. All three comments opposed the removal of these substances from the list of direct human food ingredients that are GRAS. One of the comments contained information on the direct use of these ingredients in food. In addition, two of the comments expressed concern that removing these compounds from the list of direct GRAS ingredients would cause confusion about the GRAS or prior-sanctioned status of these substances for indirect uses. Finally, two of the comments stated that the fact that the agency had not received any reports of these substances being used in food was not an adequate reason to remove them from the list of direct food ingredients that are GRAS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has considered all of these comments. In view of the comment that these substances are being directly used in food, we have concluded that the orginal basis for the agency's proposal to remove these substances from the GRAS list is not valid. FDA also wishes to clarify that its proposal to remove these substances from the list of direct human food ingredients that are GRAS would not have affected their allowed indirect uses under &sect;&sect;175.300, 178.2010, or 181.24, as suggested by two of the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the agency announces that it is withdrawing the proposal that it published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 13, 1982 (47 FR 35240), to remove thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate from the list of direct human food ingredients that are GRAS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William K.

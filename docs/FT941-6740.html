			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Rules on public contract tendering to be eased Private companies will be able to win public sector contracts without having to compete against other bidders, under government guidelines to be unveiled today. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, will announce that ministers have decided to drop their insistence on competition in all cases, in an effort to get the government's private finance initiative off the ground. Under the guidelines, a contract will not be put out to public tender if it cannot proceed without access to the intellectual property of the company that came up with the proposal. The move, recommended by the government's private finance working party, is designed to address what has emerged as a significant obstacle to the involvement of private capital in public sector projects. Companies have been unwilling to commit resources to devising new proposals since, once adopted, they are required to go to competitive tender for implementation, allowing the innovation to be won by a competitor. Mr Dorrell will set out a framework for handling competition in private finance initiative contracts at an Institute of Directors seminar. He is expected to confirm that government departments will be permitted to offer the partial reimbursement of tendering costs if they set out the arrangements under which this would take place before the tendering process starts. Companies on the government's private finance working group have also been assured that when contracts are put out to competitive tendering the competition will only be between three or four big companies. This is designed to cut bureaucracy and time involved in the tendering process. Government departments will also clearly define public sector contracts in order to avoid what one member of the committee called 'the chopping and changing of government construction contracts'. Mr Dorrell will explain that the government has decided against giving departments the right to offer design-only contracts. A string of conditions is expected to apply to the cases where the competition requirement is dropped. The proposals will not involve cases covered by European Union rules requiring competition. Mr Dorrell's speech will come just a week after the release of a Labour discussion paper on private financing for infrastructure projects. He is expected to use this to argue that there is now cross-party consensus on the benefits of private finance. Ms Ann Robinson, head of the IoD policy unit, said yesterday: 'The private finance initiative is at present underutilised and insufficiently attractive to private bidders. Improvements can be made.'</p>

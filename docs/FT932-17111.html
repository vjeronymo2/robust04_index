			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Strikes of no economic significance TWENTY years ago a one-day strike by the main rail and mining unions, boasting a combined membership of about half a million, would have sent shudders through the economy. Today the combined membership is closer to 100,000 and, aside from the considerable inconvenience to rail commuters, the one-day strikes will have no economic significance. Less than 10 per cent of domestic freight is now carried by rail, and the coal stockpile is currently 11m tonnes, more than a quarter of the coming year's contract with the electricity generators. Aware of the limited impact of their action, the unions cite the official reason for today's disruption as the European Trade Union Confederation's day of action against unemployment. Unofficially, however, today is the closest that the more traditional sections of the British labour movement can get to a 'general strike' against unemployment and pit closures. Leaders of the National Union of Mineworkers still believe pit closures and privatisation can be stopped by mass action supported by sympathetic public opinion. Mr Ken Capstick, leader of the Yorkshire NUM, says: 'We don't have the industrial muscle any longer and we rely on popular support and on other sections of the trade union movement. But in a strange sort of way the miners can still give the lead.' The rail union, RMT, meanwhile, appears to accept that rail privatisation is unstoppable but wants to cushion its members from the effects. Its low key campaign has failed to win the public support that it achieved during the 1989 dispute but it has forced the government into abandoning plans for a radical restructuring of the British Rail pension fund. The official reasons for action today are that BR is refusing to give a 'no compulsory redundancy agreement' and refusing to abandon the use of private contractors on traditional railway work. But the RMT executive also wants to show solidarity with the NUM, especially because many of the 20,000 job cuts expected at BR are linked to pit closures. Laws on industrial action, however, mean RMT may only take action against its own management. Neither union has won overwhelming support from its members for even one day of action. The NUM won 60 per cent support on a 75 per cent turn-out and the RMT got 70 per cent support on a 55 per cent turn-out. Both have talked about further action but no firm decisions have been taken. RMT, in particular, might face a much tougher reaction from BR and even from the government if it attempts another strike. Whatever the outcome of today's action and the threat of further disruption, the important future battles will be fought in the law courts. The key issue in the mines will be what happens to the Mines and Quarries Act, one of the most rigorous pieces of health and safety legislation in Britain. If the NUM can keep the essentials of that act they will help retain union power at pit level and make privatisation less attractive. The RMT, meanwhile, will probably be covered by the European Transfer of Undertakings legislation - protecting jobs and pay levels - when franchisees take over the rail service. In neither industry will the unions be completely marginalised, even after privatisation, but the sort of labour flexibility now common in manufacturing industry will increasingly become the norm.</p>

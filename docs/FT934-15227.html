			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / No opt-out from works councils: Robert Taylor explains how EC rules may hit 300 British companies THE ISOLATION of Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, over the European Community works council directive was disclosed at yesterday's meeting of EC social affairs ministers in Luxembourg. While the other 11 EC member states have signalled their intention to push ahead with the directive after November 1, Britain was excluded from the discussion. But when the directive comes into force, British private companies, who employ more than a 1,000 workers elsewhere in the EC, will have to introduce a works council for their continental employees. Employees working in UK-based subsidiaries of large Continental companies can also expect to participate in Europe-wide works councils. Last night Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the UK government had 'lost the argument' over the issue. 'The works council directive will sooner or later apply in Britain,' he said. 'The era of the British veto is over. This is good news for British workers and the whole country.' At the moment there are an estimated 30 European works councils at large companies, none of them UK-owned. The number will grow when the directive comes into force to an estimated 1,000: all those which have head offices in EC; which employ more than 1,000 people; and which have subsidiaries with at least 100 employees in at least one other member state. A third of these are UK companies, and they include British Telecommunications, Grand Metropolitan, Barclays Bank, Thorn EMI, Royal Dutch Shell, Imperial Chemical Industries and Unilever. The proposed European works councils will not be involved directly in collective bargaining. Their purpose is to provide a forum for employees in European transnational companies to receive information and consultation on their business activities. British union leaders do not see how these companies would be able to insulate their UK operations from the effects of the directive. Enormous pressure would be exerted on them to allow their UK workers to be involved in the works council system as well. A survey published last weekend by Industrial Relations Services found that half the UK companies surveyed did not believe a European works council would add to their costs. But Britain's employer organisations can be expected to resist change strongly. The Confederation of British Industry has been at the forefront of the battle to oppose the works council directive. The question is whether Britain's employers will find themselves, like their country's government, isolated from their colleagues on the Continent over the issue.</p>

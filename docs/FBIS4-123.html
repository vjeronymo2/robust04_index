			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political editor Shaun Johnson] </F>   [Text] The ANC should be the clear winner in the election,  but it is still wide open as to whether Nelson Mandela's  organisation can achieve the two-thirds majority it is gunning  for. This finding emerges from the latest STAR/MMR [Marketing  and Media Research] survey, reflecting opinions expressed as  recently as three weeks ago. The survey comes as a follow-up to  the first phase poll, conducted three months ago, and published  in THE STAR.    There are still 17 percent of people who are undecided  compared to about 19 percent three months ago. This adds up to  almost four million voters who could hold the key to a  two-thirds ANC majority.    The "absolute majority" cut-off has emerged clearly as the  main focus of the campaign -- all research indicates the ANC  will win the election comfortably, but the question is by how  much.    Against this background the survey suggests that while  interesting, subtle and important shifts have occurred in the  intervening period, broad support-levels have not altered  sufficiently to make dramatic changes -- as in a different  overall outcome -- likely in the remaining weeks of the  campaign. But percentages can still shift meaningfully, with  important political spin-offs for power balances in the  five-year transition period.    The accompanying graph sets out MMR's estimates, within five  percent ranges--ANC 59-64 percent, NP 16-21 percent, PAC 3-8  percent, FF 2-7 percent, DP 1-6 percent--of the likely  performances by the five main political parties contesting next  month's election. MMR's estimates -- which take into account  other credible pre-election polls -- suggest the ANC is  tantalisingly close to the two-thirds breakthrough at this  stage, but that this remains a possibility rather than a  probability. For this reason the closing stages of the election  campaign take on a particular significance.    A regrouping National Party [NP] could draw as much as 21  percent of the vote, indicating that it has no serious  competitors for second place as the major partner in the new  government.    It is thought unlikely that any other parties will break the  10 percent barrier, but the estimates show that the Pan  Africanist Congress [PAC], the Freedom Front [FF] and the  Democratic Party [DP], all have the chance of achieving and  surpassing five percent -- which, in terms of the Interim  Constitution and arrangements for the transitional period would  catapult them into a coalition Cabinet.    The survey's extrapolations show, therefore, that the PAC's  potential is higher than has been generally thought and the new  factor, the Freedom Front, is also to be taken seriously.    As is explained at the top of this page [see "How the poll  works" passage below], many factors have been brought to bear by  MMR in reaching what are "best informed guess" predictions. What  will happen to the Inkatha Freedom Party's support, for example,  is unpredictable.    MMR calculates the "midpoint of range" election outcome  predictions are as follows:     -  ANC, 62 percent.    -  NP, 19 percent.    -  PAC, 6 percent.    -  FF, 5 percent.    -  DP, 4 percent.       The new poll points to a five percent loss of support by the  ANC, with the NP being the main beneficiary. Indian voters in  particular seem to be shifting, with the trend less marked among  coloureds and black South Africans. Upper income voters are  more likely to switch their allegiance to the NP than other  voters. The ANC's supporters have stood firm, but the  organisation has some male support. The ANC's appeal to women  can probably be linked to its strong pro-female campaign,  including speeches from Mandela.    The NP is in a growth phase, attracting an increase of up to  six percent in its support level. Many whites who said they  were uncertain three months ago have thrown their lot with  President de Klerk's party.    The DP has remained largely static; it has make moderate  gains among coloureds; but has lost white and Indian support.    The PAC's messages is having some effect in black and  coloured communities, in the 25 to 34 year-old age group.    Before its formal decision to boycott the election, the IFP  showed a one percent increase in voter support.    Separate articles on this page spell out the other detailed  findings of the survey.    In the first survey 19 percent of people said they were  undecided and 6 percent refused to name their choice.  <H5>  How the poll works </H5>   The second phase of The Star-Marketing and Media Research  (MMR) poll is comparable to the first in terms of the size and  the methods used. A total of 2,590 people over 18 years old  were interviewed face-to-face in their homes, in their chosen  language, by trained Market Research Africa (MRA) interviewers.    Areas representative of the whole of South Africa were  chosen  and random samples were then taken in these areas. This sample  is representative of just under 90 percent of voters living in  cities, towns and larger villages in South Africa.    The survey excludes communities of fewer than 500 and,  therefore, is not representative of the "deep" rural vote.    The fieldwork for the second phase was carried out between  February 9 and March 7, about three months after the first phase.    The survey was designed and analysed by MMR, which will be  happy to answer any queries about the reliability or  significance of the findings.  <H5>  But remember this... </H5>   Although the survey used scientific methods, and interviews  were carried out by trained people and analysed by unbiased  experts, factors outside their control could influence the final  result of the election.    Among these are:     -  When the first poll was carried out the Freedom Alliance,  which included the IFP, had not decided definitely on whether or  not to take part in the election. Since then IFP has refused,  but the Freedom Front has decided to come in.    -  No one can accurately predict the voter turnout -- polls on  this vary from 60 percent to 90 percent -- or spoilt papers.    -  Violence and intimidation.    -  Uncertainty in Natal.    -  The position of a party on the ballot paper.    -  The ability of rural voters to get to polling stations.    -  Voter education and party propaganda.    -  Coloured and Indian "swing" vote.    -  Processing of valid identity documents.    -  Survey sample error and the lie factor in answering  questions.    -  Undecided voters.    -  Lack of accurate census figures.    -  Difficulty in predicting who, or if, those who support the  IFP,  CP [Conservative Party], Azapo [Azanian People's Organization],  etc, will vote for.    -  Apathy or uninterest.</p>

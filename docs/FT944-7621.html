			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: New trade group shuns UN links - Gatt members near-unanimous in rejecting Boutros Ghali scheme The preparatory committee of the future World Trade Organisation has rejected any formal links with the United Nations, decisively rebuffing a campaign by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to bring the WTO within the UN system. Mr K Kesavapany, Singapore's ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and chairman for institutional matters, yesterday said that Gatt members had found no grounds for 'any formal institutional arrangement' between the WTO and the UN. Mr Boutros Ghali has been lobbying hard in New York for the WTO to become a specialised UN agency or, failing that, to have the same kind of looser UN attachment enjoyed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. However, the idea has met with virtually unanimous opposition among Gatt members in Geneva, including the Quad group of leading traders, the US, the European Union, Japan and Canada. Developing countries are equally unenthusiastic, with the exception of Egypt, Mr Boutros Ghali's home country. The WTO, due to take over from Gatt on January 1, will have to co-operate on various aspects of trade policy with a number of international organisations, including the World Bank, the IMF and the World Intellectual Property Organisation, a UN specialised agency. However, Mr Kesavapany said that, with one exception, pragmatic ties between the WTO and the various intergovernmental bodies could be established by the WTO's governing council. The exception relates to co-ordination with the IMF over balance of payments issues. Officially, Gatt members take the view that as contractual agreements, Gatt and the WTO are legally incompatible with the UN structure because their rules must be negotiated not imposed by a higher authority. Unofficially, trade diplomats are anxious to keep the WTO well away from the political and bureaucratic clutches of the UN. Gatt, with a relatively small staff of about 450, is generally considered to be among the most efficient of the international organisations in Geneva, partly because it has managed to avoid the destructive politicisation experienced by much of the UN system. Gatt's relations with the UN are governed by an agreement of August 1952 covering ad hoc co-operation - an approach likely to be continued by the WTO.</p>

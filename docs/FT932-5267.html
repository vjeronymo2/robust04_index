			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: St James's Place net asset value 13% ahead NET ASSETS per share at St James's Place Capital, the investment company chaired by Lord Rothschild and Sir Mark Weinberg, rose by 13 per cent from 95.5p to 107.7p in the year to end-March. The directors take the view that the company should be judged on a net asset basis, rather than on the profit and loss account. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 9m, against Pounds 18.4m. Losses in dealing investments rose to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 7.5m) mainly because European interest rates took longer to fall than anticipated. The company was formed after the demerger of J Rothschild Holdings. It operates a fund management arm and has interests in J Rothschild Assurance, a life company, J Rothschild, Wolfensohn, a corporate finance business and a stake in RIT Capital Partners. The increased value of the stake in RIT was the main factor behind the increase in net asset value over the period. A final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of 3p, payable from earnings of 3.8p (9.7p). The shares slipped 2p to 105p. RIT, the investment trust, reported a 29 per cent increase in fully diluted net asset value from 140.7p to 181.1p. The shares rose 3p to 141p. The main reason for the increase was the rise in the value of its holding in Newmont Mining. It sold a third of its 7 per cent holding to Mr George Soros, the international fund manager who recently invested Dollars 400m (Pounds 260m) in gold.</p>

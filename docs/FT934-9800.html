			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Lufthansa In glaring contrast to Air France's equivocations, Lufthansa is resolutely attacking its cost base. Although passengers remain few and far between, Lufthansa has been able to record a rare third-quarter profit after cutting operating expenses by 4.5 per cent over the first nine months of the year. The financial stringency is continuing, promising further margin improvements. Demand should also begin to pick up next year while the link-up with United Airlines holds out considerable promise over the longer term. The German stock market has been quick to scent recovery. Lufthansa's shares have risen almost 70 per cent over the past year, even though the company is unlikely to record an annual profit until 1995. This seemingly provides an encouraging backdrop for the German state to reduce its 54 per cent holding further. But with a weighty deficit hanging round its neck, the government can ill-afford to take on Lufthansa's DM4bn pension fund obligations. A consummation of the Alcazar alliance would give Lufthansa another cause for concern. The four airlines, which rim Germany, could well develop into a formidable force in European aviation. However, the clash between KLM and Swissair over which US carrier should be chosen as the alliance's transatlantic partner threatens to scupper the whole deal. That would be doubly good news for Lufthansa if it cleared the way to it securing an alliance with Austrian Airlines.</p>

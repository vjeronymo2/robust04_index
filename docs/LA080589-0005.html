			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FASCINATION WITH ROCK-CLIMBING  </P> <P> After his eight-day ascent of Yosemite's El Capitan, paraplegic Mark Wellman  said he made the climb just because it was something he wanted to do. If it  inspired other handicapped people, so much the better. As for his climbing  partner, Mike Corbett was not overly concerned with his athlete's image. When  Corbett was asked to recall his scariest moment, the pack-a-day smoker said it  was when his carton of cigarettes almost fell off a ledge. Two thousand feet up  El Capitan is not the place for nicotine withdrawal.  </P> <P> The nationwide attention the climb received is just one manifestation of a  growing fascination with rock-climbing in this country. Thousands of young men  and women are establishing incredibly difficult new climbing routes in places  like Smith Rocks in Oregon, Vedauwoo in Wyoming, the New River Gorge of West  Virginia and even throughout the South. One of the nation's top woman climbers  lives in Atlanta.  </P> <P> For years, traditionalists claimed that publicity and competition were at odds  with the notion that a virtuous mountain experience was two or three rumpled  companions toiling up a remote virgin peak unknown to anyone. The only  notoriety might come months later with a cryptic note in a climbing journal.  But today, even the American Alpine Club supports climbing contests. A second  annual international climbing meet will be held on an artificial climbing wall  at Snowbird in Utah this summer. There will be television coverage, of course.  If the truth were known, there always has been some form of competition:  Climbers in the old days tried to keep their plans secret so they could beat  their rivals to a coveted first ascent.  </P> <P> Still, the hoopla is nothing compared to what it has been in Europe for  decades. If it were, there also would have been intense television coverage of  the weeklong Paul Piana-Todd Skinner ascent of the Salathe Wall on the same  side of El Capitan last summer. They did what the best climbers had tried and  failed to do for more than a decade: make the first free ascent of perhaps the  best and most sustained rock climb in the world. This means they climbed the  3,500-foot route without using their ropes and climbing gear except to hold  them in the event of a fall. When the Salathe was first done during a 9 1/2-day  stretch in 1961, Royal Robbins, Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost could surmount many  hundreds of feet of vertical and overhanging wall only by standing in nylon  loops clipped to pitons hammered successively higher into cracks in the  Yosemite granite. Piana and Skinner did pitch after pitch of sustained free  climbing at levels of difficulty that were not believed possible in 1961.  </P> <P> Another hot climber, Peter Croft, has done six classic Yosemite routes in a  single day -- routes that required a cumulative 10 days by the accomplished  climbers who made the first ascents in the 1950s and 1960s. Croft did them  alone without a rope for protection against falls.  </P> <P> There are many reasons for such achievements. They include the evolution of  quality lightweight climbing gear, shoes with super sticky rubber, access to  good rock for long stretches of time, diets, training and specialization in  certain types of climbs.  </P> <P> The ultimate frontier of climbing, however, is the frontier of the mind. The  Piana-Skinner climb was stunning, but they had the advantage of several weeks  of practice on the route in advance, working out the moves needed to overcome  many of the hardest obstacles. When Robbins, Pratt and Frost first climbed the  Salathe, no one had been there before.  </P> <P> The unknown always has been a central element in climbing. As a specialized  branch of mountaineering, competitive rock-climbing has evolved into a  technical sport stripped of mystery and adventure. Some might think the same of  Wellman's climb of El Capitan as he hauled himself by brute arm strength up a  route that had been climbed many times before. But what a frontier of the mind  Wellman had to cross first.  </P></p>

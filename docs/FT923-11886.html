			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Italian financier indicted on perjury charge in US MR Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who last year lost control of MGM, the Hollywood studio, was yesterday indicted in the US on criminal charges of perjury and tampering with physical evidence. The indictments were handed down by a grand jury in Delaware. The charges relate to a lengthy hearing in the Delaware chancery court while Mr Parretti and Credit Lyonnais, MGM's bank creditor, were fighting for control of the troubled Hollywood studio. Mr Parretti, who was backed by Credit Lyonnais when he acquired MGM from Mr Kirk Kerkorian in 1990, was removed from the board by the French bank last summer. The Delaware court hearing began last August and ended in a ruling against Mr Parretti last December. Last spring Credit Lyonnais formally took control of MGM in a Delaware foreclosure auction.</p>

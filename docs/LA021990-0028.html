			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : 'CUBES, PRIMITIVES IN HOLLYWOOD'S BASTION OF ATTITUDE  </P> <P> Iceland's Sugarcubes and England's Primitives are two bands noted for "attitude  problems" -- audience-baiting and aloofness, respectively. Thus were they  suited to pair up for a Friday double-bill at that steamy bastion of attitude,  the Hollywood Palladium.  </P> <P> The intricacies of the Sugarcubes' inventive sound were lost in the Palladium's  non-musical acoustics, and singer Einar Orn's thickly accented insincerity got  older faster. It didn't help that the 65-minute set was sabotaged halfway  through by the departure (from "vocal strain") of female singer Bjork  Gudmundsdottir, the yearning musical good cop to Orn's ranting bad cop. Left to  front the group alone, Orn did so as if leading a thrash band, and some of  their most popular numbers were necessarily preempted.  </P> <P> If the 'Cubes weren't quite up to their good rep, the Primitives -- who got  mediocre notices for previous club appearances -- overcame their bad one and  were actually enhanced by the hall. Their noted lack of charisma was less of a  drawback in this unintimate setting, and their simpler sound -- a Velvet  cushion with bubble-gum underneath -- filled the Palladium with a big, bouncy,  beautiful post-Blondie power-pop foam, as if new wave never went away.

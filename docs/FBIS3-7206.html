IAEA Director General Hans Blix, whose inspectors visited  North Korea from March 3 to 14, urged the Security Council to  encourage North Korea to accept a short-term inspection to  accomplish that goal.    British UN Envoy David Hannay indicated that the council  members would respond positively to Blix's recommendation,  telling reporters it remains important that the IAEA complete  its inspections as originally intended.    The members were expected to confer on a draft resolution  calling on North Korea to permit the inspections to be completed.    Blix briefed the council on North Korea's recent refusal of  inspection of a key facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex,  which he said increased suspicion of its intentions.    IAEA inspectors were denied permission to collect samples at  a radiochemical laboratory to help them determine whether  reprocessing activities occurred there, which could imply  diversion of plutonium for military use.    North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang, in a broadcast  monitored in Tokyo on Friday, blasted the IAEA for adopting a  resolution at its recent board of governors meeting referring  the issue back to the UN Security Council for actions that could  include sanctions.    Quoting from a statement issued Thursday by a spokesman for  the General Department of Nuclear Energy, it warned that if the  IAEA does not immediately retract the resolution then North  Korea "will be left with no other choice but to take practical  measures commensurate with the widening partiality of the  agency."    The statement said North Korea is under no international  legal obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections since  it now has a "special status" by virtue of its temporary  suspension of an earlier declaration of intent to withdraw from  the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    It insisted that the latest IAEA inspection "was enough to  fully confirm that nuclear materials has not been diverted."</p>

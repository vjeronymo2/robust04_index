			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow picks up as Russian worries abate Wall Street US SHARE prices finished higher across the board, with secondary stocks particularly firm, after worries about political unrest in Russia abated, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.78 at 3,547.02. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 3.25 to 456.20, while the American SE composite finished 3.20 higher at 450.29 and the Nasdaq composite 11.98 stronger at 745.54. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 289m shares. Prices rebounded from Tuesday's big losses as soon as the opening bell sounded. The early gains - the Dow rallied 15 points in the first 30 minutes  -were partly a natural reaction to the sell-off the day before, and partly a response to the news of the latest developments from Russia. The market's biggest fear, that the military would intervene to oppose President Boris Yeltsin and plunge the country into civil war, was not realised, and the widespread support for Mr Yeltsin among western nations reassured investors. The situation in Russia, however, remained uncertain, and continued to cast a shadow over trading in New York. Domestic considerations were also influencing market sentiment yesterday. President Bill Clinton was due to officially present his health care plan to the nation last night, and the drugs sector remained under pressure ahead of the speech. Among the biggest pharmaceutical stocks, Pfizer slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 60 1/2 , Bristol Myers-Squibb Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 and Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 , but Merck firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 . Primerica moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/2 in volume of 2.4m shares and Travelers edged Dollars  5/8 higher to Dollars 36 5/8 in turnover of 2.6m on news that Primerica, which already owns 27 per cent of Travelers, is negotiating a possible stock-swap merger with the insurance group. Paramount Communications remained very active, advancing Dollars 1 to Dollars 78 in volume of 4.37m shares as investors and traders continued to speculate about the takeover battle that has engulfed Paramount between Viacom, which has made an Dollars 8.2bn bid to buy the entertainment group, and QVC, which has offered Dollars 9.5bn for Paramount. QVC, quoted on the Nasdaq market, was in strong demand, climbing Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 60 in heavy dealings, while Viacom, traded on the American Stock Exchange, rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 58 7/8 . Optimism about the outlook for third-quarter earnings boosted semiconductor stocks. Texas Instruments jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 77 3/4 , Motorola added Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 94 3/4 , National Semiconductor firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 20 1/2 and Intel, on the Nasdaq market, strengthened Dollars 2 to Dollars 67 1/4 . Canada TORONTO ended mixed after active turnover. The TSE 300 index gained a net 17.6 at 3,954.9, after trading in negative territory for much of the day, but falls still led rises at the close by 394 to 321. Volume was 61.2m shares. Eleven of the 14 stock groups rose, but gold shares gave back much of Tuesday's rise, falling 2.22 per cent as the New York spot bullion price retreated USDollars 8.50 an ounce on indications that the Russian political crisis had stabilised.</p>

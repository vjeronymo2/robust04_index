			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- "Aleksey Ilyushenko remains  acting procurator-general of the Russian Federation, and Aleksey  Kazannik is not Russia's chief prosecutor," Yeltsin's aide  Georgiy Satarov told ITAR-TASS after the Federation Council  passed a resolution defying Yeltsin's decree dismissing Kazannik  from the post.    He explained that "Aleksey Kazannik is not  procurator-general  because his candidature was not presented to the Federation  Council and was not endorsed in the post in the first place."    Commenting on today's decision of the upper chamber, Satarov  said that "it was not a legal but a political decision. The  Federation Council interpreted the Constitution, which amounts  to violating it," he stressed.    According to Satarov, the situation reflects a conflict  between two standards one of which is coming to replace the  other." One was set by the president's decree 1400 appointing  Aleksey Kazannik procurator-general, and the other is set in the  Constitution, under which the procurator general must be  nominated by the president and confirmed by the Federation  Council.    According to Satarov, Boris Yeltsin accepted Kazannik's  resignation to resolve the conflict of the two norms and thus  cleared space for the new constitution."    Satarov thinks that this legal uncertainty, which arose in  the wake of the Federation Council's move today "further  complicates the struggle against crime and blocks the activity  of the procurator's office."</p>

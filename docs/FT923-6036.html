			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Refit drill The North Sea Pioneer rig is transported by the Mighty Servant 1, a semi-submersible ship, into the port of Dundee, Tayside, for structural reinforcing work at MacGregor Engineering, Bethan Hutton writes. The rig, which was operated in the North Sea by Hamilton Brothers, the US oil company, is to be used as a floating production facility by the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation off Angola. The Mighty Servant 1 is operated by Wijsmuller Transport of the Netherlands. Its main deck can be lowered under the water, allowing a rig to be moved on top. The procedure is a fairly routine one internationally but it is the first time an oil rig has entered Dundee on top of a ship rather than being towed behind one.</p>

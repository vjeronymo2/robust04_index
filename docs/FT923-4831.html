			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound rises on DM borrowing STERLING received a strong boost in the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday after the UK government announced plans to borrow Ecu10bn in foreign currencies and sell them for sterling on the currency markets, writes James Blitz. Announcing that they would borrow half of the sum in D-Marks and sell them for pounds in the next few days, the UK government pushed the currency above the DM2.80 level for the first time since the dollar fell through its all-time low two weeks ago. The news had a strong effect across the foreign exchanges, raising the US dollar against the D-Mark and sharply depressing the Italian lira. In London, sterling ended 1 1/4 pfennigs up at DM2.8000, while the dollar closed some 2 pfennigs better at DM1.4115. The Italian lira finished in London on its ERM floor against the German currency, at L765.40. In New York the dollar rose further to end at DM1.4155. Dealers said the Ecu loan committed the government to hold the pound at its current parity of DM2.95. The move will act as an alternative to boosting the UK's foreign exchange reserves by Dollars 13bn, by creating an immediate demand for sterling in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum. If the UK government supports an EMS realignment, this will entail a substantial loss on the loan because D-Marks will have been purchased at the current rate. 'Norman Lamont is putting his money where his mouth is,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London. The pound was boosted by a feeling that the government had pulled off a surprise coup. One analyst called it a 'double whammy': while the conversion of D-Marks into sterling should hold the pound above its ERM floor, the gilt market will come under less pressure because of the government's large borrowing requirement. Mr John Shepherd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities in London, said the balance of the government's strategy on the pound had changed. 'Until now, they have had the option of either devaluing or raising interest rates,' he said. 'They are now saying that their response to a No in the Maastricht referendum will be to raise rates.' Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International, believed the move has bought the government time. 'All it does is put the government in a position of borrowing money to spend its way out of the problem,' he said. The UK's move highlighted the plight of the Italian authorities, who have no scope to borrow foreign currency in the same way. Before the UK announcement, the lira was supported by intervention from both the Italian and Belgian central banks. In US dealing, it was trading well outside its ERM bands at a low of L766.50 to the D-Mark.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (7): Attractive advantages - Madeira offshore centre Madeira, set in the Atlantic 600km off Casablanca and on the same latitude as Bermuda, has been providing a haven of warmth and tranquility for North Europeans ever since the British aristocracy made the island a fashionable winter resort in the mid-18th century. Today, tourism remains the mainstay of the island's economy, accounting for more than 12 per cent of Madeira's gross regional product. But tourism has recently been joined by another, equally successful source of income: a dynamic offshore development known as the Madeira International Business Centre (IBC). Established with the help of the European Union to stimulate development, the IBC offers investors the benefits of both EU membership and a zero tax rate. Covering the full range of offshore services, Madeira provides a free-trade industrial zone, a financial centre, international services and a shipping register, all benefiting from tax and duty exemptions. The IBC was conceived as a special incentive, on top of extensive support from EU structural funds, to help the island bridge the development gap separating it from the rest of western Europe. 'Studies of other peripheral EU regions show that grants alone are simply not enough to overcome the disadvantages of insularity,' says Mr Jorge Veiga Franca, a director of the Madeira Development Company (SDM), which runs the offshore centre. This stimulus to Madeira's economy offers attractive advantages for investors. Since legislation on the offshore centre was approved in 1986, close to 1,200 companies have set up in the IBC: 38 manufacturers are operating in the free-trade zone; 32 companies, mostly bank branches, have registered with the financial centre; and 36 vessels are listed on the shipping register, known as MAR. The rest are doing business in the international services sector. Madeira's full integration into the EU is an important asset. Companies operating in Madeira benefit from the free circulation of goods, services and rights of establishment within the Community that is guaranteed to all EU enterprises. All raw materials and components imported into the industrial free-trade zone are exempt from customs duties. Duties are levied only on raw materials from third countries incorporated into finished products exported to the EU. Companies enjoy total exemption from taxes on profits and capital gains until the end of the year 2011. Officials are confident that the rate will subsequently be increased to only 5 or 10 per cent. Investors also benefit from exchange freedom, including free repatriation of capital and profits, free transfer of funds used in commercial operations and freedom to import capital. IBC officials believe they have an important edge over other offshore centres because Madeira is an integrated part of Portugal, not isolated in either economic or legislative terms. Companies setting up there enjoy the same guarantees of credibility as they would in mainland Portugal. Maintaining this image is a priority. 'We would prefer 10 good companies to 100 dubious ones,' says Mr Francisco Costa, chairman of SDM and chief architect of the IBC. The Madeira regional government opted to negotiate a concession agreement with SDM so that the IBC would be run by a private company that speaks the same business language as investors. Efforts are made to cut red tape to a minimum, with a special public deeds office set up to ease formalities. However, the IBC acknowledges that ship owners have recently encountered delays in registering vessels with MAR because of difficulties raised by a technical commission appointed by the regional and central governments. 'This is a bureaucratic issue that we expect to clear up very shortly,' said an IBC spokesman. On a more positive note, recently approved regulations make Madeira's shipping register considerably more attractive than before. To register, half a ship's crew and its captain must now be of EU nationalities where previous legislation stipulated that the same proportion of the crew had to be Portuguese. Ship owners may now chose any country whose laws they want to govern the mortgage of their vessel. Yachts are also now eligible. So far, the financial centre of the IBC has predominantly attracted Portuguese bank branches. From Madeira they can provide all the services of an overseas branch without the heavy costs of establishing a network abroad. Several important foreign banks have followed suit and legislation approved in January should make the financial centre attractive to a wider range of companies. The new law makes it possible for financial companies to set up subsidiaries in Madeira where they were previously limited to opening branches. 'This measure will broaden the appeal of the IBC,' says Mr William Cunningham, a Lisbon-based partner with consultants Arthur Andersen. 'There was little incentive for a foreign financial institution to set up a branch in Madeira if it was going to be taxed on the earnings of that branch in its home country. Now that tax can be avoided by creating a subsidiary.' The institutions now allowed to set up subsidiaries in Madeira's financial centre include banks, investment societies, leasing, factoring and higher-purchase companies, stock brokers, dealers, investment fund managers, credit card issuers, asset management, regional development, venture capital and group purchasing companies, exchange bureaux, insurance and re-insurance companies and pension funds. The new legislation also allows banks to set up international branches as well as offshore branches. Offshore branches may only do business with non-residents in Portugal or other companies in the IBC. The ability to establish international branches means that banks in Madeira can do business with Portuguese companies. They will be subjected to normal Portuguese tax laws, except that they will be able to accept deposits from non-residents in Portugal without having to withhold a 20 per cent tax on the interest paid on the deposits. 'Previously banks in the Madeira offshore centre were completely fenced off from doing business with mainland companies,' says Mr Cunningham. 'The new measure means that Portuguese banks that set up international rather than offshore branches in Madeira will be able to raise money more cheaply than in Portugal for lending on to their clients on the mainland.'</p>

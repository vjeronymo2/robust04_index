			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Fed worries on inflation fade away THE inflation scare that alarmed the US Federal Reserve earlier this year seems well and truly over. US consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent last month, following increases of 0.1 per cent in May and zero in June, the Labour Department reported yesterday. The year-on-year rate of inflation dropped to 2.8 per cent last month. Since May consumer prices have risen at an annualised rate of less than 1 per cent, meeting the practical criterion of zero inflation. From January to April consumer prices rose at an annualised rate of over 4 per cent. Wholesale price inflation is equally subdued. Producer prices fell both last month and in June and rose only 1.3 per cent in the year to July.</p>

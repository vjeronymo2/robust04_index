			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: PM 'cares' for NHS THE Prime Minister yesterday rejected a charge by Labour leader Mr Neil Kinnock that he 'couldn't care less' about the national health service. In a question time exchange, Mr Major said: 'I am personally committed to the National Health Service. I want the management of the NHS to be as efficient as medical care in the NHS.' Mr Kinnock called for an end to the 'opting out' of NHS trusts.</p>

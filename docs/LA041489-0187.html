			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMATEUR STATUS OF PIRATES' KEY PLAYER QUESTIONED  </P> <P> Andrew Gaze, who in a six-month stay at Seton Hall helped the university to the  NCAA basketball final, had $25,000 placed in a family fund by his club team in  Australia, the New York Times reported today.  </P> <P> The newspaper quoted Bruce Ward, general manager of the Melbourne Tigers, as  saying that the money was put into a trust fund over a period of six months in  1988, when the team became professional.  </P> <P> He said it had come from a fund of $362,000 established by sponsors for the  Tigers, who are coached by Gaze's father, Lindsay.  </P> <P> The newspaper quoted an official of the NCAA as saying the payments raised  questions about whether the rules on amateur status were violated. However, the  organization has not started a formal investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unaware of Funds  </P> <P> Seton Hall Coach P. J. Carlesimo said he was unaware of the money going into  the fund and Gaze himself said the money was "more like expenses."  </P> <P> Gaze, 23, enrolled at Seton Hall last October and averaged 13.6 points per game  for the Pirates on their run to the title game, which they lost 80-79 in  overtime to Michigan.  </P> <P> His three-point shooting plus his maturity and experience -- he had played for  the Australian team in the last two Olympics -- was cited as a key factor in  keeping the Pirates together and he was the MVP of the West regional.  </P> <P> Last Friday, Gaze left and returned to Melbourne, where he signed a contract  for $50,000 with the Tigers, whom he first joined as a junior 16 years ago.  </P> <P> Gaze said of the fund: "It was more like a scholarship, helping out with my  expenses more than anything else."  </P></p>

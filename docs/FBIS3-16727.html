But such talks must be preceded by an unconditional  ceasefire, Ara Saakian, first deputy chairman of the Armenian  parliament, told INTERFAX on Sunday.    Today both Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan are making  preliminary conditions, the former pressing for a ceasefire and  a certain legal status for itself, the latter demanding that  Nagorno-Karabakh withdraw its troops from Azerbaijani  territories they occupy, Saakian said.    He said Armenia "is building great hopes" on Russia's  mediation.    Meanwhile, disagreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan last  week prevented the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly meeting in  St. Petersburg from passing an appeal against the imposition of  a transport or energy blockade by one Commonwealth state against  another. Azerbaijani delegation leader Afiyaddin Dzhalilov  insisted that the appeal include a provision for a mechanism for  liberating the 20 percent of Azerbaijani lands occupied by  Nagorno-Karabakh forces and for bringing back home the more than  a million Azerbaijani refugees.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 22 (CNA) -- Pedro Noyola, Mexico's  vice minister in charge of external trade and investment  affairs, arrived in Taipei on Wednesday [22 June] at the start  of a three-day campaign to court prospective Taiwan investors.    Noyola, who has been here twice before, urged local  enterprises to use Mexico as the gateway to the North American  market.    At seminars in Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Taipei, Noyola will  brief local investors wanting to tap the North American Free  Trade area about Mexico's investment climate.    NAFTA, which also groups the United States and Canada, is  the  world's largest free-trade market.    Ten firms from Taiwan have investments worth US$10 million  in  Mexico, notably in areas bordering the United States.</p>

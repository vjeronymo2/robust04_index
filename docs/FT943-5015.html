			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Canadians buy holding in Trio Regent Pacific Group, an international financial services group which is majority-owned by Altamira Management of Toronto, said yesterday it had bought 9.1 per cent of the share capital of Trio Holdings, the UK money and securities broker. 'We are keeping an open mind about further investment,' said Ms Jayne Sutcliffe, a director of Regent Pacific in charge of corporate finance. She noted that although Regent had invested in UK investment trusts in the past, this was its first entry as a significant shareholder into an operating financial services company. She said the purchase reflected Regent's view that the UK's financial services sector had good growth prospects. Trio represented a geared play on the sector since its restructuring last year had improved its potential, she added. Mr David Hagan, Trio's chairman, said he was pleased that another institution had decided to take a material stake in the company. Fidelity is thought to be Trio's largest single shareholder with a stake of about 11 per cent, followed by Warburg Pincus with about 10 per cent. Ms Sutcliffe said the 5.08m shares in Trio were acquired in the market towards the end of last week, when the shares traded between 28p and 30p. This would put a price tag of some Pounds 1.5m on the stake. Trio's share price closed at 34p yesterday, up 2p from Friday.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Air France, Lufthansa Extend Agreements: Air France and West Germany's  Lufthansa agreed to cooperate on everything from catering to aircraft purchases  in a move designed to better prepare two of the world's biggest airlines for  the year 2000. Under the terms of the deal, each airline will maintain its  separate identity and continue to compete for most routes. But they will extend  existing cooperation agreements -- including reservation systems, aircraft  maintenance and flights to West Berlin -- to cover sales forces abroad, a new  catering unit, new long-haul and regional routes and joint negotiations with  aircraft makers.  </P></p>

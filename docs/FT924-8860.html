			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Letter: Federalism designed to confuse Sir, There are two forms of federation principle which can be applied: 1) All powers, which have not been specifically retained by individual states, automatically are transferred to the central federal organisation. 2) All powers, which have not been specifically granted to the central federal organisation, remain with the individual states. Which principle does Europe want to apply? In the interests of clarity, many years ago, the Americans opted for the former, Switzerland for the latter. From the declarations of Mr. Martin Bangermann, vice-president of the European Commission, contradicting Mr Major, it would appear that Europe has opted for neither solution, which would seem to be a solid base for current and future confusion. Gordon Paul Hediger, managing director, Custom Management, 22 Court Drive, Stanmore, Middlesex HA7 4QH</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (16): Limited scope for development - Emerging Markets THE USE of derivatives for risk management purposes may seem pretty old hat to the blue chip companies of the world's more developed countries, but for companies in some of the emerging economies it is a skill still largely in its infancy. That is not for want of sufficiently volatile conditions. Companies in developing countries are just as exposed as their western rivals - if not more so - to the vicissitudes of modern life. As companies turn away from their domestic markets and grow increasingly international, they often face the problems of fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. A company in the developing world which borrows cheaply in dollars to finance the construction of a new factory, for example, might suddenly find itself paying more than it had bargained for if the domestic currency suffers a sharp devaluation. Given the increasing integration of world markets, fluctuations in the developed world are rapidly transmitted to the developing economies. Added to these external factors, some developing countries (for example Brazil) suffer from very high inflation. Under such circumstances, companies are often forced to consider a much shorter time-frame, focusing on daily or monthly financial management rather than looking much further ahead. 'High inflation typically reduces the maturity range of available financial instruments, which limits the ability of firms to deal with currency (or interest rate) exposures beyond a short horizon,' says Mr Jack Glen, an economist at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in his recent report on risk management in developing countries*. For example, in Brazil (where the domestic capital markets are very sophisticated, offering a broad range of different instruments for managing a variety of risks) the very high inflation rate and economic uncertainty 'prevents the development of medium and long-term risk management instruments', according to Mr Glen. For the normal range of interest rate and foreign exchange risks encountered by companies in developing countries, however, it is possible to use some of the risk management techniques and instruments which have already been developed and put to use in the world's more sophisticated financial centres. So far, the extent to which these risk management methods have been employed in the emerging markets is quite limited. As Ms Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants, the US-based consultancy which monitors emerging markets, points out: 'Some of these countries barely have domestic bond markets, let alone their own derivatives markets.' Instead, companies in developing economies would tend to turn to US banks or the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, for assistance in managing their foreign exchange or interest rate exposure. 'We are seeing the increasing use of risk management instruments but it still tends to be done on a 'deal by deal' basis,' says Ms Morrissey. 'Derivatives grew in the developed world so it's only natural they should percolate to less sophisticated financial centres,' says Mr Mark Coombs, an emerging market specialist at ANZ Grindlays Bank. He points out that the use of derivatives in the emerging markets is becoming more prevalent, with an increasing emphasis on structured deals which are tailored to the needs of the individual company. 'The use of derivatives is growing across the board in the emerging markets: what you tend to see is either investor-driven deals, where the investor wants to enhance his return through leveraging, or borrower-driven deals where the borrower is trying to hedge a risk,' says Mr Coombs. The IFC has assisted companies from a wide variety of developing countries - ranging from Bolivia to Ghana - to set up currency and interest rate swaps to manage their exposure. To take one example, an Egyptian manufacturing concern which had secured low-cost yen financing to purchase Japanese equipment, suddenly found itself a victim of the appreciating yen. The company had mainly dollar revenues, so the yen's appreciation in the latter half of the 1980s meant that its financing costs soared. Each one yen decrease in the yen/dollar exchange rate cost the company an additional Dollars 300,000 annually in interest expenses. The IFC points out that for nearly three years the company was forced to accept the mismatch (of yen interest expenses and dollar revenues) because the international swap markets were effectively closed to them. Eventually, with the help of the IFC, the company entered into a currency swap that exchanged a portion of its yen financing for dollar financing. While the IFC was able to help in this instance, in many cases, companies in developing countries are denied the sort of access to risk management tools that western companies enjoy and employ. Mr Glen highlights several reasons why the use of risk management instruments may be restricted or limited, including credit considerations, regulation and the size of the transactions. 'The derivatives products markets are credit sensitive and as most long-term derivative securities involve credit risk, direct access generally is limited to companies having at least investment grade credit ratings,' he says in his report. Creditworthiness is a significant factor in pricing and access for swaps, making it difficult for developing country firms to have access to the international swap market. Without a track record or a credit rating, companies may not have access to risk management instruments. In cases where they do have access, it may only be to short-term instruments, or the conditions may stipulate the company post collateral which could make the deal more expensive. In some developing countries, domestic financial regulations which prevent the use of risk management instruments - sometimes because the authorities are concerned that the fine line between use for speculation and use for hedging purposes might be blurred. In some cases it may simply prove too costly to conduct the transaction, either because of the tax treatment or because of the rather small size of the deal itself. Given these limitations, it could be some time before the use of derivatives is as widespread in the developing countries as in the western world. * How Firms in Developing Countries Manage Risk, a discussion paper by Mr Jack Glen, published by the International Finance Corporation.</p>

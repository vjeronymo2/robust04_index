The appeal says the campaign is a mass movement of  innovation  to achieve a new victory in the work for national reunification  and all the patriotic work of Chongnyon this year, one year  before the 50th anniversary of the August 15, 1945 liberation of  Korea and the 40th anniversary of the founding of Chongnyon.    It calls for waging a grand movement to learn from the  greatness of the sagacious leader at all Chongnyon organs,  branches and families under the slogan "Let us learn from the  illustrious leader Marshal Kim Chong-il!" and for strengthening  the patriotic ranks of Koreans in Japan as ranks of people loyal  to him.    "Let us all make a tangible contribution to the  reunification  of Korea in the 1990s through the implementation of `10-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the  reunification of the country' in the patriotic spirit that `my  destiny is linked with the destiny of the country and the  nation,' actively help toward the building of socialism in the  homeland and increase the ranks of our supporters and  sympathizers among the Japanese people," the appeal stresses.</p>

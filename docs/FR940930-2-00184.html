The Applicant operates a farming enterprise in the San Joaquin Valley area of California. Agri-Bis, Inc. is related to the Applicant by common ownership. The Plans are both defined contribution plans. As of September 30, 1992, the Vaquero Farms, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan had 138 participants and total assets of approximately $4,531,364. As of January 31, 1993, the Agri-Bis, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan had 41 participants and total assets of approximately $2,039,764.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Plans acquired their interests in the Notes in June of 1989 when each Plan loaned $250,000 to Triad Pacific 1987 Investors (Triad), a California limited partnership, unrelated to the Applicant. The Notes are secured by second deeds of trust on industrial leased real property located at 192&hyph;252 West Larch Road, Tracey, California (Drew Centre) and 3008 East Hammer Lane, Stockton, California (the Pavilion). The Applicant represents that, prior to investing Plan assets in Triad, the Plans' trustees conducted a thorough investigation of the potential investment, including an examination of the properties and the financial condition of Triad. According to the Applicant, the investment was consistent with the Plans' investment policies. The Applicant represents that the Plans have invested from time to time in other deeds of trust and that they learned of this investment opportunity directly from the principals of Triad. In accordance with the terms of the Notes, the principal amount of the loans became due in June of 1993. The principal amount plus accrued interest from June 1993 remains unpaid. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In July of 1993, the borrower, Triad, filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. Union Bank, which holds a first deed of trust on the Drew Centre property securing a promissory note in the principal amount of $3,301,132, has filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay seeking to foreclose on its security interest in the Drew Centre property. Appraisals of the Drew Centre property indicate a range of values between $2,750,000 and $3,900,000. Gentra Financial, which holds a first deed of trust on the Pavilion Property securing a promissory note in the amount of $3,800,000 has also sought relief from the automatic stay to enable it to foreclose on its security interest in the Pavilion property. Appraisals of the Pavilion property indicate a range of values between $2,366,000 and $3,125,000. Consequently, the Applicant represents that the Plans are in jeopardy of losing the security for their loans. The Applicant also represents that full repayment of the loans is very unlikely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the Notes, and all decisions regarding collection on the Notes when due, are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of part 4, subtitle B, title I of the Act.

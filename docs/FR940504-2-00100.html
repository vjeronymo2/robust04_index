			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Budget_Applicants must submit a comprehensive line item budget for which specific details are available in the application packet. The Center does not pay for costs that are not directly related to the specific project being funded (e.g., indirect costs). No support will be given for the purchase or lease of capital equipment (e.g., fax machines, computers), or other related infrastructural costs. Some degree of institutional support should be reflected in the proposed project budget. Salary support must be fully justified by the specific requirements of the projects and should not represent a major portion of total project expense. Salary support should be calculated as a percentage of time spent on research for the duration of the project. It is not permissible to request support in lieu of responsibilities for university course instruction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Review Process: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Grants made through the North-South Center External Research Grant Program are awarded through a competitive review process.

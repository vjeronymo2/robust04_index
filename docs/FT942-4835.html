			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Government warned over 'unfit' housing A 'housing underclass' is being created in Britain with more than 1.5m people forced to pay rent for homes that are unfit for habitation, the Royal Institute of British Architects said yesterday. The institute called for action to alleviate the problem in a report - part of National Housing Week - and blamed lack of coherent government policy. The institute said the existence of 700,000 rented homes that were unfit for habitation was unacceptable and it warned that the longer repair work was delayed, the higher the eventual repair costs would be. It called on the government to help people seeking to improve their homes. A housing 'underclass' had been created, it warned. Most homes in the middle and top range had improved over the past few years, but those at the bottom had got worse.</p>

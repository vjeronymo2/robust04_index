			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Enron ahead by 28% Enron, the Houston-based natural gas company, reported a 28 per cent improvement in underlying net earnings in the three months to September, in spite of a sharp decline in the natural gas price compared with a year ago. Mr Kenneth Lay, chairman, said the results stemmed in part from the company's policy of 'substantially hedging our commodity price risk'. They also reflected higher profits from asset sales, which added Dollars 11.3m to after-tax profits compared with a year before. Enron reported after-tax profits of Dollars 96m on sales of Dollars 2bn, against Dollars 74.9m (before a deferred tax adjustment) on sales of Dollars 1.9bn. Earnings per share rose to 36 cents, from 30 cents in the 1993 quarter. The best earnings advance came in Enron Oil and Gas, an 80 per cent-owned subsidiary, where operating profits climbed nearly 33 per cent to Dollars 52.6m. It cut gas production by a quarter but benefited from an increase in crude oil and condensate production.</p>

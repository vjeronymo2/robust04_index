			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: French push for Japanese trade FRANCE has launched a trade promotion campaign targetted at the Japanese market, aimed at reducing its growing trade deficit with Japan, Ian Davidson reports from Paris. The campaign follows a visit to Japan by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, finance minister, which is being interpreted in France as a direct riposte to the trade promotion visit of President Bush. Mr Beregovoy sought from the Japanese government, and believed he had secured, pledges of no discrimination in favour of the US at the expense of the Europeans. Saying he was not in Japan as 'a travelling salesman', Mr Beregovoy stressed his aim of closer co-operation with Japan, and France's openness to direct investment. The French export campaign, spread over three years, aims to improve the image of French goods, promoting 12 specific sectors, including aeronautics, food, pharmaceuticals, environment and car components. France's trade deficit with Japan runs at about FFr30bn (Pounds 3bn) a year. 'This is a difficult market, but not impenetrable,' Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French foreign trade minister, said yesterday. 'Japanese imports are growing each year by 20 per cent, and we must get our share'.</p>

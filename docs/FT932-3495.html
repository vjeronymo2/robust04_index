			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Letter: Holding on to directors Sir, You may be right, overall, to urge the limiting of directors' rolling contracts to not more than 12 months ('Pay off punch', June 8), but the longer ones do have their legitimate uses. I recently pointed an accusing finger at a non-executive company chairman who had raised from three to five years the contracts for this top two executive directors. He patiently explained that he was anxious to retain the services of the two executives concerned for as long as possible as they were important to the company. There was no question, in this case, of a possible golden parachute. Walter Wright, 188 Court Road, Orpington, Kent BR6 0PY</p>

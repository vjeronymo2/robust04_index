			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Silent, windless surges from Hurricane Gabrielle far out in the Atlantic  whipped up huge waves, sweeping beach goers out to sea and capsizing boats from  Maine to New York. But by late in the day, Gabrielle's winds had weakened to 65  m.p.h. and it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Gabrielle was located 350  miles south-southwest of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, the National Hurricane  Center in Florida said. Earlier, at least six people were reported missing and  three people apparently drowned in mishaps officials said were related to the  sea swells, undertow and waves up to 15 feet high, even on some rivers. "People  shouldn't be out there," said Jarred Randall, a Narragansett, R.I., police  sergeant who rescued two teen-agers from the water.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kathy Evans report: "Radical Time-Bomb Under British </F> Islam"]    [Text] It is a wet Saturday night in Ilford's shopping  centre and groups of excited Muslim teenagers are pouring into  the town hall. The bouncers at the door, sporting Afghan caps  and urban guerrilla outfits, beam at the turnout.    The meeting, to discuss the Arab-Israel peace accord, has  been called by the most influential of Britain's new radical  Islamic groups, the Hizb-ut-Tahrir or Liberation Party.    There is only a sprinkling of whites in the audience, mostly  girlfriends and the cranks who turn up at every political  meeting going. The evening kicks off with a warning from the  platform against "the Jews, policemen and the spies present from  the Western media." All eyes turn to the Guardian reporter  sitting unveiled in the female section as the chairman says:  "Don't speak to them."    As the speeches get underway, the audience in the Essex town  hall listens with rapt attention to a rambling three-hour  outpouring of hatred of the West, Arab governments, Israel,  democracy and any form of kafr or heathen authority. The  teenagers eat every word.    "It will be better for the Jews to become Muslims if they  want to live in peace in tbe land of Muslims," says the party's  deputy leader, Farid Qassim.    In the daytime, Qassim works as a town planner, but at night  he is teaching young Muslims about their "enemies."    The Jews, he says, are the most powerful force in Britain.  "Who signed the GATT agreement for Britain? Leon Brittan, a  Jew. Who signed for the Americans? Another Jew."    The audience jump from their seats, crying God is Great and  shaking their fists.    From the female section, a gloved hand goes up. Ilford-born  Shazia, swathed in black, her face totally covered, asks how  British Muslims can show their commitment to the jihad or holy  war for which Qassim has called.    "There is no such thing as British Muslims. There are only  Muslims," he replies.    The new radical parties, of which Hizb-ut-Tahrir is the  fastest growing, are urging Britain's Muslims to think again  about the ideals which have governed their lives for three  generations. During those years, most have focused on securing  economic prosperity, a place in society, while preserving their  way of life.    Now the radical groups are arguing against integration. They  say that British Muslims are a part not of British society but  of the Islamic ummah -- or world community -- and must be fully  involved in the struggle against Western "oppression."    Officials of the Commission for Racial Equality warn that  the  radical groups are planting a time bomb under harmony between  Muslims and British society.    The radicals are conducting a two-pronged offensive. They  are challenging the managements of Britain's mosques by making  humiliating public criticisms of the local imams' sermons. And  Hizb-ut-Tahrir has taken over nearly all the Muslim student  societies at London University colleges and campuses in other  areas where Muslims form a large part of the community.    This new fervour has a distinctly Middle Eastern flavour and  has challenged the hold of Asian groups on militant circles. A  number of the new groups have direct links with radical  organisations fighting to overthrow Arab governments.    According to one liberal Muslim journalist, Ehsan Massoud of  Q News, Hizb-ut-Tahrir says Islam is the answer to all problems.  "It is very attractive to young people, this pre-packaged  Islam, particularly for those young Muslims who want to break  out of the `biraderi' (clan) politics which dominate the society  of their parents."    Their challenge to the establishment occurs at a time when  many young British Muslims are wondering about their future in a  Europe which has allowed the massacre of thousands of Bosnian  Muslims and the cancellation of Algerian democracy, and is now  enforcing what they see as an inadequate peace formula on  Palestinian Muslims. Such issues preoccupy liberals too. "We've  been here for only 30 years, but the Bosnian Muslims have been  in Europe for 500 years. They wanted to be Europeans. So what  hopes are there for my future?" asked Massoud.    Racial problems also harden support for the radical groups.  "No matter how much I want to be British, I never will be  because of my brown skin. I used to see everything as blacks  versus whites, but now I see the struggle as Muslims against  non-Muslims," said one Birmingham Muslim, a recent recruit to a  radical organisation.    A Birmingham psychiatrist, Dr Farouk Hashimi, said he  believed the radical groups were providing many young Muslims  with an identity. "Instead of rituals which they can learn at  the mosque, the radical groups function as clubs, providing  support, friendship. They give them an identity which British  society hasn't."    Islamic centres are proliferating. Most, particularly those  centred around mosques, are harmless religious study circles and  community groups, with links to local councils and British  political parties.    A recent study by Derby University turned up some 1,400  Islamic organisations operating in this country, but the  academics believe that there may be as many as 4,000.    Liberal Muslims say a climate of fear is growing in  Britain's  estimated 1,000 mosques as the fight for spiritual supremacy  between liberals and radicals intensifies. Many imams and  mosque officials say they feel besieged.    Liberal imams say that when they refuse Hizb-ut-Tahrir  permission to speak at their mosques, they become the target of  campaigns by activists.    One elderly imam from west London, who accompanied me to the  Hizb-ut-Tahrir gathering, begged me not speak to him during the  meeting.    "You will get me into trouble with them and I don't want  that," he said. "I have to deal with them in my community and I  cannot go against them. Nobody can. I'm only going to the  meeting to be seen. I don't agree with their views at all,  there's too much hate in them. But you can't fight them."    Young liberal Muslims say much of the blame for the inroads  of the radical groups must be laid on the Muslim establishment.    "They are operating the mosques as though they were still in  Karachi," complained Ehsan Massoud. "We want better educated  imams with more modern views, and more say in the management.  But they won't let us in."    One young radical described the present management  committees  of mosques as "groups of local supermarket millionaires in the  pay of Saudi Arabia."    A top demand by young Muslims is for sermons in English.  They complain that the imams imported from Pakistan and the  Middle East are often ill-qualified for the job and do not speak  English.    "I want to see the mosques more open to women. Many of the  mosques ban women, and this is a Pakistani tradition, not a  British one," Massoud said.    Young Muslims also want their mosques to operate centres,  providing advice on job problems, addiction or how to deal with  social services. Imams should function more as counsellors and  be less remote, the young Muslims say....    One suggestion is wider British training for imams. At  present, there are only two main training centres. One, in  Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, offers the same education as that  available on the Indian subcontinent. The other is the Muslim  College in Ealing, which by contrast also offers courses in  Engiish and history and training in counselling and dealing with  government departments and courts. However, most of its students  have been foreigners because no assistance is available for  British Muslims.    Another necessity, liberal Muslims say, is to establish a  Muslim version of the Board of Deputies of British Jews,  allowing the Muslim community to promote its interests with one  voice. They say the lack of such a body has allowed radicals to  corner the agenda.  <H5>  `Purify Every Inch' </H5>   The following extracts are taken from Hizb-ut-Tahrir  leaflets:    Islam forbids you and forbids any Muslim from pledging their  allegiance to America, Russia, Britain or France or any other  disbelieving country... Allah has also forbidden the believers  from taking the disbelievers as intimates and telling them their  secrets and befriending them, for these disbelievers only seek  to bring harm to the believers.    The British establishment, its Government, its institutions,  its education system, its media, will never be satisfied with us  until they take us away from our religion of Islam.    Muslims are sinful if they allow the disbelieving Jews to  continue occupying the land of Palestine. They will not be  relieved of this sin until they exterminate the Jewish authority  over it, and liberate it, as well as purifying every inch from  the filth of the occupying Jews.    The idea of a democratic society is deceptive, dangerous and  unworkable. The party considers it is haram (forbidden) to  establish or participate in parties which call for capitalism,  socialism, secularism, nationalism or any religion other than  Islam.    We are surrounded by a sea of kafr (disbelief). Kafr  thoughts, practices and kafr systems of life.    The Muslim ummah (community) has been seduced, tricked and  subverted into a disastrous friendship with the kafr, the result  of which has been the abandonment of our educational nexus for  theirs, our moral nexus for theirs, our governmental nexus for  theirs, our judiciary nexus for theirs, so that our  anthropological distinctness has been submerged and eradicated  until all that is allowed to remain is a romantic appraisal of  our Islamic past in Museums of Mankind and other Jew-designated  mortuaries of wisdom.    From an unidentified leaflet in verse, distributed outside  the Regent's Park mosque in central London: Do something to  prove that on your shoulders there stands a head not a piece of  cheese.    Throw a stone, trigger a bomb, plant a mine, hijack a plane,  do not ask how.</p>

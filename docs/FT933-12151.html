			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Arts: The Hamlet Project - Theatre Fiona Shaw has taken a group of young actors from the Abbey Theatre and made them into a fine company of Shakespeareans. The Hamlet Project grew from her workshop sessions at the Abbey last summer into a full-scale production of the play which opened at the Galway Arts Festival and will tour Ireland for the next month. It is an exciting Hamlet, demanding of both actors and audience. It runs for two and a half hours without interval in one corner of a vast, leaky munitions warehouse. Similarly large, uncomfortable and unorthodox venues have been carefully selected for the tour. Use of props is minimal, costume is present day casual, and there is no set as such. The 10 actors rely on voice, movement and energy - and Fiona Shaw's often inspired direction - to put new life into the familiar words. The opening ghost scene is lit only by candles in jam jars and, after a long mood-setting silence, is played in terrified whispers. Entrances and exits are made through the audience, usually at running pace. As the play progresses the empty spaces of the other three-quarters of the warehouse are brought into use: Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' soliloquy is sprung suddenly upon the backs of the audience; Ophelia's final scene is delivered from the top of a distant railway carriage-sized shipping container. The very absence of normal theatrical trappings becomes a virtue, leading to ever more ingenious improvisations. For example, the midnight chimes which herald the second appearance of the ghost are banged out on a cast iron pillar; a circle of rope spread on the floor becomes the players' stage. There is an authentic Elizabethan feel to such low-tech makeshift measures. Hamlet's apparent madness is signalled simply but strongly by his appearance in court naked, his body bruised and scratched: he wraps his arms in black plastic sticky tape while delivering his lines. Instead of drilling Irish voices into standard Shakespearean English, the policy seems to be to let each actor work with the accent that he or she is most at home with. It took some time to tune the ears to unexpected Irish cadences, but once in tune the diversity seemed to enhance and refreshen the verse. Jane Brennan, an unusually youthful Gertrude improves as the evening goes on, finally achieving remarkable depth of feeling. Ophelia, a small, child-like woman played by Anna Livia Ryan, raised the hair on the back of the head with her loud songs of madness, and went on to maximum pathos in the 'herb strewing scene' clad in white bra and pants with a bucket of water as her only prop. John Lynch as Hamlet looks the right age - 30 - and grew in moral stature so effectively that Horatio's words at his death - 'now cracks a noble heart' made perfect sense. Sean McGinley's Claudius - who, like the whole cast, looked as if he had been sleeping rough for the last few months - is a guilt-ridden nervous wreck from the very start. Something rotten in the state of Denmark indeed. But this Hamlet is so much a company achievement that it seems wrong to single out individual performances. This is no star vehicle but is the result of 10 dedicated actors working together to bring a reputedly difficult play alive for audiences who will include many coming across Shakespeare for the first time. This is an aggressive, hyperactive production which provides an unforgettable experience of theatre in the raw.</p>

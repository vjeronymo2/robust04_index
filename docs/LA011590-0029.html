			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE'S FOOT  </P> <P> Question: Someone once asked you how he could have gotten a case of athlete's  foot when the most strenuous thing he ever did was change the channel on his  television set. You explained that the conditions that cause athlete's foot can  affect anyone.  </P> <P> What I would like to know is why men get it more often than women. Is it  because there are more men athletes than women athletes? Or am I wrong that men  get it more often?  </P> <P> Answer: Women do appear to be less susceptible to athlete's foot, and the  reason seems to be the kinds of shoes they wear. Warmth and moisture are the  principal factors associated with the risk of developing athlete's foot. It is  these factors that account for the condition being so much more prevalent in  the summer than at other times.  </P> <P> Women, however, wear shoes that permit their feet to remain cooler and drier;  for example, wearing open-toed shoes and sandals helps keep the feet dry. Men  can accomplish the same thing by using powder on their feet and wearing  absorbent socks.  </P></p>

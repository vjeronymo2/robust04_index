			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Every Day" column by Tariq Masarwah: "Congratulations"] </F>   [Text] We would like to congratulate the U.S. Embassy in  Amman for being able, over the past 48 hours, to impose a  complete media blackout on the stand of the Jordanian observer  at the multilateral water talks held in Muscat. The Jordanians  did not know what really happened there. They only know the  bits that were broadcast by the Israeli media, which celebrated  the occasion, and the bits that were broadcast by the BBC, which  is usually interested in details such as the kinds of fish that  are threatened with extinction in Iraq's marshlands or the red  collar of General Garang in southern Sudan.    We began by announcing that we will not contribute to the  peace process so long as the siege imposed on our country  continues and we ended with sending an observer to Muscat and  with imposing a complete blackout about what happened in the  Omani capital. What happened is not far away from the  Israeli-U.S. game.    What is required now is to consolidate both the principle of  siege and negotiations. What is required now is to achieve  regional cooperation with Israel before reaching peace. What is  required is to set up a center for water studies, without  mentioning the region's water, the rights of the participant  countries, or Israel's theft of this water. What is required is  to set up a Palestinian water authority without mentioning its  powers or the extent of its responsibility for Palestine water  on the land of Palestine.    It is the same game faced by the Jordanian negotiator who  places the issue of al-Yarmuk River on the negotiating table.  Meanwhile, the Israeli negotiator pushes away the Jordanian  negotiator's figures and maps and says in a disgusting way: The  entire region needs water. So, why do we not think of big  desalination projects? Why do we not start big projects to draw  the water of the Turkish rivers Seyhan and Ceyhan ? All this  means that the al-Yarmuk River is not a subject for discussion,  that you must accept God's distribution of water, that the  Jordan Valley must depend on technology and drip irrigation,  that the Jordan River will be part of the environmental issues,  and that all these issues will be discussed within the  multilateral talks.    It is the same game. The important thing is the negotiations  -- negotiations in Washington whose objective is to hold  negotiations provided that they are secret negotiations. The  objective also is to hold many negotiations provided that they  are held in Arab capitals -- in whose hotels and streets Israeli  officials will walk freely -- and provided that the Israeli  television carry these talks live to the people who are besieged  in their houses in villages and cities in the occupied  territory, to the families of the victims of al-Aqsa and  al-Ibrahimi Mosques, to the Israeli Defense Forces, and to the  settlers who shoot indiscriminately and kill pregnant women and  children at play.    It is fine for the Jordanians not to know what their  observer  has done in Muscat while satellites bring them the latest summer  fashions from the well-known Paris fashion houses.</p>

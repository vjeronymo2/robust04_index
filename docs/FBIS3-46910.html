According to the poll, the  approval rating for the Hosokawa cabinet dropped dramatically to  55.6 percent, a 10.5-percentage change from the previous month,  while its disapproval rating has jumped to 23.4 percent, up from  13.3 percent in November. The results show that some of those  who supported the cabinet in November now disapprove of it.  This is the first time the Hosokawa cabinet, which has  maintained a high, 60 percent or more approval rating since its  inauguration in August, has seen the rate drop below 60 percent.  JIJI PRESS also surveyed approval ratings for political  parties. While the support rate for the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] has increased a little, those for most of the ruling  parties have dropped.    The nationwide poll was conducted on 12 and 13 December  among  2,000 men and women aged 20 or over. Of them, 70.1 percent  agreed to be interviewed.    The large drop in the cabinet approval rating seems to be  the  result of its failure to launch an effective pump-priming  package as well as its decision to partially open Japan's rice  market. It is possible that a question about a loan provided by  the Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery company to Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa also affected the rating.    When asked why they supported the cabinet, 18.1 percent of  respondents noted its "favorable impression," 15.5 percent said,  "the prime minister is trustworthy," and 15.3 percent said,  "there is no one better than Hosokawa to do the job of prime  minister."    Asked why they did not support the cabinet, 9.6 percent  said,  "the cabinet is incapable of meeting public expectations," and 5  percent mentioned "its poor policies." The figures are almost  double those of November.    Meanwhile, the poll shows that the LDP approval rating has  increased a little to 23 percent from 22.2 percent in November,  while support for most of the ruling parties has decreased.    The approval rating for the Social Democratic Party of Japan  has dropped from 7.4 percent to 6.6 percent; for Shinseito from  3.5 percent to 3.0 percent; for Komeito from 3.7 percent to 3.1  percent; for the Japan New Party from 7 percent to 6.2 percent;  and for the Democratic Socialist Party from 1.4 percent to 1  percent. Sakigake and the United Socialist Democratic Party are  the only parties among the ruling coalition whose support rates  have increased from 1 percent to 1.3 percent and from 0.1  percent to 0.2 percent, respectively. The approval rating for  the Japan Communist Party dropped to 1.9 percent from 2.2  percent in November.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Text] PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Amr expects  the forthcoming summit between Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz  al-Asad to produce positive results on all tracks of the peace  process, particularly on the Palestinian track.    In a statement to AL-RA'Y, 'Amr emphasized the importance of  Arab coordination to face the challenges of this stage,  particularly before this important meeting.    'Amr also said the PLO will sign an economic agreement with  the Egyptian Government within the next few days, and expected  that PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi, or Pan-Arab  Department head Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, will sign this  agreement in Cairo.    He said the signing of economic agreements between Palestine  and its Arab neighbors is affirmation of its inseparable links  with the Arab nation. He emphasized that the signing of the  Palestinian-Jordanian economic agreement, and then the  Palestinian-Egyptian economic agreement is evidence of the  desire of the PLO and the Palestinian people to eliminate the  Israeli economic hegemony after 26 years of occupation.    'Amr said the Palestinian objective out of signing such  economic agreements is not to gain profits, but to entrench a  line that the Palestinian people have been following for  centuries, which is that they are an inseparable part of their  Arab nation and Arab homeland.    He stressed that concluding this economic agreement between  Palestine and Egypt is very important due to the past links  between the Gaza Strip and the Egyptian Government, especially  after the occupation of Palestine in 1948.    In an answer to a question, 'Amr said the Egyptian pound  will  not be the main currency [in the self-rule areas], and said  Palestinian technical committees will organize all issues  included in this agreement.</p>

"In Cairo, Foreign Minister Peres and Yasir 'Arafat  announced  an agreement on self-rule and on the terms of withdrawal from  Gaza and Jericho," Clinton told the World Jewish Congress.    "I think another big milestone has been achieved today," he  said.    The negotiations in Cairo were designed to implement the  historic accord signed in Washington last September and setting  December 13, 1993, for the military pullout of Israel, which  balked at negotiations over details of the plan for weeks.    Clinton said that the U.S. approach is to ensure the  successful implementation of the declaration of principles and  will show the Israelis that the agreement can not only enhance  their security but provide a self-government for their  Palestinian neighbors.    Meanwhile, he described the U.S. commitment to maintaining  and enhancing the security of Israel as "ironclad" and a  precondition for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.    "To achieve our goal of a comprehensive settlement," Clinton  stressed, "we insist that the Arab boycott of Israel end now."</p>

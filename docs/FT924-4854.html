			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Study finds fault with bank loan covenants BRITISH BANKERS may have shown financial naivety when setting conditions for loans with companies, an academic study suggests. The current definitions in loan agreements between companies and banks of ratios such as minimum net worth, interest cover or gearing are open to widespread manipulation, the study found. The conclusions come in an analysis of bank loan covenants by Mr David Citron, a lecturer in accounting at City University Business School in London. Most banks attempt to safeguard their loans with performance linked to key financial ratios, yet while the definitions are legally watertight most leave enormous scope for creative accounting by managers determined not to breach these ratios. Bankers appear to have relied too much on their lawyers and not enough on their accountants. In a survey of 29 leading lending institutions, Mr Citron found that for loans over Pounds 1m more than two-thirds have financial ratio covenants, rising to an even greater proportion for unsecured loans or for those to companies with high gearing. In a separate analysis of 25 bank loan contracts and 13 contract templates, he found few of the ratios were directly linked to performance. The most common were minimum net worth, interest cover and gearing. On the definition of profit, he says: 'There is little evidence that contracts attempt to adjust for accounting procedures that are particularly susceptible to management discretion.' Overall, he concludes: 'Some items are accepted as presented in the accounts, thus leaving some scope for manoeuvre through a choice of appropriate accounting methods.' While some of the accounting ratios are more tightly defined with less scope for abuse - such as assets - many measures are based on profits and so remain open to manipulation. Off-balance sheet finance is typically not considered, because most of the ratios only specify the ratios in relation to the consolidated accounts of a company.

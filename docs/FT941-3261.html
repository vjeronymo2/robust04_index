			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / China takes one step back on prices: But new curbs do not mean the end of steps forward Chinese officials may not have hit the panic button over inflation, but measures adopted this week to slow price increases reveal a deepening concern. Mr Zhu Rongji, China's vice-premier in charge of the economy, spoke of the dangers of a 'domino effect' of price rises that might threaten the government's entire economic reform programme. Western economists in Beijing see the steps taken to control prices of some 20 items, including basic commodities and services, as recognition that measures such as curbs in money supply growth and credit restrictions were not enough to deal with an inflationary spiral. But equally they do not view the new steps as an abandonment of the government's liberalisation programme under which prices of about 90 per cent of consumer items and basic commodities in the market have been de-regulated. 'They must realise,' said a World Bank economist, 'that price control never succeeds in the end.' For the moment, however, because of the disorderly state of China's markets during its economic transformation, economists believe intervention is justified. 'The national unified, open, orderly and competitive market system has yet to shape up,' wrote an official of the State Planning Commission in an internal memo recently. 'Market infrastructure lags behind . . . . Monopoly, cheating, unbridled pushing up prices and unauthorised levying of administrative charges (are all contributing to inflation)'. Officials have been under enormous pressure on prices. Painful reforms of state enterprises - a number are simply being allowed to wither on the vine  -are causing hardship for thousands of workers who have lost jobs or are working part-time on reduced wages. Mr Zhu, in an unusually candid address to delegates at the current session of the National People's Congress, blamed price rises mainly on speculation. He also warned that wages have 'spun out of control'. The cost of living (COL) in China's 35 main urban centres rose by 23.3 per cent in January compared with the same period last year, and inflationary pressures, especially in the potentially volatile cities, show little sign of easing. More worrying perhaps for the government than the COL increase (the COL index includes services whose costs have been rising sharply) were signs that the retail price index was also rising fast. The index, which is heavily weighted towards food and clothing, soared to 19 per cent in December 1993 compared with a year earlier. The average annual increase in 1993 was 13 per cent, more than double that in 1992. Western economists are predicting that retail prices will rise 15 per cent for the first quarter this year, making the year's target of 10 per cent virtually unattainable. Mr Zhu also warned that unchecked price increases were making worse the difficulties of faltering state enterprises which were in danger of being 'strangled' by the 'debt chain', the inability of struggling enterprises to pay each other for raw materials or finished products. He appeared to foreshadow a 'carrot and stick' approach to public sector indebtedness, saying that while banks had set aside funds to write-off public sector debts, a new bankruptcy law which comes into effect this year will be applied rigorously to hopeless cases. It is debatable, however, whether, given the political sensitivities involved, that even the redoubtable Mr Zhu has the nerve to follow through on this threat. Among measures outlined by Mr Zhu to curb inflation and to calm the economy, which grew by more than 13 per cent last year, were a further clamp on capital construction; reforms of the grain supply system; a freeze on fertiliser price increases; and controls on prices of basic items. He also called for a halt to the phasing out of subsidies to public utilities such as gas and electricity. Mr Zhu singled out vegetable prices as the key to damping down inflation, and blamed the property boom for cutting into arable land near the cities. Western economists also point out that a shortage of vegetable retail outlets in the larger cities has led to disorderly pricing. There was, for example, a 50 per cent difference between wholesale and retail prices in many cases. A World Bank official says that China is still paying the price in terms of 'cost-push' inflation for the construction binge of early last year that saw increases of between 50 and 70 per cent in the prices of raw materials such as cement and steel. The bad news for Mr Zhu and long-suffering Chinese consumers is that inflationary pressures are likely to persist through the middle of the year. The slightly better news is that some economists are forecasting an easing of these pressures in the second half. See Editorial Comment</p>

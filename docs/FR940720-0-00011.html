			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, the NRC recognizes that its fee rule including this policy could result in a disproportionate allocation of costs to a licensee in unusual situations. Exemptions for such unusual circumstances are provided for in 10 CFR 171.11(d) and are supported by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allied-Signal v. NRC.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC concludes that the issues raised by Allied-Signal regarding a disproportionate allocation of the budgeted costs to them, as a result of the elimination of Sequoyah Fuels from the fee base, falls within the confines of an unusual situation. Therefore, the NRC will consider Allied-Signal's comments regarding NRC's allocation of costs to them as an exemption request under 10 CFR 171.11(d). The Commission will issue a decision on this exemption request in the near future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the response in item 3(a), the NRC recognized that there will be adverse impacts on licensees as a result of implementing OBRA&hyph;90. The NRC has concluded after notice and comment rulemaking that it would not be appropriate to consider licensees' ability to pass through costs in establishing its fee schedules, an approach now recommended by Allied-Signal. As stated in the decision to reinstate the exemption from annual fees for nonprofit educational institutions, ability to pay is not a basis for an exemption (59 FR 12539). No one sought judicial review of that decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission disagrees with Allied-Signal's suggestion that it be placed in the uranium recovery fee category rather than that reserved for fuel facilities, where it is currently located. The NRC includes the regulatory costs for UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conversion facilities in the fuel facility class of licensees. In developing the FY 1994 annual fees the NRC followed the established budget structure. This permitted the NRC to more readily identify and allocate generic and other regulatory costs to a class of licensees, and allowed the NRC to explain and to show the origin of these costs upon public examination of the record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conversion facilities are included in the same class as fuel fabrication facilities for budgeting purposes, the annual fee is based on the NRC's costs attributable to the UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conversion facility subclass of licensees. For example, generic safety and safeguards and other regulatory costs are included in the budgeted costs for the fuel facilities class of licensees. However, none of the safeguards costs are included in the annual fee for the UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conversion facility subclass since none of these costs are attributable to this subclass. Thus, the costs included in the annual fee for the UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  subclass of licensees are those budgeted costs attributable to the subclass. These costs, and the resulting annual fee, would be the same independent of where they are included in the budget. Therefore, even if the UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conversion facilities are more akin to uranium recovery facilities, the budgeted costs attributable to them result in a different annual fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC further notes that the NRC's costs of promulgating regulations for a type of licensee do not necessarily decrease when the number of licenses in a class goes down. Whether a class of licensees is comprised of one licensee or one hundred, generic safety concerns may well remain the same, and the same research and regulations are necessary. This is what distinguishes the annual fee from the 10 CFR Part 170 fees, which are charged to recapture costs for specific services such as inspections and license amendments. By its very nature the annual fee is levied to recover the costs of providing services, such as the development of new regulations, that cannot be attributed to a specific licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC does recognize the strain this policy unavoidably places on licensees who become, as Allied-Signal has, the single licensee in their class or subclass. The NRC will be reviewing this problem along with others associated with classification of fuel facilities. Any changes resulting from this review will be included in the FY 1995 proposed rule for notice and public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

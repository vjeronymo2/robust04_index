			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / US-German aid package for Ukraine blocked The UK and France are blocking a joint US-German effort to mount an international financial aid package to encourage economic reform in Ukraine. The stand-off is creating further tensions in the trans-atlantic alliance following US criticism of the European Union's efforts to stabilise eastern Europe and former Yugoslavia. Ukraine is expected to be discussed informally at today's meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, but the decisive meeting will take place among finance ministers a week later, just before the European Council summit in Essen on December 9.

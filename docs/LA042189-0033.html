			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: DINING IN THE EYE OF THE STORM AT TULIPE  </P> <P> Open kitchens are all the rage these days. Trouble is, most of them are so  separated from the dining room that you really don't see very much. Tulipe is  different; this new restaurant on the site of the old Ma Maison, 8360 Melrose  Ave., (213) 655-7400, puts you right into the center of the action. And there  you can watch two accomplished chefs, Roland Gibert and Maurice Peguet, as they  cook up a storm in their new restaurant.  </P> <P> And they are doing some pretty exciting stuff: Ravioli made of duck ham and  snails in a bright green parsley coulis. Smoked salmon on a bed of sauerkraut.  Wild mushrooms served with fava beans. A wonderful pastry of blue cheese and  pears. And these are just for starters. The entrees, such as grilled scallops  on a bed of caramelized shallots, are equally interesting.  </P> <P> The room itself is bright, loud and rather plain: all the romance is on the  plate. But prices, for food of this quality, are also on the plain side:  appetizers are $4.50-$9 and entrees $14-$19. Two careful people could eat a  three-course dinner for $50 (food only).

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRENZY STIRRED UP OVER MEDFLY SPRAYING IS SCARY  </P> <P> I wonder what would have happened if we had had the equivalent of our current  crop of "Medfly worriers" shouting from the rooftops when the vaccines for  infantile paralysis, measles and diphtheria, to name a few, were developed and  given to the public.  </P> <P> I've lived and raised a family through these scourges, and to the best of my  knowledge, there have been no side effects of any consequence to any and all  without any of the side noise of unsubstantiated and imagined claims we have to  listen to today from a host of lay people and vote-hungry and attention-seeking  politicians.  </P> <P> I'm satisfied that the health department scientists today are just as competent  and concerned about public health, if not more so, as they were when the above  cures were developed.  </P> <P> Come on now, you politicians. It appears that we need a cause. Why don't you  whip up the fire to get an inner- and inter-urban transit system for Orange  County and Los Angeles that makes some sense, or is that too big?  </P> <P> DICK OSTERLIND  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

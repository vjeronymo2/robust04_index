			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> REDS END SCORELESS STREAK IN FOURTH INNING, SNAP LOSING STRING IN 10TH  </P> <P> Breaking their scoreless streak was relatively easy for the Reds Saturday at  Cincinnati; ending their losing streak was a little more difficult.  </P> <P> It took extra innings, but when Paul O'Neill singled home Kal Daniels in the  10th, the Reds had a hard-earned, 5-4 victory over the Houston Astros.  </P> <P> The Reds, shut out in three consecutive games, extended their string of  scoreless innings to 30 before Eric Davis hit a sacrifice fly in the fourth  inning. The major league record for consecutive scoreless innings is 48, set by  the Philadelphia Athletics in 1906 and tied by Chicago Cubs in 1968.  </P> <P> The crowd of 31,073 gave the Reds a standing ovation when they finally scored.  It had been 38 years since the Reds were shut out in three consecutive games.  </P> <P> Davis gave the Reds a 4-2 lead in the sixth inning with his fourth home run of  the season. But reliever Kent Tekulve couldn't hold it, as the Astros tied it  in the seventh.  </P> <P> In the 10th, the Reds loaded the bases on walks, two of them intentional. With  one out, Daniels walked. Danny Darwin balked, and Davis was walked  intentionally. After making a wild pitch, Darwin also walked Benzinger  intentionally, bringing up O'Neill, who singled to left.  </P> <P> "I balked," Darwin admitted. "There was no reason to balk, especially on a  pitchout.  </P> <P> "I was trying to strike out O'Neill. I guess he had a hit coming, because he  had hit rifle shots for three outs."  </P> <P> The Reds, who got six hits, have only 19 in their last 36 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> New York 3, Chicago 1 -- Sid Fernandez was so tired of hearing about being fat,  he shed 20 pounds.  </P> <P> If he had known how much it would improve his pitching, Fernandez, who improved  to 2-0 with this victory at New York, would have trimmed down long ago.  </P> <P> When Ryne Sandberg opened the ninth with a single, it was the fourth hit given  up by Fernandez. Roger McDowell gave up another hit, but held on for the save.  </P> <P> "The nagging was getting to me," said Fernandez, who now weighs about 230  pounds. "I wasn't feeling good about myself. I didn't do anything drastic to  knock off the pounds. I just ran a lot and rode the bicycle. Now, I'm going to  keep it off. That gives me stamina."  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Plagued by injuries and lack of hitting,  nothing comes easy for the Pirates these days.  </P> <P> They had to call on workhorse Jeff Robinson again to get the victory. Robinson,  formerly the setup man for Jim Gott, has been the finisher since Gott was  injured.  </P> <P> Robinson entered the game in the eighth. His first pitch was wild, allowing the  go-ahead run to score. The Pirates scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth  and staggered to the victory.  </P> <P> Robinson has two wins and four saves for a team that only has seven victories.  </P> <P> The Phillies had 14 hits, three by Tommy Herr, but left 15 runners on base.  </P> <P> St. Louis 5, Montreal 2 -- Although three of their starters are on the disabled  list, the Cardinals continue to get outstanding pitching.  </P> <P> Scott Terry gave up just five hits to improve his record to 2-1. Friday night,  Jose DeLeon pitched a two-hitter in a 1-0 win over the Expos.  </P> <P> Terry Pendleton drove in three runs for the Cardinals, and former Dodger Pedro  Guerrero doubled in another. The 18th run batted in this month tied Guerrero's  career high for a month.  </P> <P> The Expos have lost their last five games at Busch Stadium.  </P> <P> Atlanta 5, San Diego 1 -- John Smoltz got too pumped up at Atlanta and failed  to complete his third victory in four decisions.  </P> <P> Smoltz worked out of a jam in the eighth inning when Dion James made a leaping  catch against the fence with two runners on.  </P> <P> "Smoltz did a great job," Atlanta Manager Russ Nixon said. "He got so hyper in  the eighth inning that we decided he'd had enough." DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The ninth round of Russian-Moldovan talks on the  withdrawal of Russian troops from the republic is taking place  in Moscow today.    [Unidentified correspondent] Diplomats and military men from  the two states are discussing clauses in the basic agreement on  the legal status of, procedure for, and scheduling of the  withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the Republic  of Moldova, as well as six attached agreements. According to  the agreement, Russia will withdraw all its 50 units and  formations, the core of which is the 14th Army, in addition to  the 15 military units already withdrawn since November 1992.  The troops' withdrawal should, according to the Russian  delegation's proposal, be synchronized with political settlement  of the Dniester conflict. This proposal met no objection from  the Moldovan delegation.    The main role in settlement of the conflict is, naturally,  being given to the Moldovan and Dniester sides. Experts have  effectively completed the talks on the handover of the remaining  property to Moldova and on Moldova's participation in building  housing for Russian officers, warrant officers, and their  families. In essence, agreement remained to be achieved on just  one issue:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified Russian officer, in  progress]  ...to determine the precise schedule for the withdrawal of our  troops -- either a calendar schedule, by some date or other, or  an overall one, over a specific period. We are now proposing a  period of three years.    [Unidentified civilian] On this, we politicians should heed  the view of the military, who decide the organizational and  tactical processes, the scheduling, and so on. I think we'll  find a compromise even on such a difficult issue. [end recording]    [Correspondent] The progress of the talks is giving rise to  hopes that the package of documents could be agreed tomorrow at  the expert level and passed to the governments for  consideration.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WEEK: A CALL FOR PEACE IN THE WAR OF THE SEXES  </P> <P> "Over the last 10 to 15 years, I've observed a guerrilla warfare breaking out  between men and women," declared John Herman Shaner, whose staging of his "The  War Against Women" opens June 27 at the Matrix. "The play is an effort to try  to understand that epidemic of violence. In the age of Freud, we said, 'These  men are sick -- aberrations.' Well, I interviewed a lot of them, and let me  tell you, they don't look very sick. They're functioning just fine in society."  </P> <P> The playwright sighed. "What I'm trying to do is explore those issues in an  agitprop, Brechtian way -- heavy with symbols, not realism." The story is set  in a karate dojo (studio), guided by a mysterious sensei(teacher). "Whether  she's real or unreal we're not sure: she is an ideologue, has a very strong,  radical-feminist point of view," Shaner said. "The War Against Women" revolves  around a couple whose marriage is unraveling, and a younger unmarried couple  "facing the problems of being upwardly mobile, working, and trying to work on a  relationship," he said.  </P> <P> Shaner, whose "After Crystal Night" played at the Melrose Theatre in '84, has  also peopled his theatrical landscape with a variety of ethnic types, "generic  representations of American society, the people who populate its terrain." He  includes himself in his investigation: "I have mixed feelings about feminism.  On one hand, it's a thousand years late in coming. But the downside is the  terrible price we're paying for it now. This play is a call for peace,  rapprochement. Let this war of the sexes end."  </P> <P> On another, smaller front, director Charles Marowitz, who had been working with  Shaner on "War" for the past three years, left the show after three weeks of  rehearsal, and was replaced by Shaner himself. Marowitz insists his departure  from the project was amiable. "It was sort of a sad situation," noted the  former Herald-Examiner theater critic and Los Angeles Theatre Center  dramaturge. "I just wasn't able to do what I wanted. The normal cuts and  changes I would have made, John resisted. I felt the most honorable, sensible  thing was to withdraw -- and let him get on with it."  </P> <P> THEATER BUZZ: From the missing music department: we were wondering what  happened to the strains of Joe Cocker singing "You Are So Beautiful to Me,"  which underscored a heart-tugging scene between father and daughter in Israel  Horovitz's "Strong-Man's Weak Child" (at Los Angeles Theatre Center). Following  multiple critical barbs aimed at the weepy musical choice, Horovitz cut the  song, replied a theater rep, confirming that Horovitz has been fiddling with  the play since its opening.  </P> <P> Speaking of "Strong-Man," we also had to wonder if the play's dueling  weight-lifters (Nick Mancuso and Don Yesso) are really hefting 580-pound  barbells on stage. It certainly looks real. But the clanking of metal and  accompanying grunts and groans are only partially genuine, admits the rep.  "When they add weights, one's real, the other two are made of wood. So they're  acting to an extent. But not entirely acting."  </P></p>

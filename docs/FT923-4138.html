			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, The Netherlands (6): Cautious conservatives - Profiles of New chiefs take over at ING Group and ABN Amro TWO years after the mergers that gave rise to the creation of the two biggest financial holding companies in the Netherlands, new men are taking over at the top of ABN Amro and Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING Group). Mr Robertus Hazelhoff, 61, in charge at ABN Amro, and Mr Willem Scherpenhuijsen Rom, the 59-year-old banker who heads up ING Group, are both typical of the cautious and conservative approach that runs through the Dutch financial sector. The changes in command at ABN Amro and ING Group symbolise the start of the second phase of both mergers. The men who held the chairmanships in the first phase have now retired according to schedule, leaving their successors and former seconds-in-command to fine-tune the two biggest corporate tie-ups in Dutch history. At ING, a further step in creating a new corporate entity is scheduled to take place tomorrow when NMB Bank - one of the constituent parts of the banking and insurance merger and well known overseas for its leading role in the trading of Third World debt - changes its name to ING Bank. In a market increasingly vulnerable to competition from Europe, defensive considerations were uppermost in the thinking behind the mergers of ABN and Amro on the one hand and Nationale-Nederlanden and NMB Postbank on the other. The sort of cost savings potentially available through cuts in branch networks which persuaded the UK's Lloyds Bank to bid for Midland Bank earlier this year do not figure prominently in the strategic perspectives of either Mr Hazelhoff or Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom. Neither merger was motivated primarily by cost-cutting considerations. At ING, the desire to bring together banking and insurance sprang from the dual attractions of using the bank's outlets to sell insurance and of encouraging insurance agents to sell banking products. At ABN Amro, the goal was to combine both banks' domestic strengths to focus on retail and corporate business at home and to concentrate on trade finance, capital markets and private banking abroad. Early talk of ABN Amro's ambitions as a 'global player' raised investor worries about a string of rapid, big, international acquisitions, but the pace of expansion has been moderate, in keeping with innate Dutch caution. 'The worst thing a bank can do is to be fashionable,' says Mr Hazelhoff, glancing up towards the portrait of King Willem I, who founded the forerunner of ABN Bank in the beginning of the 19th century. 'He's glancing over my shoulder and telling me not to do stupid things.' But although they are both averse to taking risk, the two men differ sharply over the 'allfinanz' principle, which has been a key element of the ING merger and has also stimulated co-operation between other Dutch banks and insurers. Predictably, Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom is a firm fan. He cites the financing of a big urban development scheme in Rotterdam and tunnel projects in other parts of the country as examples of contracts that NMB Postbank might not have won had it not been linked to Nationale-Nederlanden, the Netherlands' biggest insurer. Moves to reduce costs are also beginning to bear fruit. The group is half way towards achieving its goal of realising cost savings of Fl 100m a year. And after a slow beginning Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom is hopeful that by accessing the loyal customer base of Postbank and NMB the group can boost sales of both life and general insurance policies. Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom dismisses suggestions that banks and insurance companies are entirely separate businesses which cannot be managed adequately if they are part of the same organisation. 'Look at the number of conglomerates in the world. This is simply another example in the financial services industry. There are as many differences within the banking sector as between banks and insurance companies.' Although ABN Amro plans to set up its own life assurance subsidiary to sell life policies via its own branch network, Mr Hazelhoff is a firm opponent of any broader deal which would involve him in general insurance business. 'There is a difference between an insurer and a bank. I'm not interested at all in non-life business. All that I have seen in the last 10 years is four bad years and one good year and then the same all over again. They compete so strongly with each other. One thing or another - if it is not hurricane Hugo, it's agent orange or asbestos. 'There is more in it for insurance companies than for banks. The advantages for us are questionable. Perhaps it gives us access to long-term money. It could bring a certain amount of securities trading.' Moreover, as a broker, ABN Amro already distributes the products of several insurance companies from whom it earns commission income on insurance sales. By linking with one insurance company, the bank could damage this network. Through pure coincidence, the changes in command at ABN Amro and ING took place within six weeks of each other this summer upon the scheduled retirement of both companies' chairmen. But the sense of transition in the upper echelons of the Dutch financial world was strengthened by the fact that Mr Guus Zoutendijk, the chairman of Delta Lloyd, the big Dutch insurer owned by Commercial Union of the UK, also retired at about the same time and handed over the reins to his successor, Mr Hans-Eric Jansen. It would be wrong to place too much emphasis on the arrival of a new chairman at either ABN Amro or ING. Both Mr Hazelhoff and Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom served as vice-chairmen in the first phase of their respective companies' merger, and the emphasis in both cases is on continuity rather than on change. However, because of ING's hybrid banking-and-insurance composition, it is natural that people in the group's insurance arm will need to take a bit of time getting used to the idea of the top man being a career banker rather than an insurance executive. This is all the more so because Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom, a former army officer and a chartered accountant by training, succeeded Mr Jaap van Rijn, the gregarious former chairman of Nationale Nederlanden who for many years was the public face of the Dutch insurance industry. At ABN Amro, the transition is, at first glance, more straightforward. The merger between ABN and Amro brought together the country's two most senior bankers, Mr Roelof Nelissen of Amro and Mr Hazelhoff, who headed ABN, into a single management team. Mr Nelissen, a former politician and finance minister, retired as chairman in May, leaving the job to Mr Hazelhoff, whose demeanour and fondness for pipes leave the impression of a congenial classics professor rather than that of the country's most powerful banker. As they take their merged companies forward, Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom and Mr Hazelhoff will literally be able to keep an eye on each other's progress. ABN Amro has recently announced that its new head office is to be built in the Amsterdam neighbourhood of Buitenveldert, across the road and across the railroad tracks from ING's new offices which are currently under construction next to the city's World Trade Centre.</p>

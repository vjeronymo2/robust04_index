			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (24): Small fish in a big pond - How business houses are achieving an international presence THEY are just minnows in a global pond. Yet they are not insignificant. They do not possess the financial muscle of American and Japanese multinationals, but they are chiselling out an international presence. Forty-five years after independence, Indian business houses are dipping their toes into unfamiliar waters. Leading the charge is RPG Enterprises, India's sixth biggest business house. The Bombay-based group is building a Rs120m car tyre plant in Sri Lanka. It is scheduled to go into commercial production by the end of the year. 'Once full production is reached, we expect annual sales to be Rs300m,' says Mr Harsh Goenka, the youthful chairman of RPG Enterprises. Government-run companies are not far behind the private sector. The Baroda-based Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL) wants to set up a Dollars 200m, 100,000 tonnes a year acrylonitrile plant in Yambu, on the western coast of Saudi Arabia. According to Mr Hasmukh Shah, IPCL chairman, the engineering phase 'will commence after August'. Other important projects include a Rs35bn oil refinery at Jebel Ali in Dubai by the Bombay-based Ambani group and a Rs7.4bn rayon grade pulp plant in Indonesia by the Delhi-based Thapar group. Meanwhile, a handful of Indian business houses already runs significant international operations. Singapore-based Mr Rajan Pillai, head of a Rs12bn bread and biscuit empire, controls New Zealand's biggest biscuit company. Mr P. K. Mittal, head of the Rs13bn Calcutta-based Ispat group, runs the largest steel mill complex in Indonesia's private sector. In Malaysia, Bombay-based Mr Aditya Birla operates one of the world's largest palm oil refining plants. From Essex, Mr Vijay Mallya supervises 17 manufacturing units, spanning 18 countries, which generate revenue of Rs18.65bn. This surge of international activity among Indian business houses coincides with an awakening realisation among foreign companies of India's attractiveness as a large consumer market and as a potential manufacturing base. There are several reasons why Indian businessmen have chosen to come out of their shells at this point of time. First of all, Indian technology appears to be coming of age. RPG's Enterprises's Sri Lanka project is a case in point. Within India, all the six major tyre companies have been established with help from global leaders such as Dunlop, Pirelli and Intercontinental. The RPG project, however, is based solely on technology provided by Ceat, a RPG Enterprises-run company in which the Goenka family holds a 40 per cent equity interest and Italy's Ceat owns 10 per cent. For some businessmen, the motivation seems to be a need for international recognition. In India they may be powerful players, but they want to be more than just big fish in a small pond. As Mr Mallya puts it: 'We want to be a large international group based in India, operating a broad spectrum of businesses in association with the world leaders.' Mr Shah of IPCL echoes this sentiment. 'While the new economic policies place a premium on export-led growth, IPCL believes that the mission is much larger in dimension. We should aim at international forays to emerge as a force to reckon with in the petrochemical industry worldwide.' Before that happens, the government will have to ease the cumbersome controls on Indian investments abroad. Aware of the bottlenecks, the government is now actively considering granting automatic clearances for Indian companies planning to invest in overseas joint ventures or wholly-owned subsidiaries. Procedures for granting approvals to the appointments of Indians on the boards of overseas companies in which investments may also be relaxed shortly. Combined with the imminent free convertibility of the rupee, these should further stimulate Indian groups to go global. Despite the enthusiasm of Indian businessmen, so far the dip into international waters has been rather timid. Most lean on local partners for expertise and funds. IPCL's acrylonitrile plant is being set up in collaboration with the Alujain Corporation, part of the Saudi Arabian Xenel group. Mr Pillai's Britannia Brands is a joint venture with BSN, the French food conglomerate. The Thapars are setting up their pulp plant with P. T. Risjadson Holding and Investment of Indonesia. Financially, also, most of the new ventures tend to start off small. RPG's Sri Lankan foray, for example, is extremely modest. At Rs120m, it is a mere drop in the ocean compared to the Rs30bn which the Goenkas propose to invest on projects in India. Of this, Rs4.5bn is earmarked for expanding their Indian tyre interests. Mr Birla's international adventures started equally bashfully. 'By the late 1960s, I started feeling that south-east Asia would be a good place to be in. I began with a very small textile unit. I think the initial outlay was not even Rs10m,' he recalls. This 12,000-spindle textile plant in Thailand became the take-off point for a multi-location, multi-product group of 11 companies whose combined sales are currently Dollars 730m. Within India, Mr Birla's group sales are Rs54bn. Despite their export growth, until recently Indian business houses were unable to break out of their Asian boundaries. That is rapidly changing, with India's diamond merchants setting the pace. Their manufacturing outlets are in Surat and Bombay, but they buy diamonds from London and Antwerp and export them to New York and Hong Kong. Industry experts say that three Indian diamond firms (Rosy Blue, Jayem and Vijaydiamond) tower over the rest. Not only are their sales higher (roughly Dollars 200m each), but they differ from hundreds of run-of-the-mill diamond merchants because they operate cutting and polishing plants in several countries besides India. Mr Dilip Mehta of Rosy Blue has factories in Belgium, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Israel besides India. Mr Vijay Shah (Vijaydiamond) has plants in the Philippines and Thailand besides offices in Bombay, Israel, Antwerp, Hong Kong and New York. Though both maintain manufacturing ties with Surat, Mr Madhu Mehta of Jayem now largely operates out of Antwerp and Thailand. Does all this point to the birth of India Inc? It is too early to say. Nonetheless, today's willingness of Indian business houses to look out of India and into the world's windows reveals growing confidence and maturity.</p>

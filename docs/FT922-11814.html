			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Class divide still rules some company canteens THREE OUT of 10 companies with canteens still divide workers from bosses at mealtimes, according to a survey published today. It is called the 'multi-status dining operation' in the catering trade although others might describe it as another example of the British obsession with class. Companies offer traditional canteen fare in basic surroundings for the manual workers; staff restaurants for white-collar workers; and dining rooms for the high-ups. Trade journal Caterer and Hotelkeeper - which commissioned the study along with Touche Ross, the management consultants - believes the practice is quintessentially British. In most Japanese or American companies, all employees eat in one room, the study points out. The survey, which criticises the multi-status operation, examined the catering policies of 200 of the UK's largest companies and talked to 2,000 employees. It says: 'As well as being more expensive, multi-status is frowned upon by management philosophies as being at the root of the 'them and us' syndrome.' However, the survey finds common ground between the classes in the food consumed. There is a continuing attachment to chips across all divisions, with 80 per cent of employees saying they should remain on the menu. Healthy eating seems to be making some impact on desserts: fresh fruit salad and yoghurt are popular, although syrup sponge has a strong following. Most employers expect to subsidise catering or at the least break even - although 16 per cent make a profit out of the operation. There is little sign that companies are cutting catering expenditure because of the recession. The study concludes: 'Perhaps the reasons for the survival of staff restaurants virtually intact is that parent companies want to maintain workforce morale during periods of redundancies or other severe money-saving schemes. Many firms take the view it is better to keep those unaffected by redundancies sweet and maintain their subsidised employee-feeding package.'</p>

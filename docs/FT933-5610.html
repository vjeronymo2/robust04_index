			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / US targets regional conflicts in revamp of defence forces THE Clinton administration has unveiled a strategic defence plan aimed at US forces being able to win two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts as the country moves from its cold war goal of defeating the Warsaw Pact. The plan, which follows a five month 'bottom-up review' ordered by Mr Les Aspin, the defence secretary, would reduce US troop strengths by about 150,000 to 1.4m by 1999, and would cancel weapons development programmes such as the Navy's A/FX bomber and the Air Force's future multi-role fighter. The review proposes keeping about 100,000 troops in Europe and 100,000 in Asia for the foreseeable future. Mr Aspin said the new force structure, including 10 active Army divisions, 11 Navy aircraft carrier groups with one reserve carrier, and 13 active Air Force fighter wings, had been dictated mainly by the need to prepare for regional contingencies such as the Gulf war or a potential conflict with North Korea. 'The regional danger is the main thing that drove the size of the defence establishment that we are presenting,' Mr Aspin said, adding that enhanced mobility and improved weaponry would also make US forces better adapted to this kind of conflict. The review recommends keeping enough troops to handle two regional conflicts at the same time, but economises on transport, expecting that the US will not need to lift more than one army at a time into war zones. Mr Aspin declined to detail the budget implications of the review until next week, but defence analysts said it would result in only small savings from the earlier Base Force plan developed under former president George Bush. The Washington Post reported this month that the plan would cost about Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) more over the next five years than President Bill Clinton has budgeted for. The Aspin plan, approved by Mr Clinton this week, would retain two fewer active army divisions than the Bush proposals, but keep more marines. It would keep the same number of carrier battle groups and just over two fewer air wings. The review had been widely expected to recommend the cancellation of the A/FX and the MRF. Congress may, however, take issue with some of the other elements in the plan. Defence review, Page 6</p>

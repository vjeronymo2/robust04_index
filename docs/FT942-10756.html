			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Goldsborough buys hospital Goldsborough Healthcare has enlarged its position in the acute hospitals sector with the acquisition of Regency Hospital, the owner and operator of Macclesfield's independent Regency Hospital, for an initial Pounds 1.1m, plus the repayment of Pounds 3.53m of debt. Regency Hospital is currently registered for 33 beds, but could increase that number by 17 'with only relatively minor additional commissioning costs', Goldsborough said. In 1993 Regency made profit before interest and tax of Pounds 396,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.62m. The profit figure was struck after one-off charges of Pounds 138,000. Subject to the achieving of profit targets for 1994, Goldsborough will make a deferred payment of Pounds 1.5m on a pro rata basis. The consideration will be financed from Goldsborough's own resources.</p>

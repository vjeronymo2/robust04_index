			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not a low-cost concert Sir, I refer to your critic, David Murray's, review of the English Chamber Orchestra's concert with Sviatoslav Richter ('A high price for Richter's big sound', November 25). Mr Murray concludes his article with a reference to '. . .the laid-back, low-cost but pricey Richter exhibition'. I would like to point out that, taking into account Mr Richter's very high fee, even if we had sold out (which we did not) we would still have sustained a substantial deficit. I do not think therefore, that this concert could, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as low-cost. Leopold de Rothschild, chairman, English Chamber Orchestra and Music Society, 2 Coningsby Road, London W5 4HR</p>

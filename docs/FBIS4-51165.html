			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said that the whole nation should support Shanghai's Pudong New  Area's development and opening to the outside world, and the  area, in turn, should serve national economic growth, reform and  opening to the outside.    He made these remarks during his May 23-25 inspection of  Shanghai, following his tour of neighboring Jiangsu Province.    He noted that it was a most important decision of Deng  Xiaoping's to develop the Pudong Area and to open it to the  outside world.    Li, who has gone to Shanghai each year since the central  government's decision to develop and open the Pudong New Area in  1990, was pleased to see the great achievement that the new area  made in the past few years.    By the end of last year, there were some 3,100 separate  domestic investments and some 1,600 overseas investments,  attracting a combined overseas investment of 3.27 billion U.S.  dollars in contractual volume.    Shanghai is where the Chang Jiang River flows into the sea.  The city has a vast hinterland which is quite advanced  industrially, and in commerce and transport. A large number of  highly skilled and talented people have also gathered there, Li  Peng noted.    The central government will continue to give its policy  backing to the Pudong New Area since it is still under  construction and needs a continuous policy on development and  opening to the outside world, he said.    He said Shanghai should be built into one of the world top  economic, financial and trade centers.    To achieve that target, he said, Shanghai should make  concentrated efforts to make use of the favorable conditions  that Shanghai enjoys.    Shanghai should develop international shipping and establish  an advanced network of domestic and international  transportation, he said. He pointed out that the clearance of  the Chang Jiang River course will make it possible for Shanghai  to become a world shipping center.    More domestic and foreign trade channels should be opened  and  specialists on international trade be trained so that the city  can become an international trade center, he said.    The service industries, especially finance, trade and  shipping, should be developed as a key sector, he stressed. As  for the secondary industry, he added that a group of large new  and high-tech and export-oriented projects should also be  constructed as a new pillar industry for the city.    On agriculture, the premier said that vegetable planting  should be stressed and stable farming production centers should  take shape in the rural areas administered by Shanghai.    The premier inspected the Pudong New Area and the famous  Yangpu Bridge that links the city proper to the new development  zone.    Wu Bangguo, secretary of Shanghai Municipal Committee of the  Chinese Communist Party, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, as well as  officials from the State Council accompanied him during the tour.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Advance Bank climbs 81% and lifts payout Advance Bank, the regional Australian financial services group, has announced an 81.5 per cent increase in net earnings in the year to May following large reductions in bad debt and problem-loan provisions. The bank has raised its annual dividend from 50 cents to 80 cents a share after lifting earnings to ADollars 101.4m (USDollars 74.1m) from ADollars 55.9m on a 23 per cent rise in total loans and advances to ADollars 8.2bn. Total bad debt write-offs fell almost 95 per cent to ADollars 2.1m and non-performing loans carried on the bank's books were down 81 per cent to ADollars 16.0m. Mr Jim Service, the bank's chairman, said the result was achieved in spite of pressure on margins. He said the bank's total capital adequacy ratio eased from 11.75 to 11.54 per cent in the year. The result followed a tax provision of ADollars 57.6m, compared with ADollars 45.2m previously, and depreciation of ADollars 20.7m, compared with ADollars 20.0m. Net interest income rose 17 per cent from ADollars 282.7m to ADollars 331.4m. Parker &amp; Parsley, the US oil group, has taken control of Bridge Oil, the Australian oil group, with its ADollars 378m takeover bid. Acceptances to the bid, which closes today, yesterday gave Parker &amp; Parsley more than 51 per cent of Bridge's shares. Woolworths, the Australian retailer, lifted sales almost 9.5 per cent from ADollars 10.49bn to ADollars 11.48bn in the year to June. The result exceeds prospectus forecasts issued when the company floated in mid-1993. Directors said the performance easily exceeded Australian retail sales growth of around 5 per cent in the same period and they were confident the company would achieve profit forecasts for the year.</p>

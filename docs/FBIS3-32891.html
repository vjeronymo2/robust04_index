			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 3 Feb [date as received] (PL) -- The Cuban  parliament has refused to treat CIA-backed emigrant groups, who  are supposedly interested in talking with Cuban authorities, as  valid interlocutors.    The Foreign Affairs Committee issued a statement saying,  "Cuba has never been adverse to the possibility of reaching an  understanding with the emigrant population," and Cuba has talked  with sectors that disagree with the island's political project  but have no ties with the CIA and do not favor the blockade or  aggression.    The document, which was revealed at a Latin American and  Caribbean solidarity meeting recently held here, specifically  rejects the so-called "Democratic Platform" position, that,  abroad, pretends to favor dialogue.    Cuban legislators have said this group has "no backing among  the emigrants and represents one of the strategy trends that  certain stubborn power circles in the United States have for  Cuban counterrevolutionary groups."    The document notes that in its search for legitimacy, this  group, which lacks political backing, claims it represents Cuban  liberal trends, the Christian democracy, and the social  democracy.    Expanding on this issue, the document points out that the  Liberal Unity and the so-called Social Democratic Coordinating  Board, members of the platform, have no more than 30 members  combined and even less support in Cuba.    The document cautions that the platform's political position  does not condemn "the criminal U.S. blockade against Cuba," but  rather denies it, minimizing the extent of the conflict to  "bickering among Cubans" in an effort to confuse and weaken  international solidarity.    The document accuses the platform of not criticizing, at  all,  the aggressive U.S. policy against Cuba and of defending and  praising the most important terrorist programs of the  Cuban-American National Foundation, with its headquarters in  Miami, Florida, the United States.    According to the parliament, the so-called Democratic  Platform has received political and economic support from  foundations and governments, and from the U.S. administration  itself through the National Endowment for Democracy and the CIA  to carry out its plans.    The 25-page document provided some biographical data on the  main leaders of the pseudocoalition, including Jose Ignacio  Rasco, one of the CIA's chosen, it said, to create the "Cuban  Revolutionary Council" which served as a civilian front for the  U.S. Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. Regarding Enrique "Kike"  Balyora, it said he belonged to several terrorist organizations  in the service of the CIA, took specialized training courses at  Fort Benning for elite, covert operations, and worked as an  analyst for the Pentagon in such sensitive issues as El Salvador.    Carlos Alberto Montaner also belonged to a terrorist  organization, and different sources have placed him on the CIA's  payroll since the 1960's as a propaganda agent and specialist in  ideological subversion.    It added that Montaner served two years in the U.S. Army,  received training in covert operations, and recently has become  the main organizer of campaigns in Washington against the Cuban  Revolution.    "His syndicated press columns are marked by his pejorative  attitude toward Latin America and the glorification of U.S.  values as patterns to be imitated in the subcontinent," the  document added.    Regarding Juan Alberto Suarez-Rivas, it noted he was also  involved in different counterrevolutionary organizations, the  same as Angel Del Cerro, whereas Emilio Martinez Venegas was  recruited by the CIA in the 1960's and he now lives in Venezuela.    The list includes Pedro Alejandro Interian Garcia, a leader  of terrorist organizations in and out of Cuba in the 1960's.    According to the document, after trying rapprochement and  feigning a respectful attitude on a political level, in 1991, he  reestablished and activated his ties with CIA agents and  collaborators and represented their platform in Brazil.    "These men are incapable of playing a positive role in any  real process of improving relations between Cuba and the United  States, nor do they have the moral, political, and ethical  legitimacy in Cuba's commitment to improving relations with  regard to emigration," the parliament statement concludes.</p>

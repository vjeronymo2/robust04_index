The meeting was attended by Sa'id  Kamal, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo.    Afterward, Dr. Sha'th said he gave Minister Musa a message  from the Palestinian leadership to President Husni Mubarak. He  said the message deals with developments following the  abominable and criminal massacre committed by Israeli settlers  with the support and backing of Israeli army units in the  Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, developments to come in relation with  this issue, and the Palestinian leadership's insistence on  providing security for the Palestinian people under occupation  until the Israeli withdrawal is effected according to the peace  agreements. Sha'th added that it is impossible now to proceed  with the negotiations with the Israelis without clear-cut and  effective measures to disarm the settlers, secure international  protection, and reconsider the settlement issue. He noted that  this is an important issue without which it is difficult to  build a real base for progress in the talks, as the Americans  demand.</p>

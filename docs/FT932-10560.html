			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: UK will step up pressure BRITAIN WILL step up pressure on Serbia to take action to isolate the Bosnian Serbs, Mr John Major, prime minister, told MPs yesterday, as the government signalled its continued resistance to allowing arms to be supplied to the Bosnian Moslems. Stating that military options such as air strikes had not been ruled out, Downing Street indicated that the next step in forcing the Bosnian Serbs to accept the international peace plan on Bosnia had to be to tighten sanctions. No additional British troops would be sent to the region until the plan had been accepted, although it would probably be unrealistic to wait until all shooting had stopped, Downing Street said. The government recognised the importance of putting peacekeepers in place promptly once the plan was agreed. It continued to regard the Vance-Owen plan as the best chance for a lasting peace. Challenged during 'prime minister's questions', Mr Major called on Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic to 'make good' the commitment he had made when he accepted the Athens agreement. Mr Milosevic should do this by 'closing Serbia's borders with Bosnia, cutting the supply of weapons and other goods, and by exerting all other possible pressure on the Bosnian Serbs', he said. Lord Owen was ready to meet Mr Milosevic for further discussions if it was felt this might smooth the path to a solution. He said Britain was committed to a 'twin track' policy of securing agreement for the peace plan while intensifying pressure on the Serbs 'should they remain intransigent'. Later Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a Foreign Office minister, sidestepped calls from Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, and others to make a commitment to pull out British troops if air strikes started. Britain had 'expressed our reservations' about embarking on selective bombing, Mr Garel-Jones said. 'Not least' among British reservations was that such a policy would put the humanitarian operation at risk and endanger British troops. For Labour, Mr George Robertson, a front bench foreign spokesman, said the government's policy in pursuit of the Vance-Owen plan had to be firm and resolute but also measured and not precipitate in its timing. Mr Milosevic must now 'make it clear' that the Bosnian Serbs had no alternative but to sign the plan.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (8): Multinational prefers 'one stop' software shopping - Citibank integrates its European Banking Network CITIBANK is one of a growing number of multinationals which are opting for a one-stop shop in information technology (IT). The new breed is tired of having to sign numerous contracts with the same computer supplier in different countries. And it is no longer willing to leave IT strategy and purchasing up to individual subsidiaries. Previously, Citibank (the retail banking arm of Citicorp of the US) did not get the full benefit of its investment in technology. For example, if an improvement was made to banking software in, say, Germany, it was not always spread to other subsidiaries. Co-ordinating IT projects which involved more than one subsidiary also involved a lot of management time. But last year Citibank opted to use one main supplier, Philips Information Systems (now part of Digital Equipment Corporation), to supply systems and software for over 400 offices of its European consumer banking network. Citibank is not alone in choosing the one-stop approach. As business pressures increase and the Single Market looms, multinationals are trying to derive maximum competitive advantage from their international status. A well-integrated European IT system helps by allowing information to be exchanged quickly and better-informed decisions to be made. In Citibank's case, it wants to become a dominant supplier of pan-European banking services to counter increasing competition at home. It also hopes to win more business from high-margin customers. These customers, it argues, will expect the same service whether they go into a bank in Brussels or one in Dusseldorf. They will also expect new products and services to be developed and introduced quickly. The system which will make this possible will be one of the largest Windows-based client-server networks in Europe with 5,000 'client' pcs. These will be able to run a variety of applications locally, and will also be able to issue commands to larger computers on the network (Unix 'servers'). Work has started in Germany and Belgium and the system should reach other parts of Europe soon.</p>

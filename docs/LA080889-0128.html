			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ARIZONA REPUBLIC PUBLISHER RESIGNS  </P> <P> Pat Murphy, publisher of the Arizona Republic and the Phoenix Gazette, resigned  today. His statement did not cite a reason.  </P> <P> Murphy, 59, had been publisher for three years and had spent 14 years before  that on the Republic staff. The president of the Indianapolis company that  controls the newspapers said a search for Murphy's successor will begin  immediately. Central Newspapers Inc. is owned by the Pulliam family and  includes Vice President Dan Quayle as one of its owners.  </P> <P> Murphy took an active role as publisher, describing maverick Republican Gov.  Evan Mecham as a brutish, ideological juggernaut even as Mecham attacked the  newspapers and their reporting. Mecham, who was ousted by a Senate Court of  Impeachment last year, called Murphy's departure "good news" today, adding: "I  hope they can rebuild a little credibility to the newspaper."  </P></p>

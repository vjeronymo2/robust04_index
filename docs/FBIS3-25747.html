			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] South Africa and Namibia have signed an agreement to  facilitate the easier administration of justice between the two  countries and have expressed hopes for increasing regional legal  cooperation. Signed in Walvis Bay by the South African justice  minister, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, and his Namibian counterpart, Mr.  Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, the agreement was the first of its kind  between South Africa and a neighboring state. It creates the  legal scope for enforcement of maintenance orders, civil  judgments, and cross border subpoenas, and criminal court  orders. The two governments also agreed to investigate  reciprocal legislation to better facilitate searches and seizure  of illegal goods.</p>

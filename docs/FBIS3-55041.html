			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Viktor Batyuk, our state's permanent representative  at the United Nations, took part in a briefing at the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs today. He noted in particular that Ukraine's  delegation has done great work explaining Ukraine's foreign  policy. Unfortunately, however, it is nevertheless impossible to  surpass the activity of one delegation and the furious pressure  on the part of the mass media and government structures of the  United States and Russia, which are distorting our stance  regarding nuclear weapons, said Viktor Batyuk.</p>

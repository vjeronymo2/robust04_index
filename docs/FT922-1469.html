			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (14): Passing the buck avoids headaches - Maintenance MAINTENANCE IS always a chore. Maintaining a computer system is a job you would rather give to someone else. Traditionally, maintenance contracts come with the purchase of hardware or software. When a manufacturer stipulates maintenance fees, they can be high. If the supplier wants to pressure the user into moving up to the next generation of machine, whittling down support is a powerful inducement. Then there's software. Old programs throw up unforeseen bugs. Only veterans of that system can hope to sort out bizarre glitches. And experts wouldn't be experts if they didn't know how to charge for their services. One blanket solution to the headaches of maintenance is outsourcing, also know as facilities management (FM) - An outside party takes over all or part of a company's computer operations. FM has become widespread in the past five years, with financial institutions in particular turning to third parties to sort out their sprawling systems. Some users are reluctant to sign over too much responsibility to an outside concern. But in spite of initial cynicism it soon became obvious that no FM company would survive if it left behind a trail of disaffected customers. The Computer Services Association now includes a clause in its code of conduct binding FM companies to ensure a smooth handover to replacement suppliers. Maintaining human resources is part and parcel of keeping the machinery ticking over. With an outsourcing deal, the contractor can take over managing technical staff. That means somebody else is responsible for retaining scarce specialists. All of these policies are cheaper than a DIY solution. But in the current environment that is not good enough. Now corporate information technology departments are setting up shop on their own. Their commercial experience and fierce attitude to overheads suggests that the FM pioneers, who owe their original appeal to economic pressure, may be up against serious competition. With several mainframe computer sites and a complex data processing requirement, Barclays Bank has executed an about turn in computer maintenance. All servicing on branch automation equipment is carried out via a third party, Olivetti. But the core mainframe support is now covered by Barclays Computer Operations (BCO), a year old spin-off business. BCO sprang out of Barclays' need to maintain 'dark site' computer operations. This means unattended running - computing with the lights off. Two IBM mainframes tick away in a locked room, tapes are loaded automatically. It should, and normally does, run like a dream. But there will always be occasions when an engineer has to sort out a problem. The question for Bruce Hotter, managing director at BCO, was how to maintain a high level of skill when the requirement for that service was infrequent. The answer was to retain a small team of technicians within BCO and loan them out across the 13 IBM and IBM-compatible mainframes owned by Barclays. Only by using BCO as an external source could the bank keep the right people on call at a realistic price. 'We only have 10 software people in the IBM mainframe operating system arena to cover the UK. That's pretty efficient.' says Hotter. BCO's emphasis on efficiency is ruthless. Hotter reveals that BCO has recently made an important human catch. 'We're employing an ex-IBMer, on the engineering side, for three months. We'll bleed him dry on how to cut maintenance costs. He's already paid for himself 10 times over.' Third party suppliers are used for some mainframe maintenance. 'Our policy is to make good money by always going out to competitive bids. This gets the price down. We're always squeezing. We make the system work for us.' The system in question is the persistence of hardware manufacturers in chasing after pricy maintenance deals. The Hotter school of no-nonsense maintenance calls for constant questioning. 'Do you really need 24-hour cover? It might be cheaper to get a limited call-out service instead. Going without round the clock service hasn't caused us a problem and it's significantly cheaper.' BCO now employs 1,100 staff controlling 13 mainframes, 800 Digital Equipment and Tandem processors and a network of 50,000 connected terminals. The organisation has a turnover of Pounds 150m and is bracing itself for full commercial operation in competition with the maintenance and FM industry. Hotter reviews BCO's achievement to date modestly. 'We're beginning to get a bit of street cred.' Maintenance is about burden shifting. But it is critical to remember that signing up for maintenance involves making a purchase. No company with a cost-conscious approach to buying hardware and software should fall for a maintenance deal without some hard bargaining first. There's no need to lose your wallet in the coding jungle.</p>

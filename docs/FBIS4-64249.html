			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andreas Anzenberger and Dieter Holzweber: </F> "Special Referendum on EU Defense Alliance?"]    [Text] With "greetings from Villach" Pro-European Union  [EU] activities welcomed the 168 delegates on Saturday morning  [30 April] for the federal European congress of the Greens. On  fliers, which referred to the activities of Freedom Party of  Austria [FPOe] Chairman Haider in Carinthia, the common  rejection of EU membership by the Greens and the FPOe was  criticized.    In Goldegg Castle (Salzburg) the Greens decided with 87  percent of the votes that they will definitely vote against  membership. EU advocates, such as Environmental Spokeswoman  Lanthgaler and Vienna City Councilor Chorherr, remained in the  minority.    It was clear from the very start that the speeches by  Foreign  Minister Mock and EU State Secretary Ederer, who were invited as  guests, would not be able to change the mood. The government  members pointed not only to the advantages of membership but  also voiced praise: The Greens have essentially contributed to  the development of an awareness for the environment.    Mock stressed that neutrality will not be restricted even  after the EU's institutional reform, which is planned for 1996.  There are two possible scenarios: If the Western European  Union [WEU] (the EU's defense alliance) develops into a  collective security system along the lines of the United  Nations, membership in this alliance will be possible as neutral  state. Otherwise, a special referendum on neutrality would be  necessary before joining the WEU.    This statement aroused the displeasure of the coalition  partner Social Democratic Party of Austria. Chancellor  Vranitzky told KURIER: "Austria will actively participate in the  establishment of a collective security system in Europe.  However, there is no coercion to join the WEU. Therefore, the  discussion about a special referendum on neutrality is  superfluous."    The reaction by Greens Federal Spokesman Pilz: "The  government has already worked out a two-step plan for abolishing  neutrality. The first step is joining the EU."</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in modest trading volume - Market report Shares reacted nervously in London yesterday to a warning on interest rates from the Governor of the Bank of England and also to renewed losses in bond markets following sharp rises in oil and commodity prices. But there was little selling pressure in the stock market, which stood up well to the new setback in UK government bonds. Neither the UK chancellor of the exchequer nor the Bank Governor had given the stock market much encouragement in their respective speeches on the previous evening at the Mansion House, in the City of London. But traders said that the day's fall of 15.7 for a final reading on the FT-SE 100 Index of 3,030.1 appeared 'quite good in the circumstances'. Equities opened lower as traders digested the chancellor's assurances that taxes will not be cut until public borrowing levels permit, and the Governor's warning that UK interest rates will have to rise at some unspecified moment in the future. The FT-SE 100 was down just over 20 points within a few minutes of the official opening of trading, albeit in very thin volume. At first, it appeared that confidence in the stock market would be severely challenged by falls in UK gilts as European bonds reacted sharply to the weakness overnight in US Federal securities. A crude oil price of nearly Dollars 20 a barrel in the US, together with a higher gold bullion price, reminded investors that the US Federal Reserve Board has identified commodity prices as a significant inflation trigger. Some bond market analysts predicted that the Fed might soon feel obliged to tighten credit policy again. Against this negative background, the stock market did well to rally quickly from the day's low of 3,025.4 on the Footsie and to trade peaceably ahead of the opening of the new session in New York. Little response was accorded to news that domestic retail sales patterns were unchanged in May, or to a rise in May Public Sector Borrowing Requirement to Pounds 4.34bn. When the Dow Industrial Average opened modestly firmer, to show a gain of 10 points in UK hours, the London market consolidated and appeared unaffected by renewed uncertainty in US Federal bonds, or by the absence of recovery in domestic gilts. In the wider market, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 25.5 down at 3,534.2. Oil shares benefited from higher crude prices, with Lasmo firmer in late trading in spite of a generally negative view of pros-pects for the increased terms from Enterprise Oil. The utility sector, however, remained rattled following the warning on dividend policy from British Gas in the wake of the Ofgas pricing report. Although Seaq volume increased to 610.1m shares from the 562.8m registered in the previous session, traders said that the market was not busy yesterday. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up a high 60 per cent of overall Seaq business. The warning on interest rates, while not presenting any new factor for the market, encouraged fund managers to back away from equities while still waiting for the bond market to settle down. Some analysts said that equities had yesterday shown themselves successfully freed from bond market influences. Retail business remained high at Pounds 1.56bn on Wednesday, in spite of the reduced market attendance prompted by a national rail strike. Many traders sensed that retail business had fallen away yesterday.</p>

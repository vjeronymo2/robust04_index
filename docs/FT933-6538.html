			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Qureshi seeks to end deepening malaise: The implications of the Pakistani premier's ambitious new programme of economic and social measures IN his 2 1/2 -month stint as Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, Mr Moeen Qureshi is seeking to reverse years of profligate mismanagement which have left the country's finance in total disorder. It is not clear to what extent the ambitious programme of economic measures that he announced last week will endure when a new government, subject to familiar political constraints, takes office after elections due on October 6. But Mr Qureshi, who has no political affiliations after a 33-year career in Washington with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, will have left an important legacy if he succeeds in beginning a recovery from what he sees as a deepening malaise in Pakistani life. His initiative goes much further than dealing with a budget crisis. According to Mr Shahid Javed Burki, a senior World Bank official who advised Mr Qureshi on the measures, the prime minister chose to address long-standing problems of which the most important was 'a steep deterioration in the social order.' Mr Burki says there has been a collapse of law and order and of the supply of basic services, such as safe drinking water, sanitation and electricity, to the community - with the rich using their wealth to circumvent such problems. He says disorder is the product of a political system in which governments have 'failed to inculcate a sense of honesty and integrity among officials.' Mr Qureshi took over, following the resignations of prime minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in July, to find the finances in a parlous state. Official foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low after months of political turmoil. Inflation was rising rapidly as the government printed money to finance a spiralling budget deficit. Among emergency measures, Mr Qureshi suspended costly programmes such as a scheme under which members of parliament were given government funds for development projects in their constituencies. A 'yellow taxi' scheme, a pet project of Mr Sharif, had seen Rs15bn (Pounds 331m) lent to importers of 51,000 foreign cars which, because they were to be used as taxis, were subject to reduced import duties. Mr Qureshi suspended it as well as a planned 'yellow tractor' scheme. Construction of motorways on which work has not yet started is expected to be put off. Mr Qureshi devalued the rupee by 9 per cent in order to discourage imports and boost exports after a Dollars 3.26bn (Pounds 2.18bn) trade deficit in the financial year which ended June 30. Interest rates were increased by two percentage points, and a quick-disbursing loan was sought from the IMF. Official reserves have risen to Dollars 400m or about 2 1/2 weeks' imports from the lowest level of around Dollars 250m last month, and the haemorrhage in the government's finances has been halted. Equally important, however, are the longer-term reforms which Mr Qureshi has begun. Taxes have been imposed on both the income and wealth of Pakistan's feudal landowners, previously exempt because of their political influence. Though this means defying powerful vested interests, the government may believe that the new taxes would be politically difficult to undo. Secondly, Mr Qureshi is seeking to tighten control over the banking system and to distance banks from political influence by granting autonomy to the State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank. 'In recent years we have seen virtually the rape of the commercial banks owned by the state,' says Mr Burki. Governments, he says, had no compunction about ordering banks to make large loans for political purposes. Thirdly, Mr Qureshi has outlined plans to step up the privatisation programme, with most of the state's substantial assets up for sale, and to open state monopolies in utilities to private competition. Proceeds are to be used to retire government debt, servicing of which currently eats up some 40 per cent of government revenue. Other steps to cut the budget deficit to a targeted 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product include: removal of subsidies on fertilisers; a campaign to force payment of Rs16bn of unpaid bills to the telephone and electricity companies - defaulters are warned that their names will be published in newspapers; and a 10 per cent rise in petroleum product prices. More broadly still, Mr Qureshi has taken steps designed to restore public confidence in official institutions. These include plans for tribunals to which citizens could appeal against malpractice by customs or income tax officials; a commission to speed up slow judicial processes which, according to Mr Burki, are causing a breakdown in the legal framework which surrounds business transactions; and tightening of rules on the distribution of public assets such as land to government officials. Will Mr Qureshi's programme last? The measures were discussed with leaders of the main political parties, and officials say they did not disagree privately although they are expected to criticise them during the campaign. The government is banking on three hopes: that the need for a Dollars 1bn medium-term IMF loan will force the new government to adhere to the plans, which have the IMF's backing; secondly that the new government will allow Mr Qureshi to take the heat for politically unpalatable measures but will not rescind them; and thirdly that support for Mr Qureshi by army generals - who worry that the budget situation might force cuts in defence spending - will help to give the programme longevity. 'These reforms have a good chance of survival because they are backed by powerful interests domestically and in the outside world, but there are new risks now of public unrest if life becomes too difficult in the coming months,' says one leading banker - referring especially to the inflationary impact of some of the measures.</p>

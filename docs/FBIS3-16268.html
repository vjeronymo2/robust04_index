			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Estonian Government decided to cut down the  transmission time of the Russian TV broadcasting company  Ostankino on the territory of the republic from 9.5 to 4 hours a  day starting on March 11, Government Press Secretary Ain Saarna  told a briefing in Tallinn Friday [11 March]. He said the only  Russian channel in Estonia will be broadcast every day from  18:00 to 22:00.    Saarna explained the measure by saying that Russia owed  about  DM [German marks] 200,000 to Estonian Esttelecommunications for  relaying the broadcasts.    The Estonian government asked Esttelecommunications to  inform  Ostankino of its decision and to conclude a new contract  envisioning the reimbursement of its debt and regulating other  procedural issues before March 28. Otherwise, Ostankino  programs will no longer be broadcast on Estonian territory,  Saarna said.</p>

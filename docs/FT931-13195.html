			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Two more Lilley businesses sold RECEIVERS to Lilley, the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group, sold two businesses to a management buy-out team over the weekend. Cowcaddens-based MDW and Meadowline Services were sold to a team led by Mr Bill Shearer, the managing director, and financed by the Bank of Scotland, 3i and Scottish Enterprise. Negotiations on the buy-out were completed within a week and the move will safeguard the jobs of the 265-strong workforce. Price Waterhouse, the receivers, also confirmed that a number of large contracts within Lilley's Scottish-based National Contracting Division have been sold to Amec, the construction group. Last week the receivers also sold the business and most of the contract assets of Hatfield Construction to TA Bickerton, an independent builder based in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Bickerton is owned by Mr Ken Wilkins, who founded Hatfield Construction and sold it three years ago to Lilley, which wanted to complement its network in the south of England. Mr Wilkins said Hatfield had always remained profitable and would now be restructured as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bickerton.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: News in Brief TORY FUNDS: More than half the 35 ministerial visits to Hong Kong between 1988 and 1991 involved party political fund-raising activities, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, claimed yesterday. Countering Tory charges that Labour is controlled by the unions Mr Dobson said Mr John Major, the prime minister, had led efforts to beg for 'backhanders' from Chinese millionaires. SCOTLAND: The Scottish Conservative party yesterday presented an opinion poll showing that a majority of Scots would not be prepared to pay higher taxes under a devolved assembly. Under Labour's plan the Scottish assembly or parliament would have the power to increase or lower income tax in Scotland by up to 3p. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday presented a Harris opinion poll showing 58 per cent of Scots were not be prepared to pay higher taxes 'to meet the cost of the assembly and its activities', against 30 per cent who would. Some 12 per cent did not know. JOHN MAJOR: Downing Street took the unusual step yesterday of refuting a newspaper report which claimed Mr John Major had once backed proportional representation. Officials said remarks attributed to Mr Major when he first won his constituency in 1979 were in fact said by the Liberal candidate. As prime minister, Mr Major has said he opposes electoral reform.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals cut Invesco MIM to Pounds 0.93m INVESCO MIM, the UK-based fund management company, yesterday reported sharply lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 926,000 after exceptional charges for the six months to June 30 and cut the interim dividend to 1p. Last year's profits were restated at Pounds 11.5m when an interim dividend of 2.3p was paid. The Pounds 13.8m in exceptional charges include a Pounds 9m write-off associated with the troubled Drayton Consolidated Trust which is managed by Invesco MIM, and a further Pounds 2.6m in management and reorganisation costs. The company also took a Pounds 2.2m charge for costs incurred in drawing up plans to spin off its profitable US operations earlier this year. Mr Charles Brady, the new chief executive who replaced Lord Stevens in July, said that he believed that further exceptional charges were unlikely. He said his main priority would be to establish the company's credibility. Mr Brady said that pressure from directors of Invesco's highly profitable US operations had been among the factors prompting Lord Stevens' departure. The US directors are holders of a Dollars 60m convertible loan note which matures in 1998 and has a conversion price of 105p. Yesterday, Invesco's shares closed at 55p. As part of that housecleaning, Invesco will be selling off its own investment book, much of which includes stakes in companies in which Lord Stevens was also a director. The cost of those disposals is included in the Pounds 2.6m charge for management and reorganisation costs. That charge also included legal fees incurred in the defence against a writ filed in connection with its management of part of Mirror Group Newspapers' pension funds. Mr Brady said that among his priorities will be winning new pension fund accounts for the company's UK operations. Funds under management have fallen since the year end from Pounds 9.1bn to Pounds 8.4bn, reflecting poor investment performance and adverse publicity attracted by Lord Stevens, much of it in connection with his relationship with the late Mr Robert Maxwell. US funds under management meanwhile have grown from Dollars 41.6bn to Dollars 44.1bn over the same period. 'Our investment performance here has not been satisfactory,' he said. With the problems of Drayton out of the way, fund managers should be able to concentrate on improving investment performance, he said. COMMENT Whether or not Invesco's shares look attractive depends on whether Mr Brady can clean house effectively and bring back institutional clients. The Pounds 9m charge for Drayton may not be the last and there is considerable uncertainty about what other expensive skeletons may be lurking in the company's closet. Meanwhile, several of Invesco's existing pension fund clients are those of companies for which Lord Stevens is a director. These may soon depart the Invesco stable as well. However, Mr Brady has run the US operations effectively and if that performance can be replicated, the shares, on a yield of almost 8 per cent, could be a speculative buy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From KBS Pusan general bureau] </F>   [Text] With the approaching National Assembly approval of  the plan to implement the Uruguay Round [UR], including the  opening of the rice market, college students are planning  large-scale demonstrations, and the police have gone on  emergency alert.    Colleges in the Pusan area, including Pusan and Tong-a  Universities, will conduct a student referendum beginning today  [29 March] on the adoption of the 12 April Morocco Treaty in  connection with the UR negotiations and on the National Assembly  approval of UR implementation. The students will continue a  petition drive on the streets and distribute printed material  following an assessment meeting at Puyong Theater at 5 PM on 30  March.    The Korea Federation of University Student Councils  [Hanchongnyon] will hold a deputy election from 1 to 3 April at  Pusan University, which will be attended by 15,000 students from  throughout the country. They will adopt a policy to go on  strike on 8 and 9 April in opposition to the National Assembly's  approval of the UR.    A considerable controversy is expected concerning the  National Assembly's approval of the UR implementation plan  because Hanchongnyon and colleges in the Pusan area are planning  a struggle against the opening of the rice market in May in  alliance with labor unions after obtaining support from farmers  to oppose the rice market opening during their rural activities,  which begin in April.</p>

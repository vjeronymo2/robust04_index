			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- The leader of the No. 2 party  in the ruling coalition urged Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano on  Friday [6 May] to step down to take the blame for an  international outcry triggered by his remark concerning Japan's  wartime brutalities.    Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa said, "although it  was proper for him to have withdrawn his remark, it does not  release him from the need to take the responsibility as a  cabinet minister." Ichikawa is regarded as the archally of the  prime coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa.    Nagano, the 71-year-old army general-turned politician, is  from Ozawa's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Shinseito and  Komeito have closely cooperated in pushing the policies of the  coalition government.    Ichikawa went on to say the remark was "inappropriate as  that  of a cabinet minister." Ichikawa made the remarks a few hours  after Nagano apologized for making the remark that the 1937  Nanjing massacre was a "fabrication."</p>

In the meeting,  the president expressed concern over the fate of the people of  Azerbaijan, especially those who live in the war-hit areas. He  said: The war that is currently in progress in Nagorno-Karabakh  and along the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia cannot be  justified by any international norms and conventions, and  fanning the flames of this war will not be in the interests of  any country in the region or the world. The president stressed:  The atrocious living conditions of the women and children  refugees of Azerbaijan in the cold areas on the borders make it  absolutely necessary that international organizations pay  greater attention to the fate of these people.    Moreover, Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the fact that from  the early days of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia,  Iran had foreseen its bitter consequences and made efforts to  find a peaceful solution to the dispute. He added: At present,  too, on the basis of its humanitarian principles, the Islamic  Republic of Iran has provided shelter on the border areas to  thousands of oppressed and helpless Azerbaijani refugees. Iran  has done all it can to remedy the suffering of these refugees,  and will continue to do so.    In this meeting, Gasanov, in turn, expressed the gratitude  of  the president, government, and the people of Azerbaijan for the  humanitarian aid given to the Azeri refugees by the government  and nation of Iran. Furthermore, he presented a report about  the latest developments in Azerbaijan, particularly the crisis  areas on the border with Armenia.    Earlier today, Gasanov also met and conferred with our  country's foreign minister, 'Ali Akbar Velayati.</p>

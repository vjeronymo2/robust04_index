			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> FOUR INTRUDERS BEAT, ROB TV PRODUCER OF $500,000  </P> <P> Four masked men invaded the Beverly Hills home of a writer-producer Monday  night, banged the man's head against a floor and stole about $500,000 in cash  and jewelry, police said today.  </P> <P> It took 37 stitches to close the head wounds inflicted on Frank Alesia, 45,  whose credits include the "Laverne and Shirley" television program. Alesia was  treated at Beverly Hills Medical Center and released early this morning,  according to Lt. Robert Curtis of the Beverly Hills Police Department.  </P> <P> The assault culminated a five-hour ordeal that began when a masked gunman  confronted Alesia's butler outside the home and forced him inside.  </P> <P> The butler had taken the family dog for a walk about 6 p.m., Curtis said. When  the butler returned to the home in the 800 block of North Elm Drive a half hour  later, the intruder appeared and placed a handgun to his head, Curtis said.  </P> <P> Three other gunmen, all masked and wearing gloves, then entered the house. They  bound and gagged the butler and his wife and waited for Alesia to come home.  </P> <P> Alesia arrived at about 10 p.m. and was confronted by one of the gunmen when he  walked in, Curtis said. "He tried to run but he was overtaken by one of the  bandits and he and his accomplices forced him to the floor."  </P> <P> The robbers then beat Alesia's head on the floor until he agreed to lead them  to the jewelry and cash, Curtis said.  </P> <P> The bandits bound and gagged Alesia before they escaped with about $500,000 in  cash and jewelry. They also took Alesia's 1983 Toyota Tercel.  </P> <P> Police were called to the scene shortly after midnight.  </P></p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Treuhand agrees to Krupp plan for east KRUPP Stahl, one of Germany's leading steel groups, is to buy the Eko Stahl company in Eisenhuttenstadt, near the Polish border. The Treuhand, the state privatisation authority responsible for selling east German assets, agreed late on Thursday to a complex restructuring plan put forward by Krupp. It includes building an electric scrap smelter, a hot rolling mill, and spending DM350m (Pounds 121m) on modernising the existing cold rolling mill. Total planned investment, including the DM75m purchase price of the concern, will exceed DM1bn. However, Krupp also wants government subsidies, which will need approval from Brussels, for a substantial part of the renovation. Combining its existing capacity with that of Eko, and Hoesch, which is also being taken over, Krupp will become the fifth-biggest steel maker in Europe, with raw steel capacity of around 10m tonnes. The company, part of the Fried. Krupp group, has agreed to take on Eko's 5,750 workforce, of which around 2,000 are currently employed in government-funded work creation schemes. It expects to find permanent jobs for around 2,800 at Eko, and work for another 1,000 in associated industries in steel tubes, transport and construction steel processing, which are expected to set up nearby. Before German unification Eko was East Germany's biggest steel works, employing 11,300. Mr Jurgen Harnisch, chairman of Krupp Stahl, announcing the deal, said 1991 profits at the company, the only quoted part of the Fried. Krupp group, would be markedly below the previous year's DM277m after-tax earnings. Even so, it still expected to pay a dividend. Last year's DM5 pay-out was the first for 16 years. The company had reacted quickly to deterioration in the steel market and cost-cutting had saved it more than DM130m over the year.</p>

"Foreigners in China should respect China's laws, refrain  from harming the public interest of Chinese society and should  not interfere in China's religious affairs through whatever  means," a foreign ministry spokesman said.    The spokesman was responding to comments made in Bonn on  Tuesday by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who said he was  "concerned by the new Chinese laws on religion which have  introduced a further restriction on freedom of belief and to the  arrest of Chinese and foreign Christians."    A stronger denunciation came from the chairman of the U.S.  House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human rights, Tom Lantos,  when he called on Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who  arrives here Friday, to "emphasise our revulsion and outrage at  China's vicious campaign of religious persecution."    Fearful of a possible challenge to its own authority, the  Chinese government issued new regulations, which took effect  January 31, to strengthen control over religious practice and  limit ties between Chinese and foreign believers.    The regulations "are not for the purpose of restricting  religious freedoms," the spokesman said, "but fully show that  the Chinese government respects the freedom of belief of  foreigners in China and Chinese citizens." However, he also  stressed that "China's religious bodies are not subject to  foreign control."    A group of American, Indonesian and Hong Kong missionaries  were detained for five days last month for having "conducted  illegal religious activities" in violation of the new  regulations. The foreign missionaries eventually returned to  Hong Kong, but the fate of three local Chinese Christians  detained at the same time remains unknown.    "We must protect normal religious activities and protect the  cultural and academic exchanges in the field of religion between  foreigners and the religious circles in China," the spokesman  said.</p>

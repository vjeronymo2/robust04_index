			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, </F> published in PRISMA DE CUBA Y LAS AMERICAS, a PRENSA LATINA  publication: "Latin America: S.O.S. for Ibero-American Summits"]    [Text] For the fourth time, and without "anyone's"  permission, the heads of state and government of Latin America,  Spain, and Portugal will sit down at the same table -- this time  in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia -- to take new steps to bring  together countries which, for plenty of historical, cultural, or  ideological reasons, should always be united.    A glance back at the three previous summits makes it  possible  for us to see that the Ibero-American nations have focused their  discussions on various subjects usually recommended by the host  country. Guadalajara (Mexico, 1991) marked a very special  occasion because, for the first time, all of the Iberian-origin  countries on the American continent were convened under the  banner of joint support for the unity and integration of our  peoples and to lay the forum's fundamental groundwork on topics  such as plurality, diversity, and the people's right to  peacefully create institutions and the best political system  possible.    Certainly, the idea of this meeting had been conceived  within  the framework of the festivities organized by Spain in 1992 to  commemorate the 500th anniversary of the "discovery" of America.  Mexico, however, had the good idea of convening the first such  meeting in the region -- a move that guaranteed continuity and  the fulfillment of unity and integration at a time when NAFTA  caused concern among some people about Mexico's future role in  Latin America.    Madrid (1992), in the already mentioned context of its  festivities, underlined the contribution and implementation of  cultural and educational cooperation projects. It was in  Salvador de Bahia last year, however, where for the first time  the Ibero-American Summit discussed development with a social  emphasis, and it did so at a time when Brazil was proposing in  the United Nations an "agenda for development."    On focusing its attention on "economics, integration, and  commerce" in June, Cartagena de Indias seeks to give the forum a  new dimension beyond common history, language, and culture. The  meeting seeks to turn the association of peoples into an  economic opportunity for all. In this context, Cuba has always  longed for a united Latin America -- a Latin America of which  Bolivar and Marti had dreamed -- and integration as a function  of the most precious interests of our peoples.    Great are the challenges and efforts found on this difficult  yet vital path. Cuba has pointed these out more than once. To  achieve the desired regional dimension, it is necessary to bring  together all ongoing regional processes. At the same time, we  must defend our joint positions on political, economic, and  social matters of interest, particularly those related to  regional integration and incorporation, from a point of  fairness, of Latin America and the Caribbean into international  relations.    It is also essential to give this process a broader scope  and  greater depth through the gradual integration of the productive  and service sectors, but without playing down the importance of  scientific, technological, health, and educational cooperation  as vital instruments of an irreversible and permanent  integration process. This process, conceived as a means to  improve the welfare of our peoples through the integration of  the social sector and actions that give it a human dimension,  would be the adequate framework for Cuba to put at the service  of regional cooperation its progress and experience in the field  of social development for the solution of collective problems  that, above ideologies, require urgent measures.    Of continual concern for the Cuban delegations attending the  three previous summits have been both the prevailing enthusiasm  for neoliberalism and the enormous optimism in terms of its  results. On each occasion, Cuba has made known that it  respects, but does not share, these viewpoints, because they do  not favor the development of our peoples or stimulate a revision  of dependency as a function of the interests of the current  centers of power. For this reason, the unanimous recognition,  even by the Inter-American meeting, of the extreme poverty and  social imbalance situation experienced by most of the countries  south of the Rio Grande is clear proof of neoliberalism's  failure in the region.    Cuba will attend the Cartagena de Indias summit with these  ideas in mind and with the purpose of contributing to the  strength of this important forum at a time when the hemisphere  summit convened by the United States undermines the permanence  of Ibero-American summits as a mechanism for a concerted effort.  <H5>  False Agenda </H5>   The new U.S. Democratic administration is trying to exploit  the success attained with the approval of NAFTA with the  intention of casting a positive image of its policy throughout  the continent and recovering lost ground. This explains the  lack of definition regarding the topics to be discussed in the  meeting.    By definition, Cuba cannot oppose this convocation, because  there are indeed numerous problems to be discussed regarding  relations between the United States and Latin America. This is  not a bad idea, provided the meeting serves to discuss  undeniable existing disagreements. If we are to be honest,  Latin America and the Caribbean know they cannot have great  expectations for the possible results of the meeting. Past  Washington-convened meetings have proven to result in much ado  about nothing.    The attempts to once again exclude Cuba show a U.S. policy  of  discrimination against our country, and they run against  international trends in which collective wisdom advises against  making contrived exclusions. Such exclusions have not been made  in the meetings under the Ibero-American framework, the Security  and Cooperation Conference in Europe, or the Asian-Pacific  summit.    The Hemispheric Summit should not be used as a tool of  specific U.S. interests but, rather, as a tool of the interests  of all participating countries. For this reason, it would be  good for the summit's date, venue, agenda, and participants to  be decided by mutual agreement and not by a unilateral dictate  from Washington. What merit can Miami claim for hosting a  meeting of the nations of the continent, other than the city's  well-known record of violence; the lack of freedom of expression  imposed by the intransigence and terrorism of the Cuban-American  extreme rightists; and, as a bad joke, the fact that it serves  as the main organizational center for the continent's drug  traffickers?    The people of the region should concentrate their efforts in  promoting an agenda to discuss the true problems of  Inter-American relations to prevent any one country on the  continent from being excluded, to keep alive the Ibero-American  movement, and to keep Washington from once again making our  decisions for us.</p>

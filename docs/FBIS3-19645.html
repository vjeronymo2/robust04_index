			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at German-Baltic </F> Consultations in Bonn-Bad Godesberg on 9 March 1994]    [Text] Dear colleagues; I am very pleased to welcome you  to our consultations here in Bonn today, and I am grateful that  you have accepted my invitation so quickly.    When I decided to propose German-Baltic consultations I was  well aware of the fact that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are  in many respects quite different from one another.  Nevertheless, I think that there are a number of important  issues that concern all of the Baltic states and that are also  of special importance to Germany. There are four areas in  particular that we should discuss in detail today:    -- The relations of the Baltic states with Russia;    -- Moving closer to the European Union [EU] and the Western  European Union [WEU];    -- Moving closer to the European-Atlantic security  structures;    -- Baltic cooperation.    Let me make a few introductory remarks before we begin the  discussion.    One: Germany has a particularly close relationship with the  Baltic states and Russia in many respects. For this reason and  because the Baltic have always been a yardstick for European  stability, we are interested in consolidating Baltic-Russian  relations. Germany, together with its Western partners, has  always advocated an unconditional withdrawal of former Soviet  troops from the Baltic. We have recently reiterated this  commitment by participating in the U.S.-Latvian negotiations to  achieve a compromise on the Russian radar station at Skrunda.  There must be no further doubt about the final withdrawal of  Russian troops by 31 August 1994, leaving only the troops  required for operating the Skrunda installation. There is no  reason for making the withdrawal subject to any conditions,  either.    Another open question is the status of the Russian-speaking  population, especially in Estonia and Latvia. This aspect is of  utmost importance for future relations with Russia. The Baltic  states deserve credit for their human rights policy, which has  been acknowledged by the CSCE and the Council of Europe. On the  other hand, the CSCE and the Council of Europe have found open  points regarding the future status of the Russian-speaking  population, which must be solved by a flexible and pragmatic  approach. We are well aware of the historic reasons for the  existing problems. Yet: Political reality tells us that there  is no alternative to integrating the Russians who want to stay  in Estonia and Latvia. This requires, however, that the  Russian-speaking population demonstrates its will to be  integrated by behaving accordingly.    Together with its Western partners, Germany supports all  measures contributing to a long-term stabilization of  Baltic-Russian relations. With this in mind, I do hope that  both sides will make use of the opportunities for consolidation  that will arise after the troops have pulled out. This also  applies to the restructuring of trade relations. There are good  opportunities for the Baltic states to act as a link between the  Central and North East European states on the one hand, and  Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine on the other.    Two: Since they regained independence, it has been a special  concern of German foreign policy to get the Baltic states closer  to the European Union and the WEU. This policy is based on the  insight that the Baltic is part of Central and North Eastern  Europe in political, geographical, and cultural terms. On the  other hand, by moving the Baltic states closer to the European  Union and WEU we want to emphasize that they are irreversibly  linked to Europe and we want to open up new markets in the West  for them. Urged by Germany, the EU Council gave the Commission  a mandate for negotiating a free trade agreement with the Baltic  states on 7 February, which is to contain a perspective for  membership.    During its EU presidency in the second half of this year,  Germany will do everything it can to create the right conditions  for concluding an association agreement. At the same time, we  are trying to get the Baltic states closer to the WEU, the  European Union's defense policy component. It is our aim to  include the Baltic states in an improved security policy status.    Three: We are working toward an all-European security  structure based on trust and cooperation between equal partners.  It is to safeguard security, including that of the Baltic  states. An important step in this direction is NATO's  Partnership for Peace offer, which you immediately accepted.  The CSCE is also of great importance. The opportunities  offered by preventive diplomacy within the CSCE have been shown  by the activities of the CSCE Commissioner for National  Minorities and the CSCE long-term mission to Estonia. We are,  therefore, pleased that such a mission will also open in Latvia  shortly.    An important precondition for the functioning of the CSCE  and  the all-European structure is the inclusion of Russia. Taking  account of Russian security interests and Russia's active  participation in the CSCE does not mean that the idea of special  spheres of interest is accepted. Such concepts are by no means  acceptable to us and are expressly rejected by us and our  partners in the alliance.    Four: The Baltic Sea links Germany, the Baltic states, and  Russia in a special way. After the end of the Cold War, chances  for a cooperation creating peace and prosperity in the Baltic  Sea area are better than they have been for a long time.  Cooperation within the Council of Foreign Ministers of the  Baltic Sea States, chaired by Estonia, has developed in a very  positive way. With the third meeting of foreign ministers of  the Baltic Sea Council approaching, we should consider ways of  making future Baltic Sea cooperation as vivid and full of  perspectives as it has been up to now.    Dear colleagues, I suggest that we now start the discussion  on your countries' relations with Russia and I ask colleague  Adrejevs to open the discussion.</p>

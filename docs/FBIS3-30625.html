PUNR President Gheorghe  Funar called for withdrawing the parliamentary support granted  to the current government, while vice president Ioan Gavra  pleaded for the maintenance of the current coalition and for  further participation in the negotiations with the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], alongside of the Socialist  Party of Labor [PSM], the Greater Romania Party [PRM], and the  Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR]. Ioan Gavra's  proposal did not obtain the vote of the PUNR leadership;  consequently, the final decision was to withdraw the  parliamentary support for the PDSR. During the proceedings,  Gheorghe Funar received a message from the PDSR inviting him to  a discussion with Oliviu Gherman, president of the ruling party,  the following day [1 February]. Parliamentary sources told us  that Oliviu Gherman managed to "persuade" Gheorghe Funar and the  other members of the PUNR Standing Bureau to accept the  continuation of the negotiations. The only condition raised by  the PUNR was that the PDSR and the other parties of the majority  coalition should accept the government protocol adopted at Cluj.  In the end, it was decided that the protocol should be the  subject of the PDSR-PUNR-PRM-PSM-PDAR talks that will conclude  on 1 March.</p>

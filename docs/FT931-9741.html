			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wider market for venison WILD VENISON, hitherto confined largely to the tables of the upper classes, has begun appearing on the shelves of British supermarkets. The Safeway supermarket group, which launched it last month, is invoking the cause of nature conservation in its support. It has introduced a range of venison products made from red deer stalked and shot in the Scottish Highlands, claiming to be the first supermarket chain to market wild venison. It says it wants to broaden the diet of the British public and also help reduce the population of red deer, which have become a serious problem in parts of the Highlands. The Scottish red deer population has expanded rapidly in recent years because of warmer winters and insufficient culling by landowners. In places deer are preventing the regeneration of pine forests and invading farmland. Conservationists have been urging landowners to step up their annual deer cull in over-populated areas. But the incentive to cull has been reduced in the past three years by the collapse of venison prices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 11 (AFP) -- There will be no application  of a safeguard clause on behalf of the fishing industry in the  European Community, European Commission President Jacques Delors  said in Paris on Friday [11 February] after a talk with French  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.    He said such a clause could be applied only when "the  European markets have been turned upside-down."    French fishermen have staged a series of violent  demonstrations and protests against imports of cheap foreign  fish, which they say prevent them from earning an adequate  living.    The safeguard clause authorizes EC authorities to limit or  halt imports of goods for limited periods if they are considered  to destabilize EC markets to an excessive extent.    Delors commented that, "The safeguard clause is used when  all  the European markets are upside-down, unfair practices are used,  and so on. For the time being, we've done everything that is  legally possible. Rules are rules, and I can't violate them."    He said the EC had adopted minimum prices for some fish  imports, "which was not simple because the fishing crisis, for  the time being, is concentrated on the Atlantic coast. It is  not like the last one, during which several countries were  affected."    French authorities had said last week that they wanted  "safeguard measures" on behalf of French fishermen, such as  import quotas or suspensions, import license, and/or other steps.    On a more positive note, Delors said, "I am now going to  propose to the European Commission that we adopt a program of  Community initiative aimed particularly at letting the French  fishing industry modernize and adapt to the conditions of the  world economy. This program will allow aid to restructuring and  in controlling markets.... We hope to enable all French  fishermen to adapt to today's conditions."</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has charged former White House budget  director Bert Lance and a Calhoun company with defaulting on loan payments to a  now-defunct Tennessee bank. The U.S. District Court suit seeks $1.5 million  from Lance and the Kris Co. It alleges that Lance and the company defaulted on  payments to the United American Bank of Knoxville for four separate loans and  renewal agreements dating to late 1981. The suit, filed in Rome, Ga., was made  public Thursday after U.S. District Judge Harold L. Murphy denied a request by  the government's lawyers to keep it secret for 20 days. Lance said he had not  seen a copy of the suit. Lance declined to talk about the Kris Co, saying it  was a "personal company."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today lawyer Jaime Jose Bestard, acting on behalf of  the Colorado Reconciliation Movement, a faction of the Colorado  Party, submitted to the Supreme Court a great number of  documents on the Colorado Party elections, which were held on 27  December 1992. These documents could allegedly prove that the  current administration of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy is  illegitimate. Luis Maria Argana, the leader of the faction, also  was present at the Supreme Court when the presentation was made.    The Supreme Court received five thick binders which contain  5,000 notarized photocopies of electoral records from the  capital, Concepcion, San Pedro, Cordillera, Guaira, Caaguazu,  Caazapa, Itaugua, Itapua, Misiones, Paraguari and Alto Parana.  The records bear the signatures of the presidents, vice  presidents, and faction representatives of each voting station.    The plea states: "These documents clearly show the true  results of the Colorado Party elections held on 27 December  1992."    According to the plea, the total vote count yields the  following result: Ticket No. 4 [Argana] 215,764 votes; Ticket  No. 2 [Wasmosy] 188,949 votes, which means that the Colorado  Reconciliation Movement won the elections by 26,815.    It is explained that only the vote counts for presidential  and vice presidential candidates are being objected to as  unconstitutional, not the vote count for senators and deputies.    The plea emphasizes that "it is aimed at laying bare this  monstrous fraud and paving the way for the appropriate criminal  lawsuit and claims for damages against the people involved."</p>

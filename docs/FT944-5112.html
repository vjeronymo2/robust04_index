			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Yeltsin denounces Nato plans to expand eastwards: Russian leader warns Europe could slide from cold war to 'cold peace' President Boris Yeltsin, in a tough speech to a summit on European security, yesterday denounced Nato's plans to expand into eastern Europe and warned that the continent could slide from a cold war into a 'cold peace'. In one of the most hard-hitting messages from Moscow to an international forum since the fall of communism, Mr Yeltsin said Russia was worried by Nato's enlargement programme, laid out in Brussels last week, and poured scorn on the alliance's pledge to 'export stability eastwards'. The Russian leader's message was in sharp contrast to that of US president Bill Clinton who, in a speech immediately beforehand, had hailed Nato as the bedrock of security in Europe, and emphasised that no country could exercise a veto on its expansion. 'If Nato does expand, so will security for all European states, for it is not an aggressive but a defensive organisation,' Mr Clinton said. Later, a senior US official said Mr Yeltsin had misrepresented western intentions. The Russian leader called repeatedly for the Commonwealth of Independent States - the group of 12 ex-Soviet republics of which Russia is by far the strongest member - to be recognised as an international organisation that could guarantee security in the former Soviet Union. The proposal - effectively a demand for the recognition of a Russian sphere of influence - was made at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which groups 53 nations, including the US, Canada, most European countries and the ex-Soviet republics. Mr Yeltsin described Russia as the 'eastern buttress' of European security and stability. 'Europe, which has not yet discarded the legacy of the cold war, risks plunging into cold peace,' he told the meeting. 'Russia respects the interests of all participants of the CSCE, and it expects its own interests to be taken into account.' In an implicit rejection of the Russian demand for supremacy within the former Soviet Union, both President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany spoke out against the notion that powerful countries could impose their will over smaller neighbours. Mr Clinton called for the CSCE to adopt rules 'which can guard against the assertion of hegemony or spheres of influence'. Mr Yeltsin said Nato was engaged in a difficult search for a new role in the aftermath of the cold war. 'It is important that this search should avoid creating poles of division, and that it brings European unity closer,' he added. Moscow has repeatedly warned against Nato's expansion plans, under which Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would join the organisation. Russia, however, would be excluded. Mr Yeltsin said: 'We hear the explanation that this is an 'expansion of stability' in case of an undesirable turn of events in Russia. But, if for that reason they want to push the limits of Nato's responsibility to the borders of Russia, I will say one thing - it is too early to bury democracy in Russia.' Commenting, the US official said: 'The outside world is not giving up on democracy in Russia . . . and the process of Nato expansion is not rushing headlong anywhere.' Mr Yeltsin's words were a blow to US hopes that Nato could admit new members soon without upsetting Russia. The alliance agreed last week to a US plan for an expansion procedure. Despite Mr Yeltsin's harsh public words, he had a cordial 40-minute meeting with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Edouard Balladur has said he does not believe it is  France's job to shoulder endlessly the duties and  responsibilities concerning Bosnia that others reject. The  prime minister, who was addressing the National Assembly this  afternoon, added that the time for making a choice is  approaching and that everyone must be aware of it. He demanded  the unconditional release of the 11 French people in the  organization Premiere Urgence who are still being held by the  Bosnian Serbs.</p>

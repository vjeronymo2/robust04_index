			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Coal shares suspended at 76p Shares in Coal Investments, formerly Geevor, were suspended at 76p last night 'in view of the continuing press comment' about 'the future of certain closed collieries previously operated by British Coal Corporation'. CI has exercised its option to acquire from Edwards Energy, a private company controlled by Mr Michael Edwards, CI chairman. British Coal has said that Edwards Energy is the preferred bidder for Coventry, Trentham and Markham Main collieries. The shares will remain suspended until CI announces the terms of the transactions and the associated fundraising.</p>

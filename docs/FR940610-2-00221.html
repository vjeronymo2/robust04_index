			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Delineate a specific population of children_i.e., by age, disability, diagnosis, level of functioning, and membership in a special population, if appropriate_and their families;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Produce detailed procedures and materials that enable others to replicate the model as implemented at the original site;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) As appropriate, develop and evaluate the model in integrated, age-appropriate settings that facilitate the interaction between project participants and their peers without disabilities, including models developed for use in home or in hospital settings (such as neonatal intensive care units); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Evaluate the model at the original model development site and_if approved for funding beyond the initial three years of the project period_at other sites to determine whether the model can be adopted by other sites and yield similar positive results. In its evaluation, a project must use multiple outcome measures to determine the effectiveness of the model and its component strategies, including measures of multiple, functional child and family outcomes, other indices of the effects of the model, and cost data associated with implementing the model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In determining whether to continue a project for the fourth and fifth years of the project period, in addition to considering factors in 34 CFR 75.253(a), the Secretary considers the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The degree to which the model developed by the project is, or would be by the end of year three, designed soundly and replicable by other agencies, and provides state-of-the-art interventions for the target population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The extent to which dissemination of the model would meet a significant or unique service need in other geographic locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The degree to which the project has initially produced compelling, quantifiable evidence of the effectiveness of the model as implemented at the original development site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Availability of funding for the model from sources other than the Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities to support the operation of the model at the original development site during years four and five.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The extent to which the project has documented the commitment of other agencies not affiliated with the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project to adopt its model and participate in evaluation of the model during years four and five of the project period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The extent to which the project has sound plans for aiding in replication and for evaluating its model at replication sites during years four and five of the project period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A project that applies for funding for the fourth and fifth years must set aside in its budget for the third year funds to cover costs associated with the services to be performed by the review team appointed by the Secretary to evaluate the project in the third year. These funds are estimated to be approximately $4,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Competitive Priority. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Within Absolute Priority 1, the Secretary, under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(2)(i), gives preference to applications that meet the following competitive priority. The Secretary awards up to 10 points to an application that meets this competitive priority in a particularly effective way. These points are in addition to any points the application earns under the selection criteria for the program:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects designed to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate models that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Incorporate the appropriate use of assistive technology to enhance services to young children with disabilities; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Address the unique needs of young children with low incidence disabilities, such as deaf-blindness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project Period: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Up to 60 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Absolute Priority 2_Early Childhood Model Inservice Training Projects <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (84.024P). A model inservice training project considered for funding under this priority must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Identify the target population to be trained, including their roles and responsibilities, and the national needs addressed by the model;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Delineate a conceptual framework upon which the training model is to be based, including the changes in personnel roles and responsibilities and the skills needed to implement the new roles or responsibilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Identify the content of training and the format for delivery of training and other activities of the model;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Develop and demonstrate an inservice training model for professionals, paraprofessionals, or both, who are currently providing services to infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children with disabilities and their families, or to those individuals who through retraining could provide those services;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Include goals, objectives, and activities to ensure that personnel participating in the training acquire skills to work effectively with children and families who are members of cultural, linguistic, and racial minority groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Include within the model an array of follow-up and support activities that ensure that personnel participating in the training acquire the skills being taught and use that knowledge in meeting the service needs of young children with disabilities and their families;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Coordinate with the State agencies responsible for the Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD) under part H or part B of IDEA, and arrange for credit to be granted to trainees by appropriate agencies, organizations, or institutions of higher education; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Evaluate the inservice training model through direct assessment of participants' skills following the training and, after a period of time, include some direct observation measures of trainees in the service setting using standardized observational rating techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Competitive Priority. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Within Absolute Priority 2, the Secretary, under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(2)(i), gives preference to applications that meet the following competitive priority.

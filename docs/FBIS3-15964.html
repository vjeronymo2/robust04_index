			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During his visit to Moscow, Foreign Minister  Beniamino Andreatta said that Russia will be given a fuller role  at the next G-7 summit in Naples. This is how Italy is trying  to meet the Kremlin's demands to play a larger part in solving  the world's major problems. Here is a report from Moscow.    [Begin correspondent Lucio Gambacorta recording] Minister  Andreatta spoke about the crisis situation in Europe, first with  President Boris Yeltsin and then in more detail with Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Andreatta was representing the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which he is  currently chairman. The talks were based around three main  points:    1. The crisis in Yugoslavia and the Serbian position with  regard to the new Croatian-Muslim federation. There was no  mention of Italian blue helmets possibly being sent to Bosnia.    2. In the Baltics -- Andreatta left Moscow for Estonia this  evening -- Italy wants the Russian minority's civil rights to be  respected.    3. The G-7. Italy is preparing a program for the  forthcoming Naples summit in July. Some members, especially  Japan, are perplexed about the idea of widening the group to  admit Russia, and Russia's bid to join the group of the most  industrialized countries will have to be taken one step at a  time. The Kremlin's foreign policy will no doubt be the subject  of political discussions, but in Naples only seven nations will  participate in economic talks. [end recording]</p>

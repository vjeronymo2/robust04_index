			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The criticism of FRG Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and his  Bundeswehr planning continues. In the BERLINER ZEITUNG  (Wednesday [20 April] edition), defense experts of CDU and Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] called for the abolition of  compulsory military service.    CDU politician Otto Hauser called for general compulsory  service for men. In the future, there should be a free choice  between military service or national alternative service,  between police and fire brigade, disaster relief and  environmental service. "Compulsory military service is  outdated." Anyone who further reduces the Bundeswehr departs  from the concept of compulsory military service, the defense  expert said, referring to plans to reduce the Bundeswehr to  320,000 men. Referring to Ruehe, the CDU politicians said: "I  have never seen such behavior by a defense minister." One  cannot push such profound changes in the armed forces through  parliament in a "mad dash." He thinks the course that has been  set is substantively wrong. Anyone who serves in the military  for 10 months is effectively available for only eight months.    FDP Politician Juergen Koppelin said that he favors general  compulsory service for men and women. There is no way to avoid  an army of volunteers if compulsory military service is  shortened further. One can hardly find words to describe the  defense minister's confusion, criticized the FDP politician.  "Mr. Ruehe finally must present a concept instead of constantly  manipulating the figures." Compulsory military service of 10  months would throw the Bundeswehr into organizational chaos.</p>

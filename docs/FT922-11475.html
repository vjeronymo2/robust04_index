			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Sillars condemns '90-minute patriots' MR JIM SILLARS, deputy leader of the Scottish National party and a leading campaigner for Scottish independence, has said that he now doubts whether Scots have the 'character and ability' to face up to the responsibility of making their country independent. Mr Sillars, who lost his Glasgow Govan seat to Labour in the general election, said Scotland had too many '90-minute patriots' whose national outpourings were confined to big sporting events. In a Scottish Television interview he said that Scots had twice mishandled the chance of taking a decisive step forward - once in the referendum on a devolved assembly in 1979 and again on April 9. It was very unlikely they would get a third chance. He complained that, from January, the people of Scotland had been telling the world they were heading for independence and then in the end Mrs Margaret Thatcher had been right when she had said that when it came to the crunch Scots would hesitate. Mr Sillars said he was not giving up the deputy leadership of the SNP, but had no immediate desire to return to Westminster. He said that the drive by opposition parties to secure a multi-option referendum on Scotland's constitutional future was a post-election placebo - it was dishonest to pretend that Scots would win devolution in such a way. The revival of the Scottish Conservative party would continue at the next general election. The strength of popular demand for a referendum will be tested tomorrow when Scotland United, the newly formed grouping of all non-Conservative parties, holds a rally in Glasgow. It hopes to attract more than the 3,000 to 4,000 people who attended its first rally on the Sunday after the election.</p>

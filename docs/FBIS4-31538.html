			<p>BFN     [Text] Stjepan Mesic has lodged a protest with the Croatian  Constitutional Court, requesting the protection of his  constitutional rights. Mesic suggests that the Constitutional  Court should annul the decision of the Chamber of Deputies of  the Assembly of 24 May this year, whereby the president  [speaker] of the chamber was relieved of duty. The protest note  was received in the Constitutional Court today, and Stjepan  Mesic's office distributed it to journalists in the Croatian  Assembly.    In his protest note Mesic explained why he postponed the  18th  session of the Chamber of Deputies and stressed that, when the  president was relieved of duty, provisions of the Constitution  and the Chamber's code of practice--that is, the constitutional  rights of the speaker of the chamber and the procedure for  adopting documents on relieving him of duty--were violated.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> MGM/UA Distributes Shareholder Payment: MGM/UA said it made the $4-per-share  distribution to shareholders in connection with Pathe Communications Corp.'s  proposed $1.3-billion acquisition of the movie studio.  </P> <P> Big beneficiaries included Kirk Kerkorian, who pocketed $180 million from his  45 million common and preferred MGM/UA shares. MGM/UA shareholders are to  receive $21.50 a share. MGM/UA said remaining $17.50 per share is expected to  be paid on or before Oct. 23, 1990. Pathe's purchase of MGM/UA is far from a  done deal, however. Pathe President Giancarlo Parretti must still come up with  $650 million in financing that evaporated when Time Warner Inc. pulled out of  the deal earlier this month.  </P></p>

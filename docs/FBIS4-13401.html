			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Arrest of `Brotherhood' Leading </F> Figures Linked to `Jordanian Afghan' Groups"]    [Text] Jordanian security sources yesterday confirmed that  there were links between the "Jordanian Afghan" groups recently  arrested in connection with explosions in the Kingdom, and the  Muslim Brotherhood which is officially active within the  framework of the Islamic Action Front.    The sources told AL-HAYAH that the security authorities  arrested two leading Muslim Brotherhood figures on suspicion of  links with the "Jordanian Afghans" groups and seized a quantity  of arms and explosives in their possession.    They said that among those arrested and interrogated were  'Abd-al-Majid Diyah, who was released on bail, and 'Abdallah  al-Hashayikah, a leading Muslim Brotherhood figure suspected of  links with an Afghan group.    The same sources said that the security authorities also  arrested 'Abd-al-Majid al-Majali on suspicion of belonging to an  Afghan organization after the discovery of explosives at a  children's nursery run by the Muslim Brotherhood in al-Karak.  They added that the nursery, which is attached to the city's  Islamic Center, is managed by Muslim Brotherhood member 'Imad  al-Sawalimah, who was also arrested.    The security sources stressed that "all the arrests, without  exception, were made on the orders of the attorney general after  the seizure of large quantities of arms and explosives." They  added that the number of people detained in connection with the  explosions in two movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa' as well  as incidents of burglary and planting of devices discovered  before exploding, has reached 70. Those against whom evidence  is unearthed will be referred to trial.    According to government sources, some of the detainees have  links with foreign Islamic organizations whose aim is to  undermine Jordan's security and stability through explosions and  theassassination of Jordanian figures. Asked about the reasons  for the arrest of members of Fatah--the Revolutionary Council  [FRC], they said that members of Abu-Nidal's organization in  Jordan were arrested after the Lebanese judiciary authorities  obtained evidence of the organization's complicity in the  assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah on 28  January in Beirut, and on the basis of that evidence "the  organization is now considered a terrorist organization." They  added that "members who, in the view of the attorney general,  had close links with the organization were placed under  precautionary restrictions and the rest were released."    The Islamic Action Front issued a statement the day before  yesterday criticizing the security authorities and accusing them  of "practices and violations which are worrying to the Jordanian  public and which have revived the specter of martial law in the  guise of democracy."</p>

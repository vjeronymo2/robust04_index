			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 11, IRNA -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman  told IRNA here tonight that the British Government in violation  of all diplomatic regulations had bugged the Iranian Embassy in  London.    Asked when the earliest evidences was found in this  connection, Mahmoud Mohammadi said the earliest signs were  discovered three weeks ago.    "Naturally after the discovery of the first clue, the  embassy  staff tried to complete their investigations for the discovery  of all the (eavesdropping) devices, and this needed time,"  Mohammadi said in answer to a question as to why the issue was  not disclosed earlier.    Of course, he said, the British officials saw themselves  facing a big scandal as soon as they felt the first disruptions  in their bugging system, thus accusing Iran of collaboration  with I.R.A.    The accusations covered by the British press were mocked  even  by other European press, some of them describing the British  claims as "sheer propaganda."</p>

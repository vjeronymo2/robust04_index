			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / People: Huntingdon International Holdings Shares of Huntingdon International Holdings jumped 11p to 31p yesterday as the life sciences group announced that Roger Pinnington was its choice as chairman to succeed Ian Campbell, who gave notice of his intention to resign in mid-August. Last Friday, shares of HIH tumbled 23p to 20p as the group revealed a plunge from profits of Pounds 8.68m to pre-tax losses of Pounds 71.1m, after exceptional charges of Pounds 70.8m to cover restructuring costs at HEE, the US engineering and environmental services business, and the placing into administration of Travers Morgan, the UK-based consultancy. Known as a 'company doctor', Pinnington, 62, has been chief executive of UBM Group, Royal Ordnance, RHP Group, Telfos (after the aborted takeover bid by William Cook), and Blackwood Hodge (until its takeover by BM Group). More recently he has worked with multinational leasing companies, institutional and private investors, clearing banks and venture capitalists, including recovery and reconstruction situations. Currently he is chairman of Lynx Holdings, Cortworth and British World Aviation.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Not too many British are aware that a foreign power planned to invade our soil in 1970. It was the Irish government, planning to reclaim Ulster, according to Timewatch, BBC2's fortnightly history slot (8.10), which this week traces the origins of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Irish ex-cabinet ministers and leading Republicans shed light on the role that the Republic played in nurturing the Provisional IRA. Jerry Hall is the guest star who kicks off the first episode of The Detectives (BBC 1, 8.00), a comical cop-show devised as the vehicle for the moderately side-splitting talents of Jasper Carrott and Robert Powell. Of distinctly more mirthful stuff is the eponymous star of Victoria Wood (BBC 1, 8.30), who returns in a repeat of the popular series which she wrote. The Late Show (BBC 2, 11.15) drops its usual, irritatingly brief magazine format and devotes all 40 minutes to its penultimate exploration of art and culture in Russia. Viktor Eroveyev, a new wave novelist, floats around Moscow looking for the exciting cultural manifestations which are emerging from the debris of official Soviet art.</p>

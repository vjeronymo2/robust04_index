			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed a range of VOC and toxics performance standards for Phase II reformulated gasoline, covering a variety of options for setting these standards [see the Notice of Correction for the Proposed Rule 58 FR 17175 (April 1, 1993)]. The proposed VOC standards ranged between 29.7 and 37.7 percent reduction in emissions for VOC control region 1 areas (Class A and B, the southern areas of the country) based on a baseline fuel with an RVP of 8.7 psi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and between 26.7 and 34.7 percent reduction for VOC control region 2 areas (Class C, the northern areas of the country) [58 FR 17178, 17179, 17180 (April 1, 1993)]. These percentage reductions are in comparison to the emissions performance of baseline vehicles operating on baseline gasoline; the proposed version of the complex model was used to establish a fuel's emissions performance. In proposing the range of values EPA considered the costs of VOC control, the cost-effectiveness of the controls, the health and environmental effects, energy impacts, and technological feasibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Relative to a baseline fuel including an RVP of 7.8 psi, the proposed VOC standards ranged between 20.7 and 31.7 percent reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's analysis showed that fuels meeting the proposed VOC and toxics standards were expected to show no increase in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions, and in fact would likely achieve some reduction in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Based on the expected benefits of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction, and considering various other factors, EPA also proposed NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reduction standards for Phase II reformulated gasoline based on the authority of section 211(c)(1)(A) of the Act. The proposed NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards ranged from 0 to 14.8 percent reduction for VOC control region 1 (southern areas) and 0 to 15.4 percent reduction for VOC control region 2 (northern areas) [58 FR 17178&hyph;9 (April 1, 1993)]. Again, the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions performance of a fuel would be determined using the proposed complex model. The range of proposed standards was based, in part, on different levels of potentially acceptable cost-effectiveness as well as whether the cost-effectiveness was calculated based on reductions in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions alone or on the combined reduction in VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposed alternative VOC standards that would apply depending on whether EPA adopted a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction standard. These were based on changes in the cost-effectiveness analysis from combined VOC plus NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reductions. As explained in the proposal, measures taken to achieve the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions under this option would result in VOC emission reductions incremental to those obtained under the proposed VOC only standards, which were based solely on the cost per ton of VOC reduced. These additional VOC emission reductions obtained through a combined VOC plus NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard presented the option of setting a standard for larger VOC reductions. EPA analyzed the cost-effectiveness of a more stringent VOC standard in connection with a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard, and proposed a range of values depending on the target cost-effectiveness level: for southern areas, 29.7&hyph;40.2 percent based on an 8.7 psi baseline RVP (20.7&hyph;33.8 percent reduction based on a 7.8 psi baseline RVP); for northern areas, 26.7&hyph;37.3 percent reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In analyzing potential VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction requirements, EPA looked at two potential cost-effectiveness targets: $5,000/ton and $10,000/ton. These figures were selected as representative of the range of cost-effectiveness for controls which would be incurred by many ozone nonattainment areas in achieving attainment. In addition, they reflected higher cost-effectiveness values than those for any then-existing federal nationwide motor vehicle or motor vehicle fuel control programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, EPA proposed a toxics emissions reduction standard between 20 and 25 percent. The 25 percent reduction standard proposed was based on the level specified in section 211(k)(3)(ii) of the Act. In the proposal, EPA recognized that while on average this level of toxics control was cost effective, it could be highly cost ineffective for some refiners. The statutory minimum 20 percent reduction standard was proposed as an alternative to allow refiners further flexibility in meeting the VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards (and for some to reduce the need for capital intensive modifications specific to toxics control), under circumstances where in most cases large reductions in toxics emissions would automatically result from the VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. General Comments Received on Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received several comments recommending a reproposal of the Phase II standards once the complex model was finalized and EPA could develop a single standard for each pollutant. One comment stated that the construct of the complex model will have a significant effect on the standards, and it was therefore not possible to comment on the costs or performance of the Phase II standards as proposed (since they were not based on the final complex model). Others commented that it was improper to establish standards until the model that predicts benefits exists. EPA does not believe it is necessary to repropose these standards, since the proposal presented a range of values for the standards and outlined all of the options that were considered. The final standards were derived based on the final complex model, so the standards include the effect of the complex model on the emissions reductions predicted. EPA had proposed, and it was agreed in Reg-Neg, that the Phase II standards would be promulgated with the complex model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Briefly described below are the factors EPA considered in setting the standards being promulgated today, the methodology used in determining the cost-effectiveness of fuel controls, and the reasoning used in determining the standards. The full analysis leading to the final standards is more thoroughly discussed in section VI of the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) associated with this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

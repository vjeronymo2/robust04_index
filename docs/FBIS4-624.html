			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ben Maclennan] </F>   [Text] Bisho April 8 SAPA -- Ciskei's interim  administration has begun reclaiming weapons issued to the  so-called "auxiliary force" in the territory. Speaking in Bisho  on Friday [9 April], joint administrator the Rev Bongani Finca  said the search was still on for 103 firearms issued to youths  in the force. "It's these boys who were taken from the  villages, trained for two weeks to shoot and kill, and given  weapons and deployed in the villages." The administration did  not know who commanded them, but it was aware that they had been  issued with state ammunition.    Mr Finca appealed to community structures to help the  administration reclaim and account for all the missing weapons.  The reclamation had to be accompanied by a call on the  community to ensure there were no attacks or reprisals on  headmen or political parties.    It is understood that one of the aims of the formation of  the  auxiliary force was to protect headmen who supported the Gqozo  government.    Mr Finca said all political parties had to be given a chance  to campaign for the elections and hold meetings.</p>

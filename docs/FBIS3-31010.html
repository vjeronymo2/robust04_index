			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, has sent a protest note to UN secretary general's  special envoy Yasushi Akashi, [who is currently] in Zagreb,  saying that the Serb forces have been attacking Bihac and the  surrounding areas.    Human and material damage is vast. This region was declared  a zone protected by the UN Protection Forces. Even after  several appeals your troops have so far only watched the  aggressor's barbaric actions. We demand action from you, Ejup  Ganic's letter to Jasushi Akashi says.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: How the scheme works A TARGETED stock scheme does not involve any formal spin off of any assets or operations, unlike a conventional demerger, where a company divides its business into different legal entities. Instead, the company - with agreement from existing shareholders - makes a tax-free distribution of new shares designed to reflect the performance of one division. The existing shares are usually renamed, and reflect performance of the remaining operations. Both series of shares are quoted, and the company notionally divides its assets and liabilities between these two divisions. This allows it to report separate financial results for each. However, from a legal standpoint, relatively little changes. The company remains responsible for all liabilities and assets, and the rights of bondholders and other creditors are maintained. The different series of stock vote together on corporate matters, such as the election of directors.</p>

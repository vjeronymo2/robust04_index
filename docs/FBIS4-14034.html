The head of the  delegation will deliver a message to President Hafiz al-Asad  from Russian President Boris Yeltsin concerning developments in  the Middle East, the peace process, the Russian efforts made in  this connection, and bilateral relations. According to Russian  sources, the Russian delegation is expected to discuss the debts  question and Syria's needs, that is, spare parts and weapons.    The delegation will also visit a number of industrial  installations and participate in opening the electrical "Tishrin  Complex" in which Russia participates.    Syrian-Russian committees will meet to solve the problem of  the military debts Syria owes to the Russian Federation, as the  heir of the former Soviet Union.

The Russian delegation will also hold talks with Syrian  Defense Ministry General Mustafa Talal on the Middle East  crisis, the peace process, and Russia's view on how to advance  this process, especially the Russian proposal to convene a  "Madrid-2" conference.</p>

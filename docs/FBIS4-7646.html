			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, 1 April (MTI) -- Foreign Minister Geza  Jeszenszky presented Hungary's application for full membership  in the European Union [EU] to Greek Minister for Foreign and  European Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos, current president of the  EU Council. The document was signed by Prime Minister Peter  Boross. At the same time, Pangalos confirmed that Greece would  continue to help Hungary attain full EU membership.    On presenting the document, Jeszenszky said, "I deem it a  great honor that I can present Hungarian Prime Minister Peter  Boross's letter to the president of the Council of the European  Union in Athens, which cradled Western civilization, in the  country where the concept of Europe was born. In this letter,  the Hungarian government expresses its intention to apply for  admission to the European Union under article 'O' of the  Maastricht Treaty."    "The application to join the greatest and most successful  venture of European peoples reflects the Hungarian nation's  commitment to return to the road which it chose a thousand years  ago. After a long, forced waiting, history has again provided a  chance for this move."    "Our government believes that over the past four years  Hungary has taken the steps needed to join the organization of  democratic European market economies."    "Our membership bid has the broadest possible support: The  freely-elected Hungarian Parliament unanimously approved the  relevant proposal."    "While filing our request, I would like to restate the  position of Hungary's government and Parliament that we  completely identify with the aims of the European Union, laid  down in the Maastricht Treaty. We are ready to accept the  commitments entailed in membership and wish to strengthen the  process of European integration by joining the organization."    "I would like to assure you and the European Union that in  the coming years Hungary will adopt all legal and economic  measures necessary for full EU membership as soon as possible."    "Hungarian culture was part of European culture even when  foreign occupiers attempted to isolate us. It is largely thanks  to art and science that the spirit of European affiliation has  survived and attempts to subvert our national interests failed."    "It is Hungary's conviction that joining the EU makes the  political processes of the past four years irreversible. This  is how our nation's security and continuing economic reform  gains a favorable framework and guarantee. European integration  is the only way to Hungary's modernization."    "I ask, Mr President, that the EU Council discuss our  application at its April 18 session and forward it to the  Commission for comment," Jeszenszky said.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HIGH OUTPUT PETER ALLEN  </P> <P> Peter Allen's hard to figure.  </P> <P> Despite writing enough hit ballads -- from "Don't Cry Out Loud" to "I Honestly  Love You" -- to retire most songwriters to beachfront pads in Malibu, he still  seems determined to prove that he is a world-class entertainer.  </P> <P> By this point, surely, whatever doubts he may have had are long resolved. Even  though his concert at the Wilshire Theatre Friday night was a bit smaller  scaled than some past appearances (only a 10-piece band this time), it buzzed  and crackled with the familiar supercharged gestures of Allen's obsessively  energetic performing style.  </P> <P> Seated at the piano, lying on top of it, dancing and high-kicking from one side  of the stage to the other, pacing nervously as he unfolded hilarious,  stream-of-consciousness tales about life in the upper echelons of show biz,  Allen must have burnt calories at the rate of 1,000 a minute.  </P> <P> He sang all his hits, of course, but he was best when using numbers from his  new "Making Every Moment Count" album as the real text of his performance.  Songs like "I Could Marry the Rain" and "Love Don't Need a Reason" revealed  surprisingly darker aspects of his songwriting skills.  </P> <P> The failure of Allen's Broadway musical, "Legs Diamond," appears to have  generated a more world-weary and complex expression of his muse in his songs.  And, appealing as his high-voltage performances may be, the new pieces suggest  that Allen has wisely chosen to allow his songs to take him wherever they may  lead.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the performance was undercut by a sound mix that kept losing the  vocals in the instrumental backgrounds, as well as by a scruffy-looking set and  threadbare scrim. Fortunately, the quality and quantity of Allen's entertaining  more than made up for the tattiness of the setting. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

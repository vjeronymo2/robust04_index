			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (6): Saga inflicted deep wounds  -Profile / Nestle-Perrier STUDENTS of cross-border takeover activity in continental Europe fall broadly into two camps. One holds that national barriers are inexorably crumbling in the face of global competition, technology and mobile capital. The other argues that the barriers are not really falling at all, but simply changing shape. Both schools can claim vindication in the recent struggle for control of Perrier, France's largest mineral water company, in which Nestle, the Swiss food group, triumphed over the Agnellis, Italy's most powerful industrial dynasty. The affair is one of the most complex and controversial battles in European takeover history. As well as splitting the French business establishment, it inflicted scars on Italian pride which were only partly salved by the Agnellis' success in ultimately extracting a handsome capital gain. The saga began last year, when the Agnellis persuaded the Franco-Greek Mentzelopoulos family to sell them 34 per cent of Exor, a holding company which owned 35 per cent of Perrier. With French allies, notably the Saint Louis paper and sugar group and the Worms family holding company, the Agnellis gained control of almost half Perrier's shares and voting rights. Then things began to go wrong. Their first mistake was to launch a bid for just two thirds of Exor in November. Though partial bids were then legal in France, the offer outraged some of Exor's minority shareholders, including Compagnie de Suez, the large industrial group, which complained it was being short changed. The Agnellis hastily raised their bid. But it was too late to pacify Suez, which turned to Nestle to act as a white knight. The Swiss company also received backing from other influential French interests, notably BSN, the country's largest food company and other main mineral water producer, and Lazard Freres, the investment bank which dominates France's mergers and acquisitions market. To have stirred up such powerful opposition was a remarkable feat, given the Agnellis' close personal and business links with both Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's chairman, and Mr Michel David-Weill, chairman of Lazard. Indeed, Lazard had previously used its influence to help the Agnellis acquire French assets which have made them the country's largest foreign investor. Not only did the Agnellis consult neither BSN nor Lazard in their stealthy approaches to Perrier. They actively antagonised them by hinting unwisely that their next target was BSN, in which Lazard had helped them acquire a minority stake. Their biggest blunder was perpetrated by an ally, Mr Jacques Vincent, chairman of both Exor and Perrier. In an effort to strengthen the Agnellis' hand, Mr Vincent illicitly transferred to Saint Louis a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier which was frozen in the mineral water company's treasury. Challenged by Nestle and Suez, the deal was annulled by a French court, depriving the Agnellis of almost a third of their Perrier votes and paving the way for their defeat. It is tempting to see the story as a threatened French business establishment ganging up against a hostile intruder. But though true in part, that is too simplistic. After all, the Agnellis, with their influential local connections, started out more as insiders than Nestle, which is not even headquartered in the EC and whose bid for Perrier was hostile. In reality, a combination of arrogance and miscalculation led the Agnellis to misplay their hand. They both mistook their insider status in France for a licence to trample on tribal loyalties, while underestimating the degree to which traditional French capitalism had moved closer to the Anglo-Saxon model. The real winner was the country's fledgling system of stock market regulation, intended to provide greater transparency and equity, which was aggressively invoked by Nestle and its allies and ultimately was decisive in the Agnellis' undoing. The ironies of the situation are manifold. For the tactics the Agnellis employed to win control of Perrier were barely distinguishable from the stealthy, behind-the-scenes manoeuvring which has traditionally characterised the exercise of power by France's business establishment. It is paradoxical that prominent members of that establishment should have seized on rules designed to end such practices to defeat the Agnellis. But the fact that they did so has probably done more to entrench the rules, and their underlying objectives of openness and fairness, than could have been achieved by any number of EC directives or government legislation.</p>

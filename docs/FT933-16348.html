			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Don Juan opens Avignon THE 47th Avignon Festival opens on Friday with a performance of Moliere's Don Juan in the Cours d'Honneur of the Papal Palace, a co-production with the Comedie-Francaise to be directed by Jacques Lassalle. This represents a welcome return by the Festival to square one. Don Juan was the piece most frequently given at Avignon by the Theatre National Populaire when the Festival began after the war under Jean Vilar. Before the Festival expanded to unmanageable proportions, Don Juan was performed 233 times. When asked why he played it so frequently, Vilar replied that of all Moliere's plays this one was 'the most contemporary, the closest to our attitudes, our anxieties, our beliefs, our outlook. Don Juan is a modern hero . . .' And that, we are told, is exactly the note that will be struck in this new production. Contemporaneity, says Bernard Faivre d'Arcier, will be the keynote of this year's Festival programme as a whole. It runs from July 9 to August 2 and the majority of the plays will be works of the 20th century; with an underlying Slavic flavour. They include Mikhail Bulgakov's Adam and Eve, written for but never performed by the Moscow Arts Theatre, Chveiak au Terminus du Monde, derived by Wladyslaw Znorko as a new ending to the career of The Good Soldier Schweik, La Poule d'Eau by Stanislaw Witiewicz, Pan Theodor Mundstock adapted by Bruno Boeglin from the novel of Ladislav Fuks set in Prague in 1941. Britain is another region well represented in this year's international mix at Avignon with Edward Bond's Maison d'Arret, and Steven Berkoff's Kvetch given in French translation both directed by Jorge Lavelli, and Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead performed in Russian by an Israeli company. The French novelist and poet Louis-Rene des Forets will be honoured with readings from his work and a performance of a play made from his novel Le Bavard. Philippe Caubere will be presenting his Le Roman d'un Acteur described as 'a burlesque epic in 11 episodes'. Each one occupies a whole evening; this virtuosic piece relies heavily on improvisation as the hero tries to make a work of art out of his life. If this sounds like a touch of the Pirandellos there will be more of the same in a production of Six Personnages en Quete de . . . by Sophie Loucachevsky who has also devised an evening devoted to the tales of Pushkin, while L'Homme, la Bete et la Vertu is a less well known work of Pirandello's that will be performed. His leading French interpreter in the 1920s, the actor-director Georges Pitoeff, is the subject of this year's major exhibition. From the same innovative period in the French theatre, the surrealist playwright, Roger Vitrac is also represented with Les Mystere de l'Amour in a production from Rheims. A prestigious African company, the Ensemble Koteba from Abidjan will be seen in Leconte de Lisle's translation of Oedipus at Colonus with music by Olivier Dejours interpreted by Ethiopian musicians and in Souleyman Koly and William Sassine's Funerailles Tropicales. This year Festival is contained within the ancient city - nothing out at Boulbon or Les Taillades - but the small festival of sacred music at Villeneuve-lez-Avignon with performances in both the Chartreuse and the Church of the Chartreuse will include recitals of work by Harrison Birtwistle, Gerard Grisey and Klaus Huber.</p>

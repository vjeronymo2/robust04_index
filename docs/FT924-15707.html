			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (16): Midland Software - Supplier Profile MIDLAND Software is a privately-owned UK company formed in 1984 as a specialist in human resources systems. In January 1992 the former Midland Software and sister company Arcast merged under the Midland name. Arcast focused on ICL computers and Midland on IBM but the trend towards open systems, which free users from being tied into particular computer manufacturers, led to the merger. Turnover: Pounds 9m expected in 1992; Pounds 7m in 1991; Pounds 5.4m in 1990. Employees: 160. Product: Delphi, described as an integrated human resources system. It can combine payroll, personnel and pensions, working with its own database or using database management software from Ingres or Oracle. Hardware: there are versions for IBM and ICL mainframes, for the IBM AS/400 business minicomputer and for IBM-type personal computers. An open systems version running under the Unix operating system was launched this year. Price: products are rented and there is an initial one-off cost; rental depends on the applications run and the number of employees. A company with 300 staff running payroll or personnel would pay around Pounds 2,000 and then Pounds 200 a month. The rental includes maintenance. Customers: 250 in the UK, mostly from the top 500 companies. Various users' views: Pros: 'The company is small and well-run, with long experience . . . the system is easy to customise; needed far fewer users and technical staff than normal to implement; users were able to drive the implementation; integrated system; met specification for complex payroll.' The only criticism - that 'the report generator is long-winded' - came from existing users: no users of other products, interviewed by Software At Work, mentioned Delphi as one of the systems they had considered and rejected.</p>

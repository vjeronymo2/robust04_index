			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH JANICE;  </P> <P> THE REMATCH  </P> <P> Mysterious Pirate, a chalk starter and a show finisher in the sixth, cost me my  largest loss of the meet. I will try to rebound today, betting $50 to win and  place on Franny Frizzle in the seventh.  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger's Thu. Bankroll: $1,949  </P> <P> Thursday's Loss: $150  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,799  </P> <P> SURELOCK lost $100 when Past Remembered failed to win the eighth. However, his  other two exacta horses in the race, Bequest and Girl Of France netted him $60  to cut his losses to $40 for the day. His selection today is $200 to win on  Formidable Lady in the eighth.  </P> <P> SURELOCK's Thu. Bankroll: $1,520  </P> <P> Thursday's Loss: $40  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,480  </P> <P> Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in.  SURELOCK does not own horses.  </P> <P> Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.  </P></p>

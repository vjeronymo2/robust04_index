			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Melville Street Melville Street Investments, an investment trust specialising in venture and development capital, saw net asset value fall 10p to 140p over the year to April 30. Directors said the fall was largely attributable to the reduced value of one of the group's investments in the Lloyds insurance market. Net revenue edged ahead to Pounds 800,758 (Pounds 790,887), equivalent to earnings of 4.3p (4.2p) per share. A same-again final dividend of 2.5p maintains the total at 4p but directors warned that some reduction in the distribution may become necessary as the company becomes fully invested. It currently has Pounds 3m on deposit.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Recession reduces regional divide SOCIAL CHANGES in the 1980s and the effects of the recession are challenging traditional images of the UK's north-south divide, Regional Trends, the annual government statistical publication, shows today. Ms Alison Holding, associate editor, said this year's edition showed the recession had proved 'quite a leveller'. By the start of this year unemployment in the south-east, at 10.5 per cent, was higher than in Scotland, Wales or the east Midlands. Families in the south-east outside London are still most likely to own their own homes - 75 per cent do so, compared with a national average of 68 per cent - but other regions have caught up. Owner-occupation in the north grew from 48 per cent to 61 per cent between 1981 and 1991. The report shows a relatively even spread of professional and managerial employment across the country. While the south-east comes first with 8.1 per cent of its population being professionals and another 30.7 per cent of its male working population in managerial occupations, East Anglia and the south-west both have 6.5 per cent professionals and about 27 per cent in managerial work.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Marcolino Moco arrived in  Benguela this morning. He was welcomed at the airport by  Governor Paulo Jorge, members of the provincial government, and  traditional and religious leaders. Moco spoke to newsmen at the  airport about the aim of his visit, noting that peace could be  achieved soon. [passage omitted]    [Begin Moco recording] The aim of our visit is of utmost  importance. I could even say that we are going to make Benguela  the capital of central and southern Angola. I intend to meet  the governors of Benguela, Cuanza Sul, Huambo, Huila, and Bie  Provinces to discuss the consequences of the war waged against  the Angolan people throughout the country. The war has had a  significant impact on this part of the country.    At a meeting I held with his excellency the president of the  Republic we assessed a number of issues that were raised at the  recent meetings he held with traditional authorities. We  realize that there are serious problems affecting war-displaced  persons, and the transport sector. Although most districts are  in government hands, bandit action prevents free movement to the  various regions, causing terrible suffering for the people. So,  that is one of the issues we will discuss. We have brought some  suggestions. [passage omitted]    My visit will serve to convey an important message for the  residents of Benguela, and obviously for all Angolan people.  That is, it is possible that we are on the threshold of peace.  But we, Angolans, have already learned a lot. We ought to  prepare the ground so that peace will not turn its back on the  Angolan people again, as is the case right now. Every  structure, ministries, and provincial organs... [pauses]  Although it has been reported that ministerial portfolios and  provinces will be given to UNITA representatives, that should  not mean a return to confusion, insubordination, disregard for  human rights as we saw before the elections. But we should not  be too theoretical. We need to create the necessary conditions.  During my visit we will discuss this aspect at length with  officials and even with the people. So, we ought to create  mechanisms so that peace will never turn its back on the Angolan  people who have suffered dearly from actions by those who are  not interested in true peace. Those are the aims of my visit to  Benguela. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Raise the strategic game Sir, Andrew Campbell's spirited defence of strategic planning was well founded (Management Page: 'The point is to raise the game', September 14). However, along with the detractors of planning, Campbell misses the enormous positive impact strategic planning can have on medium-sized companies. For them, the planning process often is the first time the management team deals with fundamental questions facing their company; Where do we want to go? How can we get there? How do we make it work in our company? When the senior team shares a future direction - the vision - it creates a framework in which strategies can be crafted as means towards realising this greater end. Strategies are useless when unconnected to a desired future state on one hand and to specific action plans involving teams on the other. Moreover, strategic planning adds value in bonding the team together, managing change and creating the appropriate structure to make the plan work. Perhaps we need to 'raise the game' by extending the debate over strategic planning to the much larger pool of medium-sized companies?

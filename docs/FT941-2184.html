			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Move to reduce size of UBS board BK Vision, an investment fund that is the largest shareholder in Union Bank of Switzerland, is proposing that the bank cut its board membership from 22 to a maximum of nine. Using a new provision in Swiss company law entitling large shareholders to put motions to an AGM, BK has asked that a resolution to this effect to be put to the UBS annual meeting on April 29. It has also submitted a motion that would require the nomination of each director of UBS, Europe's largest bank by market capitalisation, to be put to a separate vote by shareholders. This is the third issue on which BK, which is controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank, has tangled with UBS. A year ago, it complained about the bank's decision to sack Mr Christoph Blocher, a BZ ally, from the board. It also took the bank to court over the creation of equity capital that could be used to make acquisitions without prior shareholder approval. A decision is still pending. At the end of last year, BK, which promises investors that it will take an active role as a shareholder, held 9.6 per cent of the total UBS equity, worth SFr1.8bn, and 17.6 per cent of the registered shares. Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, a BK director, said the fund, which raised SFr480m (Dollars 324m) in a rights issue in January, had not reduced its UBS stake since then. Mr Schiltknecht said it was widely accepted that large boards were ineffective in representing shareholder interests. UBS said it would recommend that shareholders reject the BK motions. It added that as a large and influential institution within the Swiss economy, it had to have on its board leaders from different regions and sectors, and they had to represent shareholders, employees and clients. The bank also pointed out that the executive committee of the board, comprising eight people, formed the hard decision making body that BK seemed to be seeking. Mr Schiltknecht said the best thing the bank could do for the Swiss economy would be to remain successful. He said the executive committee still had to refer decisions to the whole board and the political influence there could often be strong if the decision was a difficult one. To succeed, the BK motion would require the approval of two thirds of the shares being voted at the AGM. Shareholders can indicate their wishes on the normal proxy form.</p>

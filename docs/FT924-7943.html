			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Pounds 1.75bn is released - Capital projects AN extra Pounds 1.75bn is being released for councils to spend on capital projects including housing, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said yesterday. He published regulations to allow them to spend the capital receipts they are expected to receive from now until the start of 1994. He said: 'Local authorities will also have an incentive to consider the advantages of selling surplus assets during this period. All the proceeds could be used for capital projects.' He said he would today announce details of a new scheme to encourage councils to invest in areas of lasting benefit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the Channel Africa report program] </F>   [Text] The secretary general of the Organization of African  Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim, has held talks with the South African  Government. He's on the third day of a week-long visit to the  country, and after the talks the South African Foreign Affairs  Minister Pik Botha stressed that the country must not become a  new headache for the rest of Africa.    [Begin recording] [Botha] I would urge all South Africans to  take note of the importance that Mr. Salim is attaching to this  country. He has come here. He's a man with great problems  himself that he must face in Africa, and he's come here with a  top delegation because of his interest in us, because of the  contribution that he wants to make to resolve our internal  problems amongst the parties. And it is against this background  that we have had a thorough exchange of the problems facing us,  and I can say that I'm impressed with his objective and clinical  analysis of the situation as he sees it.    [Salim] We think that it is very important for the leaders  of  South Africa and for the people of South Africa to look and  prepare beyond the coming elections. We want to see a strong  South Africa. We want to see South Africa as being one of the  key parts in the resolution of African problems -- not to be a  focus of Africa's attention in resolving South African problems.  We have had very, very useful, very extensive discussions with  the minister. We have known each other for a long time. Those  were difficult days, but it's such refreshing and such rewarding  to come and discuss in an atmosphere of understanding, of  concord, of almost identity of use on some or almost all the  major issues that face our continent, and also that face South  Africa.

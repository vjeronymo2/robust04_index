			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bombay, January 14 -- The first research reactor,  Apsara, commissioned in 1956 and operating satisfactorily, will  be converted into a heavy water reflected core reactor to  improve its utility.    This will also give the reactor a new lease of life and  serve  as technology stimulation for the design of a 510 MWt  multi-purpose research reactor which has been developed by the  Bhabha Atomic Research Centre recently, according to Dr. R.  Chidambaram, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.    In his inaugural speech to the three-day, first annual  symposium on "Ageing management of nuclear facilities" here  today, he said the enormous cost of addition of new capacity and  the lack of cleared sites for new nuclear power plants had made  planners think of extending the operation of existing nuclear  power plants and pilot plant studies had been initiated in a big  way abroad.    Continued operation of the existing nuclear power plants as  long as it was safe and economical to do so should be an  important element in any nation's energy strategy to meet their  growing need for electrical power, he said. (His speech was read  out in his absence.)    He said the second research reactor, Cirus, (40MWt) would be  shut down for about one year for execution of refurbishing  programme as during recent years excessive maintenance efforts  were needed on some of the components due to ageing-related  degradation. It was commissioned in 1960. With refurbishing, its  useful life was expected to be extended by 10 to 15 years, or  even more.    The Tarapur atomic power station (TAPS) commissioned in 1969  had not yet run its normal full course of design life. Dr.  Chidamabaram said studies should be undertaken to understand the  ageing mechanism of critical components of this nuclear plant  and methods of assessing the residual life which will be based  on vigorous inspections being carried out.    Referring to stoppage of fuel supply from abroad along with  the embargo put earlier on the supply of critical spares for  TAPS, as it completes 25 years, the AEC chairman said the  problems were being tackled by way of development of Mixed Oxide  (MOX) fuel to continue operation and also by undertaking  development of certain critical spares with the help of Indian  industries as also in-house development work in DAE  establishments. Results of studies had shown that TAPS could be  operated for up to 40 full power years.    As regards ageing management of TAPS was concerned, critical  components and ageing mechanisms to which each was subjected to  had been categorised. A criteria had been evolved to categorise  a component as critical, based on its potential to cause  spreading of radiation within the site and beyond the plant  boundaries, if it were to fail abruptly.    Incorporation of special design features in new plants was  being considered towards easy replacement of such critical  components. The reactor vessel was the main critical component.    Components of the pressurised heavy water reactors were also  being studied.    Dr. A. Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the Atomic Energy  Regulatory Board, delivering the topical address, outlined the  technical requirements for safety assessment of ageing nuclear  power stations and steps to identify the critical structures and  components.    He lauded the R&amp;D efforts at BARC and the Indira Gandhi  Centre for Atomic Research at Kalpakkam in bringing about an  understanding of complex phenomena associated with ageing of  nuclear facilities and in the development of tools and  techniques to measure and mitigate these effects. AREB would  like the department of atomic energy to promote increased  involvement of academic institutions, national research  institutes and industry to accelerate the progress of such work.    Mr. A.N. Prasad, director, BARC, noted that more than 400  nuclear power reactors were operational in the world, producing  nearly 16 per cent of the total electricity generated globally.    By the turn of the century, 160 to 170 nuclear power  reactors  of different designs would have reached a service life of 25  years, or more. A very large number of research reactors would  also have reached the end of their service life by them,  awaiting decommissioning.    He said ageing related issues were under critical  examination  in the R&amp;D studies of several organisations. BARC had  undertaken  a systematic study of identification of critical materials,  components and systems of the pressurised heavy water reactors  as well as the severity of operating and environmental stresses.  Several techniques and software had been developed and were  being applied for condition monitoring notable among them being  current signatures for motor-operated valves in the emergency  core cooling system and vibration signatures for the pumps in  the coolant circuits and surface temperature of electrical  systems to mention a few.    Mr. S.K. Chatterjee, managing director of Nuclear Power  Corporation, said the safety levels of nuclear power plants were  not deteriorating with age because of the continued monitoring  and assessment being made and the required level of safety met  at all times. He, however, said while dealing with the issue of  ageing management of nuclear plant one had to keep in mind the  fact that public acceptance was likely to play a significant  role in plant life cycle decision-making.    Internationally, the ageing issue especially of nuclear  power  plants was assuming a great importance. The nuclear energy  agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development had created an international expert working group on  plant life management to achieve a systematic and higher level  collaboration among its member countries in Europe on these  issues.</p>

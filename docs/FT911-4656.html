			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (1): A better tale for 1991 - After last year's investment setback, equity market buoyancy in the first quarter of 1991 has dramatically changed the pension fund picture. But scheme surpluses are likely to fall, partly because of the European Court judgment on sex equality IT WAS important to get 1990 out of the way. After a brilliant decade for investment performance during the 1980s, UK pension fund managers were overdue for a market setback. In fact, the minus 10.5 per cent median rate of return was the first negative result in nominal terms since 1974. But fund managers will now be hoping that the shake-out in the markets has been left well behind. Certainly the first quarter of 1991 has presented a dramatically different picture, with equities buoyant around the world: the FT-Actuaries World Index jumped 21 per cent in sterling terms in the three months, a highly encouraging statistic given that the average UK pension fund held around three- quarters of its portfolio in equities at the end of last year. This stock market strength has been of considerable commercial importance. The fees of external fund managers are generally calculated on the basis of the value of portfolios at the end of each calendar quarter. When stock markets hit their low points at the end of the third quarter of 1990, fund managers were squeezed nastily, while their costs were rising quite fast. It was not much better in December. But March will have brought a substantial recovery in income. For UK pension schemes themselves, however, the arithmetic of poverty or prosperity is done very differently. Surpluses and deficiencies are calculated on the basis of actuarial rather than market valuations. In general, these are income- based, certainly for UK equities, which make up more than half of most portfolios. Therefore, because dividends continued to be buoyant for much of last year, with a rise of 11 per cent for the year as a whole, many schemes stayed comfortably in surplus. In a curious way, this turned out badly for fund manage- ment companies. The over- funded pension schemes very often enjoyed contribution holidays, thus choking off much of the cash flow into their funds. According to the WM Company's performance measurement service the new money flowing into UK occupational pension schemes in 1980 was equivalent to 19 per cent of their initial value, whereas 10 years later it was less than 4 per cent, implying net shrinkage after adjustment for investment income. The strange 1990 picture of bloated funds and squeezed fund managers will now change quite quickly, however. Not only have market values risen, thus increasing the investment managers' revenues quite sharply, but the scene is set for a very rapid rundown of pension scheme surpluses. This is firstly because dividend growth is bound to slow down very sharply this year. After averaging an extraordinary 16 per cent a year during the second half of the 1980s, the rate of increase may well drop to under 5 per cent for 1991 because of the economic squeeze on companies. This increase is likely to be less than the underlying growth of average employee earnings (still running at 9.5 per cent). Another important consideration is that large unfunded liabilities are crystallising for many pension schemes. These relate in part to the so-called Barber judgment in the European Court on equal treatment for the sexes, which could impose equal retirement ages and other expensive adjustments on schemes. At the same time, the Social Security Act 1990 laid down that partial inflation-proofing of benefits (limited price indexation, or LPI, of up to a limit of 5 per cent a year) must be applied in future, after a certain A-Day, the date of which has yet to be announced. In addition, to the extent that there are surpluses in the scheme, this LPI protection must be backdated to cover past service. What is bad news for schemes could nevertheless be good for pension fund managers, as extra contributions and top-ups begin to roll in; at least, this will be true unless the pressure on final salary-linked schemes becomes so intense that companies decided to wind them up in favour of cheaper arrangements. In these potentially troubled times, however, UK pension fund managers can justifiably point to the very high returns that they have succeeded in generating over many years. According to the other main performance measurement service, Caps, the average rate of return achieved by the median fund over the past 10 years has been 15.4 per cent. This is a considerably high return than has been enjoyed by typical funds in the US or on the Continent, even after adjustment for currency changes. The uniquely aggressive strategy of UK funds, relying heavily on equities, has paid off handsomely. The one bad year, 1990, has only made a small dent in this record. In the latest edition of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management's Pension Fund Indicators, perhaps the best source-book on UK pension fund investment, Mr Jim McCaughan, a PDFM director, argues: 'The long-term investor might justifiably regard the unsettled market conditions of 1990 as a blessing since opportunities were presented to acquire investments at favourable prices.' Yet the equity orientation of UK pension funds has relied heavily on the willingness of British companies to adopt a high pay-out strategy. That has led to criticism from the UK corporate sector on the grounds that continental and Japanese companies do not face the same pressures from their own institutional shareholders. Moreover the entry of the UK to full membership of the European Monetary System six months ago posed the possibility of fundamental structural change. Has the focus of UK funds on equities been merely the consequence of persistent UK inflation? Will bonds be much more attractive if they offer a reliable real rate of return? But Mr McCaughan does not see UK fund managers going back to government bonds, in which they invested heavily during the 1970s. 'Pension funds no longer see themselves as natural buyers of gilts,' he says. Moreover, UK company schemes have the flexible long-term actuarial and accounting procedures which permit them to accept the volatility of equity returns. In the US, the pension fund accounting standard FAS87 focuses much more upon temporary market values, which have to be reflected in company profit and loss accounts, whereas in the UK SSAP24 embodies long-term smoothing. These accounting influences, together with the much greater incidence of defined contribution schemes, explain the high proportion of bonds in US pension fund portfolios. In the UK nearly all large schemes have a defined benefit (or final salary-linked) structure, although there is concern that the coming pressures from Barber and LPI may cause a number of companies to switch over to defined contributions. In mainland Europe, meanwhile, funded occup- ational pension schemes are beginning to grow in import- ance, and could become much more popular given the demographic pressures on many of the pay-as-you-go (unfunded) state schemes. Moreover a new EC directive proposes that the single market should apply to pension fund management: national investment restrict- ions, such as on bond/equity proportions, should be swept away, and foreign managers should be allowed to compete freely across borders. As their confidence recovers in line with the rise in equity markets, the UK's pension fund management companies are beginning to reassess the scope for exporting their skills to Europe.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / French to reduce army by 25% over five years The French army is to be cut by more than a quarter,in a five-year programme of defence cuts announced by Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister, writes Ian Davidson in Paris. The first reductions, of just under 29,000 men, are to take effect next year and are made up of 16,000 national servicemen, 8,000 professionals, and 4,750 civilians. From 1993 to 1997, the French army will be reduced from 280,000 men to 220,000, roughly equivalent to the elimination of a division a year. During the same period, the air force will be reduced from some 450 combat aircraft to fewer than 400.</p>

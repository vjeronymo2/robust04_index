			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Commission's order approving the NYSE's OHT facility, the Commission noted the benefits that would accrue to investors through the development of an after-hours trading session. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  The Commission stated its belief that Crossing Session I would provide investors whose orders were not executed during the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. session with another opportunity to have their orders executed at the NYSE closing price. Crossing Session I also would provide investors the flexibility to decide whether they want a particular order to participate in this Session. With respect to good til cancelled (``GTC'') orders entered for execution during the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session, a customer would have the option of deciding whether to designate that order as a GTX (good til cancelled, executable through crossing session) order, thus allowing the order to migrate to Crossing Session I for possible execution. In addition, a customer would have the option of cancelling any order entered into Crossing Session I at any time prior to its execution at 5 p.m. These benefits would accrue to both individual and institutional investors. Moreover, the Commission stated its belief that Crossing Session I may help recapture overseas order flow by enabling firms to facilitate a number of portfolio trading strategies involving small programs of stocks to achieve executions at the NYSE closing price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See OHT Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, the Commission stated its belief that Crossing Session II would benefit the investing public by offering members the opportunity to enter aggregate-price crossing portfolio orders with their customers after-hours to be executed against each other. The Commission recognized that Crossing Session II could help to recapture overseas trades of U.S. stocks by providing a mechanism by which portfolio trades arranged off the floor can be effected in an exchange trading system. While the Commission recognizes that Crossing Session II does not provide an auction market for portfolio trades, the reality of the marketplace is that these portfolio trades currently are being effected off-exchange and, frequently, overseas. Bringing institutional trades that currently are being exported overseas for execution within the purview of U.S. regulatory bodies should benefit the marketplace overall, as well as help to protect the investing public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Commission discussed these prospective benefits of the OHT program in its order approving the pilot program procedures, the Commission also voiced concern regarding certain issues concerning the NYSE OHT facility, particularly with regard to Crossing Session II and certain National Market System (``NMS'') concerns. In order to address these concerns, the Commission approved the OHT facility on a pilot basis, and requested that the Exchange submit a report concerning various aspects of the pilot, including information regarding the ability of customers to cancel orders entered into the OHT facility. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the Commission requested that the Exchange provide the following information, broken down by month: trading volume (trade, share and dollar value) in both Crossing Session I and Crossing Session II; the number, if any, of: (1) Single-stock single-sided orders; (2) single-stock paired buy and sell orders; and (3) GTX orders executed in Crossing Session I; the number, if any, of: (1) single-sided orders; and (2) single-sided GTX orders that remained unexecuted at the end of Crossing Session I; the number and percentage of GTC orders on the book that were designated ``GTX'' and thus migrated to Crossing Session I; the number of member firms participating in Crossing Session I and those participating in Crossing Session II; whether the NYSE marketplace has experienced any increased volatility during the last hour of the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session after the initiation of the OHT facility; whether there were greater (wider) quote spreads during the last hour of the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session after the initiation of the OHT facility; whether there was a diminution in the number of block transactions during the last hour after the initiation of the OHT facility; and the degree to which transactions were entered in Crossing Session II to avoid the restrictions of the short sale rule in the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session. The Commission also requested that, because at the time of the Commission's approval of the OHT facility, at least one other marketplace had proposed a system comparable to the NYSE's OHT facility, the NYSE's report should indicate: (1) How its OHT facility could link with any other systems approved during the 18-month pilot period; (2) how orders entered on the other marketplaces could interact with orders in the OHT; and (3) how the intermarket issues discussed in the Commission's order approving the OHT pilot would be addressed (the Commission emphasized that the resolution of intermarket issues would not be solely a responsibility of the NYSE, but would fall equally upon the regional exchanges or the National Association of Securities Dealers proposing an after-hours system). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above information, the Commission further expected the NYSE to monitor carefully the composition of aggregate-price orders in Crossing Session II to ensure that firms do not enter aggregate-price orders where one stock dominates the basket. In addition, the Commission expected the NYSE, through use of its surveillance procedures, to monitor for, and report to the Commission, any patterns of manipulation or trading abuses or unusual trading activity in the two crossing sessions. Finally, the Commission expected the NYSE to keep the Commission apprised of any technical problems which may arise regarding the operation of the OHT, such as difficulties in order execution or order cancellation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

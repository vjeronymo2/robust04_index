			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> PRICE TAG BLAMED FOR FAILURE OF PARK PLAN  </P> <P> Both supporters and opponents of a $57.5-million measure to fund new parks  agreed Wednesday that voters trounced the proposal because it was too big and  too expensive.  </P> <P> The referendum, known as Proposition Parks, was defeated by a 3-1 margin  despite the unanimous backing of city officials.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran said the measure was too broad. As he campaigned for the  measure, he said, voters told him they wanted developers to foot the bill  rather than taxpayers. If developers refuse to pay for new parks and  recreational facilities, Agran predicted, the pace of new building will slow.  </P> <P> "There's no way that (the city) could begin to fund (new parks) . . . out of  existing capital funds," Agran said.  </P> <P> The bond and assessment district would have funded 27 community service  facilities, including three new parks. Returns showed that 74% of the 10,703  ballots cast were against Proposition Parks.  </P> <P> The measure was opposed by many community activists, who described it as a  veiled tax increase.  </P> <P> Jacquie Ellis, executive director of the Irvine Chamber of Commerce, took a  positive view of the defeat. She said the chamber will return to the City  Council to develop another park plan.  </P> <P> "We were never against parks; it was just the method," Ellis said. "We think it  can be done for a lot less" money. DANICA KIRKA  </P></p>

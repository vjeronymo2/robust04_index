			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> USC'S AMEND-BLACK TAKES DOUBLES TITLE  </P> <P> Byron Black, who was near flawless, combined with Eric Amend Sunday to give USC  its 20th individual title in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. men's  tennis championships.  </P> <P> The unseeded Trojan team outlasted UC Irvine's Mike Briggs and Trevor  Kronemann, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, at the University of Georgia's Henry Feild  Stadium.  </P> <P> USC has won three of the last four doubles titles, including 1987 when Rick  Leach and Scott Melville defeated UC Irvine's Julian Barham and Darren Yates.  </P> <P> "When you come to USC you become a good doubles player because our coaches are  so good," said Amend, a fifth-year senior. "But the thing that I'm most  disappointed in is we never won a team championship for our coach (Dick Leach).  He deserves it."  </P> <P> In Sunday's singles final, Louisiana State's Donni Leaycraft overcame a shaky  second set to defeat Nebraska's Steven Jung, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3. The unseeded Jung,  who lives in Hacienda Heights, missed his chance to become the first player  from a school that did not make the team field to win the title. He is the  first Big Eight player to reach the NCAA championship match.  </P> <P> "I played a smart game," said Jung, who graduated two weeks ago with a degree  in finance. "I thought I played a winning game. I just came up short."  </P> <P> Leaycraft, among those seeded nine through 16, became LSU's first NCAA tennis  champion. A junior, he's also the first non-senior to take the NCAA title since  Georgia's Mikael Pernfors won in 1984.  </P> <P> Leaycraft's strategy of sitting on the baseline and waiting for Jung to make  mistakes worked in the first set when Jung admittedly forced the action.  </P> <P> In the second set, Jung relaxed and lured Leaycraft into errors. He also won  four sudden-death points. But with a 3-2 lead in the third set, Jung lost his  patience. He hit a forehand wide on a sudden-death point that allowed Leaycraft  to tie the set. Leaycraft won three more games to take the title.  </P> <P> In doubles, both Irvine players and Amend gave most of the credit to Black, a  sophomore from Zimbabwe. He served consistently and returned nearly everything  the Anteaters hit. He was a major reason USC broke Irvine's serve five times.  Black held his serve each time.  </P> <P> "He kept us in the match," Amend said. "If it weren't for him, we would have  lost."  </P></p>

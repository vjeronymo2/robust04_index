			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Arts: Just stay calm as the next fad arrives - War and Peace (Populist social history and glimpses of hell) / And away with fakery and lunch] Our critics make some New Year resolutions for themselves and others The New Year may revive old desires; it also revives old rancours. So, this year, away with all sorts of fakery and misbegotten Swan-Lakery. Leave well alone is the message for would-be producers of 'the classics'. Let swan-molestation be an indictable offence. Resolve to obey the dictum: 'Petipa knew best'. And 'No' to interval drinks kindly provided by managements who have found a vineyard on the outskirts of Hell for the tipple they offer. And no, no, a million times no, to any more of Channel Four's Tights, Camera, Action series, which turns dance on television into an Olympic contest for the fastest switch-off. And, cunningly, manages to avoid showing talented dance-creators. But a hugely supportive 'Yes' to the work of such bright talents as Jonathan Burrows and Mark Baldwin, who are making exciting new moves. And let everyone resolve to give support to the work of Candoco and of Wolfgang Stange, who use dance to enrich the lives and artistic potential of disabled people. ***** As 1995 draws nigh, the next fad in classical music must already be preparing to take a bow. Pavarotti started the rot with 'Nessun dorma'. Ever since the Italian world cup it has been impossible to show football on television without the accompanying soundtrack of Big Lucy hitting a high B as the ball goes into the net. Taverner's 'The Protecting Veil' came next, cello and orchestra straining in religious ecstasy. Then - the music gets thinner each time - came Gorecki's Third Symphony. The two-minute extracts on Classic FM made that sound almost appealing, but sitting through the whole symphony in the Royal Festival Hall was quite another matter. When that was followed by a band of Spanish monks singing Gregorian chant, we knew we had reached rock bottom. The marketing department of EMI deserves a special prize for digging out that old recording and getting it into the charts. So my New Year resolution is to remain calm when the next fad arrives, to be philosophical about the way the public is led like sheep and not to scream 'Oh, my God, whatever next?'. What will be next, you ask? Well, they say whale noises are on the way in. A medley of high-pitched squeaking over an undulating wash of strings, entitled 'Whale Symphony', would seem to have all the necessary ingredients, intellectually as challenging as an anaesthetic and trendily green as well. Place an order at your local record store now. ***** I promise to walk down Cork Street once a week and back down the other side; to do the rest of Mayfair occasionally and Motcomb Street, and Bloomsbury, and Clerkenwell, and Hackney; even to go inside a gallery now and again, rather than hover furtively at the door, think better of it and slip away; to give video/installation/performance art another try; to cross the road to speak to the dealer/artist/fellow critic I spot on the other side; to go to more private views for the sake of the stimulating conversation they afford, the philosophical insight, the view and serious discussion of the work. To be avoided at all costs: all the wonderfully distracting women of the art world; all offers of a drink, unless I can get a good look at the label, or it is after 12 or 6, or it fizzes; anything on a plate or a stick; the artist/dealer/critic spotted on the other side of the road; video/performance/installation; the telephone; lunch.</p>

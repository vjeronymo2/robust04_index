When the recovery kicks in, the new airplane  should lure airlines, which will be introduced to the A321 in  1994, and the A319 in 1996.    A stitch in time saves nine. That piece of advice from good,  old Jean de La Fontaine is still giving Airbus Industrie  managers headaches.    While the airliner market plunges to new depths, the  European  consortium--indifferent to the economic downturn--is stepping up  the number of its product launches. In fact, it is sending up so  many new airplanes that the whole thing looks like a fireworks  show. Airbus's A340 quadrijet went into service last February,  while its twin, the A330 twinjet, is beginning its final phase  of certification testing now. If everything goes as planned, the  first A330 should join the fleet of Air Inter, which ordered 15  of them, in December. However, the airline might postpone  delivery of the last 10, depending on how the economy looks.    There is more. A month later, in January, 1994, Airbus will  add a new member to its family with the A321, the new stretch  version of the bestselling A320, assembled in Hamburg, Germany.  It will be joined later by the A319, the small 130-seater whose  1996 birth was announced at the last Bourget Show. That makes  four new programs in the space of four years, or almost one a  year. Does Airbus think it is a car manufacturer?    Most important is the question of how the European aircraft  manufacturer plans to amortize the nearly Fr4.5 billion it has  invested in these developments. Its sales are at their lowest  level ever (see table). Since 1 January 1993, 58 Airbus orders  have been canceled, against only 27 new orders written. That is  a negative balance of 31 planes. And manufacturing plants are  slashing thousands of jobs: 3,000 at Germany's Deutsche  Aerospace, and 1,600 at Aerospatiale's airplanes division in  France.    The truth is, Airbus had little choice. Most of its new  planes were launched before the recession. The decision to go  ahead with the most expensive of the programs, the dual  A330-A340 project ($3.6 billion in development costs), was made  in 1987, three years before the slump began. The most recent  arrival, the A319, is an exception, and meets a pressing market  demand for small planes to serve airline "hubs" and regional  routes. Moreover, as a derived model, the 319's development  costs are a modest $250 million. The challenge in the  aeronautics industry is to make very long cycles to coincide  with the abrupt turnarounds in the travel market. It takes five  or six years to bring a new program to fruition, once the  decision to launch it is made. And engineers design the new  aircraft to last 20 years. That means manufacturers always base  their strategies on long-term trends. The important thing is to  constantly stay ahead of competitors, for technological  innovation is what ultimately pays off.    Innovation is what has enabled Airbus, which started from  scratch less than 20 years ago, to challenge Boeing by capturing  30 percent of the world market. Its first move was to invent the  concept of a large-fuselage, short-haul carrier (the A300).  Later it gambled on automated cockpits with the A320. But to  confirm its penetration of the Seattle giant's market, Airbus  still needed a complete family of airplanes. With its four new  programs, it now has one. Even in the midst of a recession, say  officials in Toulouse, a complete line "will limit the damage  and help sell older models, inasmuch as airlines prefer  homogeneous fleets, to save money." The A330 will probably not  lift Airbus out of the current doldrums. Its sales have topped  out at 127 firm orders since the beginning of the year. On the  other hand, Airbus managers are convinced that the airplane and  its siblings are vital to the consortium's "rebound" once the  recovery kicks in.    According to the two major launch airlines, Air Inter and  Malaysia Airlines, the A330 is certainly not without assets. It  is the world's biggest twinjet, designed to serve both as a  high-density (440 passengers) short-haul carrier and a long-haul  plane (up to 6,000 km). This makes it extremely flexible to use.  The A330 is even more fuel-efficient than any rival to date. It  does not consume any more kerosene than the first A300s, and can  carry 30 percent more. Outfitted with the same equipment as the  A320, 321 and 340, the A330 offers fantastic productivity gains,  notably in maintenance and crew training. The same simulators  mean the same procedures: A pilot can easily shift from one to  the other in a few days time. It is easy to imagine how  interested airlines are. "The A330 is a recession airplane,"  claims Air Inter, which will be able to use it to prepare for a  price war in Europe. The domestic carrier plans to employ the  A330 on its most-traveled routes, i.e. Paris-Marseille,  Toulouse, Nice, Strasbourg, and Montpellier. It will gain about  18 percent on operating costs per seat.    Meanwhile, the A340 quadrijet has acquired the nickname  "World Ranger" since it captured the record for the world's  longest flight this summer in a 19,000-km trek from Bourget to  Auckland, New Zealand. The A330, together with its A340 twin, is  probably Airbus's best weapon for the coming years, provided  that traffic continues to pick up and transporters' finances  improve. Both Toulouse and Seattle believe they will. After long  claiming that there was no market for an A330-A340 type  airplane, Boeing is trying to counter the new threat from Europe  with its 777 family. It is running two years behind. Only the  future will tell which company took its stitch in time.

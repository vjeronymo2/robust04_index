			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / How to Spend It: Sunny thoughts for house and garden If last weekend's promise of summer raised your spirits and made you broach the matter of outdoor life with some optimism, then you might like to know of a new mail order operation called Crucial Trading. The catalogue offers a small, edited collection of 'natural alternatives for the house and garden'. Lurking behind that vague - and these days fairly ubiquitous - claim are some attractive products. There are simple wooden garden seats and planters, some covered almost like gazebos. There are natural coir paths - ideal for conservatories - starting at Pounds 10.95 and a marvellously capacious Crucial coir carry-all bag at Pounds 14.95. There are some sensibly sturdy garden essentials - aprons, kneelers, holdalls and tool pouches in dark green and natural at prices ranging from Pounds 7.95 to Pounds 14.95. The galvanised watering cans in dark green or plain, range in price from Pounds 19.95 to Pounds 37.50. For lingering summer days there are hammocks and picnic rugs and a small collection of colonial country furniture from India - divans and carved cupboards. Everything can be bought by mail, the catalogue costs Pounds 1 from The Crucial Trading Post, The Market Hall, Craven Arms, Shropshire (tel: 0345-666660). Those who would like to browse can see much of the range at 79 Westbourne Park Road, London W2 5QH. Tel: 071-221 9000. If your garden, or your tastes, run along grander lines, Sotheby's annual sale of garden statuary and architectural items takes place at Summers Place, Billinghurst, West Sussex, on Tuesday May 24. Although many of the items are grand, the estimated prices seem reasonable - a pair of wrought iron gates, French, second half of the 19th century, is estimated at between Pounds 400 and Pounds 600, there are fountain heads at Pounds 200 to Pounds 300 and wrought iron garden seats at Pounds 300 to Pounds 500. There are statues and fountains, stone troughs and urns - all the accessories the grand garden requires. A catalogue costs Pounds 12, (from Sotheby's, Sussex) and viewing days are from Friday May 20 through to Monday May 23. Finally, good news on the price front. About four years ago I mentioned Jane Tennant's collection of colonial-style planter's chairs, which cost Pounds 285 each. Today she has a new collection, bought, as were the originals, in Sri Lanka, but selling for Pounds 199 each. The quality is exactly the same  -they are made in authentic planter's style from an indigenous wood (which she tells me is carefully controlled and replanted) called Suriyamara, and the cane-work is exceptionally fine. She sells them without cushions - kelim-covered cushions look particularly good with them - and although she will deliver it will cost extra. Most people she finds prefer to look first and then buy. Available from Market Trading, 44 Burlington Gardens, London W3 6BA. Ring for an appointment (081-992 9255) as she operates from home.</p>

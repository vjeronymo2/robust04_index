			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S AIDES ASSAIL HIM FOR ACTIONS IN SALCIDO CASE  </P> <P> Sheriff Dick Michaelsen is being criticized by some members of his staff for  his handling of the Ramon Salcido case, including charges that he may have  aided the suspected mass killer's defense, according to a published report.  </P> <P> The accusations are made in a letter drafted and approved by about 80% of the  Sonoma County Sheriff's Department's management staff and a small number of  deputies, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported.  </P> <P> The letter is scheduled to be considered by the executive board of the Sonoma  County Sheriff's Employees Assn. on May 18.  </P> <P> Among other things, the letter said Michaelsen's public statements contributed  to hysteria in the community, violated basic investigatory practices and may  have aided the defense by lending credence to the proposition that Salcido is  insane.  </P> <P> The letter said "a series of behaviors" by the sheriff were "inappropriate,  irresponsible and unprofessional."  </P> <P> The letter attacked Michaelsen's announcement at a news conference that two of  the victims, both of whom were Salcido's sisters-in-law, had been sexually  assaulted.  </P> <P> "Other than some vague physical circumstances at the crime scene, there existed  no proof" of sexual assault, the letter charged.  </P> <P> The letter says that Michaelsen's announcement violated "rudimentary police  investigative practices" by releasing information that only the killer was  likely to know.  </P> <P> Further comments during press conferences by Michaelsen that the suspected  slayer must have been "insane" and "psychotic" caused resentment among  department members.  </P> <P> "He's helping build their defense," one law official told the Press Democrat.  </P> <P> The official's opinion is reflected in the draft letter.  </P> <P> "The term(s) psychotic and insane have specific psychiatric and legal meanings.  Sheriff Michaelsen is not a psychologist or psychiatrist and is not in any  position to offer an authoritative opinion as to the psychological state of  suspects."  </P> <P> Salcido, 28, is charged with seven counts of murder and three counts of  attempted murder. He fled but was captured in his native Mexico and brought  back to Santa Rosa.  </P></p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Technology: Whither the IT department? Information technology directors have been foisting computerisation upon corporate professionals for several years - forcing people to change the way they work and realigning responsibilities in the workplace. Now it is their turn to adapt. Rapid changes in information systems technology are undermining the traditional role of the information technology manager and in some cases making the role redundant. The open systems phenomenon, client-server environments and software that makes computers easier to use are designed to 'empower' the end user. They are not, however, designed for the convenience of the IT manager. At the same time, the expertise of the IT manager is increasingly challenged by users and customers. These issues are prompting a basic reassessment of the IT function. And in some organisations the IT department is ceasing to exist. Timex, the Dundee watch-maker, is replacing an ageing mainframe-based system with new integrated software on an open distributed platform. Peter Hall, the company's vice president, says the investment will improve service levels to the business and cut costs. Ultimately Timex thinks the system will run itself - and the company will not need a formal IT department. This option may not be open to many organisations, but doing away with the IT function is not so far removed from 'outsourcing' it. A survey from IT consultancy CSC Index reports that 71 per cent of its respondents in Europe plan to outsource some information systems activity this year - compared with 36 per cent in 1991. This ranges from applications development to telecommunications and software maintenance. According to Robert Morison, CSC vice president: 'Outsourcing information systems activities is no longer a question of 'whether', but of 'what'.' Ironically, says Morison, the activity most often associated with outsourcing - data centre operations and management - is among the least frequently sent out. 'The idea of giving up the data centre sends most systems managers scurrying for performance benchmarks to prove that their shops are as efficient as their neighbours,' he says. Yet, he argues, it is often the data centre which should be the first to go. Not surprising, many IT managers prefer to think of outsourcing as facilities management. Yet their companies are beginning to treat outsourcing IT no differently from business activities where, in advertising or distribution, for example, there is a reliance on 'outsourced' specialist skills. If, as CSC concluded, most organisations are outsourcing their IT activities, then just as many are involved in a serious rethink of how their IT department works - about who should own it, and to whom it is responsible. 'Re-engineering' the IT department is one of the biggest consultancy opportunities, comments David Narrow of Price Waterhouse Management Consultants. 'It is a very high priority. Costs are going up in IT faster than in any other corporate area - people just have to do better,' he says. But this is not just a matter of cost saving. Some organisations are moving towards a small cadre of specialists who plan, design and oversee the company's IT, while contracting out most of the traditional work. The pressure on IT to maximise the business value it delivers may be undermining some traditional IT regimes, but it also coincides with a generation of technology which will not only allow IT to deliver the goods, but which on any large scale probably demands more specialised IT disciplines and requires more managing than the technology that it replaces. And it is this new level of complexity that should ensure the future of the IT function, if not the traditional department. According to Des Lee, IT director of B&amp;Q: 'There may not be an IT department as such - but there will be an area of IT excellence. These are very exciting times for IT people. There is great opportunity - and there is no doubt that we'll emerge as the agents of competitive advantage at last.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) A record of taking appropriate action, as warranted, in response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to written complaints, if any, about the bank's performance in meeting the credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs of its service area(s); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) A reasonable geographic distribution of loans given its service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility for an outstanding rating. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A small bank that meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``outstanding''.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Manuel Robles Sosa] </F>   [Text] La Paz, 13 Jun (PL) -- The Ibero-American Summit  being held this week in Cartagena de Indias should serve to  consolidate that international forum, according to Bolivian  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.    The chief of state made this statement in an interview  granted to PRENSA LATINA before beginning an overseas tour that  will include his participation in the Ibero-American Summit. He  described the summit as important to help the member-countries  coordinate their policies, adding that it will serve as a  fitting venue for the presidents to discuss topics that interest  them.    [Robles] Mr. President, what are your expectations regarding  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit? What do you think the  summit's priorities should be?    [Sanchez] Regarding the Ibero-American Summit, I must note  that it is a meeting whose importance is undeniable to the  extent that it will permit the definitive consolidation of this  international forum and will serve as a hub for relations among  member-countries.    In keeping with modern times, the most important topics will  deal with the implementation of the most dynamic mechanisms of  commercial exchange and regional and subregional integration.  At the same time, such mechanisms could serve as the means to  aid the various countries in their struggle to consolidate their  internal development and to strengthen the social policies that  will improve the living standards of the people.    [Robles] What is your assessment of the Ibero-American  summits held so far? Do you think they have met expectations?    [Sanchez] The preceding summits were highly significant,  because for the first time we set up a mechanism for  Ibero-American relations. In this area, we can stress two  principal achievements:    A. Following its inception, policies are now coordinated  among member-countries, and cooperation and integration among  the countries have improved, both on the bilateral and  multilateral level.    B. Attendance at these summits is significant, considering  that the presidents avail themselves of such meetings to discuss  topics that are of particular interest, especially on the  bilateral level.    Also, I must note, that on this occasion the meeting will  broach the problem of the native and Indian peoples of the  continent. This demonstrates that important progress has been  made in identifying the new social problems and permits  consolidating and strengthening the democratic processes in the  region.    [Robles] Considering the importance your administration  attaches to international cooperation, what are your  expectations regarding the Ibero-American Summit is this area?    [Sanchez] This Ibero-American Summit must attempt to  strengthen the objectives outlined in previous summits and also  render a renewed impetus for regional integration, through the  analysis of topics such as trade, sustained development, and  cooperation, seeking to alleviate the existing social problems.    [Robles] Some time ago your government announced a  diplomatic  plan of action aimed at decriminalizing the international trade  of the coca leaf. Will you broach this option at the  Ibero-American Summit?    [Sanchez] At the next summit, the Bolivian Government will  present findings to the rest of the countries that demonstrate  the process of structural reforms undertaken and the new views  to be implemented in terms of efforts against drug trafficking.    [Robles] How do you view Latin American integration, its  progress, and perspectives?    [Sanchez] Latin American integration is at a stage of  complete development, seeking to consolidate its main mechanisms  by reviewing and updating them. This new view includes a common  perception on the viability of open regionalism, whereby  countries that conform to different mechanisms will encounter  fewer obstacles in negotiating with similar regional groups,  thereby fulfilling the principal goal of overseeing Latin  American regional integration, ensuring its flexibility, and  seeking to include all of the nations in their unity proposal.    [Robles] Considering the priority that your government  assigns to integration with its neighbors, could you give us  your views in this regard?    [Sanchez] Bolivia attaches particular importance to regional  and subregional integration, because it is believed that this  policy will jointly promote the internal development of the  member-countries and of the diverse economic coordination  mechanisms.    [Robles] Mr. President, what means do you see for merging  the  existing subregional blocs into a vast integrated framework?  Should this merger be based on pluralism?    [Sanchez] Undoubtedly, pluralism has become one of the key  elements of Latin American integration. Since the creation of  the Latin American Integration Association in 1980, our  countries have considered the final goal of regional  coordination policy to be the formation of a single continental  bloc. This will be possible to the extent that democratic  systems are consolidated in our countries, which supposes the  active practice of pluralism, both internally within each  country and in its foreign relations.    [Robles] What are the achievements, the biggest problems,  and  the tasks faced by your administration? How are you coping with  the social problems faced by your government?    [Sanchez] My administration finds itself at a very  significant point in Bolivia's history. The reforms we are  implementing are of a structural nature. At this moment in  time, we are focusing on the capitalization laws, the education  reforms, and reforms dealing with the people's participation.  Our final goal is to consolidate democracy, improve the  Bolivian people's standard of living, and last, make tangible  our desire to achieve the country's overall development. We are  seeking all of this within a framework of a renewed concept of  overall and sustained human development based on economic  growth, social justice, participative democracy, respect of the  environment, and international solidarity.</p>

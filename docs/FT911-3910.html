			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (29): The potential of pictures - Multi-Media, tools to create  more informative systems A group of 12 computer hardware and software manufacturers has put its name to a trademark. This is not in itself so remarkable. The establishment of a trademark does not require any great degree of commitment. However, the object of this collection of companies is to establish a way forward for the personal computer industry - and that future will encompass television pictures and sound as well as the more conventional aspects of data processing. The name for this is multimedia, and the trademark is MPC - Multimedia Personal Computing. Most computer systems are constrained to store and display information in ways more acceptable to machinery than human beings. Text or numbers are the norm, and, where pictorial information is kept, it is most often in a form more akin to a cartoon or drawing than to a photograph. The storage of sound for computerised manipulation is not any more advanced. There are exceptions to this - a good example being the Domesday Project machines, which use a BBC micro to access all sorts of geographical and demographic data from a video disk, for display on a television screen. However, in the mainstream of computing such applications are rare. One of the leading suppliers is VideoLogic, a British company. It provides a board which can go into an IBM-compatible PC or Macintosh. It can capture television pictures and sound for editing and inclusion in a presentation alongside other computer data. Integration of video, audio and conventional data within a data processing system is known as multi-media. A multi-media system should enable the user to manipulate and view all such data. He could, for example, press a help button, and not only view a manual but bring up an interactive tutorial, where a film can be seen and heard of a teacher explaining a topic of interest. Such manipulation should be an integral part of the system's capabilities. In a windowed environment, this would mean that the user would see the film in a window alongside other data, and be able to drag it around the screen or desktop or re-size it. If such machines were readily available, it is easy to see what their potential would be. Wherever pictorial information was needed it could be invoked as easily as more normal text. For example, a travel agent could store the whole of his catalogue of holidays, and then show a customer film of a chosen spot, with appropriate sound track, as well as the normal textual descriptions. Sceptics might argue that all this is more appropriate to killing martians on a screen and certainly the games or leisure market is where much of the development of such systems has taken place. Multi-media enthusiasts, though, such as Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft, believe that, by the end of the 1990s, it will be the norm, and that computer users will expect to be able to deal in all forms of data, and interact with their machines in far more sophisticated ways than they do now. 'Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is most readily enjoyed if it is delivered in audio form,' says Mr Gates, in a piece on the subject published in Encyclopaedia Britannica. He has a point. One wonders in what other form it might be delivered, apart from a printed score. Obviously, whilst the latter might be useful to a musician, it leaves a lot to be desired to the layman. Merely to provide conventionally-displayed computerised information can be just as limiting because it does not provide the user with a form of data readily interpreted by the most appropriate human senses for the information under review. Multi-media promises to deliver information in the most appropriate fashion, but with the same degree of control that you experience with any other computerised data. A company might, for example, need a system to enable them to look at geographical data. You could start by displaying a map. From there, the user might select a town and look at a picture of the architecture, or at a list of companies which have offices there, and then at pictures of their products. Those pictures could be revolved or walked around to enable the viewer to see them from any angle. They could be accompanied by a spoken sound track describing what is on view. At each stage, the correct medium would be used to communicate the information. It would be easy to dismiss this as just another piece of enthusiastic marketing, a product looking for a problem. However, that would be to ignore the way other products have blossomed, and, if not changed the world, certainly made an impact. Spreadsheets, for example, were originally intended merely to provide a way of doing cash flows, to take the pain out of re-calculating when information changed, but that in itself could not account for their phenomenal success. Users have driven that change, and spreadsheets are now embedded within the corporate culture to such an extent that it is hard to imagine how we could have managed without them. The Multi-media PC will not be an end in itself, rather it will provide the tools necessary to create more colourful and informative systems. Doubtless it will provide the games player with an even more realistic view of his imaginary worlds, but it could also bring the benefits of computing to a wider business audience than hitherto. At least, that is what the gang of 12 are banking on.</p>

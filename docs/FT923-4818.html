			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / No exit from a vicious circle: A harsh economic climate is taxing Nordic countries The Nordic countries hoping to join the European Community later in the decade are enduring a highly uncomfortable wait in the ante-room. Sweden, Finland and Norway - which have all lodged applications to join the EC or are about to do so - are suffering an exceptional buffeting from the currency unrest swirling through Europe. The economic and financial jitters rippling through Scandinavia deliver a grim message for members of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), such as Britain or France, that complain about the Bundesbank's tight monetary policies. The Nordic experience shows that the fall-out of the monetary turmoil caused by the strong D-Mark and weak dollar can be still greater for countries outside the ERM than for those inside it. Sweden is in the eye of the storm (see below). The stern currency action is part of an attempt by Mr Carl Bildt's minority government to maintain the confidence of the financial markets in his economic reforms. It comes, however, at a time when Sweden is still grappling with its most severe recession since the 1920s - and when Mr Bildt's efforts to prove the markets wrong may be coming apart at the seams. Finland, which raised interest rates yesterday for the third time in less than a month, has subjected its economy to an unprecedented squeeze. Norway is still struggling after six years of crisis in its troubled financial sector. And Denmark, the sole member of the foursome already within the EC, is weathering a bout of financial market nervousness caused by its No vote against the Maastricht treaty three months ago. One senior Finnish diplomat called yesterday's renewal of interest rate increases by the Bank of Finland 'very grim news'. The tough economic adjustment policies in force throughout the Nordic region, he said, represent a belated effort to repair economic weaknesses which should have been righted during the 1970s and 1980s. 'This is the price for past sins of omission. Sweden, for example, managed to pass over the effects of the 1973-74 oil shock by expanding the public-sector share of the economy. Now we're paying double,' he said. Even by the dour standards of the highly subdued world economy, the four Nordic economies are in an extremely difficult position. They have been experiencing the pain - and none of the advantages - of adherence to Europe's hard-currency 'club'. According to Mr Keld Holm, international economist at Lehman Brothers, the London investment bank, the Nordic region is locked in a series of interconnected vicious circles - with no exit in sight. 'Everything has come at once,' he says, 'the lack of US recovery, the weak dollar and the currency troubles in Europe, where international investors have been withdrawing funds to place in economies of the 'hard core' of the ERM. Everything now looks a little more gloomy.' Sweden, Norway and Finland, although outside the ERM, have unilaterally committed themselves to maintaining their currencies within set fluctuation bands against the Ecu, the EC's composite currency unit. But they have conspicuously failed to attain ERM-type credibility. The financial markets appear to believe that, in an unforgiving international climate, the Nordic governments may have to ease their tough economic policies. As a result the past fortnight's surge in international demand for the D-Mark has led to large-scale withdrawal of funds from Nordic money and bond markets. The Nordic countries have become anti-inflation champions. The annual rate of price increases in all four is now down to between 2 and 3 per cent, below the German level. Yet this virtue has not been rewarded by any improvement in economic performance. Real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates - varying between 15 per cent in Finland and 8 per cent in Denmark - are the highest in the industrialised world. Yields in long-dated bonds in all four markets have risen by between 1 and 1.5 points since the Danish setback on June 2 damaged the markets' faith in the sustainability of international anti-inflation efforts. The extreme monetary squeeze, combined with high levels of debt produced by often ill-fated commercial and residential property lending during the 1980s, have exacerbated strains in the banking and insurance sector. This has been a general factor behind the wariness on international financial markets. The Swedish economy is due to decline by a further 1 per cent this year, following a fall of 1.2 per cent in 1991, and growth of only  1/2 per cent in 1990. Finland will register a contraction of an estimated 1/2 per cent this year after a 6 per cent fall in GDP last year. Norway will chalk up domestic (non-oil) GDP growth of only 1 1/2 per cent this year, the same as Denmark. The Copenhagen government has managed to bring its current account on balance of payments into sizeable surplus - but 1992 will be the sixth successive year where economic growth will fail to exceed 1 3/4 per cent. Sluggish economic growth, combined with the effects of mounting unemployment on increasing social security pay-outs, is putting great upward pressure on budget deficits. These economic challenges are damaging the spirit of political consensus which Nordic governments need to keep alive to sustain their campaigns to join the EC. The Danish No to Maastricht, combined with realisation that EC membership will in some cases speed up painful restructuring in formerly protected economic sectors, has led to a general increase in scepticism about the effects of joining the EC. For the moment, the general mood in the Nordic countries remains, on balance, favourable to EC membership. Latest opinion polls indicate that 54 per cent of the population are in favour of joining in Finland, compared with 41 per cent in Sweden (and 46 per cent in Switzerland and 38 per cent in Austria, the two other countries which have also applied). Collapse of the Maastricht treaty, if voted down in the French referendum later this month, could, ironically, ease some Nordic difficulties in passage to the EC. Acceding to the free-market provisions of the Treaty of Rome would prove less politically taxing than agreeing to the further-reaching commitments of the Maastricht treaty in matters such as foreign policy and defence. A French No to Maastricht would also increase still further Nordic exposure to the pressures of the financial markets. It would thus heighten the region's need to come fully inside the EC club rather than hovering uncertainly outside.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Crimeans vote for Russia Mr Yuri Meshkov yesterday became Crimea's president-elect, after winning a landslide victory on a platform of re-integrating his republic into Russia. In a result that could provoke a direct confrontation between Kiev and the Black Sea peninsula, Mr Meshkov won 73 per cent of the vote in Sunday's run-off presidential election. Mr Meshkov is promising to press ahead with a March referendum on Crimean independence from Ukraine despite Kiev's threat to 'take decisive action' and 'use all possible options' against any steps to undermine 'Ukraine's territorial integrity'. Russia is maintaining an embarrassed silence on the election results, but the Russian media have been quick to point out that Crimea could be the next in a series of bloody civil wars in the CIS republics. President Boris Yeltsin has just signed a trilateral agreement with the US guaranteeing Ukraine's current borders, in order to coax its neighbour into relinquishing its nuclear arsenal. But it will be tough for Russia to deny assistance to its former province. Since Crimea's short-lived declaration of independence in May 1992, Ukrainian leaders have been struggling to keep Crimea content by expanding the region's sphere of political and economic self-rule. However Crimea, 70 per cent populated by ethnic-Russians and part of Russia proper before 1954, has become increasingly dissatisfied with the catastrophic Ukrainian economy, racked by hyperinflation since last summer. Crimeans rejected the status quo offered by Mr Meshkov's defeated opponent, Mr Nikolai Bagrov, in favour of uniting with their ethnic kin and historical homeland in hopes of a brighter economic future. A western diplomat in Crimea for the elections said: 'It is not that Russia has won Crimea, but that Ukraine has lost it through economic ineptitude.' The vote puts the Kiev government in a vulnerable position, frightened that Crimea's loss will destroy its fragile state. Ukraine's regional divisions run strong from the more Ukrainian, nationalist west to the Russian-oriented industrial east. Ukraine is also wary about losing its stake in the Crimean-based Black Sea fleet in the dispute between Kiev and Moscow. While Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk agreed to allow the first Crimean presidential election to proceed, he has also indicated a secessionist referendum would be unconstitutional. Mr Meshkov has already toned down his rhetoric of Russian unification in an effort to avoid hostilities with Kiev. 'No one is talking about separating from Ukraine,' he said. He now advocates a step-by-step re-integration, starting with a gradual re-entry into Russia's rouble zone and establishment of a Crimean central bank. He insists his proposed referendum for 'an independent Crimea in union with other CIS states' is not secessionist. 'This is a problem for Ukraine's constitutional court. Kiev's executive branch does not have the right to overrule us.'</p>

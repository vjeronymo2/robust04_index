Alliance sources told AL-RA'Y the formation of a "unified  national Islamic leadership of the intifadah" will top the  agenda of this important session.    The sources also expect raising the question of claiming the  same armed fedayeen operations by more than one faction of the  alliance to put an end to this phenomenon.    Hamas and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP] have both claimed several military operations  against Israeli occupation, the latest of which was a military  operation against settlers near Hebron on 6 February. This  strained relations between Hamas and the DFLP at the time.    Some Palestinian quarters think the alliance factions have  so  far failed to coordinate their electoral efforts in the occupied  territories. This was the reason for Fatah's success in the  elections of the doctors' union in Gaza Strip two days ago. All  of Fatah's candidates won the 11 seats of the union. [passage  omitted]</p>

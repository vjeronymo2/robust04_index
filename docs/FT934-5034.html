			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Treasury costs new measures at Pounds 411m in 1994-95 - Costs The Treasury said yesterday that the total cost of providing extra help to pensioners over the next three years would be Pounds 411m in 1994-95, rising to Pounds 897m in 1995-96 and to Pounds 1,287m in 1996-97. Those figures include the extra costs of indexing benefits arising from the directimpact of value-added tax on the pricelevel. Retirement pension (including linked benefits) and pensioner income support: Pounds 280m in 1994-95; Pounds 580m in 1995-96; Pounds 765m in 1996-97. Income related benefits (except pensioners): Pounds 100m in 1994-95; Pounds 195m in 1995-96; Pounds 295m in 1996-97. Other benefits: nil in 1994-95; Pounds 85m in 1995-96; Pounds 190m in 1996-97. Cold weather payments: Pounds 1m in 1994-95; Pounds 2m in 1995-96; Pounds 2m in 1996-97. Total benefits: Pounds 381m in 1994-95; Pounds 862m in 1995-96; Pounds 1,252m in 1996-97. Energy efficiency grants: Pounds 35m in 1994-95; Pounds 35m in 1995-96; Pounds 35m in 1996-97. Gas and electricity prices have fallen in both real and cash terms recently. Compared with a year ago, gas prices are 3 3/4 per cent lower and, on average, electricity prices are 1 3/4 per cent lower in cash. The downward trend in average real fuel prices, pre-VAT, is expected to continue as a result of the government's market-oriented policy towards energy and the regulatory formulae now in place. For a household using an average mix of gas, electricity, and other fuels, prices have so far fallen 4 per cent in real terms since the start of this parliament. Over the life of the parliament they are are expected to fall another 3 per cent, leaving them 7 per cent lower relative to other prices. Since the last general election, real fuel prices have fallen and further falls in the underlying price are expected over the course of this parliament. As a result of this, on average, pensioners and disabled people are likely to find that the help they will receive will broadly cover all changes in the price of fuel, including VAT.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Gamini Dissanayake, the latest to die ... The 52-year-old opposition leader had long feared for his life but even as recently as a few days ago was still saying 'I am confident of winning' the presidential election to be held in two-weeks' time. Tamil guerrillas fighting for an independent homeland blamed him, along with other ministers who were in government in the late 1980s, for bringing in Indian troops to disarm them under an accord between Colombo and Delhi. In one of his last interviews, in the Madras-based Frontline magazine, he urged caution in negotiating with the rebels. 'Nothing should be rushed through,' he said. 'There are deep wounds in the psyche of the people which have to properly undersood.' Nevertheless, he added, he would work for 'a just and fair solution ..A lot of lives have been lost and blood has been incessantly and unnecessarly shed. It takes two hands to clap and to have a dialogue. A modus vivendi is necessary. Whether the LTTE (guerrillas) will look at it this way, I do not know. I hope they do ..'   .IN THE LONG TRAIL OF ASSASSINATION 1989 The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) assumes responsibility for the murder of several prominent leaders of rival, more-moderate Tamil nationalist organisations. 1990 LTTE execution squad kills 13 leaders of a rival organisation living as refugees in India. 1991 Sri Lankan minister of state for defence Ranjan Wijeratne killed in bomb blast; LTTE widely suspected.

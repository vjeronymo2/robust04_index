During  the visit, his highness held talks with British Prime Minister  John Major on the political situation in the region, bilateral  relations, and the situation in the Balkan states. His Highness  Crown Prince Hasan also addressed a conference on the economics  of peace in the Middle East. His highness also took part in a  meeting held by the Board of Trustees of the Refugees Institute  at Oxford University.    At hand to receive his highness were His Highness Prince  'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn, His Highness Prince Ghazi Bin-Muhammad,  a number of their highnesses the princes and princesses, the  prime minister, the speakers of the Senate and the House of  Representatives, and top civil and military officials.    His highness spoke about his meeting with the British prime  minister. He said:    [Begin recording] [Hasan] We met after British Prime  Minister  Major's return from Brussels. He was preoccupied with a basic  issue; that is, the issue of Yugoslavia. As you know, the U.S.  initiative was seeking to achieve peace within the European  framework. It seems there were strong feelings about what  initiative should be taken in order to contain the ongoing  tension, especially in Tusla and (Serbrenica), when it came to  talk about replacing the Canadian and Dutch forces.  Nevertheless, British Prime Minister Major was concerned about  the need to clarify this issue to the world. I had the chance  to stress the need to condemn those who carry out acts of  violence, whoever they may be and wherever they are, in order to  enable the UN forces to carry out their tasks and missions.    [Reporter] During the conference on the economics of peace  in  the Middle East, you stressed that it is necessary for peace to  reflect on the man in the street. How did intellectuals and  politicians in Europe react to this call?    [Hasan] Just as an investment framework for a regional  meeting is being pursued, we are also pursuing a human framework  for meetings that practically define the world community's stand  toward the human being, the refugee, the evacuee, and the  expellee. Unless this crystallizes into a world vision, it will  be hard to talk about a systematic continuation of the peace  course. Regarding UN institutions, as well as those  institutions concerned with refugee affairs, I noticed there is  an inclination to move toward a comprehensive vision. This  vision applies equally to the World Bank. It is summed in the  need to establish regional institutions, including a regional  development bank, that deals, according to internationally  accepted standards, with all those who seek help and assistance  at this stage, in order to invest in the human being and make  him part of the peace course.    [Reporter] Sir, you are now the head of the newly re-formed  Royal Commission for Jerusalem Affairs as delegated by his  majesty the king. In your opinion, what are the next steps  toward Jerusalem in response to his majesty's call, in his  letter to the prime minister, to activate this committee to  protect Holy Jerusalem?    [Hasan] His majesty the king granted me and my colleagues  this great honor. I hope that we will be able to fulfill the  duties required of us at this stage within two phases of action.  The first is a phase that will continue in the future; that is,  maintaining Jordan's concern with Jerusalem through the Awqaf  institutions that work on the ground in Jerusalem. When we talk  about the Royal Commission, we are talking about a unique  Hashemite Jordanian support for the Arab and Islamic identity.  We must define this unique role and work toward reaching deep  understanding of all our responsibilities at this stage.    The second role is to acquaint scholars from the Islamic  world with ethical supremacy, including its dimensions and  various literature. As for the Arab and Islamic right and duty,  naturally, there is much room for action within the framework of  Jerusalem and the holy places in Palestine. I should recall  that there is dearth of discussion in this field within the  Islamic and Arab framework. In fact, we need to sharpen the  conscience and mind. I believe that seeking assistance from an  elite of scholars in the Islamic world, for which the  opportunity is open, is a very important and critical issue at  this particular stage. [end recording]    His Highness Crown Prince Hasan this evening took the  constitutional oath as regent, during his majesty the king's  presence abroad, before the cabinet and in the presence of  speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper price hits 1988 low but recovers on strike fears THE DOLLAR price of copper, the world's most heavily-traded metal, dropped to its lowest level since August 1988 on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. However, the fall was partly reversed in late trading by news that miners in Chile, the world's largest copper producer, might go on strike. Analysts suggested the metal's price had some way to fall before it reflected the true state of supply and demand in the market. For much of last year the price was held up in a market support operation by Sumitomo, the Japanese trading house, but this support has now apparently been removed. Copper for delivery in three months touched Pounds 1,149.50 a tonne at one point yesterday before it recovered to close at Pounds 1,153.75, down Pounds 3.50 on Tuesday's close. The price has fallen by Pounds 26.50 a tonne or 2 per cent in the past three days. Chile's Copper Miners' Confederation is threatening to strike if the government goes ahead with plans to speed up development of the country's natural resources by allowing private companies to take control of some of the ore reserves of Codelco (the state-owned Chile Copper Corporation). Some analysts suggested the union was posturing and was unlikely to carry out the strike threat. Interruptions to supply have plagued the copper industry for some years but have become a much less important consideration during the recession. Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's largest mining company, suggested recently that there should be enough copper at all its stages of production to satisfy demand. 'This applies not just over the next few years but also in 1992, even when account is taken of present and prospective supply disruptions,' he said. Against this background, said Mr Crowson, 'copper prices will tend to equate to the marginal cash costs of production of those mines which are sensitive to the balance between prices and costs'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Wuhan, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Some 100,000  industrial workers, laid off by their factories here in Wuhan,  have found jobs in the city's flourishing service sector.    The new work is proving to be even more rewarding than their  original jobs, both for themselves and for the city authority.  Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province in central China.    An official from the city's office for the service  industries  said that these redundant workers are now playing an important  role in restaurants, commodity retailing, labor market and other  fields of the service sector.    If they had not got those jobs, the official said, their  original enterprises and the government would have had to pay at  least 500 million yuan a year in unemployment compensation to  them.    To create new jobs for them, the city authority spent 300  million yuan over the past years on the opening of 400 markets.  It even provided money to those who wanted to start their own  businesses but faced a shortage of funds, the official said.    The city authority has also sponsored the opening of nearly  50 vacation schools and training centers, through which some  40,000 redundant workers were prepared for new professions,  according to the official.    Enterprises also got help from the city authority to create  new jobs for those laid off by them. For example, the official  said, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation has successfully  re-employed 20,000 workers it had laid off, using them in its  many new business ventures.    The official said that the bringing in of these new forces  had resulted in a great boost for the city's service industry,  which produced a turnover of more than 10 billion yuan in 1993,  almost four times higher than in 1984.</p>

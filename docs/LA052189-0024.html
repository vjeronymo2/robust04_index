			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADRIENNE RICH: POET, POLITICIAN AND THE FEMINIST OF WILD PATIENCE  </P> <P> A "wild patience" has taken the women's movement this far, to borrow the title  phrase from one of Adrienne Rich's poetry collections, a mix of enthusiasm and  endurance that has allowed women to pile one little gain upon another. That  patience kept the feminist movement alive and functioning at the grass roots  level during the eight Reagan years, the poet says, and now it is emerging more  publicly again.  </P> <P> Where feminism has been and where it is going are inescapable themes for one of  America's pre-eminent poets. Rich, who lives in Santa Cruz when she is not off  giving readings or teaching one term each year at Stanford University, may be  feeling particularly reflective about feminism and its role in her poetry and  her life these days. She turned 60 this month. And W. W. Norton has published a  new collection of her poetry, "Time's Power," this month.  </P> <P> The most visible sign that the movement remains strong was the turnout of  300,000 -- or more -- people in Washington last month in support of women's  right to abortion. The march "attracted a huge amount of media attention  because abortion arouses emotion," she said. But she added that the public  needs to be aware that much more is going on as women work to secure  reproductive rights -- that is, everything from better prenatal care to  reduction of unnecessary Caesarean section births.  </P> <P> Another sign of vitality, Rich said recently, is "the ever-increasing  leadership of women of color." Women are giving vast attention to combatting  racism in society, she said, and many met just last month on the campus of the  University of Iowa to talk about what unites and what oppresses them. This  focus is necessary, Rich explains, so that women can work together trying to  resolve issues ranging from the quality of their children's educations to the  seriousness with which their own views are taken.  </P> <P> "As a white woman, my world is informed the more conscious I am made . . . of  the realities of other women different from myself." Speaking of these issues  means speaking of politics. There are those poetry critics who still find  Rich's work too political, as if, Rich interjects, one can separate politics  from life. "What you see when you look out of your window is political and what  you notice that you choose to put down on the page" is political.  </P> <P> "Some of the worst political poetry I know is written by white poets who go to  places like the Caribbean on a two-week vacation and write poems about the  beautiful bougainvillea and the palm trees and the beautiful women and choose  not to see, choose not to write about or even consider the poverty and misery  of those countries . . . . It would pass for being nonpolitical but I say it's  political because that kind of poem not only excludes but distorts reality so  frighteningly."  </P> <P> Too many Americans think art and politics don't mix. "You have art off on one  side being serene and decorative and inspiring and graceful and many other  things, and then you have politics, which is low-down and dirty and also which  is inevitably deforming to art. This is not the view in a great many cultures."  </P> <P> People believe "poetry will lose its density and its complexity and its  richness if it is informed by politics." In contrast, Rich thinks her own  poetry has actually moved away from simplistic viewpoints through her  involvement in politics.  </P> <P> Feminism, Rich argues, provides new working situations "where your ideas are  not only tolerated and . . . allowed to be spoken but are carried on and picked  up and amplified and where you're being stimulated by others who are  like-minded but have different perspectives on the same reality. That is such a  charge. It can be incredibly depressing to feel that you are the only person in  a situation who is thinking these thoughts and that you are going to have to  be, let's say, the Jew in the room or the lesbian in the room or the feminist  in the room and they (the men) will listen to you with tolerance and go on  doing business as usual.  </P> <P> "Politics enriches one's world view; it does not limit one's world view. When I  say politics in this case, I am talking of the politics of opposition, the  politics of empowering the disempowered."  </P> <P> Rich, one sees from her conversation and her writing, has "a dream of a common  language." If her poetry has a single motivating impulse, it is "the drive to  connect, to make communication with others, to extend a hand outward hoping  that another hand will reach it, to make bridges. That making of connections is  very important. It's crucial in my politics and it's crucial in my poetry."  </P> <P> Rich finds herself more oriented toward the Pacific since moving to California  from Massachusetts in 1984. She has had rheumatoid arthritis since she was 21,  and the Northeastern winters had grown harder and harder to endure. Living in  California has not necessarily made her more creative, she says with a  characteristic wry smile, but it has made her "differently creative." Very much  a poet of landscape, there is new landscape to discover. "I don't think it's a  bad thing in your life to have your whole orientation completely switched  geographically."  </P> <P> Critics have called Rich everything from an "exquisitely sensitive and  brilliant poet" to one guilty of "radical witchery." Much honored, she  nonetheless once rejected the National Book Award for herself but, with fellow  poets and nominees Alice Walker and Audre Lord, accepted it for all women.  </P> <P> She lives with poetry in her head. "I'm going about various things and as long  as the various things are not too demanding or pressing I can keep the poem in  the forefront . . . . I also need a lot of time to read poems. It's important  for me to feed myself with poetry."  </P> <P> One may not be able to make a living being a poet, Rich says, but now "one can  be a poet and make a living" teaching, giving readings, working as an editor.  The American poetry scene is richer now than it was when she started publishing  in the 1950s in a figurative sense, she thinks, because "more diverse voices  are being heard. The women's movement obviously opened up realms for women  poets that had simply not been there."  </P> <P> There has also been a proliferation of poetry by African-Americans,  Asian-Americans, American Indians, Latinos. "In the 1950s there were basically  two known camps of American poets, the beats and the academics. They were  almost entirely white males, both of them."  </P> <P> Rich has long kept track of herself, as she puts it, by keeping a journal. At  60, "you are looking backward on the past with a much bigger vista than you can  when you're 16 or 26 or 36. Some things that loomed very large are flattened  out and other things you see which you never saw before. So that's partly the  meaning of 'Time's Power,' the power of time to transform your personal  landscape."  </P> <P> Much of Rich's poetry is autobiography; some is fiction. Columbia University  literature professor Carolyn Heilbrun says that Rich, "more than anyone else,"  revolutionized women's autobiography. She "sought again and again to identify  herself in new ways, ways guaranteed to be upsetting to the neat, orderly world  from which she came."  </P> <P> Rich's work speaks particularly to women but she seems to be trying to push  both sexes toward a realization that neither should be the sole definer of  reality. "The vision of reality that we have been given has been filtered  through the male and has been structured by males and even our view of  ourselves has been structured" by men. "You do not understand the history of  the human species if you do not understand the history of both genders."  </P> <P> Rich was waiting, with wild patience, for an organized feminist movement for a  long time, "thinking my thoughts in secret, reading Simone de Beauvoir and Mary  Wollstonecraft and wishing I could know those women and talk to them and then  beginning to know women who thought that way and had that kind of a fire and  hunger for freedom."  </P> <P> Had she grown up with a different kind of history, "I can imagine myself having  become very eccentric, a very encoded poet who wrote obscure, difficult poems  because she didn't want to expose herself too much and whose energy was very  much given to concealment of various kinds. For me, feminism's political vision  of the world was such an endowment of energy. It released so much energy into  my poetry."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Someday if someday ever comes we'll go  </P> <P> back and reread those poems and manifestoes  </P> <P> that so enraged us in each other's hand  </P> <P> I'll say, But damn, you wrote it so I  </P> <P> couldn't write it off  </P> <P> You'll say  </P> <P> I read you always, even when I hated you  </P> <P> From "Negotiations," 1986  </P> <P> Politics,  </P> <P> you'd say, is an unworthy name  </P> <P> for what we're after.  </P> <P> What we're after  </P> <P> is not that clear to me, if politics  </P> <P> is an unworthy name.  </P> <P> From "Rift," 1980  </P></p>

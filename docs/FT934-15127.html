			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Foreign banks stall Ferruzzi deal FOREIGN banks owed L6,500bn (Dollars 4.1bn) by the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison empire are refusing to comply with the timetable for acceptance of a moratorium on interest payments. Representatives of Italian banks, owed 75 per cent of Ferruzzi-Montedison's overall debt of L28,000bn, have agreed in principle to accept a freeze on interest payments due this year as part of a radical restructuring plan of Italy's second-largest private group. However, one of the foreign creditors yesterday indicated that it would be very premature to talk of an agreement. Representatives of 20 of the most exposed of the 110 foreign banks, which met on Monday in Milan, split into two groups. The meetings were primarily intended to explain the restructuring plan for Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the quoted financial holding, and for Montedison, the industrial group controlled by Ferfin. The restructuring plan, drawn up by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, and endorsed last week by the Bank of Italy, aims at selling off non-core business to reduce debt, consolidation of debt and recapitalisation. It includes a L800bn fund to cover small creditors needs and dissuade them from boycotting the plan. A full meeting of all the foreign banks, originally to be held in Zurich on Thursday, is expected to be held in Milan. Only then will the restructuring plan be formally distributed to all the foreign creditors. The document runs to nearly 600 pages and it is thought they are unlikely to make up their minds this week. Representatives of all the Italian banks meanwhile are due to meet today to give their formal approval to the restructuring plan and the debt moratorium. The foreign banks' unwillingness to give a quick endorsement is thought unlikely to prevent the holding on Thursday of the board meetings of Ferfin and Montedison to approve their half-yearly results. These were postponed on September 30 because the administrators were unable to write into the accounts the beneficial effects of a debt moratorium. Rejection of the plan risks bankruptcy proceedings for Ferruzzi-Montedison. The administrators of Ferruzzi-Montedison are arguing that bankruptcy could lead to greater losses than the L1,500bn cost of a debt moratorium. The debt freeze will provide breathing space for the operating companies, controlled by the Ferruzzi family until the collapse in May, to lift profitability.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: TV FAMILIES JUST DON'T GET PICTURE  </P> <P> A few years ago, the Cosby clan gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the family  sitcom and brought it back to life. TV families appeared in every conceivable  combination. There is a mother raising two children alone, three children  raising their grandfather alone, three guys with a house full of kids (I have  no idea to whom they belong), adopted parents, laminated families from several  marriages, and an aunt who raises three boys whose mother split due to contract  problems. There are blue-collar families, white-collar families and  ring-around-the-collar families.  </P> <P> I have followed closely the lives of these households and have yet to see one  that parallels my own: a family that can go through 30 minutes without a single  laugh. Sometimes we go for weeks! If we had a laugh-track, it wouldn't laugh.  </P> <P> I think I've figured out why. There are glaring discrepancies between real life  and sitcoms. In a series, the parents are always wise and profound. They pass  out advice as if they were passing out napkins at a picnic. In the last five  minutes, the kids realize their parents are once again infallible and thank  them for setting them right.  </P> <P> Let's talk real life. Your child buys a used car with 210,000 miles on it. You  tell him it won't run. It doesn't. You predict he will spend the rest of his  life visiting his car in a garage. He does. You tell him it was the biggest  mistake of his entire life. He sells it for three times what he paid for it.  </P> <P> Sitcom parents are protected by contracts. They are not going to get killed off  because they're stars with lines. If something bad happens to them, they'll  recover.  </P> <P> In reality, parents live on the edge. When you climb into the car with a child  who is on his fifth "temp" and the car radio renders you sterile, there are no  guarantees you are ever coming back.  </P> <P> Real-life teen-agers speak only five words a year to their parents, yet on  television they bond their brains out. They all sit down to the dinner table  together (all on one side of the table facing the camera). When was the last  time that happened in your house?  </P> <P> For some reason, family comedy always has the siblings at odds with one  another. Insults and threats get big laughs. The reality is that it's kids  versus parents. Any couple foolish enough to have three children will be  outvoted for the rest of their lives. They become the great minority.  </P> <P> I wrote a family sitcom once that incorporated reality into the script. The  powers that be said it looked like we didn't love one another and advised me to  put more laughs in. It was canceled in eight weeks. My family is still playing  . . . every week.  </P></p>

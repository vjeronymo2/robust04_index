			<p>CSO     [Text] In lowering the interest rate by 0.5 points on  Wednesday 11 May, the Bundesbank hit hard. True, the rise of  long-term rates that has been taking place for many weeks  required a gesture as significant as it is symbolic. Because the  signal given by the Bundesbank is primarily addressed to  financial operators, whose reaction is worrying central banks.  This issue was discussed by the big moneymen last weekend in  Basel.    Europe is faced by the grave danger of seeing its long-term  interest rates continue to stretch at the risk of strangling the  recovery that is beginning. The U.S. Federal Reserve has put in  motion this dangerous movement. By deciding--quite logically--to  raise short-term rates, which had dropped to abnormally low  levels, its chairman, Alan Greenspan, provoked a rise in U.S.  long-term interest rates that the fear of overheating the  economy, and hence of the possible return of inflation, has  accelerated. The tragedy is that this upward movement extended  to Europe, where the situation is very different because it is  just emerging from a deep recession.    How is it possible to put an end to this contagion, as  fearsome as it is irrational? How could operators be convinced  that it is possible, and logical, to decouple the evolution of  the interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic? The decision  of the Bundesbank is the most adequate. First, because it proves  that German and European monetary authorities do not fear a  resurgence of inflation. Secondly, because it tends to pull down  these notorious long-term rates.    In this confrontation, the position of the Bank of France is  an uncomfortable one. Indeed, for many weeks France's long-term  interest rates rose more rapidly than Germany's. This phenomenon  leads to questioning the efforts that have taken place over many  decades to prove the pertinence of the so-called strong franc  policy. One can understand the concern of the bank governor,  Jean-Claude Trichet, about whom it must nevertheless be said  that the recent reopening of the debate on the other economic  policy did not help him. The problem is that this debate may  well develop as the presidential election draws closer.</p>

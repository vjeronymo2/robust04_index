			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (10): Defeated parties prove resilient - 'Pendularity' is an issue, but Mirko Lauer reports that the weak political spot is the economy FOR Peruvians in business nowadays there seems to be but one issue in local politics: how to avoid 'pendularity'. This is the local word which refers to the return of the political parties defeated by Mr Alberto Fujimori in the 1990 elections and then ousted by him from Congress in his April 1992 coup. The parties are Accion Popular and Partido Popular Cristiano, on the right; the Social-democratic Apra party; and an archipelago of leftist parties. Business interests in Peru fear that any combination of these parties in power would mean an end to Mr Fujimori's neo-liberal economic policies and the return of high inflation, subsidies and foreign exchange controls - or protectionism. There is also the question of whether the parties can provide political stability, economic efficiency, and the will to fight what will remain a bloody war against the remnants of Sendero Luminoso's (Shining Path's) 5,000-strong guerrilla army on the field. And yet there is a widespread feeling that Mr Fujimori's authoritarian style of government cannot run for long without increasing strong-arm tactics (something international pressure presently impedes) or without considerable doses of popularity (something his economic policies are starting to erode). The very idea that ex-President Alan Garcia (1985-1990), the exiled leader of the Apra party, whose administration swamped Peru in hyperinflation, could once again rule the country, led Peru's businessmen to support Mr Fujimori's April 1992 coup against Congress. Sixteen months after the coup Mr Fujimori is still railing against the politicians, but the message has lost most of its bite. Unpopular as they now are, the parties and their leaders are proving resilient. Keeping them at bay in a low intensity democracy such as Mr Fujimori's is proving unhealthy for the country's political stability. Preventing pendularity has meant a freer hand for the Peruvian military  - and, consequently, persistent violations of human rights. Most opposition leaders, with the exception of Mr Garcia, a staunch critic of neo-liberal policies, have so far expressed the need to maintain Mr Fujimore's economic reform programme. But this has not held them back from giving Mr Fujimori a bumpy political ride since his coup. The worst of the bumps so far have come from outside Peru, in the form of international pressure on the subject of human rights. An attempted coup last November 13 (the first for 18 years) and a good showing of the parties in the past January's municipal elections have reminded everyone that the pillars of Mr Fujimori's power - control of the army and success in the popularity polls - are not quite the democratic stability he claims for his regime. Mr Fujimori's contribution to the fight against pendularity is to seek re-election. First, he needs to win the coming October 31 constitutional referendum. His closest backers, especially the actual and potential buyers in the country's privatisation drive, will not hear about Mr Fujimori leaving his post in 1995. According to congressman Mr Victor Joy Way, China's Shougang Corporation (so far, Peru's most important new foreign investor) has pressed him to run for re-election. Stability has become identified with Mr Fujimori's permanence. This, of course, is the classic dictatorial scenario, implying that any pressure for more democracy inevitably appears to threaten stability. Because there exists the idea that pendularity may be in the hearts of an impoverished and expectant population, and that sooner or later the fickle Peruvian electoral mood will swing away from Mr Fujimori, potential investors are in a mood of more or less permanent wait-and-see, with more local and foreign money moving through the brisk Lima stock market than into its productive ventures. A recent opinion poll, conducted in Peru's main cities by the Imasen private research institute, has revealed that employment is the main concern of about 70 per cent of the population, and that worries about terrorism have diminished in importance - about 30 per cent of the population remains anxious. Mr Fujimori's weak political spot is the economy. The reforms have failed to produce any trickle-down effect so far, and as fear of a resurgence of hyperinflation and terrorism recedes, Peruvians are starting to grumble about falling salaries and rising unemployment.

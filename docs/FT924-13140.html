			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hoover Europe drags Maytag into the red MAYTAG, the US home appliance manufacturer that owns the Hoover brand in Europe, yesterday reported a Dollars 50.2m loss after tax in the three months to end-September, compared with a Dollars 24.2m profit a year ago. The loss came after a one-off Dollars 95m reorganisation charge, which Maytag had already announced, and some accounting changes. However, even with these factors stripped out, the appliance manufacturer said that operating profits would have been Dollars 39.1m, down from Dollars 53.5m a year earlier. It blamed continued losses in Europe - Hoover Europe produced a Dollars 16.2m deficit in the first nine months of 1992, on sales of Dollars 346.9m, compared with a Dollars 8.9m loss in the first three quarters of 1991 - together with the costs of a new facility in Tennessee, a new product line, competitive pressures, and general economic conditions. Last month, Maytag announced it was talking to Germany's Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, about an alliance.</p>

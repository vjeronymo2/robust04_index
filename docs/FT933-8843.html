			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Management: A literary union - Martin Mulligan examines how the fledgling Hodder Headline is coping with post-merger uncertainty / Euromanagers to watch A merger's aftermath is a tense time in any industry and nowhere more so than in the volatile world of book publishing. When the merged firms represent two very different kinds of publishing, the friction can be intense. Tim Hely Hutchinson, group chief executive of the new-born Hodder Headline, should be keenly aware of the dangers he faces. More than a decade ago Robert Maxwell headhunted him to help restore order to the industrial chaos after the merger of the aggressive, young Futura paperbacks and the established, hard-cover house Macdonald. A bitter staff dispute about redundancies at Macdonald lasted four months and Pounds 1.5m was lost in the year before Hely Hutchinson took charge. When he left in 1986 the company was once again in profit. Today, however, he is facing an arguably greater challenge with the merger of his ambitious young company Headline and the venerable, privately-owned Hodder &amp; Stoughton, which has created the fifth largest British publishing group. Hely Hutchinson's career at 39 resembles that of an executive character from a fast-paced thriller on his own Headline list. He is single and drives a silver Alfa Romeo. He is descended from Irish aristocracy - the family seat is in County Tipperary. The son of the Earl of Donoughmore, Eton and Oxford educated, his background blends a colourful cocktail of romantic appeal and success that feature writers have detailed ad nauseam. The years spent working in Maxwell's shadow provide a rich source of anecdotes and questions. How, for instance, did he thwart Maxwell's regular attempts to turn Macdonald into his own personal publishing house? Hely Hutchinson confirms that he stalled Maxwell's pet projects by turning a blind eye to the telescope, encouraging the chief quietly to abandon his craziest schemes. 'I had two jobs - running Macdonald and running a relationship with Maxwell,' he says. His ambition for Headline - the firm he founded with venture capital and the expertise of his colleagues Sian Thomas and Sue Fletcher in 1986 - was evident from the start. 'Headline was always the platform to do something substantial; it was never going to be just a niche player,' he says. A profit-driven, popular consumer publisher from the outset - as you might expect from the publisher of Follies of the Flesh, The Hello] Cookbook and Buddy Holly is Alive and Well on Ganymede - Headline was never going to fit the traditional British publishing mould. Hodder, by contrast, represents just that: a respected family firm founded in 1868 with an evangelical purpose, boasting an established educational division, and a distinguished backlist which includes Le Carre, Enid Blyton and the Bible. Hely Hutchinson has a vision of 'a conglomerate with soul'. What he has on his hands for the moment are two very recently separate publishing entities and editors on each side who start from different publishing assumptions. It will take undoubted energy and diplomacy to co-ordinate them without mishap. He plays down the merger's possible hazards. 'I do not see that there will be any culture clash, especially as the lists differ so,' he says. Nor is he uneasy at the expansion from 170 to more than 600 staff. His advice to managers in the midst of merger is: act swiftly. 'There are inevitable fears, uncertainty and unhappiness in the early days of a merger. I intend to get these out of the way as quickly as possible.' He regards 'bottlenecking' or vacillating about decisions as the worst sin a manager can commit. He is clearly uncomfortable though when it comes to discussing the ultimate size of Hodder Headline. 'The immediate thrusts of the merger will be to reduce costs and simultaneously to stimulate growth in the editorial departments, as Hodder &amp; Stoughton has been starved of resources during the past few years,' he says, quickly adding: 'No one needs to feel threatened. I don't recognise any differences between people as to their origins within the group. Everyone within the group now is Hodder Headline; it doesn't matter where they came from. No division is for sale.' So far, 72 jobs have gone, two-thirds falling on the administrative side of the business. A relocation will follow next spring when Hodder's old distribution centre near Sevenoaks in Kent is closed, affecting about 150 people. Headline's distribution company, Bookpoint, in Abingdon, Berkshire, will be expanded and 70 people taken on. Hely Hutchinson says that with these measures the 'major UK job saving programme' will be complete. The need to safeguard Headline's entrepreneurial spirit which has brought it so far - from a share price of 87.55 when it came to market in April 1991 to today's 355, and figuring frequently in the bestseller lists with Dean Koontz's supernatural thrillers and Ellis Peters' medieval whodunnits - ranks high on his list of priorities. Hodder Headline will comprise autonomous sales teams for 10 separate lists, able in theory to react more quickly to perceived openings in the market. Each unit will be headed by its own managing director. Martin Neild, former key accounts director of Pan Macmillan, is to run fiction and non-fiction. Hely Hutchinson explains: 'A publisher must be good at buying and at selling. Selling books is not like selling socks or shirts; the judgments require more subtlety. The industry is relatively short of all-rounders who are competent to buy and sell.' His conclusion is that the all-rounders heading his divisions should be free to trust their publishing intuitions and, crucially, to remain sensitive to feedback from retailers. Is this dream of a versatile publishing giant, formed of such heterogeneous units and guaranteeing quality at the same time as profits, truly attainable? Hely Hutchinson's growing number of fans insist he will be able to carry it off. His progress across the Hodder Headline tightrope will be watched with industry-wide fascination.</p>

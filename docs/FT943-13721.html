			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (27): Finrand history South African exchange controls have been in place for decades, writes Mark Suzman. The financial rand was first introduced after the Sharpeville riots of 1961 to staunch massive capital outflows. Although it was briefly scrapped in 1983, renewed political unrest forced the finrand's reintroduction in 1985 following then President PW Botha's notorious Rubicon speech and the subsequent run on the currency. Financial rands comprise a pool of rands that can only be used by foreign investors, and trade at a significant discount to the commercial rand, the currency used for all ordinary current account transactions. Finrands are created when a non-resident sells an asset to a South African. The payment is made in rand and deposited at a local bank. It can only be used again by another non-resident in exchange for foreign currency. In addition to acting as a penalty against capital withdrawal, the finrand also serves as an investment incentive for new foreign investment because all yields are remitted in commercial rands, giving a greatly augmented return, thus helping maintain foreign reserves and prevent capital flight. While it does limit the outflow of capital, however, the finrand also imposes serious costs on the economy. Most obviously, by creating severe distortions in the currency market, it encourages asset-stripping and 'round-tripping' by companies to enjoy the benefits of the discount between the two currencies. Because the finrand is relatively thinly traded, moreover, speculation in times of political uncertainty can lead to wild gyrations in its value. And although the currency is designed to attract foreign investors, its volatility is a strong deterrent, as capital gains can be eaten away by currency losses.</p>

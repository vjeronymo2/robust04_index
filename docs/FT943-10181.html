			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / International Company News: First-half income dives 28% at UBS - Weak financial markets take their toll of Swiss banks Union Bank of Switzerland has reported a 28 per cent slump in first-half consolidated net income to SFr929m (Dollars 703.7m) mainly because of a two-thirds crash in profits from trading. The bank described the result as 'satisfactory despite the unfavourable market environment'. It remained optimistic for the full year, expecting financial markets to recover and economies in many industrialised countries to strengthen. It would not forecast whether its 1994 net profit would be higher or lower than last year's SFr2.27bn. The UBS results are broadly similar to those reported by Credit Suisse a week ago. The third of the big Swiss banks, Swiss Bank Corporation, is due to report its first-half results on August 16, and they too are expected to be well down from last year's high levels. UBS's operating profit before taxes and provisions fell 28.6 per cent to SFr1.97bn in the first half, mainly because trading income plunged from SFr1.5bn to SFr493m. UBS said the surprising rise in interest rates depressed customer demand for derivative instruments. Income from foreign exchange, banknote and precious metal trading also fell short of expectations. Meanwhile, net interest income was down 6.9 per cent to SFr1.78bn, as the rise in interest rates contracted margins. Commission income was up 10.8 per cent to SFr2.14bn. Operating expenses fell by 2.8 per cent to SFr2.64bn, as profit-related compensation pushed down personnel expenses by 4.4 per cent to SFr1.85bn. The drastic SFr1.05bn fall in trading profit raises the question of whether a triple A rated bank like UBS should be so dependent on this volatile activity. The bank's spokeswoman said the group believed its profit sources were 'well balanced' and that the volatility of trading profits was normally within reasonable limits. Income from trading was extraordinarily high in the first half of last year, she observed. At the operating level, the UBS performance is similar to the 27 per cent profit fall announced by Credit Suisse a week ago. But UBS has apparently not benefited as much as its rival from the drop in provisioning needs this year. Credit Suisse, the flagship bank in the CS Holding financial services group, did not give precise figures for provisions, but indicated that they had almost totally offset the fall in first-half operating income. Net income, it said, was 'only slightly down'. UBS reported a 26.4 per cent drop in provisions to SFr790m, but that did not prevent net income from falling 28 per cent. The reason is that Credit Suisse's provisions in the whole of 1993 were much larger than those of UBS, both in absolute terms and in relation to net income. UBS's total consolidated assets at June 30 were SFr337.4bn, 8.4 per cent higher than at the end of last year. Shareholders' equity advanced 0.6 per cent over the same period to SFr21.8bn.</p>

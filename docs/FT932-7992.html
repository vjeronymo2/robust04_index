			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / PowerGen poised to win east German energy contract A UTILITIES consortium headed by Britain's PowerGen and the US-based NRG is close to completing a contract which will give it a 44 per cent share in generating power at a plant in eastern Germany. The deal, involving construction of a small regional plant at Schkopau, near Leipzig, could help to open up Germany's utilities to outside competition, officials from Vereinigte Energie AG (Veag), the east German utilities company, said yesterday. The contract is for PowerGen and NRG to build a 400MW power station. Until recently, Veba Kraftwerke Ruhr had planned to build a 900MW station at Schkopau. VKR is a 100 per cent subsidiary of PreussenElektra, which undertakes the electricity operations of Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate. The decision to allow PowerGen and NRG to negotiate a 44 per cent share at Schkopau follows lengthy negotiations between the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of eastern German industry, Veag, which controls 70 per cent of the region's energy production, and VKR. Veag is technically still under the Treuhand, but legally it is controlled by Germany's three giant utilities companies, and the five smaller ones, following a treaty signed in 1990. These include PreussenElektra, RWE Energie and Bayernwerk, western Germany's powerful utilities. Under the terms of the treaty, the Stromvertrag, eastern Germany's regional utilities are obliged to buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag over the next 20 years as a means of underwriting large investments needed to modernise eastern Germany's energy sector. This treaty, however, has had the effect of making it difficult to introduce competition into the energy sector in the region. The consortium had earlier tried to seek a stake in generating power at Lippendorf. But the negotiations collapsed because PowerGen and NRG could not seek guarantees to gain access to the high voltage grid in order to sell its energy. The power generators at Schkopau will be fuelled by Mibrag, eastern Germany's giant lignite mining complex. PowerGen and NRG have the sole negotiating rights to buy Mibrag, which is under the Treuhand. Modern methods in the pipeline, Page 16</p>

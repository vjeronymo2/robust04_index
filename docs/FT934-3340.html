			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: Gothic goes way over the top - Cinema ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES (PG) Barry Sonnenfeld AMERICAN HEART (15) Martin Bell THE SECRET ADVENTURES OF TOM THUMB (12) Dave Borthwick OZU SEASON Christmas] We recognise it from the blood-dimmed tide of non-Christmassy film fare that washes up on our shores each year from Hollywood. Thanks to the time lag in US-UK release patterns, what the Americans get at Halloween we British get at Yuletide. We leave the front door looking for joy and jollity; we reach the cinema to be greeted by strangely-dressed persons shrieking 'Trick or treat?' Addams Family Values is no treat and could well be investigated under charges of trickery. Soon after seeing the film I looked up the word 'comedy' in a dictionary. It says (Shorter OED), 'A light and amusing stage-play' - or by extension film - 'with a happy conclusion to its plot.' Even allowing for licensed exceptions to this such as black comedy and horror comedy, what do we make of a movie that dons floor-length Gothic garb, assembles a cast of overactive, in-your-face ghouls, cracks one unfunny gag after another and deploys an interminable series of near-homicidal set pieces. These range from a gold-digging black-widow nanny (Joan Cusack), out to ensnare and then snuff out Uncle Fester, to the two children, her charges, who keep trying to murder their new baby brother. (Just what we in Britain need: a comedy about infanticidal pre-teeners.) I confess I hated the first Addams film even though millions, to judge by box-office receipts, did not. I suspect it won its audiences, like Ghostbusters before it, by jumping on them from a great height. Large with OTT acting, special effects and subtlety-bypass decor, these movies come down on the viewer like collapsing scenery. You have to laugh: either you are too dazed to do anything else or you feel that more scenery will be dropped on you if you do not. What astonishes us about Addams Family Values is that it did not attract a script doctor during pre-production. The film does not know when to stop, has little idea of how to begin, and moves forward by a process of 'Quick, who's got the next gimmick?' jolts and nudges. Paul Rudnik's script and Barry Sonnenfeld's direction take the over-obvious and then rake it with spotlights. It is not enough for 'Thing', the dismembered hand, to put in the odd surprise appearance on someone's shoulder. He must dance, somersault and skateboard. It is not enough for Gomez and Morticia to do a slinky-camp tango in a cellar restaurant. They must stomp, somersault and literally set the place on fire. Oh the sadness of such frenzy. Good spoof Gothic, as the late Mr Vincent Price taught us, needs as much subtlety and poetry as good True Gothic. Santa Claus should give the cast, crew and director a free pass to an aesthetic detox clinic. Talented troupers like Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia can then get the whole series and its spell out of their system and return to making good grown-up films or even good children's films. Did you ever see Miss Huston in The Witches or Prizzi's Honour? They are both on TV over Christmas: save your Addams admission money. Or alternatively give it to the Actors In Crisis fund. Another example this week is Jeff Bridges, starring in another un-Christmassy film called American Heart. Shoulder-long hair, industrial-strength chin stubble and viva-Zapata moustache announce 'character'; just as a funny accent and portly gait announced 'character' in Bridges's last role, the killer in The Vanishing. These are the signs of a man passing from his handsome lead heyday into that grim half-world where Tinseltown no longer offers easy-option starring roles. So the actor starts exercising hitherto unused acting muscles in a bid to re-qualify as a serious thespian. British ex-documentarist Martin Bell here places a fiction filter over the clear-eyed camera-sense he brought to his raw, moving portrait of Seattle low life, Streetwise. Staying in Seattle but swapping the documentary for drama a these, he and writer Peter Silverman push ex-convict Jeff Bridges into a DIY rehabilitation programme involving manual labour (window-cleaning), dreams of flight to Alaska, love (Lucinda Jenney) and coping with a mother-deprived, crime-prone teenage son (Edward Furlong). For a lost hero searching for himself, this is a busy programme. But then movies like this have their shopping lists of Important Themes, and we the audience must sit in the trolley while the director wheels us from shelf to shelf. We are never caught up in the expedition and, like many shopping trips, this one ends in tears at the check-out counter. Plots collide, tempers fray and the film's makers find they have not brought enough pay-offs to cover all the goods. (How does the wounded hero make it to the ferry? What will he and his son do in Alaska?) As for the film's star, one wishes there were a Santa in the store. Old Cottonwool could pull Mr Bridges out from the queue, dust him down and tell him to drop the over anxious chameleonism and go back to being, at least in part, himself. For your next Christmas treat welcome to The Secret Adventures Of Tom Thumb. This does for the well-loved fable . . . well, let us just say that it does for the well-loved fable. Wielding blood, shadows, nasty insects, hypodermics and pixilated movement - even the humans in this claymation-plus-live-action film move in eerie stop-motion - the Bristol animation team 'bolexbrothers' create a fairy tale from hell. But allowing for cries of seasonal dismay, this is oddly impressive. Once again a Halloween movie, this time homemade, has hit the screens a month late. And the redfaced BBC might prefer that it had not hit them at all. Having funded the project, Auntie then shelved it in horror until the film got loose and started to win festival prizes. With its blend of Sci-Fi and lower-depths squalor, with its foetus-like hero moving through landscapes wriggling with the surreal, it packs a horrible, fascinating punch: as if Hieronymus Bosch had taken over Jackanory. To calm yourself down, you might visit the Yasujiro Ozu season at London's Renoir. Six cooling masterworks from the Japanese director of Tokyo Story, Late Spring and An Autumn Afternoon. Things do not so much 'happen' in Ozu films as exist in a state of suspended dramatic animation. The human heartbeat is there, but anyone used to Addams Family films had better take a stethoscope. It beats as much in the scenes of plain domestic realism (Kitchen Sink goes Buddhist) as in the occasional flurry of high drama like a dropped rice bowl, a visit from Granny, a bad school report. These films will do for Christmas, especially if you like your Christmases peaceful. Less, in the hands of a master, is so much more.</p>

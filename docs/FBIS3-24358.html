			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Vaganov: "National Security as a Systemic </F> Problem: An In-House Scientific Council Has Been Created in the  Structure of the Security Council of Russia"]    [Text] The Scientific Council (SC) under the auspices of  the Security Council of the Russian Federation, which was formed  by Edict No. 1807 of the president of the Russian Federation of  1 November 1993, held its first meeting last Friday.  "Organizational-presentational" was how Academician Vladimir  Pirumov, chairman of the SC and vice president of the Russian  Academy of Natural Sciences, defined its tasks. The creation of  such a structure in the system of the highest state authorities  is an unprecedented step for Russia.    As Vladimir Pirumov declared, there is an insistent need  today for the shaping of official policy in respect to the  protection of man, society, and the environment against the  ever-increasing impact of a variety of dangers. The preliminary  structure of the research work of the SC will include such  sections as foreign policy, defense, economic, and environmental  security and the fight against crime and information security.  In addition, the Scientific Council is being entrusted with  tasks of legal and information-analytical support for the  activity of the machinery of the Security Council, the  preparation of analytical material, and scientific expert  evaluation and tutorials on various federal programs.    In the geopolitical situation in which the present Russia  has  found itself, it is no longer possible to adopt the principle of  the separate assurance of security for each enumerated sphere.  This is becoming a truly comprehensive, systemic problem. On the  other hand, it is impossible to protect each and  everything--there are neither the money nor the forces. The need  to determine priorities in the sphere of security is absolutely  obvious. The difficulty of the work for the SC will be  primarily, evidently, finding the resultant of these  varidirectional vectors of interests. It was for this reason  that there was such a long and careful selection of the  composition of the Scientific Council. It consists of 27  persons. They include, for example, Anatoliy Alekseyev, chief of  the Russian Federation MVD Academy, Sergey Dyakov, chief of the  Russian Federation FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service]  Academy, Vitaliy Zhurkin, academician-secretary of the  Department of Problems of World Economics and International  Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Nikolay Karlov,  chairman of the VAK [precise expansion unknown; possibly Supreme  Arbitration Commission] of Russia, Yevgeniy Severin, general  director of the All-Russia Scientific Center of Molecular  Diagnostics and Treatment, and Vyacheslav Senchagov, rector of  the Economics Academy of the Ministry of Economics of Russia.  The other members of the SC are also burdened with no less high  degrees, titles, and positions. It is anticipated that five  "branch" groups will be created within the SC: public health  care and environmental safety, assessment of foreign policy  activity and defense and information security, conversion, and  economic, and a public and state security group.    The work plans of the SC for 1994 include discussion of  measures to limit the exodus of specialists and figures of  science and culture abroad, questions of scientific and  technological cooperation with foreign countries, a  strengthening of the legal and organizational principles of the  use and protection of Russia's scientific achievements, and  scientific and technological problems of the equipping, arming,  and special outfitting of servicemen.    Initially, however, members of the SC will, evidently, be  dealing with more prosaic matters. It was felt at the first  meeting that a system of interaction of the SC and the Security  Council has yet to be worked out. In addition, the efficiency of  the work of the Scientific Council could perfectly well be  reduced unless problems of a purely internal nature are avoided.  Thus it is contemplated that the SC will be centrally funded  (according to information available to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, it  will receive approximately R3 billion in 1994). The client of  the work will be the Security Council. And although it is  stipulated that this money must under no circumstances go to  subsidize this department or research institute or the other,  only a specific group of executants, it will, perhaps, be very  difficult to avoid lobbying attempts on the part of members of  the SC for their "own" structures.    The integration of existing efforts in the sphere of  security  in the programs planned for execution by the SC will be no less  complex a problem.    And, finally, lest the SC become a kind of elite club of  Moscow intellectuals, it will be necessary to give serious  thought to how to make rational use in its work of Russia's  regional research.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- The opposition  Democratic Party [DP] on Saturday made public a list of 51  persons it chose as witnesses and references to be used in the  planned parliamentary probe into the Sangmudae scandal. The  ruling and opposition parties have agreed to have an assembly  inspection of the suspected diversion of part of Sangmudae  construction funds into political funds in late 1992.    Acting DP Head Kim Won-ki said his party had decided to  include in the list all those suspected of having played parts  in the scandal.    Among the 29 listed references were President Kim Yong-sam,  former President No Tae-u and ex-rep. So Sok-chae. The  witnesses selected numbered 22, who included the Rev. So Eui-  hyon, disgraced ex-head of the Buddhist Chogye order  secretariat; Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae; Justice Minister Kim  Tu-hi; ex- Defense Minister Yi Chong-ku; DLP [Democratic  Liberal Party] Rep. Kim Yun-hwan; and former Chongwadae  [presidential office] Protective Service Head Yi Hyon-u.    It is not likely that all of them will actually be used as  witnesses or references in the upcoming probe as the ruling  party is determined to use only those whose role in the alleged  fund diversion can be substantiated by actual evidences.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 7, IRNA -- Ayatollah Musavi-Ardabili  and Ayatollah Azari-Qomi in an interview with a daily here  Thursday emphasized that the anti-American stance of the Islamic  revolution in Iran should continue.    Ayatollah Musavi-Ardabili, Tehran's substitute Friday prayer  leader and former chief justice, told the morning daily 'SALAM'  that those who imagined ties with the U.S. would help them make  progress, were making a big blunder. Because, he stressed, in  its relations with other nations, the U.S. adheres to no  specific objective but its hegemonistic aims.    Also commenting on relations with the U.S., Ayatollah  Azari-Qomi told the daily that it was to the benefit of the  Islamic Republic and Islam not to have ties with Washington.  The ayatollah, a theologian at Qom Seminary, further added that  although the Islamic Republic of Iran had fully severed ties  with the U.S., still whispers were being heard inside the  country on the resumption of ties with Washington. "These  murmurs should be stopped under any circumstances and this could  be done by the people themselves."    Stressing that the slogan 'Down with the U.S.' should have a  wider dimension, Ayatollah Azari-Qomi called on the press and  officials to inform the public of the positive outcome of having  no ties with the U.S.</p>

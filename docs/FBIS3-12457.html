The holy communion was chaired by Maronite Patriarch Mar  Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr, assisted by a group of patriarchs and  priests. President Ilyas al-Hirawi and his wife attended the  mass. The prime minister was represented by Minister Hagop  Demerdjian and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri was  represented by Deputy Rashid al-Khazin. A large number of  ministers, deputies, and key figures also attended.    In his homily, Patriarch Sfayr said: Some say that such  crimes happen in the best of countries, but this is not  satisfactory. There they capture the culprits, who then receive  the punishment they deserve. Here however, the perpetrators  remain unknown, either due to impotence or willingness to keep  people in the dark; both amount to the same thing. These two  reasons do not exempt the state from its responsibility for  finding the culprits; they do not alleviate the obsessions and  fears; and they do not insure safety for citizens. The Maronite  patriarch urged a state that applies right and justice and  treats all equally.    President al-Hirawi said in a speech: I came to this church  to accept condolences in the name of the whole country, and to  say that for thousands of years we have been destined to stand  fast, from Wadi Qannubin to the cedar-clad mountains, to any  spot in this sacred land. He added: I came to this church to  say, in front of Your Beatitude, the other priests, and the  representative of the Pope that we will remain faithful to this  pledge, standing fast in Lebanon.    [(Clandestine) Radio Free Lebanon in Arabic at 1010 GMT on  28  February adds: "President al-Hirawi said: We will remain  faithful to the pledge, and the hands that encroach upon Lebanon  will be cut off. Tendentious people have no place among us.  When peace began its march, they began their shameful acts."]</p>

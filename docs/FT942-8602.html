			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Thailand SE tightens rules The Stock Exchange of Thailand plans to tighten settlement regulations, Reuter reports from Bangkok. From May 25, a client buying and selling the same stock in one day will have to pay the full amount of the transaction on the third working day while receiving proceeds on the fourth. Brokers said the change was intended to stamp out contra trade in the same stock - whereby the client pays or receives only the difference between the buying and selling amounts - and dampen excessive speculation. The new ruling does not affect foreign stock- brokers who settle purchases on the third working day while getting paid on the seventh.</p>

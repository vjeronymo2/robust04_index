			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- Early this morning,  Muslim forces launched fresh offensive actions on the Gorazde  battlefront, and according to a communique issued by the command  of the Herzegovina corps, the fiercest attacks on Serb positions  are coming from Gradina and Jartiste, five kilometers from  Gorazde on the left bank of the Drina river.    Infantry attacks are being supported by artillery fire from  the very center of the town next to the facilities with Red  Cross and UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] markings. Fighting is  in progress along the entire frontline on the right bank of the  Drina river.    Chaos has descended on all bridges in the town. Strong  Muslim forces are crossing to the right bank of the Drina, while  the population is hurrying to cross to the other bank in fear of  a general disarray within the Muslim troops and a counterattack  by the Serb army as happened several days ago. Not even the  strong police force that was deployed in Gorazde for this  eventuality can secure order in the town.    Shooting can be heard in Gorazde itself this morning. It is  presumed that the Muslim police are shooting at deserters who  did not heed the mobilization call ups.    There are no details about possible casualties on either  side  in today's fighting.    The command of the Herzegovina corps links such behavior by  the Gorazde Muslims with the increase in the number of NATO  flights over the Herzegovina corps positions. These two things  have already become a rule on the Gorazde battlefront, Serb  military sources say.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An authoritative source of the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] Political Bureau has stated the following to Yemeni  news agency SABA:    At a time when the regionalist and separatist forces of  Sanaa  are continuing the war against the people and unity with the  flagrant and shameless help of foreign forces, they are still  refusing to listen to the appeals of popular and political  forces in the homeland, as well as the appeals of Arab brothers  and friends to stop this ugly and destructive war.    The appeal, issued by the national bloc of opposition on 9  May on halting the war, is one of the nationalist appeals which  condemns the choice of war which has been imposed upon the  homeland.    The people and the YSP, which has condemned the war from its  outset on 27 April, reiterates its support for the appeal made  by the national opposition bloc, proceeding from its antiwar  stance and its defense for the unity and for the Pledge and  Concord Accord.    The YSP appeals to the political and popular forces to  condemn the war and the warmongers, who have been refusing to  spare the blood of Yemenis, and to condemn the continuity of the  war and the fighting between sons of the same country.    The YSP and the armed forces' response to unity and  democracy, as well as the appeals to stop the war, falls within  the framework of our stance, which has been rejecting and  condemning the military option. [Words indistinct] on the  crimes which are being committed by the war criminals against  citizens, the armed forces, and the country's unity and future.    It will not be possible for those people to realize their  miserable illusions. The heroic resistance of the people, with  all its social forces, together with the armed forces, which  have been defending unity and democracy, has thwarted and will  thwart their illusions, which has sunk Yemen deep in this dirty  war. Furthermore, it will not be possible for them to wash their  hands of their crimes through their (?dirty interpretation).    In addition, their use of foreign forces in full view of the  world has proved their bankruptcy as well as their defeat in  front of the steadfast heroes of unity and the martyrs of the  homeland.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Resolution of the National Council of the Albanian </F> Republican Party"]    [Text] The National Council of the Albanian Republican  Party, held on 8 April 1994, reviewed the activity of the  steering committee in connection with the political situation in  the country and some aspects of economic development. After much  open discussion, the Council reached the following conclusions:    1. Political tensions have increased as a result of the  abstractionism of the Socialist Party, clothed in the garments  of renewal, and the abstractionism of its allies. Communism is  still present in Albania. The "renewal" of the Socialists,  imposed by time, is demagogy.    2. The efforts to bring the country out of the crisis have  produced some good results with the general orientation to the  free market but the optimal solution has not yet been achieved.  The optimal solution can be achieved only by means of the  republican program, which is based on the recognition and return  of private property and, especially, ownership of the land.    3. The party in power, which has the heavy burden of  governing the country, is continuing to develop a tendency to  monopolize administrative leadership and political life, with a  restraining effect on the development of democracy and the  effective use of intellectual potential. This has paved the way  for left-wing phenomena and recidivist elements from the past.    4. Corruption has taken on alarming proportions for the  present and future of the country. Efforts to combat these  manifestations, especially in the area of privatization, have  been ineffective.    5. The Republican Party provided all types of assistance to  the alliance of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and  the Social Democratic Party, an alliance which was created at  the time of the struggle for the overthrow of the communist  government, and regarded this alliance as a compass for  democratic developments. Under the present conditions, there is  no hope that this alliance can be repeated. The Republican Party  is in favor of cooperation with the Democratic Party if this  party creates true conditions for real and sincere cooperation.    6. Keeping in mind the country's great interest in internal  stability and foreign credibility, the Republican Party supports  the government coalition, which guarantees general democratic  developments. This does not prevent the Republican Party from  freely stating its opinions and providing constructive  opposition on all matters which are not in accord with its  program.    7. The National Council is convinced that the creation of a  right wing in Albania is necessary today because:    -- the right wing will be an effective counterbalance to the  unproclaimed alliance of the left-wing forces which, under  various labels and slogans, are aiming to reestablish the  socialist form of government.    -- only the right wing can carry out free capitalist  development, beginning with the recognition and return of legal  ownership.    -- under current political conditions, only the right wing  can represent a true democratic opposition.    -- during the past year, in particular, the foreign policy  of  the Albanian state in the defense of the country has followed a  correct line. However, this policy will receive the necessary  strength through coordination with the right wing's clear ideas  on the country.    The leadership of the party is charged with engaging in  discussions with right-wing political parties and associations  to formulate joint guidelines and action plans on the basis of  political reality and national interests.    8. The Republican Party will increase its struggle, in an  effective manner, for the return of property and, first, for the  enactment of a just land law. The republican concept of  ownership must be extended over the entire economic spectrum. At  the same time, the Republican Party must anticipate the problems  resulting from capitalist development.    9. The Republican Party will work with perseverance to  attract intellectuals into its ranks and management. The party's  central headquarters and the party press are being reorganized  and oriented on the basis of the guidelines in this resolution.    10. The membership of Arben Babameto, Arben Brace, Arsen  Proko, Durim Kulli, and Neritan Alibali on the party's steering  committee is approved.</p>

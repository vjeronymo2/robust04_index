			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Profile (14): An unwieldy name that carries weight in the city - Is the Henderson-Touche Remnant marriage working? John Authers reviews its first year Henderson Touche Remnant is now Britain's leading investment trust group. However, it acquired that title by merger, when the Henderson and Touche Remnant groups came together at the end of 1992, and it has spent the past year trying to justify and consolidate its title. trusts have kept their boards and fund managers intact, this has not proved difficult. TR included a number of well-established 'gems', whose performance remains consistent and impressive. This explains the new group's decision to trade under all three names. It is an unwieldy brand name, but for the time being it carries weight both in the City and with small investors, and dealers seem happy to abbreviate it to HTR. Merging the two businesses has not proved easy. 'The first priority was to get the people and systems under one roof, which we achieved by March 31,' explained Mr Alan Gadd, marketing director for HTR. 'Secondly, we established overall business plans, so we needed a coherent view of the market.' Fortunately, the managers of most of the old TR range of investment trusts had strategies that were different from those of their new Henderson colleagues, and there was no need for complicated trust mergers. On the unit trust side, however, there were several mergers - although this is a much simpler operation with open-ended funds. Last year, the new company was well-enough established to launch its first new investment trust, a Japanese smaller companies fund. It was oversubscribed, and raised its target Pounds 100m. However, the company's Peps concentrate on the more traditional investment trust sector. Its most eye-catching funds tend to take a very conventional but successful, investment approach. Bankers Trust led the esteemed International General sector for three-year performance at the beginning of this year, with growth of 173 per cent. Over seven years, it is second with growth of 253 per cent. Its fund manager, the eclectic Michael Moule, remains popular with institutions, and the fund now has the opportunity to rival better-known trusts in its sector, such as the Alliance trusts and Foreign &amp; Colonial. TR City of London, an income fund, and TR Smaller Companies have also maintained consistent long-term records, and consistent popularity with the market, with TR City shares usually trading at a premium to net asset value. Extra shares are now issued for investors who either buy Peps or savings plans, allowing the fund managers extra capital. However, pricing the group's new range of investment trust Peps has proved a problem, because Henderson and TR tended to work in different markets. While Henderson worked primarily through independent financial advisers, most of whom required a commission, TR concentrated on institutions, and individual direct shareholders. The new range of Peps reflects this. The Henderson Touche Remnant Investment Trust Pep offers five separate trusts - TR City, TR High Income, Witan, Lowland and Henderson Highland - with an orthodox charging structure for intermediaries. The initial charge is 3 per cent, with a transaction charge of 1.25 per cent, and annual charges of 1.25 per cent. Fee-charging advisers should be prepared to rebate the 3 per cent commission; but cost-conscious investors may be more interested in the TR Smaller Companies Pep, which has no direct charges to the investor, all costs, including stamp duty, being absorbed by the board (so charges might still impact on overall investment performance). TR City of London Pep, also aimed more at direct investors, has no initial charge, a transaction charge of 1.0 per cent, and annual management charges of 0.75 per cent for balances up to Pounds 6,000, and 0.5 per cent for balances higher than this. Charges on the Witan Pep, the flagship of the old Henderson range, have recently been altered to attract wealthier investors. Annual management charges are now fixed at Pounds 30, rather than the old 1 per cent. Each transaction costs 1 per cent, and there is no initial charge. Witan has kept its international content low enough to remain 'pepable', unlike several other trusts in the international general sector, including Foreign &amp; Colonial. However, this may have affected Witan's performance over the past year, as it lay 15th out of 20 in its sector for performance during 1993 (with 36.2 per cent growth), and 13th over seven years, on growth of 155 per cent.</p>

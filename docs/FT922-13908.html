			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Power Financial tumbles 14% POWER Financial, the financial services arm of Paul Desmarais' Power Corporation of Canada group, reported that 1991 profit fell 14 per cent to CDollars 159.7m (USDollars 134.2m), or CDollars 1.77 a share, from CDollars 184.6m, or CDollars 2.02 a share, in 1990. The decline was due to lower income from short-term investments. PFC's share of earnings of subsidiaries and in Canada and Europe, however, rose slightly. PFC controls two of Canada's largest financial services, Great-West Lifeco and Investors Group, and also a 25 per cent interest in Pargesa Holding, of Geneva. The CDollars 41bn Caisse de Depot, the investment arm of the Quebec Pension Plan, has invested CDollars 30m for a 2 per cent interest in the Paribas group holding company, Copeba. Mr Pierre Scohier, president of Copeba, said in Montreal the two organisations will co-operate in investing in Quebec, Canada and Europe. Mr Jean-Claude Delorme, chairman of the Caisse, will join the board of Copeba. Copeba owns interest in several Quebec-based companies. The Paribas group is the second-largest stockholder in Power Corp of Canada, with two seats on the board. Dominion Textile, Canada's only surviving integrated textile producer, has retained Goldman Sachs of New York, to look at all options for its yarn business. Domtex would consider selling it, merging it with another company or an initial public offering. The yarn business, with annual sales of USDollars 275m, represents about a quarter of Domtex's total business in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. It supplies commodity and specialised yarns for knitted and woven apparel fabrics, for furnishings and industrial products. It has seven plants in Canada and four in the US, with a total payroll of 2,000.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: TR Property to refocus on quoted stocks TR PROPERTY Investment Trust, which invests in commercial property and property shares, yesterday announced a fall in net asset value from 30.71p to 28.78p per share for the year to end-March. The sharp fall took place in the first half of the year; in the second half they rose by 13.7 per cent from 25.3p. The performance reflects the continued decline of property values, tempered by the sharp increase in property share prices since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism last September. The trust is aiming to build up the proportion of quoted stocks in its portfolio and reduce its holdings of direct property. Mr Peter Duffy, director and manager, said the trust would increase its holdings of medium-sized companies, which he expected to outperform the larger companies in the sector. The trust's total revenue rose by 71 per cent to Pounds 8.48m (Pounds 4.96m), reflecting a reduction in the provisions against trading stock. Net revenue, after tax of Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 488,000) rose from Pounds 822,000 to Pounds 2.71m. Earnings per share rose from 0.28p to 0.95p while a proposed final dividend of 0.5p (0.85p) leaves the total down from 1.45p to 0.9p for the full year.</p>

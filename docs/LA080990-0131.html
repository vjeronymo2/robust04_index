			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: BALDWIN PARK;  </P> <P> RECYCLING PROGRAM OKD  </P> <P> The City Council has approved a mandatory residential recycling program to  begin Feb. 1.  </P> <P> Webster's Refuse Disposal, which contracts with the city, will provide every  residence with separate collection bins for newspapers, glass and aluminum.  </P> <P> The bins will be picked up on regular trash collection days.  </P> <P> Although the program is mandatory, residents can either participate in the  curbside effort or take their recyclable materials to buyback centers or other  recycling programs.  </P> <P> Homeowners will pay nothing for the service the first year. During the second  year, they will pay a recycling charge of up to 25 cents a month. The cost for  the third year has not been determined.  </P> <P> The program was approved last Wednesday on a 4-1 vote, with Councilman Herschel  Keyser dissenting because he opposes the mandatory fee.  </P></p>

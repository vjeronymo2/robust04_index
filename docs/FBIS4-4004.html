			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Canadian  Governor-General Ramon John Hnatyshyn said here today that the  Canadian Government would continue to support the cooperation  between the universities of the two countries.    He said this in a speech to about 200 students and teachers  at Qinghua University, one of the most prestigious in China.    He expressed his satisfaction with the academic exchanges  between the universities of the two countries over the last  decade.    He made the speech during a tour of the university after his  meeting with Chinese acting Premier Zhu Rongji in the morning.    Following the speech, three Qinghua professors gave him an  outline of the cooperative projects between Qinghua University  and Canadian ones.    Professor Zhao Chunjun, deputy dean of the School of  Economics and Management of Qinghua, told Hnatyshyn that since  the Sino- Canadian cooperative project on management education  began in 1984, over 30 Canadian professors had taught at  Qinghua, and a center had been set up in the university to train  Chinese management officials.    About 200 Chinese managers had taken courses on  international  marketing, international finance, technology transfer,  securities and stocks, as well as development of human  resources, Zhao said, adding that the project had yielded good  results.    In the afternoon, Hnatyshyn visited the Beijing  International  Earth Station.    There he attended a ceremony marking the finish of initial  testing of the first phase of construction of the Beijing  domestic satellite telecommunications earth-station, a  cooperative project between China's Post and Telecommunication  Ministry and the spar company of Canada.    It was learned that 19 earth stations will be established in  China after the project is completed, and 14 of them have been  set up in the first stage. China and the Canadian company were  satisfied with the testing of the first phase of the project.    During the second stage, which is predicted to be finished  within the year, another five stations will be established.    The governor-general spoke highly of the project, and said  that Canada would continue its cooperation with China in the  fields of telecommunications, personnel training and technology  transfer.    The guests are due to leave Beijing for Shanghai tomorrow.</p>

Among other things, the money would be  used to build new roads in the aftermath of the IDF's [Israel  Defense Forces] redeployment after the withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho. The use of the guarantees will be discussed in Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's meetings with the heads of the U.S.  Administration during his upcoming trip to the United States.

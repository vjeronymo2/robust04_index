			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris equities soar to another record close THE ABSENCE of UK traders for the August bank holiday affected bourse turnover, writes Our Markets Staff, leading in some cases to increased sensitivity at share price level. PARIS, hoping for an interest rate cut by the Bank of France, which failed to materialise, nevertheless maintained its heady optimism for economic recovery, and the CAC-40 index soared to another record close. The index advanced 21.79, or 1 per cent, to 2,205.67 in turnover of FFr2.7bn. Even a rise in unemployment data, which came in at a record high of some 3.2m, did not dent the market's enthusiasm, as the Matif also rose to unseen levels. Some technical trading ahead of today's expiry of August futures and options was another contributory factor behind the gains. There were technical reasons, too, for the rise in St Gobain and L'Oreal stock, with the index weighting of the two groups due to be increased today as new shares are listed. St Gobain rose FFr7 to FFr584 and L'Oreal FFr27 to FFr1,183. Canal Plus was one of the day's few fallers, off FFr7 to FFr1,295, as the government announced plans to raise the limit on stakes held in television companies from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. FRANKFURT overcame a couple of minor disappointments to close higher, led by Allianz on technical grounds and Daimler on fundamentals. The DAX index rose 17.29 to 1,921.89 with Allianz up DM58 at DM2,570 and Daimler DM18.50 higher at DM748.50 - both at new highs for the year. Turnover fell from DM6.7bn to DM5.8bn. DB Research said that it liked the Allianz chart, now that the insurer has broken firmly through the DM2,500 level; a technical analyst saw the next resistance level at DM2,800. Daimler figured in a weekend report by Manager magazine which said that its Mercedes operating unit wanted to cut costs by DM3bn in the current year, in addition to job cuts already announced. Daimler said there was nothing new of substance in the report. Hoechst, the third of the big three chemical groups to report half year profits, lost DM1.10 to DM280.10 after a 31 per cent fall at pre-tax level. Some traders called this marginally disappointing; others said that the results were in line with expectations after the BASF and Bayer declines last week. A more dramatic fall was seen at Linotype-Hell, the printing machinery company, which lost DM32 to a new 1993 low of DM378 after a heavy first half loss. It recovered from an intraday low of DM365 after the company announced a wide-ranging job cuts programme to reduce its workforce by 15 per cent. ZURICH featured recovery hopes at the employment agency group, Adia, and the forecast of a marked 1993 loss at the telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Ascom, as the SMI index maintained its equilibrium to close 2.5 higher at 2,481.0. Both Adia and Ascom had been seen as turnround situations, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank in Zurich, but yesterday's news sent them in opposite directions with Adia SFr4 higher at SFr175 and Ascom SFr70, or 5.3 per cent lower at SFr1,250. AMSTERDAM set new records, with the CBS Tendency index gaining 1.8 or 1.4 per cent to 129.9. The financial sector was strong following ABN Amro's good results last week: its shares advanced Fl 2.00 to Fl 69.20, while ING was up Fl 2.20 to Fl 73.90. IHC Caland, the dredging group, added Fl 2.50 to Fl 38.00 in advance of a forecast of 14 per cent profits growth in 1993, which came after the close. MILAN saw some activity in Montedison and Ferfin as the former's shareholders meeting was held, with the latter's due today. Montedison picked up L41 or 5 per cent to L845 as fears that there might be an announcement of a merger between the two groups abated. Ferfin's shares advanced L4.75 to L245. The Comit index rose by 4.95 to 632.86. Analysts at InterEuropa added that strength in banks yesterday might also have been due to a number of foreign investors coming into the market. Banca Commerciale rose L47 to L5,432 and Credito Italiano L70 to L2,850. BRUSSELS sounded despondent as the Bel-20 index ended 8.88 down at 1,306.25 in lower than usual turnover of BFr704m. The market has retreated from the highs it achieved nearly three weeks ago; some dealers said that investors were unwilling to move on Belgian shares until the country's social pact is on track, and a solution is found to its burgeoning pubic debt. STOCKHOLM's equities, especially its interest rate sensitive ones, defied a rise in bond yields as the Affarsvarlden general index recovered 22.00, or 1.7 per cent to 1,292.20 with the financial index up 4.4 per cent. Volvo Bs closed SKr14 better at SKr484 on speculation about a merger with the French Renault, and on last week's unexpectedly strong six-month earnings report. VIENNA continued to move forward, although prices ended off earlier highs. The ATX index rose 3.51 to 1,007.75. WARSAW fell by some 7 per cent as as investors took profits after the market's recent heavy gains. The WIG index fell 503.4 to 6,970.7 in active turnover of 1,000bn zlotys. The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable yesterday because of the holiday in the UK.</p>

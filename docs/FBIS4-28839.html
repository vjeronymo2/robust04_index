			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea warned North  Korea Tuesday against deepening the nuclear crisis, voicing  serious concern at Pyongyang's announced withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "The government  expresses serious concern at North Korea's announcement that it  will withdraw from the IAEA in retaliation for the IAEA Board of  Governors' recent sanctions resolution against North Korea,"  Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement.    "The government warns North Korea against worsening the  situation regarding the nuclear problem," he said. Pyongyang  should know that the international community will take a harder  line through a U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution if  North Korea fails to comply with all IAEA inspections as a party  to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), he said.    "The government advises that North Korea accept the will of  the international community and return as a responsible member  of the world community," the statement said.</p>

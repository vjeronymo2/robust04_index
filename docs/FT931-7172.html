			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Optimism underlies the cautious mood in Cyprus - Firm foundations are being laid A TEN-MONTH decline in Cyprus' over-the-counter stock market has been attributed by brokers to the island's prolonged presidential election campaign. Yet even after last week's narrow victory for Mr Glafcos Clerides, Greek Cypriot investors show no inclination to celebrate. The Cisco weekly all-share index closed at 245.8, down by 0.8 per cent, although average daily volume did increase to CPounds 90,000 (Pounds 126,000) for the week. Since the start of the year, the index has declined by 4.4 per cent, with daily volume averaging CPounds 70,000. Nevertheless, optimism underlies the cautious mood. Mr Clerides was backed by the Greek Cypriot business community which expects the unofficial stock market to have a more solid foundation soon. A draft stock exchange law, passed back and forth between parliament and the finance ministry for the last three years, should be approved next month. And an overhaul of company law, also under way, could lead to incentives for more family-controlled Cypriot companies to go public. The market is currently supervised by the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce which is encouraging brokers to abandon telephone trading by providing a purpose-built floor for public trading sessions. More than 70 per cent of transactions now take place on the floor, watched by an enthusiastic crowd of small investors. While the market has expanded substantially, with trading volume rising by 17 per cent to an estimated CPounds 35m in 1992, local brokers say that the absence of a regulatoryframework is hindering growth. Mr Louis Clappas, chairman of Clappas Investments, says: 'Foreign investors show more and more interest in Cyprus, but fund managers abroad are wary because we don't have the proper legal backing, and because exchange controls are still very tight.' However, foreign investors now account for about 5 per cent of the market's total capitalisation of CPounds 571m. The central bank, which allows foreigners to invest on a case-by-case basis, claims that it has speeded up procedures for approving share transfers. 'All it takes is a single phone call,' says one official. Foreigners are mainly attracted by the island's two leading banks, Bank of Cyprus and Popular Bank of Cyprus, which are now stepping up their operations abroad. The Bank of Cyprus, which used to focus on the expatriate Greek Cypriot community, is broadening its customer base in Britain and Australia. Popular Bank, in which the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank has an equity stake, last year set up an Athens-based subsidiary to gain a foothold in the single European market. The two banks, which accounted for around 70 per cent of total transactions on the Cyprus market last year, helped to make up for weakness in other sectors. In spite of a booming economy, with GDP growth estimated at close to 9 per cent last year, the stock market showed an overall decline in 1992. Political uncertainty, caused by the collapse of talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders on reuniting Cyprus, followed by the closely-fought presidential election campaign, drove the market down. The Cisco all-share index fell by 8.1 per cent, led by tourism and transport stocks where the sectoral index plunged by 26.3 per cent. A sharp fall in 1991 earnings, resulting from holiday cancellations during the Gulf war, sent hotel stocks sharply down. Fears that continuing recession in Britain, the island's main tourist market, would damage future prospects prompted a move into defensive stocks, mainly banks and insurance companies. The prevailing gloom, together with capital increases totalling CPounds 37m by the two big banks, discouraged smaller companies' plans for flotations. Mr Socrates Solomides, manager of Cyprus Investment and Securities Corporation, says: 'It will take a while for the market to come back. But there are some good signs: for example, liquidity last year was just as high as in the record year of 1990.'</p>

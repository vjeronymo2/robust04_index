			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Guerrilla leaders arrive in Kabul THREE senior Afghan guerrilla leaders arrived in Kabul yesterday as at least 30 rockets fired by a rival killed 13 people and wounded 77 in the Afghan capital. Official Kabul radio blamed forces loyal to hardline guerrilla chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Kabul's night sky was riven by tracer bullets, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades as Burhannudin Rabbani, Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi and Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf drove in at the head of hundreds of vehicles. Thousands lined the route to the office of the new head of the Islamic government, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi. The three leaders had driven from Peshawar, their Pakistani base, with Shia Moslem leader Ayatollah Asif Mohseni and the chief of Afghanistan's Wahabi sect. With them were representatives of Mr Hekmatyar, whose forces fired rockets at the city to underscore his opposition to the Mojaddedi government. Under a formula worked out between the guerrilla leaders last month, Mr Rabbani was not due to come to Kabul for two months, when he would become the new head of state. Mr Hekmatyar's armed opposition to Mr Mojaddedi, and the threat he still poses to the capital, despite being pushed out of Kabul last week by fierce fighting, appears to have forced a change of course. Mr Rabbani, whose main field commander Ahmad Shah Masood was largely responsible for the collapse of the former government, congratulated the heroes of the mujahideen 'holy war' and prayed for the survival of the Islamic government. The presence of the guerrilla leaders will bolster Mr Mojaddedi in his immediate battle with Mr Hekmatyar but could result in the very faction fighting the formula was designed to avoid. At the same time, the Kabul-area mujahideen commander Abdul Haq tried to negotiate the release of an abducted minister from the deposed regime. Mr Haq said said the former civil aviation minister, Wadir Safi, was safe after being abducted on Saturday night in the capital. His capture followed the kidnap and assassination of Mr Abdul Kareem Shadan, former chief justice, whose mutilated body was found late on Saturday night.</p>

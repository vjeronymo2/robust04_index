			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Olympic News In Brief: UK weightlifters may be allowed back to compete TWO British weightlifters sent home from the Games for failing out-of-competition drugs tests may be allowed back, the British Olympic team said yesterday. Spokeswoman Caroline Searle said the cases of Andrew Saxton and Andrew Davies, both Commonwealth champions, were being reviewed at meetings in Barcelona and London. 'There is a possibility of their reinstatement which is currently being examined,' Searle said. She said she could not say why the test results were now under doubt and made clear that a decision on their possible reinstatement was unlikely before today. The cases were being examined last night at a joint meeting by the British Olympic Association (BOA), the International Olympic Committee medical commission and the International Weightlifting Federation. Saxton and Davies, both 25, were sent home from the Games on Wednesday after the BOA informed them pre-Olympic random tests done out of competition in Britain had shown traces of the stimulant and anabolic agent Clenbuterol. The BOA announced their expulsion on Thursday along with that of sprinter Jason Livingston, the European 60m indoor champion. Searle said on Thursday that a drugs test on the sprinter had shown traces of a banned steroid. Saxton and Davies both intend to appeal and have both publicly denied taking banned drugs. They had been due to compete in Barcelona in the 100kg and 110kg weightlifting categories respectively tomorrow and Monday. Livingston was to have raced yesterday in the 100m heats. The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) said Saxton and Davies had both passed the IWF's own separate, compulsory test in Barcelona. 'Both of them were negative,' IWF president Tamas Ajan said. Ajan confirmed 'it is possible' that Saxton and Davies could be allowed to compete at the Olympics after talking to British team chief Dick Palmer. 'It is not exactly finalised. Tomorrow we will give some information,' he added.</p>

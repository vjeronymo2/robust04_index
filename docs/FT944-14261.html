			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Kuwait link with Tory party funds: Interest on loan deposits donated by foreign-financed bank The Conservative party received ten of thousands of pounds in secret contributions from a merchant bank with close links to the Kuwait government. According to documents obtained by the Financial Times, the bank, Robert Fraser and Partners, was financed to a substantial extent by a Panamanian corporation, Blackford Holdings Corporation, which itself received about Pounds 100m from the Kuwait government. Robert Fraser and Partners made the political payments by putting money on deposit with the Conservative party's bank and giving instructions that all interest should be transferred to the party. The disclosure of this complex mechanism for making payments to the Conservative party, involving finance from a foreign government, will add to pressure for reform of the way in which UK political parties are financed. Mr David Blunkett, the former Labour party chairman, said that to 'avoid any inference of impropriety', all parties should refuse overseas contributions and should disclose all donations in excess of Pounds 2,000. Robert Fraser and Partners, which had several leading Conservatives as directors and consultants, placed deposits of about Pounds 200,000 in a special account with the Conservative party's bankers and gave instructions that all interest should be transferred to the Conservative party. The arrangement was in place for approximately three years in the mid 1980s. At rates of interest prevailing at the time, the Conservative party would have received tens of thousands of pounds. The bank's annual reports show only small contributions to the Conservatives: in 1986, a payment of Pounds 2,000 to its Industrial Fund, a fund-raising arm of the party, and the following year a contribution of Pounds 5,000 to the party itself. Robert Fraser and Partners' business was closely linked to Blackfords'. The Panamanian company accounted for more than half of all deposits placed with the bank, according to a Bank of England analysis. Blackford itself was financed to a substantial extent by the Kuwait government. It received Pounds 86m in cash from Kuwait, via the London-based Kuwait Investment Office, in 14 contributions between February 24 1984 and July 23 1990. In a letter to the KIO on December 11 1991, Robert Fraser requested a further Pounds 15m injection for Blackford. Robert Fraser and Partners' board was chaired by Lord Rippon, the former Conservative cabinet minister. Another director was the Tory MP, Mr Nicholas Soames. Sir Dennis Walters, a Conservative MP at the time, was a consultant to the bank as well as an adviser to the Kuwait Investment Office. Lady Archer, the wife of the best-selling novelist and former Conservative party deputy chairman, Lord Archer, was also a consultant to the group. The plan of transferring interest to the party was the brainchild of Mr Colin Emson, Fraser's chief executive, who for years had been a leading member of the Conservative Industrial Fund, a group of industrialists and bankers who raise cash from business for fighting elections. Mr Emson hoped it would in effect be a pilot for a far more ambitious party fund-raising scheme, which would have involved big public companies making interest-free loans to the Conservative party. The party would have placed the cash on deposit and pocketed the interest. The rationale was that public companies would not have needed to disclose the loans, although they must disclose direct contributions. Lord McAlpine, then the party's honorary Treasurer, rejected the proposal, because he was concerned that raising money in that way might be seen as breaching the spirit of the law, if not the letter. Robert Fraser and Partners surrendered its banking licence on September 30 1992. Much of its loan portfolio was transferred to Aston Finance Corporation, another Panamanian company linked to Blackford.</p>

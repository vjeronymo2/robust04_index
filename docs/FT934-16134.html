			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Council of Europe admits Romania ROMANIA yesterday became the 32nd member state of the Council of Europe, in a brief ceremony in Vienna where a two-day summit of the organisation begins today. Mr Teodor Melescanu, the Romanian foreign minister, fulfilled the main condition of membership by signing the European Convention on Human Rights on behalf of his country. This document is, in the words of Mrs Catherine Lalumiere, the Council's secretary-general, 'the ideological foundation of our organisation'. Romania's membership was approved by the Council's parliamentary assembly and committee of ministers only last week. It had been controversial because of doubts about the country's human rights record and particularly its treatment of Hungarian and gipsy ethnic minorities. Welcoming the new member to 'the European family', Mrs Lalumiere said pointedly that she was 'thinking of all the Romanians, whatever their origin', and that Romania was joining an organisation 'which had a duty to remain vigilant'. Representatives from other east European countries not yet admitted to the Council, including Russia, will attend a pre-Summit 'exchange of view', with the leaders of the member countries in Vienna this morning.</p>

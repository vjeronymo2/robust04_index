			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / People: Family chairmen bow out Two of the elder statesmen of Britain's building industry are bowing out at the low point of the recession and severing family ties with their firms which go back several generations. Sir Brian Hill, whose Higgs &amp; Hill family firm built many of London's more famous buildings such as the Royal Naval College and the Tate Gallery, and Paul Hyde-Thomson, who floated his family's Ibstock Johnsen brick-making firm on the stock market in 1970, announced yesterday that they plan to step down at the end of the year. Sir Brian, 59, who has been chairman of Higgs &amp; Hill since 1983, is the seventh generation of a family which started the business in 1874. Although his cousin, David Hill, is deputy chairman, the company has decided to choose the next chairman from outside the family. George Duncan (left), 58, a former chairman of Lloyds &amp; Scottish, and current chairman of ASW Holdings and Whessoe, joins the Higgs &amp; Hill board on November 10 and will take over from Sir Brian as non-executive chairman at the end of the year. Ibstock Johnsen, which like Higgs &amp; Hill cut its dividend yesterday, has also gone outside for its new chairman. Colin Hope (right), 60, chairman of T&amp;N, who was appointed Ibstock Johnsen's deputy chairman in January, will take over from the 65-year-old Hyde-Thomson at the end of December.</p>

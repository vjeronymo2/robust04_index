			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Helene Despic-Popovic] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 12 (AFP) -- UN commander General  Michael Rose ordered major peacekeeping reinforcements deployed  here Saturday [12 February] to help implement a ceasefire accord  calling for the immediate surrender of heavy weapons to UN  control.    A UN Protetion Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman said Rose had  called for a battalion of Malaysian UN troops to be deployed in  the capital to help with the operation, which must be completed  within a 10-day NATO deadline ending on February 21.    "General Rose has directed the Malaysian battalion which...  arrived about a month ago or so to come here later today to  assist interposition of UN troups between the two sides," he  said. "They will be coming in significant number."    The Malaysian battalion, comprising up to 1,000 troops,  arrived in the region about a month ago. Part of it has already  been deployed in the region of Jablanica-Konjic, in southeastern  Bosnia.    The order came on the second day of a ceasefire agreed  Wednesday between Bosnian Moslems and Serbs, and in the context  of a NATO ultimatum to launch air strikes if they do not  demilitarize the city by midnight on February 20.    The truce itself was apparently holding Saturday, with no  reports of fighting in Bosnia overnight. The NATO ultimatum  allows for air strikes if the truce is violated in Sarajevo  itself, a UN-designated safe area.    During the first day of implementation of the ceasefire  Friday, Bosnian Serbs surrendered 13 artillery pieces or  mortars, while Bosnian Moslem forces handed over five mortars,  according to UN officials.    The quantity of weapons was insignificant given the  firepower  both sides possess in and around the city, but peacekeepers said  the handover was of great symbolic importance.    At the end of the day Friday Rose said that "We've been  moving troops into positions between the (front) lines and we've  been accepting weapons under our control, into barracks on both  sides."    The threat of air strikes, which could be triggered before  the 10-day deadline by a breach of the ceasefire in Sarajevo,  was boosted Friday by the U.S. decision to send eight F-15E  bombers to Italy to increase the NATO force.    The planes, increasing the number of NATO aircraft in the  region from 120 to 146, will be part of an improved fighter  squadron being put together by Admiral Michael Boorda, NATO  regional commander in charge of the Bosnia operation.    Many of the same type of aircraft had been in the region  several months ago when the NATO allies appeared to be getting  ready to launch air strikes.    Pilots at NATO bases in Italy, already being used as the  base  for Operation Deny Flight to prevent unauthorized air activity  over Bosnia, say they are ready to implement the threat of  strikes whenever necessary.    "The decision is a political one. We are here to carry out  UN orders," said Doug Yurovich, 37, at the Italian NATO base of  Aviano. "From up there you can see the Serb positions clearly.  We would have no problem in hitting the targets, once they are  designated," he said.    The developments came as peace talks between Bosnia's  warring  parties in Geneva were adjourned until after the NATO deadline  with no progress reported.    E.C. mediator Lord Owen said earlier Saturday in Geneva that  a new U.S. diplomatic initiative in favor of the Moslem-led  Bosnian government and the NATO ultimatum were encouraging the  Moslems to hold out in the negotiations to see if Western forces  would intervene militarily around Sarajevo.    "Certainly they don't want to talk about the details of UN  administration (of Sarajevo) for the moment until they see what  happens. Probably the NATO deadline has to pass," he said.</p>

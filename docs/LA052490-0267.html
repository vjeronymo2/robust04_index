			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MADONNA MAY AID 'TRACY' DEBUT  </P> <P> Look out, Washington -- Warren Beatty is bringing his big new picture "Dick  Tracy" to town, and his co-star and sometime companion Madonna may also be here  for the premiere.  </P> <P> No one will confirm that the rock superstar is coming, but Madonna will be at  Capital Centre in Landover, Md., the same June weekend performing in her  "Blonde Ambition" concert tour.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co. says the film's "world" premiere will be at Disney World on  June 14, but one could argue that the true premiere opening will be at the  Uptown Theater on June 10, with a party afterward at the National Building  Museum.  </P> <P> Beatty is bringing the premiere to Washington -- where he grew up -- to benefit  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine's hematology research.  </P></p>

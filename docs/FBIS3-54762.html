So there was frank  discussion about practically all questions of the life and daily  activity of the Russian Armed Forces.    First of all the defense minister stressed that the outgoing  year of 1993 has certainly been extremely complex for the Army  from all viewpoints. It has been a year whose lessons require  the most serious analysis.    The most important point is that this year the Army has  played an important role in preserving Russia's integrity and  security. Metaphorically speaking, it has had to clear away the  obstructions created as a result of the political confrontation  in the country. The Army, Pavel Grachev stressed, wants just one  thing: the maximum harmony in society and state stability. Any  other speculations regarding its role in society are  impermissible and extremely dangerous.    In what kind of shape is the Russian Army as it prepares to  enter the new year of 1994? It is more cohesive and stronger  than ever. In the outgoing year it proved possible to put a  stop once and for all to many negative trends and to create good  groundwork for the future. The reform of the Army, the minister  stressed, is going according to plan, in a calm workmanlike  atmosphere.    The Russian Army currently has 2.3 million men. Over  the last 18 months it has decreased by almost 0.5 million. This  process will continue, but there will be no precipitate  [obvalnyy] reduction, Grachev stressed. He also advocated that  the size of the Russian Army be kept at approximately the  current level, since the earlier parliamentary decision on an  Army of 1.5 million is clearly at odds with the scale of the  tasks that it is resolving.    This year around 640,000 servicemen, over 30,000 tanks,  9,000 artillery systems, over 4,000 aircraft and helicopters, 46  divisions, 64 brigades, and 90 air regiments have been withdrawn  from the East European countries and nearby foreign lands. The  withdrawal of troops from Czechoslovakia [as published],  Hungary, Poland, Mongolia, Lithuania, and Cuba has been  completed. This process took place within an extremely tight  time frame, the minister stressed.    Concerning questions of troop combat training, Pavel Grachev  stressed that, despite many difficulties, here too it has been  possible to retain a planned and systematic approach. The  necessary training exercises for command personnel have been  held and command-staff and regional exercises have taken place.  These showed that the troops are at an adequate level of combat  readiness and can resolve all the tasks entrusted to them.    Of course, the most painful questions in the Army and in  society as a whole are problems of social protection. But even  in these conditions, when the Defense Ministry is literally  having to "fight" to secure everything necessary for the needs  of the Army and servicemen, it has been possible to do a  considerable amount.    The most important thing is housing, of course. Some  120,000 servicemen currently need a roof over their heads. The  Defense Ministry channels 75 percent of the money allocated for  capital construction into the construction of housing. Through  its own efforts around 62,000 apartments were constructed in  1993. This figure will go up by a further 30 percent in the new  year. In addition, Pavel Grachev named yet another reason why  it has so far not been possible to solve this extremely acute  social problem. Local administrations have allocated only 12  percent of the planned volume of housing.    The defense minister devoted much attention to questions of  manpower acquisition for the forces. After noting the  difficulties with the draft at the start of this year, he  stressed that the situation is now more stable. There is still  a shortage in many units, but the measures that have been taken  have made it possible to avoid the worst-case forecasts. He  noted the improvement in the work of military commissariats and  local administrations in the Transbaykal, Far Eastern, North  Caucasus, and Volga Military Districts. As of now draft  manpower levels are 60 percent of what is required.    Concerning contract service, the defense minister noted a  number of difficulties. In his view, it is worrying that  contract servicemen are more willing to accept posts in the rear  while there are far fewer who want to go to the front line and  join combat units. Nevertheless, 123,000 servicemen have now  signed contracts. This figure will certainly increase in the  new year.    Journalists also wanted to know about Russia's relations  with  NATO.    "Our relations," the defense minister stressed, "must  be more meaningful and develop across a broad spectrum of  collaboration." He also announced the creation of a group of  experts which is to submit as early as the beginning of 1994 a  joint plan for military-political and military cooperation  between Russia and NATO.    Army General Pavel Grachev answered many questions from  journalists during the press conference. The frankness of the  answers, including those to so-called "awkward" questions,  should be emphasized. However, the minister did not duck these  questions; what is more, he not only gave clear and precise  answers but also found the opportunity for a broader and franker  exchange of opinions.    In conclusion Army General Pavel Grachev addressed new year  greetings to all servicemen, members of their families, and  veterans: "I would sincerely like to express the wish that you  will feel confidence in the future in the new year. May peace  and tranquillity come to every home. May all the hopes of  people in uniform for a better, quieter, worthier, and happier  life come true."</p>

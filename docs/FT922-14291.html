			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Observer: Flight of fancy Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA, is obviously not the superstitious type. The Royal Academy of Arts' current exhibition of works by the American sculptor Alexander Calder has as its sponsor none other than the Shannon-based aircraft leasing company. Ryan will not have forgotten Calder's brightly coloured designs which adorned Braniff's planes in the 1970s - nor what then happened to the small US carrier. The airline filed for bankruptcy in 1982. Revived, it filed for bankruptcy again in 1989. And, third time unlucky, the last airline with the Braniff name went the same way in August last year.</p>

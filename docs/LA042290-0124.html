			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FATE OF BICYCLE CLUB RIDES ON COURT ACTION  </P> <P> A federal judge in Florida is scheduled to start the first of a series of  hearings Friday to determine how many of the investors in the Bicycle Club knew  that profits from a marijuana smuggling ring were invested in the club.  </P> <P> The judge is expected to decide eventually whether any of the club's 31  investors will be required to forfeit their interests, and who ultimately will  control the club.  </P> <P> The club was seized April 2 by the federal government and placed under the  control of the city of Bell Gardens after a federal jury found four men guilty  of a complex racketeering scheme that involved investing drug-smuggling profits  in several ventures, including construction of the club.  </P> <P> One of those men was a partner of a group that owns a controlling interest in  the Bicycle Club.  </P> <P> For the last three weeks, revenues from the club, which sometimes reach  $200,000 a day, have been deposited directly into a special account controlled  by the U.S. Marshal Service. The club's 31 investors will not receive their  share until the judge determines who will be allowed to retain ownership in the  club and who must forfeit it to the federal government for auction.  </P> <P> At stake is control of a card casino that brings in $100 million a year,  creates 1,900 jobs and provides about half of the city's tax revenues.  </P> <P> Ralph Lockridge, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Agency, said that in most  federal seizure cases, neither innocence nor ignorance of the owner or investor  is considered a defense.  </P> <P> "It is hard to understand, but the case is not against the people," he said.  "The case is against the property.  </P> <P> "For example, if a vehicle is used to transport drugs, it has nothing to do  with whether the driver or the owner knew. Under the law, the question is, 'Did  the car transport narcotics or didn't it?' If in fact it did, it can be seized  and can ultimately be forfeited by the courts.  </P> <P> "The question is (whether) the Bicycle Club was built with the proceeds of  illegal activity. If it was, then that's the end of the story."  </P> <P> But Lockridge added that the federal judge ultimately decides what will happen  to the seized property. There are provisions for innocent owners, but it is up  to the owners to prove their innocence, he said.  </P> <P> The Bicycle Club is owned by two general partnerships -- LCP Associates and  Park Place Associates. Michael Gilbert, one of the men convicted of  racketeering, is a limited partner in LCP Associates, which has a 65% interest  in the club. Club General Manager George Hardie holds a controlling interest in  the other general partnership, Park Place Associates, which owns the remaining  35%.  </P> <P> Federal law recognizes five different degrees of innocence, ranging from an  investor or owner who was not convicted but was found to be involved in illegal  activity, to an owner or investor who was found to have done everything  possible to prevent his property from being used for illegal purposes,  Lockridge said.  </P> <P> Hardie said the case is further complicated because the club is unique among  properties seized by the federal government in drug cases.  </P> <P> "It is not like a car or a boat," he said. "It is a living and breathing asset.  It has a value that fluctuates. I don't think anybody in the country knows how  it is going to turn out. It could go on for two or three years."  </P> <P> There are several possible outcomes.  </P> <P> The judge could decide that the entire club should be forfeited and put on the  auction block. The federal government has no interest in running a card casino,  Lockridge said.  </P> <P> But that outcome is the least likely one, Bell Gardens City Manager Claude  Booker said. He noted that the U.S. attorney in Miami has already stated that  Park Place Associates, the general partnership controlled by Hardie, is an  innocent third party. Hardie, who testified as a government witness during the  three-month trial, has said he did not know drug money was used to help build  the club.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors said $12.5 million of the club's $22 million construction  costs were traced to the drug-smuggling scheme.  </P> <P> Officials from the U.S. attorney's office in Miami declined to comment about  the upcoming hearings.  </P> <P> Booker also cited a partial forfeiture as another possibility. In that case,  anywhere from 5% to 65% of the club could be forfeited and auctioned.  </P> <P> Hardie, who was allowed to remain general manager, said in a recent interview  that he expects to be allowed to retain his interest.  </P> <P> He said he was referred to Los Angeles developer Samuel Gilbert while  attempting to obtain financing to build the club. Hardie said that after  several meetings a deal was negotiated in which a partnership formed by Gilbert  would receive 65% of the club in return for financing the construction.  </P> <P> Gilbert was not a partner of LCP Associates, which owns 65% of the club, but  most of the money LCP used to finance a construction loan for the club came  from Gilbert's elaborate laundering network, federal prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Michael Gilbert, Samuel Gilbert's son, was the only partner in LCP Associates  convicted of racketeering in relation to the money laundering case. He owned 5%  of the Bicycle Club.  </P> <P> Samuel Gilbert was indicted in the case, but died before authorities announced  that he had been charged.  </P> <P> The hearings that are scheduled to begin Friday are expected to shed more light  on the scheme.  </P> <P> "It's not over," Hardie said. "It's an ongoing thing. It's not pleasant. Sam  probably took a lot of secrets with him to the grave."  </P></p>

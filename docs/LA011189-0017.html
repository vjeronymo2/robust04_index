			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIGARETTE TAX TAKES EFFECT  </P> <P> So Brown, the 48-year-old paralegal described in the article, is seeing his  effort of fighting against legislators and local officials going up in smoke  following the passage of Proposition 99.  </P> <P> Brown says that Proposition 99 is "a form of extortion," singling out a group  of people in our society. He states that we might as well tax red meats, using  the money to fight heart disease; and tax candy because it leads to obesity.  </P> <P> We could just as well attribute Brown's 1 1/2-pack-a-day intake to occasional  cerebral failure. Think about it, Tom. When was the last time a candy eater  jeopardized the health of the non-candy eaters in the same room? When have  non-red meat eaters in a restaurant been gagged by the presence of nearby red  meat eating patrons, as well as seeing windows clouded as a result of the meat?  And, of course, let's remember that a scavenger hunt's easiest obstacle is to  find a crushed cigarette butt, wrapper, or box -- they're on the ground  practically anywhere you look.  </P> <P> Two years ago it was predicted that smoking will be "non-acceptable in society"  in a decade. Nonsmokers have taken great strides to see that this dream comes  true.  </P> <P> J. SCOTT BOYER  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

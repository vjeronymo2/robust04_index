			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Strong second half lifts Bass A strong second half performance by Holiday Inn operations in the US and Asia/Pacific helped Bass, the UK brewing, hotels and leisure group, lift full year pre-tax profits 7.4 per cent to Pounds 508m. The results were ahead of market expectations and the shares added 34p to 537p. Mr Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive, said it appeared unlikely that trading in the first half of the present financial year would benefit significantly from the economic environment. 'However, the management actions we have taken will produce improvements over the year and the business is well placed to gain from any increased consumer spending in our markets.' Operating profit for the year to end-September increased marginally to Pounds 603m on turnover which grew by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 4.45bn. Holiday Inn profits rose 15.3 per cent to Pounds 128m (Pounds 111m). The results reflected a substantial turnround after a first half decline. In North America second half dollar profits were 15.5 per cent higher, with revenue per available room 3 per cent ahead, and in Asia/Pacific profits rose 41 per cent. Overall, a net 89 hotels were added to the system which now comprises 1,774 hotels. Brewing profits fell 8.2 per cent to Pounds 156m, hit by price competition and charges of Pounds 18m for reorganisation, increased bad debt provisions, and the change to end product duty. Net margins fell from 10.9 per cent to 9.8 per cent. UK beer volumes, however, rose nearly 1 per cent to 8.38m barrels and market share grew 0.5 per cent to 23 per cent. Profits from Britvic soft drinks fell to Pounds 35m (Pounds 41m) as recession, poor summer weather, and price competition reduced sales volume by 5 per cent. Pub profits, reflecting a reduction in the estate of about 520 outlets, were 4.2 per cent lower at Pounds 205m. But profit per managed house, driven by an increasing contribution from food sales, was 5 per cent higher. Leisure operations raised profits by 15.6 per cent to Pounds 74m with a strong performance by Barcrest, the amusement machine business, which led the UK market with a 43 per cent share, and improvements from Coral betting shops and Gala bingo clubs. Earnings per share grew 2.8 per cent to 36.3p and a final dividend of 14.35p lifts the total 4.8 per cent to 19.8p. COMMENT Bass has seen a remarkable improvement in the second half and deserves credit for increasing its share of the beer market with only a limited drop in margins. But since the market is likely to remain highly competitive there must be doubt about whether the company can cut costs far enough to avoid further margin erosion. Hotel profits were actually down by 2 per cent in dollar terms. While the US hotel business is showing good underlying growth, the European market is depressed and further progress in the US may depend on the rate at which new franchises are added. Brokers' profit estimates for the current year of about Pounds 530m put the shares on a forward multiple just over 14 times. That would make them expensive without the support of a historic yield of 4.6 per cent.</p>

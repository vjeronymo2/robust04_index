			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Secondary issues at new high levels Wall Street US BLUE chip stocks firmed slightly and secondary issues set new record highs yesterday as telecommunications, cable and entertainment company shares rose sharply on news of one of the biggest mergers in US corporate history, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.06 at 3,603.19. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.37 higher at 461.49, while the Amex composite finished up 5.35 at 475.85, and the Nasdaq composite up 6.51 at 778.97. Trading volume on the NYSE was 292m shares. The pattern of recent days - blue-chip stocks mostly ignored as investors buy smaller-company and Nasdaq issues in their search for growth opportunities - was again repeated yesterday, with secondary indices moving to new all-time highs. All prices moved higher from the opening, lifted by the news that telecommunications group Bell Atlantic will merge with cable television giant Telecommunications Inc in a deal that is valued at close to Dollars 20bn. A spate of mergers, several of them in the telecoms and entertainment businesses, have been announced recently, supporting investor sentiment at a time when sluggish economic growth might otherwise be depressing share prices. The markets were also buoyed by the first batch of third quarter corporate earnings releases, which on the whole have been better than analysts and investors had expected. Among individual stocks, TCI rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 31 3/8 on the Nasdaq market in volume of 19m shares and Bell Atlantic firmed Dollars 5 7/8 to Dollars 65 7/8 on the NYSE as the two companies announced a merger agreement. Bell will pay Dollars 11.8bn in stock for TCI, and will also assume Dollars 9.6bn in debt, which means that the ultimate value of the deal could rival the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco, which until now was the biggest ever. Other entertainment, telecommunications and cable stocks rose sharply on the news amid hopes that similar transactions between the two industries will soon be concluded. Cablevision jumped Dollars 9 1/4 to Dollars 63 5/8 on the American Stock Exchange, while on Nasdaq, Liberty Media, which is part-owned by TCI and will also be sold to Bell Atlantic, rose Dollars 5 7/8 to Dollars 65 7/8 , Vanguard Cellular climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 31 3/4 , Comcast added Dollars 6 3/8 at Dollars 39 5/8 , and BroadBand Technologies climbed Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 43. On the NYSE Weyerhaeuser fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 38 5/8 after the company reported a 38 per cent decline in third quarter net income. First Chicago added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 50 after the banking group announced a third quarter profit of Dollars 284m, up from the Dollars 372m loss incurred in the same period a year ago when the company took a charge to cover asset disposals. Canada TORONTO stocks closed mixed in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index was up 4.48 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,111.79 according to preliminary data. Seagram gained  5/8 to 35 3/4 after disclosing that it has obtained the marketing rights for Sweden's Absolut vodka.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEW;  </P> <P> COSTELLO OPENS FLOODGATES IN 'SPIKE'  </P> <P> ELVIS COSTELLO  </P> <P> "Spike." Warner Bros. *** 1/2  </P> <P> Caustic sketches of schemers and losers. Portraits of dissolution and  dissipation, treachery and isolation. An anti-Thatcher broadside and a scenario  of video voyeurism. Murder ballads and protest songs. Jealous laments and a  face-to-face with the Big Cheese Himself.  </P> <P> Yes, Elvis is alive. No, not that Elvis. Elvis Costello. Remember? Glasses.  Used to put out like three albums a year. Couldn't shut him up. Now, after a  two-year silence, the floodgates are open. "Spike" bristles with renewed  invention, energy and expression.  </P> <P> It's all unmistakable, undiminished Elvis in its tunefulness, in its  revelations of character and situation through metaphor, in its downbeat  political observations and in its main musical precincts: British pop-rock,  Celtic folk and cocktail/torch music. Familiar, true, but Costello restlessly  advances it all into fresh territory.  </P> <P> His major step was hiring on the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, the tradition-bending  New Orleans hornblowers whose sweetly sour voicings provide both avant-garde  edge and evocations of a timeless rural South -- sort of Otis Redding meets  George Gershwin. Whether oblique funk, Band-like soul or a wild '30s cartoon  big-band spook-house workout with Costello's Irish lineup, the Dirty Dozen  emerge by a nose as "Spike's" predominant presence.  </P> <P> Costello mixes and matches other players to keep things moving. On ". . . This  Town . . . ," Roger McGuinn and Paul McCartney contribute to a richly textured  pop-rock tapestry, full of starburst chimes and unexpected melodic alleys. In  "God's Comic," a crew that includes bassist Buell Niedlinger lays out a  cocktail shuffle behind a sly, restrained vocal in this account of a decidedly  strange visit with God.  </P> <P> Off-center rockabilly clatter propels "Pads, Paws and Claws," a sketch of a  real fun couple, while the stately Irish folk of "Tramp the Dirt Down" builds  to scary intensity during a long litany of shame about Thatcher's Britain. In  the courtroom narrative "Let Him Dangle," an anti-execution message is set  against music that snaps and sways with vengeful glee, like a trap door  springing and body swinging.  </P> <P> The variety of the arrangements and themes encourages Costello's most versatile  vocal performance yet. Whether tough, sure-footed, fast-paced deliveries or  aching, underplayed confessionals, it's a commanding display. From a whisper to  a scream, indeed. RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

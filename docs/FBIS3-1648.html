The total grain output of the province hit some 23.8 million  tons last year, one million tons more than that in 1990, which  was the previous record, according to the latest official  statistics.    Meanwhile, the total agricultural output value of Hebei in  1993 topped some 50.1 billion yuan, up 6.2 percent from the  previous year.    Exceptionally serious dry weather attacked most of the area  over the past year. The average rainfall in the first half of  1993 dropped to only some ten millimeters per month, official  sources said.    In addition, water in most of the reservoirs and canals  dried  up due to rare drought.    To fight the drought, the provincial government collected  some 500 million yuan to construct irrigation systems, draw  water and readjust the crop structure.    With the support of local governments, the Hebei people sank  about 780,000 pump wells, and the total area of effectively  irrigated farmland reached some 3.93 million ha [hectares].</p>

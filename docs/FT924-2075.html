			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / People: Triplex Lloyd promotes finance director Triplex Lloyd, the West Midlands engineering group which today announces its results for the half year to end-September, is promoting 36-year-old finance director John Foley (left) to the new position of group managing director under Colin Cooke, who remains executive chairman. Cooke had stepped into the breach as both executive chairman and chief executive when Jim Dael died suddenly in July of last year at the age of 46. Cooke had previously been non-executive deputy chairman, with a number of outside directorships after a career at RTZ, Hepworth, GKN and Duport. Foley, the youngest member of the board, says the move comes 'because the rest of the board think I am ready for it'. He adds that he is not aware there were any other internal or external candidates for the position. Triplex is viewed as having steered a relatively successful course through the recession with the recent growth of the business focused in the automotive and power divisions, rather than the building products division. Foley has been finance director for the past three years. He had joined from Foseco, where he had latterly been director of corporate finance. A trained barrister, who says he did not continue in the law because he could not afford to at the time, he trained as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse.</p>

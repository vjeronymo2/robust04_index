			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Banking watchdog's role will cover small businesses THE BANKING ombudsman scheme is to be extended to cover complaints from small businesses, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced yesterday as he disclosed that a survey had cleared banks of failing to pass on cuts in base rates. The Bank of England survey, which found that average loan margins had 'hardly changed' since June 1991 although fees had risen by 5 per cent, was welcomed by banks but criticised by the Labour party and some small business groups. The Bank survey found that 61 per cent of small business loans linked to base rates fell exactly in line with the 4.5 percentage point cut over the period. Margins widened on 30 per cent of loans, and narrowed on 9 per cent of them. The chancellor has agreed with the British Bankers' Association to extend the ombudsman scheme to cover complaints of maladministration from incorporated business with a turnover below Pounds 1m. Banks initially resisted this. Mr Lamont welcomed the confirmation of cuts in loan margins, but said the extension of the scheme - which until now has covered only personal customers and non-incorporated businesses - would provide 'an independent view'. Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the BBA and chairman of TSB Group, said the inquiry had been 'worth doing' and had laid to rest accusations against the banks which led Mr Lamont to call for an inquiry. Sir Nicholas said banks had been concerned that Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman, would be asked to adjudicate on matters of 'commercial judgment' such as loan margins, but they were happy at the final terms of reference. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, who said that the largest four banks had increased charges by Pounds 1.5bn in 3 1/2 years, said the chancellor had proved to be a 'pushover for the banking establishment'. Mr Brown said the report offered 'no comfort at all to thousands hit by bank charges, high margins and overcharging'. The banking ombudsman, funded by the banks, last year received 10,109 complaints - 60 per cent up on 1991. The ombudsman's council said it hoped for 'an early start' to the changes. Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of National Westminster Bank, said the bank had strengthened its internal complaints procedure, and he did not think the ombudsman would face a wave of complaints. Mr Stan Mendham, of the Forum of Small Business lobby group, said the inquiry had 'let the banks off the hook' because loan margins and fees were less important than restrictions in credit levels and availability.

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa prices tumble to 4-month lows Cocoa futures tumbled to their lowest levels for over four months in London yesterday, spurred by heavy selling by funds in New York the previous night. The second position futures contract dropped to a low of Pounds 857 a tonne before edging up to end Pounds 45 lower at Pounds 859. The trend continued in New York, with the May position down Dollars 27 at Dollars 1,096 in afternoon trading after losing Dollars 43 on Monday. Traders and analysts said the sharp fall was largely technical, with no news to alter the fundamentally bullish outlook of a third consecutive shortfall in cocoa supplies in the 1993-94 season. London trader ED &amp; F. Man is forecasting a deficit the following year too. However, investment funds appeared anxious to move out of long positions held while the market has traded sideways over the past six weeks, and the sell-off in New York provided the trigger. Computer-generated sell programmes and a lack of trade buying exacerbated the slide. The market continued trading under London Commodity Exchange rules introduced at the start of the year, despite a fall of more than Pounds 40, the previous daily limit before trading was halted. 'There's been a bit of a shake-out of some of the speculators,' said one analyst. 'But we're still Pounds 200 higher than the lows of last year and that probably reflects the fact that stocks are declining.' Cocoa prices have been hovering around Pounds 900 a tonne since the sharp fall from a peak of Pounds 1,066 in December. This was sparked by news of high arrivals of cocoa from Ivory Coast, the world's main producer. 'The trade has pulled out and been waiting for lower prices,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London brokers. 'There's no real support until they decide prices are cheap. They could drop as low as Pounds 800.'</p>

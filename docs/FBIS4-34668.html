			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The existence of armed  groups in Mexico, denounced by Zapatist National Liberation  Front [EZLN] leader Subcommander Marcos, has been tacitly  confirmed by the Mexican Government by its expulsion of  Ecuadoran Priest Marcos Gonzalo Holla del Salto, who was charged  with having led a group of armed civilians.    Holla del Salto, 59, was accused of leading and arming a  group of civilians in the eastern state of Puebla with shotguns,  .22-caliber rifles, and other small arms. The authorities have  not disclosed any details about the group, but Holla del Salto  was expelled for having forged Mexican citizenship documents.    The Ecuadoran priest was arrested Sunday in Chapulco,  Puebla,  180 km east of the Mexican capital, and he was expelled from the  country Monday, which prompted protests by some 500 of his  followers who blocked local highways to demand his return.    Holla's arrest and the existence of his armed group aroused  the concern of a group of senators, who asked the government to  investigate the existence of organizations such as this one,  particularly in areas susceptible to unrest.    The Mexican Government must detect "additional armed groups  in areas in which there may be social conflicts," said  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Senator Alger Leon,  chairman of the Senate Defense Commission.    German Sierra, a senator from Puebla, asked authorities to  dismantle the armed group organized by Holla del Salto, who  lived in Chapulco. Sierra also admitted that the authorities  were aware of Holla's activities for some time but had failed to  act to avoid confrontations with the fanatics who sheltered him.  Senator Sierra denied the priest was involved in drug  trafficking or that he had connections with other guerrilla  groups in the country, characterizing the existence of the  Puebla organization as no threat "because its members do not  have high-caliber weapons."    The Secretariat of Defense recently admitted that it had  unsuccessfully investigated reports that approximately 2,000  AK-47 submachine guns, which are known in Mexico as "goat  horns," had entered the country. According to the reports, the  weapons, allegedly part of a larger shipment, may have been  intended for drug traffickers or armed groups in certain  southern Mexico states.    The Ecuadoran priest, who arrived in Mexico in December  1961,  managed to leave Mexico to further his religious studies in  Europe and to reenter the country on several occasions using  false documents. According to records, he resided in Chapulco.    Puebla State and southern and southeastern Mexico, including  the state of Chiapas, are the areas with the highest rate of  poverty and, therefore, are the areas in which the probable  existence of armed groups is the highest.    Subcommander "Marcos" of the EZLN, which staged an uprising  on 1 January in Chiapas in southeastern Mexico, says he has been  informed that there are other armed groups in the country.  Subcommander "Marcos" said: "The government's blindness  prevents it from seeing that there are armed groups in various  parts of the republic, that they are multiplying, and that a  civil war is imminent."</p>

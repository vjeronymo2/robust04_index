			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Challenge to LT over pension move RAIL UNIONS are challenging the legality of the deed and rules of London Transport's pension fund and the procedures by which the salaried grade fund and wages grade fund were amalgamated to form the present merged fund in April 1989. The unions say the rules of the new fund give LT powers it was not entitled to take, in particular over the pension fund surplus. The merger of the funds, into a fund of a total of nearly Pounds 1.7bn, was allowed under a law which the unions believe specified that the new fund should reflect, as nearly as possible, the balance of power and responsibilities that existed under the predecessor funds. The legal dispute arises from LT's decision to award itself the use of 70 per cent of the fund's surplus of about Pounds 460m and use the remaining 30 per cent for improvements to benefits. The case centres on legislation which is unique to LT, but solicitors acting for scheme members said the outcome could have implications for other companies seeking to merge pension schemes. There has been an increasing trend since the mid 1980s for companies to switch pension-scheme members into new schemes with less restrictive rules, allowing the companies to take advantage of surpluses built up as high investment returns outstripped increases in benefits. A solicitor for some of the LT members said that in most of those cases members had been offered some enhancement of benefits. 'In this case, they did not think the inducement was enough,' he added. Most scheme members, unhappy with the terms of their transfer, have been unable to seek redress in the courts because they do not have the funds to pursue a legal claim. The LT case is among the first to be tested in the courts. The case centres on whether the loose body of trust law, which requires trustees to act in the best interest of beneficiaries, allows the transfer of those beneficiaries to a scheme which has less generous terms than those currently on offer. LT said: 'We maintain our view is reasonable but we would always listen to new proposals. We hope the dispute is resolved before the court hearing in December.'</p>

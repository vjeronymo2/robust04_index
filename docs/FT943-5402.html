			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Rossini's 'Magpie' revived British Youth Opera, whose eighth season opened at Sadler's Wells this week, is a Good Cause. In a world where young singers need all the practical experience they can get, BYO plays a vital role. With both valuable talent to nurture and a precarious budget to balance the company's stakes are high, and it can ill afford the errors of judgment that marred one of its new productions: the contrasting fortunes of The Thieving Magpie, a heartwarming success, and the lamentable Yevgeny Onegin will, one hopes, have been instructive. The former was everything it should have been, and provided Thursday's audience the chance to hear a Rossini masterpiece not staged in London for over a decade. The Magpie is a difficult work and perhaps BYO's most ambitious project yet. Its semiseria genre, balancing humour and pathos, puts pitfalls in the way of producers, but here Jamie Hayes traces the plot - which hinges on a sinister miscarriage of justice - from light to darkness and back with a sure hand. The young cast is given strong direction; the minor characters illuminated and crowd scenes are effective, especially the march to the scaffold that fills the raked stage. The show is at once lively - the eponymous bird being taken by a dancer - and serious. Rauri Murchison's designs have colourful flair. The BYO ensemble distinguished itself by getting virtually every word of Jeremy Sams's excellent translation across. Rosamund Cole stood out for her brightly sung Ninetta, a performance that seems to promise an exciting future. Mark Milhofer disclosed a mellifluous high tenor as Giannetto, and Matthew Hargreaves a well articulated bass as the lecherous Mayor. Stephen Allen and Joanna Edworthy as Giannetto's parents Fabrizio and Lucia, Benjamin Bland (Fernando), Heather Shipp (Pippo), and Colin Judson (Isaaco) all deserve mention. The company's music director, Timothy Dean, conducted with zest, judging tempos admirably. The contrast with the previous evening's Tchaikovsky, ruined by sloppy orchestral playing from the same band and wayward singing from the same chorus, could not have been greater. Mark Shanahan's conducting was fast and unfeeling. The production by Wilfred Judd was under-rehearsed and under-directed. The young singers desperately needed better guidance, but three in particular survived to emerge with credit: the Swedish soprano Linda Tuvas was a striking Tatyana, Garry Magee a dark-voiced Onegin, and Rachel Lambert a strong Filipyevna with a well-focussed mezzo. The show as a whole, however, is probably best wiped from the BYO annals. Further performances at Sadler's Wells on Saturday and September 14,15; and at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre from September 7-10.</p>

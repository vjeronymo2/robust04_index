			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> CITY STUDIES HIRING AIRPORT CONSULTANT  </P> <P> The city may hire an airport consultant to help determine if Fullerton  Municipal Airport poses a threat to Buena Park residents, according to Mayor  Donald L. Bone.  </P> <P> "As a council we have talked about this and have directed staff to begin  investigating what it would require to hire a consultant," Bone said.  </P> <P> The action follows the city's unsuccessful attempts to get the Federal Aviation  Administration to compare the safety record of Fullerton airport to airports  with similar characteristics.  </P> <P> Following a plane crash in September, the council sent a letter to the FAA,  asking that the agency conduct a safety analysis based on factors including the  number of accidents, the amount of damage and the number and type of injuries.  </P> <P> However, in recent correspondence, FAA officials informed the city that they  have no ability to conduct such an analysis.  </P> <P> "We want to find out what it would cost, the time line, et cetera," Bone said.  </P> <P> Bone said that city staffers will begin compiling information and that then the  council will determine if the private consultant should be hired.  </P> <P> One factor in the decision will be cost. Due to increased cost of services and  labor contracts, the city is already facing a budget deficit of more than $1  million. In recent months the council has raised taxes in an attempt to offset  the deficit.  </P> <P> Getting the budget out of the red will take priority over other projects, Bone  said.LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Fisons shares drop 29% on profits warning FISONS, the British pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group, yesterday surprised the City by warning that its interim profits were likely to be less than half the Pounds 95.2m figure achieved in the first six months of 1991. The company's shares fell by 29 per cent, closing 100p lower at 245p, at which the company is valued at Pounds 1.69bn. Mr Patrick Egan, group chairman, said continuing difficulties in the pharmaceuticals division were mainly to blame for the 'very disappointing' first-half results. Turnover at the scientific instruments division would also be lower than last year because of the recession. City analysts, stung by the announcement, said it raised doubts about Fisons' future. Most believe that the shares would have to fall further for a takeover bid. Mr Egan has ruled out a merger with a larger group. He took over in January when Mr John Kerridge retired as executive chairman after pressure from institutional shareholders. Fisons's pharmaceuticals operations have been troubled since 1989 when the US Food and Drug Administration asked for Opticrom, an eye treatment, to be withdrawn because of problems with quality standards. In 1990, Imferon, a blood product, was withdrawn for similar reasons. Before withdrawal, Opticrom had annual sales of about Dollars 40m. Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, said yesterday the loss of sales and additional costs associated with upgrading Opticrom's manufacturing facilities would significantly affect the results. In addition, the attention paid to Opticrom and a desire not to market drugs with quality deficiencies had meant sales of other products had suffered. Analysts said Fisons told them yesterday it would make about Pounds 35m during the first six months. The pharmaceutical division would make operating profits of Pounds 17m for the first half compared with Pounds 68m; the scientific equipment division would make Pounds 18m (Pounds 27m); and horticultural products would make Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.4m). Interest and other charges would amount to Pounds 5m. The analysts said that such results would be dependent upon economic upturn. The company's profit shortfall would not affect its planned disposal of the horticultural and consumer health businesses, Mr Scroggs said. Fisons remained financially strong and there was no need for fire-sales. The businesses have been estimated to be worth between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. The company's strategy of looking for co-marketing partners remained, Mr Scroggs said. The company was particularly looking for a partner in the US.

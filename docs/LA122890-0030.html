			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE HOLIDAY TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> IT'S BOMBS AWAY FOR CAPISTRANO VALLEY IN VICTORY OVER KENNEDY  </P> <P> Few teams in Orange County have taken advantage of the three-point shot more  effectively than Capistrano Valley High School since the rule was incorporated  in 1987-88.  </P> <P> For the past three years, Capistrano Valley has been highly successful with  former stars Scott McCorkle, Chris Kostoff, Bill Mazurie and Charles Lockard  consistently hitting the three-pointer.  </P> <P> On Thursday night, Capistrano Valey once again rode the wave of some fine  three-point shooting, making seven of 11 attempts in the first half and rolling  to a 73-55 victory over Kennedy in the Orange Holiday Tournament.  </P> <P> The victory moved Capistrano Valley (12-1) into tonight's semifinals, where it  will meet San Francisco Riordan (8-2) at 6:50 in Chapman College's Hutton  Sports Center. Mater Dei (7-3) will meet Santa Clara (12-2) in the other  semifinal.  </P> <P> Three of the four teams played in state championship games in Oakland last  spring. Mater Dei beat Riordan in the Division I title game and Santa Clara was  the Division IV champion.  </P> <P> Riordan will have the imposing task of trying to contain guard Tom Airey, the  latest in the line of top guns at Capistrano Valley. Airey scored 26 points  against Kennedy, hitting six three-pointers against a soft Kennedy defense.  </P> <P> Airey made three consecutive three-pointers in the second quarter when  Capistrano Valley opened a 40-25 lead, and the Cougars weren't threatened the  rest of the way. Center Brett McCorkle also showed he can hit three-pointers,  making a pair in the second quarter. Capistrano Valley made 9 of 13 field goals  in the quarter.  </P> <P> "This line has changed the game so much in the past four years that you've got  to take advantage of it," said Mark Thornton, Capistrano Valley coach. "We  start right off emphasizing the shot with our freshmen. Right now, we have  three or four kids on the freshman team who can shoot it."  </P> <P> Thornton said Capistrano Valley averages 42% as a team from three-point range  with Airey, McCorkle and guard Dan Sedgwick given the green light to attempt  the shot. Airey averages 50% from three-point range.  </P> <P> Kennedy (3-6) did a poor job of defending Capistrano Valley's shooters, using a  perimeter defense that's designed to contain outside shooters.  </P> <P> The lone bright spot for Kennedy was the continued improvement of junior center  Jermaine Galloway. Galloway had 23 points, nine rebounds and blocked three  shots.  </P> <P> Mater Dei 60, Orange 36 -- Forward Jason Janeski scored 19 points and center  Terence Wilborn added 10 points as Mater Dei (8-3) won for the sixth time in  its past seven games. Center Jamiel Wortheim had 15 points for Orange (6-4).  </P> <P> In consolation play:  </P> <P> Saddleback 72, Sammamish (Wash.) 67 -- Forward Jason Register scored 17 points  and teammate David Washington added 14 for Saddleback.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 84, Facey Composite 37 -- Center Barrett Hoygan scored 20  points and forward Adam Ziebarth added 16 for Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach 73, Orange Lutheran 70 -- Guard Josh Borrella, averaging 28 points  per game, scored a season-high 37 for Laguna Beach (6-4).  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring by </F> Veronique Meutey; place and date not given: "Northern Ireland:  Voting for Peace" -- first two paragraphs are LE FIGARO  introduction]    [Text] The European election which takes place today in  both Northern Ireland and Britain will be dominated by the  conflict that has been racking the province for 25 years.  Candidates fielded by three major parties are expected to be  reelected: Ian Paisley for the Democratic Ulster Party (DUP),  Jim Nicholson for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP, moderate), and  John Hume, a Catholic, for the Social Democratic Labor Party  (SDLP, moderately nationalist).    "European stakes transcend our traditional fault lines. If  we can cooperate with other European countries in view of a  common interest, then we can work together at home," John Hume  pleaded, to no avail. Once again, political and religious  differences will prevail. And both the SDLP, which has been  defending the Anglo-Irish document, and the UUP, which still  favors it, fear the disenchantment of moderate voters with the  slowness of the peace process. In this context, Irish Foreign  Minister Dick Spring explains Dublin's views on the European  election's immediate stakes as well as the conditions for a  potential referendum on Irish reunification. [passage omitted]    Meutey: How can the conflict in Northern Ireland  be ended?    Spring: Right now, the best way would be for the  Loyalists and Republicans to seize the chance offered them by  the Downing Street declaration and subsequent texts. If they  acknowledge these texts, they agree to support negotiation  efforts between London and Dublin.    Meutey: Do you favor reunification?    Spring: All we want today is to put an end to the  killing in Ulster. For the time being, reunification is not on  the agenda. We must show respect for the Loyalists, who want to  retain their links with Britain. The identity of the 500,000  individuals who want to retain their connections with the Irish  Republic must be respected as well.    Meutey: When would reunification actually happen,  then?    Spring: When a majority of Ulster's population  has expressed a wish to see it happen...    Meutey: If Sinn Fein agrees to stop the violence,  when would the referendum take place in Northern Ireland?    Spring: Even if violence were to stop tomorrow  morning, at least 12 months of talks would be needed. So the  referendum could be held in both Northern and Southern Ireland  within a year.    Meutey: Will voters in Northern Ireland be asked  the same question as in your country?    Spring: Ideally, yes. But we must take into  account differences between the two countries. There will  likely have to be two different questions.    Meutey: Will the referendums be held on the same  day?    Spring: Same day, same time...</p>

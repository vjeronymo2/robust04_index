			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Indian groups turn to loans market Three of India's best-known companies have turned to the international syndicated loans market in recent weeks, attracted by the continued erosion of margins and the willingness among international banks to invest in this fashionable emerging market. Indian companies have been allowed to tap the international loans market since last October under a so-called 'net exporter loan' scheme, whereby the loans are repaid from their net export earnings. A Dollars 30m term loan facility with a maturity of 30 months for Indian Rayon and Industries, part of the AV Birla multinational group, has been closed following a significant oversubscription. An official at ANZ, which arranged the loan with ABN-Amro, said Indian companies can now expect to pay an annual rate of around 1 1/4 per cent over Libor, down from 1 5/8 per cent at the start of this year. He added that a Dollars 12.5m two-year amortising loan which ANZ arranged for Tube Investments of India was also oversubscribed. Meanwhile, Tata Iron and Steel, which exports around 20 per cent of its total sales, has asked ANZ to arrange a Dollars 25m two-year loan to finance the purchase of equipment, raw materials or services for use in specified projects to assist in export enhancement. This loan is in the process of being syndicated.</p>

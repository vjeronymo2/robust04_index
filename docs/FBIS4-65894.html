			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Swedish News Agency article: "Clear Majority for No to EU"] </F>   [Text] There is a clear majority against the European Union  [EU] if the referendum were held today. This is shown by a  survey done by IMU-Testologen. Of those questioned, 40 percent  would vote no, 33 percent would vote yes, while 27 are unsure  how they would vote. The survey was carried out in April at the  request of the newspaper ARBETET.    Compared with an equivalent survey done in February, EU  opponents have increased by 2 percent while the number of  proponents declined by 1 percent. These changes do, however,  lie within the statistical margin of error.    If the respondents are divided according to party sympathy,  a  clear change is noticed. Within the nonsocialist bloc (not  including New Democracy), the number of yes voters has increased  from 51 percent in February to 57 percent in April. In the  socialist bloc the number of yes voters has decreased from 25  percent to 21.    The number of opponents is about the same on both sides, 20  percent among the nonsocialists and 21 among the socialists.  Therefore the number of undecided voters is significantly larger  on the socialist side.    Of those who voted for the EU, 21 percent thought the  statement "Sweden should not be isolated" was decisive in their  choice. For 18 percent the statement "necessary for export" was  decisive, and for 17 percent the statement "serves peace in  Europe" was.    Among the no voters, 33 percent thought that the statement  "the consequences are not sufficiently determined" was decisive,  while 24 percent said "open borders cause problems with drugs  and violence" and 23 percent said "poorer quality of foodstuffs"  were the most important motives.    The survey included 1,012 people.</p>

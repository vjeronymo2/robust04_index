			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Private pay rises knock-on to public sector Sir, In 'Hunt issues fresh warning on pay rises' (May 19), the emphasis was on the need for businesses to control their wage costs so as to maintain their competitiveness. While this is important there are wider implications of the recent rapid increase in private sector pay. One aspect is the knock-on effect to future public sector pay awards. The pay review bodies for nurses, armed forces and teachers, for example, regularly refer to 'backward' looking comparisons with earnings in the previous 12 months in the whole economy when they make recommendations for the forthcoming year. Increases in the current year until September will form an important part of their considerations for public service pay between April 1995 and March 1996. Similar arrangements, such as inter-quartile ranges of past pay movements, apply in the long-term pay agreements for civil servants. In addition to the institutional considerations, econometric analysis for the period 1963-1982 (which I carried out with S G B Henry and N Foster and published while at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in the 1980s) 'proved' public service pay is largely determined by earlier developments in the private sector. The 'lags' were often long and also variable, anything from three-quarters to three years, but in the long run current private sector pay increases were the single most important determinant of future central and local government pay levels. The significance of these 'facts' is that, although the government may announce public sector pay 'restraint' and implement it for a period, if pay in other parts of the economy continues to rise at a much faster rate, then to recruit, retain and motivate people of appropriate quality for the public services it is necessary to raise those wage rates too. The 'funding' limits operated by the government over the medium term to that extent restrict the quantity and quality of the public services available, but the long-term 'price/wages' are outside its control.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Carlos Reina by Raul Balladares at </F> the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa -- live]    [Text] [Balladares] We are now with President Carlos Reina,  just hours before the opening of the mini-summit of Central  American presidents -- a session in which U.S. Vice President Al  Gore will also participate.    Good morning, President Reina. What do you have to say to  the Honduran people a few hours before this mini-summit gets  under way? It has been said that Vice President Albert Gore's  presence is the beginning of a new relationship between Central  America and the United States.    [Reina] Thank you, dear friends, for visiting us at the  Presidential Palace this morning at a time when we are on the  threshold of such an important event, namely, the visit of U.S.  Vice President Albert Gore and the Central American presidents.  All of us will get an opportunity to speak to this important  U.S. statesman who enjoys great prestige in his country and  abroad.    I have heard very fitting comments on this visit, comments  that have significant meaning. This summit means that our  nation has the democratic conditions and the international image  required to serve as host of such an important event. Under  these circumstances, we are preparing for two more summits: the  Cartagena de Indias summit and the Miami summit. One is the  Ibero-American Summit, and the other summit has been organized  by the United States. There have been a number of events  leading up to this meeting. This meeting is being held in  Tegucigalpa to enable the Central American presidents to engage  in an open dialogue with the U.S. official, thereby allowing us  to extensively review issues prior to the Cartagena de Indias  and Miami summits.    We believe there are basic issues that need to be discussed  with the U.S. statesman. For example, we must repair the  damages of a badly administered economy, while at the same time  we must improve the state's finances. We must also strengthen  the business sector's capacity, and we must meet the most  pressing needs of the those people living in poverty who  comprise the majority in Honduras. To do this, it is imperative  that the international institutions adopt more flexible  policies. This is one of the main issues we are going to  discuss at this Tegucigalpa meeting.    As far as the domestic situation is concerned, our position  is that basically we need a broad consensus of all social and  economic sectors to implement a [word indistinct] plan in  Honduras. Therefore, we need the understanding and flexibility  of the international institutions and friendly nations for this  transition, at least until the unification plan is fully  implemented.    In preparation for the Tegucigalpa meeting, there was the  Inter-American Conference for Peace and Development for Central  America, which was held during the 14th Presidential Summit in  Guatemala on 29 October 1993. We should reinstate the thesis of  the Alliance for Sustained Development in which Guatemala and  Costa Rica have been actively participating. For our part, we  should strengthen trade, investment, and environmental  protection. All of these issues will be taken up as part of a  very full agenda. This is what I can tell you in broad terms  about this event, of which I am very pleased, because it  represents trust in the Honduran democratic system.    [Balladares] In Switzerland this weekend, the American  Association of Jurists questioned the IMF about its autocratic  rule over the world's economies and finances, claiming it only  wants to help powerful multinational corporations. President  Reina, are you going to raise this issue with Vice President  Gore during his visit? Some of your government officials have  said that these statements by the American Association of  Jurists might prompt international financial institutions to be  more flexible, which is something you stressed this morning.    [Reina] The news you have just given me agrees with what the  world currently thinks. The nations that are moving down the  path toward strengthening democratic systems, as well as facing  up to macroeconomic variables to achieve healthy economies, must  not be pressured. With a healthy and prosperous economy, all  other problems can be resolved. The opinion of the jurists  agrees with this position. The people of Latin America and the  world need international financial institutions to display  flexibility, not impose pressure. With this flexibility, we can  very well solve difficult situations and strengthen what  concerns everyone -- namely, human development. During our  campaign, we gave this policy the name of development with a  human face.    [Balladares] Does this mean you are going to present the  U.S.  vice president with these concerns, in other words, that there  should not be any pressure? Nevertheless, such pressure does  indeed exist. For example, one form is already being felt, the  elimination of subsidies and the ensuing higher prices of public  services in our country. This is part of what these  international financial institutions are demanding from our  nation. Will this be raised with the U.S. vice president  because it is common knowledge that Honduras, at least the  Honduran people, cannot endure a situation of this nature.    [Reina] We are dealing here with two situations. One is to  be discussed with Vice President Gore and the other involves  multilateral issues, such as the treaties in which the  international financial institutions offer assistance to our  nations. At times, however, when demands must be made, these  are made with some emphasis. I think the president [as heard],  all international officials, and all Latin American and world  leaders know about this situation. What we have to determine  now is how to resolve this situation. For example, in the case  of Honduras, we want to avoid the situation we encountered when  we received the nation amid a general crisis, a crisis that has  a tendency to worsen.    We have halted this tendency. Now we must consolidate a  very solid and democratic way of life in Honduras. We must make  deep cultural and educational changes. One of the first steps  we took in this direction was to strengthen all values of  civilian society. This has been excellent in clearing the way.  Also, I believe that economically we must update our  macroeconomic foundations. This cannot be done quickly. We must  do this thoroughly and with the efforts of all of the Honduran  people.    I insist that we not allow those who have been hard hit,  which is the majority of the Honduran people, to be hard hit any  longer. We are on the path of overcoming this situation.    [Balladares] Mr. President, according to many skeptics,  Honduras is no longer a strategic point for the United States.  For this reason, these skeptics claim that U.S. assistance is  being diverted from Honduras. Do you really think that with the  visit of this important U.S. official, the country can receive  assistance equal to aid it received in the past or perhaps even  larger amounts of aid?    [Reina] The problem you have raised is much more complicated  than that. We have left the Cold War behind us. In the Cold  War, the world's attention was focused on Central America  because a Cold War was forming in Central America in which the  two large blocs were testing their strength. In El Salvador  alone, the United States gave more than $6 billion in military  assistance. We know now, however, that this situation and this  world view have disappeared. The two blocs have reconciled, and  now what is being sought is to improve the people's way of life.  U.S. assistance that was geared toward a situation of conflict  has disappeared. Now, we must develop assistance geared toward  issues such as social problems, improving international  solidarity, technical assistance, transfer of technology,  environmental problems, and various forms of international  cooperation.    We cannot continue to permit tactless remarks that say  Honduras is not fit for investment. I have seen with great  satisfaction that even the U.S. representative in Honduras, the  U.S. ambassador, has said that this is wrong and that Honduras  is indeed a country for investment, a country in which all  guarantees and securities are provided for anyone wishing to  invest in Honduras. The world that you refer to has  disappeared. The new world is based on other premises that are  more encouraging.    [Balladares] Will you ask the U.S. vice president for fair  access of Central American products in the U.S. market?    [Reina] In terms of economics, there are many things that  will have to be brought up. There is the topic of Central  America's possible integration into NAFTA. This is a technical  and extensive topic. Let us recall that Honduras is also a  member of GATT. Honduras has had a series of setbacks in terms  of the banana trade. All of these economic topics will have to  be broached with the U.S. vice president.    I think, however, that he is coming to gain awareness of  what  is truly happening in Central America. This is the main point  to which I referred earlier. He is coming to gain awareness and  to make contact with the presidents of the area in order that  the resolutions will favor international cooperation, with that  new human face I mentioned, as well as with that way of  approaching the people and offering support to democratic  governments that are making immense efforts to leave their  historical problems behind. I think this is part of the basic  objective.    The fact that he is coming to Honduras honors us very much.  When President Kennedy planned to meet with Central American  presidents, he met them in San Jose, Costa Rica. That was a  meeting of utmost importance in which Dr. Villeda Morales played  an important role. Subsequently, President Johnson went to San  Salvador. That was another era. Today, the Clinton  administration has selected Tegucigalpa, this dearly beloved  capital of Honduras, in which we should all be united now to  request not assistance but, rather, request that we be shown  understanding and flexibility in finding solutions to our  problems.    [Balladares] Mr. President, because we have a government  that is conducting a moral revolution and, as you say, a  government that has a human face, there have been some questions  about this. As the U.S. vice president arrives in Honduras and  as we enhance our rapprochement with the U.S. Government in the  field of economics, specifically in terms of assistance to the  country, what will the talks you will be undertaking within the  next few hours consist of?    [Reina] U.S. influence in all world organizations is very  great because the United States is the richest and most powerful  nation in the world. We demand an understanding that takes our  efforts into account. As I mentioned earlier -- for example,  things such as the unification plan, broadening democracy, and  improving macroeconomic indicators -- the United States must be  aware of all of these efforts. In addition, our fight against  corruption, drug trafficking, and poverty as our essential goals  is something democracies worldwide deem very praiseworthy.    [Balladares] Mr. President, Honduras used to be very  important within the region because of the Nicaraguan war and  the presence of contras on our soil. This is why Honduras was a  U.S. strategic location in Central America. In light of what  you said on 20 May -- that the U.S. vice president's arrival  necessarily underscores the great importance of our country --  why is Honduras regaining importance? By virtue of the fact  that Honduras was chosen as the site of the meeting, is this an  unusual visit? What is the message of the visit?    [Reina] I want to speak openly. Within the framework of the  Cold War, Honduras played a sad and very bitter role because of  the presence of counterrevolutionary forces involved in the  Central American war. Honduras' image was very negative then.  Today, however, just the opposite is true. Honduras was chosen  to host this Central American presidents meeting to discuss the  two upcoming summits -- again, the Cartagena de Indias and Miami  summits. This reflects the strategic importance of Honduras.  Also, Honduras has become a democratically strategic location  in strengthening the values that serve as democratic  foundations, and, in turn, this improves the image of Honduras  within the United States and the world community. I believe I  heard this stated in the Tegucigalpa media. We must understand  this concept and welcome the international community's  recognition of the democratic system currently reigning in  Honduras.    [Balladares] Mr. President, in a weekend meeting of some  Armed Forces chiefs, the (Trifinio) Plan was made public by  Colonel Claudio Lainez Coello, who views the opening of the  border with suspicion because it may ultimately hurt the nation.  What is your opinion on this?    [Reina] Opening the borders is a delicate, yet inevitable,  process within the framework of integration. We must learn to  live peacefully and democratically in Central America. This  poses new risks. As for the (Trifinio) Plan, I flatly oppose  its so-called shared sovereignty. It was unacceptable before  the demarcation of the borders because it could misrepresent the  jurisdiction of each state. After the borders were demarcated  by the highest world court, their redemarcation became  imperative. Then, the states will be able to reach special  agreements for the development of the area. This situation is  not only relevant to the (Trifinio) Plan, but also to the  Fonseca Gulf. The disputation of sovereignty issues by others,  however, is something that must unite all Hondurans in order to  defend our interests, interests that must not hinder regional  development.    [Balladares] As for domestic issues, over the weekend it was  reported that you had decided to dismiss a top tourism official.  It sounded like speculation, and we are lacking an official  report. I would like to know if you have any official report?    [Reina] Special commissions are currently investigating the  latest cases in Tourism, Honduran Corporation for Forest  Development, and Customs. These commissions will issue their  reports in due time. I want to view this situation very  positively, however. Should there be any irregularities, the  Honduran people will be informed. The Honduran media have  played a key role in this. This is part of the fight against  corruption; it is a barometer for the new system.    In the past, we refused to talk about corruption until it  was  impossible to control it. Today, we all act on it as soon as we  encounter it, as soon as the first symptom arises. I believe it  is important for each case to be properly studied. This  constitutes the basis for many cases whose resolutions will be  made public in accordance with the duties of a responsible  government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by G Arde] </F>   [Text] Durban March 7 SAPA--There is a "strong likelihood"  the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] will not observe Wednesday's [9  March] deadline for the submission of its election candidate  list to the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], it emerged  on Monday. Reaffirming this view from IFP National Chairman  Frank Mdlalose on a radio interview, spokesman Ed Tillet said  "we don't see any pressure on us".    "I don't see the IFP observing that deadline at all. A  national settlement is far more important than artificial dates.  The first thing we have to do is secure a national settlement  which will accommodate the aspirations of the vast majority.  We'll draw up a candidate list only after attempts at  international mediation, and providing those attempts are  successful...We haven't worried about it at all," Mr Tillet said.    The IFP spokesman said he was confident the IEC would allow  flexibility on the issue of late registration. "There has to be  room for flexibility on this; we're talking about a life or  death situation here," he said.    IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje said the party's registration  would lapse if its candidate list was not submitted by 4.30PM on  Wednesday. "If they have any difficulty they would need to talk  to us. We'll try to be as helpful as we can," Mr Cronje said,  adding he knew of no communication from the IFP on the matter by  Monday afternoon. "It's difficult to say what plan can be made;  it depends on the nature of the party's problem," he said in  response to a suggestion that the deadline might be waived.    Mr Tillet said it would be almost impossible to finalise the  party's list by the deadline because the list would have to be  caucused and then verified at a regional level.</p>

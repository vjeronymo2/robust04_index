			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Lower interest rates lift financial stocks EASIER interest rates lifted financial stocks yesterday, though industrial recession in Europe and a firmer dollar continued to mark cyclical and dollar-sensitive stocks yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was cheered by some good interim results and bargain-hunting in over-sold blue chips. The CAC-40 index ended 41.64 or 2.58 per cent higher at 1,654.15 on turnover of FFr2.82bn, of which FFr609m was generated in Printemps. Shares in Au Printemps, the department store, were re-quoted at FFr780, up FFr130 or 20 per cent, the price offered by Pinault to buy out minority shareholders. The shares were suspended on September 22. Societe Generale rose FFr30.80 or 6.4 per cent to FFr514 after pleasing the market with its interim results, released shortly before the close. But Paribas slumped FFr12.80 or 4.4 per cent to FFr278.30 on reports of serious losses at Ciments Francais, in which the bank has a 34 per cent stake. The stock fell on speculation that Paribas would have to pay compensation to Italcementi of Italy, which is in the process of buying a controlling stake in the French cement group. Shares in Ciments Francais were suspended. UAP jumped FFr29 or 8.4 per cent to FFr375, amid rumours that it was planning to raise its industrial insurance premiums by 20 per cent. FRANKFURT ran the twin themes - banks strong, carmakers weak - which have given its equity market some character since the ERM realignment and the reduction in German interest rates on September 14. A 7 per cent drop in nine-month sales at Daimler's Mercedes-Benz car division, and talk of a downgrade to nil in Warburg's 1993 earnings forecast for Volkswagen, left Daimler DM3.50 lower at DM522, and Volkswagen DM5.70 down at DM252.90. Banks posted strong gains on the recovery in the Bunds, and recurrent talk of a downward trend in German interest rates. Deutsche Bank rose DM12.30 to DM632.80, Dresdner by DM7.50 to DM345.50 and Commerzbank by DM4.50 to DM238. Since September 14 the banks have lost less than 1 per cent on a crude average, compared with 16 per cent for the big three carmakers and 10 per cent for the DAX index, which rose 15.70 to 1,436.05 yesterday. ZURICH, lifted by lower Swiss interest rates and the firmer dollar, saw the SMI index rise 37.7 or 2.1 per cent to 1,858.2. In financials, Union Bank rose SFr24 to SFr790 and CS Holding by SFr55 to SFr1,975; among insurers, Winterthur gained SFr80 at SFr2,830 and Zurich SFr45 at SFr1,945. Pharmaceuticals featured a SFr110 rise to SFr3,530 in Roche certificates and SFr12 to SFr625 for Ciba Geigy bearers. Heavy industry was weak but the South African-controlled Richemont rose SFr90 to SFr1,050 following this week's implementation of its 10-for-one stock split. MILAN continued its rebound on hopes that the recent drop in the lira would improve the outlook for Italian exports. The Comit index rose 8.82 to 369.93 in turnover estimated at around Tuesday's L129bn. Fiat was fixed 5.8 per cent or L205 higher at L3,755 and Stet recovered another 7.4 per cent or L80 to L1,160. Italmobiliare and its cement group, Italcementi, were suspended by Consob. AMSTERDAM remained subdued as the CBS Tendency index edged up 0.1 at 107.8. Royal Dutch was affected by a downgrading of Shell UK and closed down 30 cents at Fl 141.90 while a sell note on Unilever took it Fl 1.70 lower to Fl 181.60. MADRID made ground as domestic banks bought across the board. The general index gained 3.65 to 186.80. Good volumes were noted in Ibredrola I, up Pta27 at Pta557, and Union Fenosa, Pta4 better at Pta354. STOCKHOLM rose as an easing in marginal lending rates from 20 per cent to 18 per cent drew foreign investors into the market. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 12.4 to 655.5 in turnover of SKr394m. Ericsson B and Astra free shares dominated trading, gaining SKr4 to SKr105 and SKr5 to SKr503. But Volvo free shares shed SKr11 to SKr214. Some analysts attributed the fall to weak European car demand. BRUSSELS closed mostly higher, in line with other European markets. The Bel-20 index rose 8.93 to 1,077.15. Societe Generale de Belgique, which on Tuesday reported a 6.3 per cent fall in first half net, was one of the day's biggest gainers, climbing BFr50 or 2.8 per cent to BFr1,810. HELSINKI's banks recovered some of the sharp losses they sustained earlier this week, the banks and finance index rising 13.1 per cent as the Hex index rose 9.1, or 1.5 per cent to 612.2. VIENNA's ATX index rose 2.98 to 771.53 but Lenzing, the textile and fibre manufacturer, went against the trend, slipping Sch9 to Sch619 after warning that the dividend may be cut this year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - OCT 7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes    Open    11.30am 12 pm    1 pm    2 pm    3 pm    4 pm   close    961.64  963.43  967.17  969.20  969.79  968.74  971.78  971.05  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High 972.51            Day's Low 961.64  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Oct 6         Oct 5        Oct 2        Oct 1        Sep 30       954.29        937.42       993.56      1006.01      1003.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

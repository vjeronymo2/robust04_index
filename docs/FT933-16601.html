			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Storm writes off brush with Russian paintings STORM GROUP, the UK animation, licensing and merchandising company, is writing off the last of its paintings received from the Soviet Union instead of royalties in view of the fall in the art market. Mr Jim Driscoll, executive chairman of the USM-quoted group, said: 'We expect to be able to sell them when the market improves but we wanted to clear the decks as part of the change of direction of the company.' The paintings, all by 20th century Russian artists, had been in the books at Pounds 276,000. Their write-off formed part of an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.08m in the 1992 results. Mr Driscoll said the company had raised Pounds 100,000 from sales of paintings to cover the value of the royalties. Pre-tax losses came out at Pounds 2.11m (against Pounds 848,000) on turnover of Pounds 6.04m (up from Pounds 1.43m). During the year the company decided to pull out of investing in cartoon productions. It will concentrate on licensing and merchandising. As a result of the change, film costs are being written off as they are incurred. This accounted for Pounds 1.54m of the exceptional costs for 1992, with Pounds 750,000 being charged to the previous year. The company fell into operating losses in the second half of the year. It said it expected to return to profits for the first half of 1993. Mr Driscoll said he was confident the improving trend would continue in the second half. Losses per share were 2.8p (against 1.7p).</p>

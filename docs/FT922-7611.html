			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Greene King bids for Morland - WIC sells 28.5% holding and pledges 14.9% balance to Pounds 101m offer GREENE KING, the south of England's largest regional brewer, yesterday launched a Pounds 101.3m hostile bid for Morland, its Oxfordshire-based rival. The offer, triggered by the Whitbread Investment Company's need to reduce its holdings in regional brewers to comply with the government's beer orders, was immediately rejected as inadequate by Morland. WIC was Morland's biggest shareholder with a 43.4 per cent holding. It is selling a 28.5 per cent stake to Greene King for Pounds 27.23m cash and has agreed to accept the offer for its remaining 14.9 per cent if there is no higher bidder. Sir Humphrey Prideaux, Morland's chairman, warned shareholders that WIC was 'a forced seller . . . influenced by motives that are not relevant to other shareholders'. He added that WIC had to reduce its stake in Morland by November to ensure that its associate brewer, Whitbread, did not have to free more of its pubs from tied beer supplies. Speculation now surrounds the future of two more brewers, Marston, in which WIC has a 31.4 per cent stake and Brakspear, where Whitbread has a 27 per cent holding. Greene King, which had tried for nearly three months to agree merger terms with Morland, is offering nine new convertible preference shares for every two Morland shares, equivalent to about 477p a share. There is a cash alternative of 450p. The paper offer represents a 47 per cent premium on the Morland share price in February when talks began and an exit multiple of 21 times Morland's 1991 earnings. Morland's shares closed at 458p, down 27p while Greene King fell 7p to close at 507p. Mr Simon Redman, Greene King's chairman, said that a merger made commercial and financial sense in the changing conditions of the beer market. 'Morland faces strategic difficulties as a small independent company, with neither the strength of brands nor the critical mass to become an efficient low cost producer,' he said. 'Greene King is the natural merger partner, with an excellent fit between our trading areas and similar business cultures.' Mr Redman estimated that the acquisition would lead to cost savings and improved margins which should benefit trading profits of the enlarged group by an initial Pounds 2.5m a year. The combined estate of more than 1,100 pubs would enable Greene King to consolidate its position in southern England where its Abbot and IPA brands already command a 20 per cent share of the market for cask conditioned ale. Greene King would close Morland's Abingdon brewery, with a loss of about 100 jobs, early next year and convert the site to a distribution depot, Mr Redman said. The future of Morland's beer brands, Old Speckled Hen and Morland's Original, would be reviewed. Greene King recorded a marginal decline in interim pre-tax profits to November last year of Pounds 10.9m. Bad free trade debts and higher interest charges depressed earnings. Morland, which bought 100 pubs from Courage last year, increased interim profits to March 31 of Pounds 3.06m a rise of 30 per cent. See Lex</p>

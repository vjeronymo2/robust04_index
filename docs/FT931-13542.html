			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Randstad buys US jobs agency RANDSTAD, the biggest temporary employment agency in the Netherlands and the fourth-largest in the world, said it had agreed in principle to take over a small agency in Atlanta, Georgia, fulfilling its long-held strategic goal of expanding into the US, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. It gave no financial details, but said that the agency, Temp Force Inc, had 12 offices in and around Atlanta and a full-time staff of 90. The company, which will continue to be run by its founder and sole shareholder, Mr Dewey Sadka, finds temporary jobs for some 15,000 workers a year. Randstad, which was floated on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 1990, said it would use its financial strength and know-how to help Temp Force expand. The Dutch company has been looking for an acquisition in the US for several years. It already has a large presence in Belgium and France and smaller shares of the UK and German markets.</p>

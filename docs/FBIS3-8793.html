			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The opposition has been very reluctant to take  the step and express no confidence in Prime Minister Vladimir  Meciar and his government. The watershed came with the speech  delivered by President Michal Kovac, which tipped the scales.  The unity of opposition was disturbed by the hesitation of the  Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], which, until the very last  moment, did not exclude cooperation with the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. This was stated by the vice chairman  of the Coexistence [Egyutteles] Movement, Arpad Duka Zolyomi,  whose statement continued to dominate today's press conference.  Our radio was represented by Bernard Hornak, who invited  Zolyomi to the microphone.    [Begin recording] [Hornak] According to a preliminary  agreement of the former opposition parties, politicians  representing the [ethnic] Hungarian parties in Slovakia will not  appear in the new government. In spite of this, you do support  the formation of the new government, which should consist of  representatives of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], of  the so-called center bloc, and of the Christian Democratic Party  [KDH].    [Zolyomi] I would like to return to the 26th session of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic, where we learned that  the emerging broader coalition did not count on our  participation. Then we started to discuss under what conditions  we were going to support this new government. We defined  certain points, certain measures that could be taken in a joint  effort with the government. These were very specific matters,  out of which a more comprehensive concept was formulated. We  therefore want to support this government, provided, of course,  that it keeps to our agreement. In such a case, our requests or  suggestions should appear in some form in the new government's  program.    [Hornak] You mentioned the conditions. What are they?    [Zolyomi] They are concerned with specific matters related,  for example, to the recommendations of the Council of Europe,  which should put an end to matters that have been dragging on  for almost a year. Then, certain questions relate to  jurisdiction of local self-governing bodies, to an alternative  educational system, and to the local administrative division.  Naturally, this government, whose term of office will be  limited, is probably not going to deal with this question in  depth. [passage omitted]. A further matter to be dealt with is  related to reorganizing and creating a new concept of the  Council for Nationalities working within the framework of the  Slovak Government and, in some way, the matter of minority  representation in the civil service.

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Wellman pays Pounds 46m for three FKI offshoots Wellman, the specialist engineering group, yesterday announced a large-scale expansion through the Pounds 46m acquisition of three businesses from FKI, the electrical engineering and components group. The deal, funded partly by a Pounds 32m placing and open offer, will increase Wellman's market capitalisation from Pounds 12m to Pounds 54m, with turnover predicted to jump from Pounds 22.3m to about Pounds 130m. Under the transaction, Wellman has agreed to pay FKI Pounds 30m from the placing and open offer - involving 88.9m new ordinary shares at 36p - while also issuing to FKI Pounds 10m of convertible preference shares and Pounds 6m of loan stock. Existing shareholders will be offered new shares on a 5-for-4 basis, and 5-for-1 for preference shareholders. The issue has been underwritten by Singer &amp; Friedlander. Mr Geoffrey Iley, Wellman chairman, said the acquisition would transform the Midlands-based group from a lossmaking operation into one with the potential for profits and growth. 'This deal gives us critical mass. After some pretty poor results, we had to make the existing business viable and to expand.' It follows more than six months of talks with FKI, which has agreed to sell three subsidiary groups: Transport Equipment, comprising four businesses making equipment for the automotive, garage and car parking market; Data Recording Instruments; and Babcock Robey, the boiler and pressure vessel manufacturer. The FKI companies made operating profits of Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 3.61m) on turnover of Pounds 91.8m (Pounds 91m) in the year to March 31 1994. Mr Iley said the figure had been dented by exceptional restructuring provisions of Pounds 2.07m which were 'unlikely to recur in the future'. For the same period, Wellman reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 681,000 profits). Wellman, however, said its performance had improved following the arrival last November of Mr Alan Baxter, a former FKI director, as chief executive. Mr Baxter, who first approached FKI with the acquisition proposal, has been credited with cutting Wellman's costs by 16 per cent and winning record orders of Pounds 24m this year. Mr Iley also announced a dividend for the current year of not less than 1.44p, pending approval of the deal. For FKI, yesterday's deal marked another stage in its phased withdrawal from non-core businesses. Mr Eric Bowers, finance director, said the disposals would enable the group to concentrate on four main areas: automotive components, hardware, engineering, and materials handling. 'It was always our aim to get rid of peripheral businesses, and Wellman was the only group to make an offer for the lot.' FKI plans to use the Pounds 30m payment to cut its Pounds 122m net borrowings, reducing gearing from 60 per cent to 44 per cent. See People</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A difficult shareholder BEFORE 1982, we purchased a freehold retail outlet at a value based primarily on property. At the end of 1985 one of the shareholders parted company, resulting in transfer of his shares to my wife. Allowing for the potential CGT liability, and calculating the absolute nett value of the shares, mainly based on the property value, we agreed a consideration sum for the share value, albeit unhappily. In March 1988, when the chancellor abolished liability to CGT on pre-1982 gains, the ex-shareholder demanded his share of the potential CGT saving. He has no rights after the shares were transferred, but because of heavy pressures and unbearable tension I have agreed to resolve the matter by paying him his share of the retained CGT liability. 1. How do I stand regarding stamp duty? This additional payment will obviously be counted as a consideration for the original share value. Do I simply say that this was a delayed payment? What about penalty, and so on? 2. In what manner do I inform the Revenue? 1. The payment which you have made cannot be regarded as part of the consideration for the transfer of the shares to your wife at the end of 1985. Consequently there is no stamp duty problem. 2. You have simply made a gift to the former shareholder, in order to stop him pestering you. So far as we can see, from the bare facts outlined, that gift cannot be taken into account for CGT purposes, either in relation to your wife's shareholding or in relation to your own. (The gift is a potentially exempt transfer for inheritance tax purposes.) No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

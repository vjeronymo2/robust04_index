			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Britain prepared to join US in air strikes BRITISH forces are ready to join the US in air strikes against Iraq if the Baghdad government continues to flout United Nations resolutions, the government signalled yesterday. Downing Street officials played down speculation that strikes were imminent. But they confirmed Mr John Major would discuss the option at a meeting with senior ministers this morning UK officials emphasised that Mr Major had yet to make any final decisions. The prime minister is said to be uncertain whether military action would require further deliberation at the UN Security Council or whether it would be authorised under existing resolutions. Legal experts are expected to clarify the position at today's meeting. But one senior official said that even if no further resolutions technically were required, Mr Major would prefer specific UN authorisation for air strikes. The officials added that the bombing of military installations and government buildings was only one of the options under consideration to force compliance with UN decisions. Mr Major is interrupting a holiday in Spain to attend today's meeting which will discuss Iraq as well as next week's international conference on Yugoslavia. The officials indicated that the brunt of any military action would be borne by the US. But UK aircraft could operate from several bases in the region. The RAF has a small number of Jaguar fighters stationed in Turkey to protect the safe havens for the Kurds in northern Iraq. Squadrons of Tornado ground attack aircraft regularly operate from Cyprus and others could be quickly deployed in Bahrain if the strikes went ahead. The Royal Navy's three-vessel Armilla Patrol is also in the region and the Type 42 destroyer HMS Edinburgh is currently involved in a training exercise with the Kuwaitis.</p>

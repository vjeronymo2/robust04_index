			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Conservative press issues warnings and retributions CONSERVATIVE-supporting newspapers today dispense warnings and retribution for what has been called the catastrophe at Newbury and the slaughter in the Tory shires. In the pages of his traditional supporters Mr John Major, prime Minister, fresh from his 'bloody nose' at the hands of the electorate, can read calls for urgent reshuffles and the head of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Some, however, are more strident than others. The Sun says: 'Those results reflect a national disillusionment with politics amounting almost to disgust. And the source of that dangerous disaffection lies with one man. The chancellor. Norman Lamont.' The Tory tabloid adds: 'The chancellor boasts that he regrets nothing and had even has the impertinence to suggest that the ERM wasn't such a bad thing after all. 'The man is so oily he could give lessons to Castrol.' Over at The Daily Telegraph the words are not quite so blunt but the message is not very different. Fiascoes such as the coal closures, the Matrix Churchill affair, school testing, leasehold reform and the Criminal Justice Act all added up to 'a grisly political indictment'. If Mr Major's administration, the Telegraph says, 'is to run its full term and win a further general election, it will have to do a great deal better than it has managed in the past 13 months, and somewhere find new frontbench faces that look a great deal more convincing than some of the present incumbents'. The Daily Express, which calls the results 'little short of a calamity for John Major and his government' does not call for anybody's head and says that senior Tories are already lining up to demand that of Norman Lamont and a much bigger reshuffle than originally planned. The Daily Mail says the real significance of the results is not merely that the government is disliked 'but, worse, that even traditional supporters have little confidence in it'. 'The time has come for boldness and firm leadership,' it says It adds, however, that the government's great fortune is that Labour and the Liberal Democrats 'lack the determination and vigour to form an electoral pact which really would be a formidable threat to Conservative rule'.</p>

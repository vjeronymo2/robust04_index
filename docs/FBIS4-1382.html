			<p>BFN     [Text] The cease-fire between RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front]  rebels and government forces that was supposed to come into  force on Monday [25 April] night, had already broken down  yesterday. Since the death of President Habyarimana on 6 April  and the ethnic atrocities in Kigali, the RPF has been closing in  on the capital. Abe Saleh asked our Kigali correspondent, Nestor  Serushago, about the state of fighting today:    [Begin recording] [Serushago] In the northern part of this  town, about five kilometers from the heart of the city, there is  a heavy fighting between Rwandese forces and the RPF. Battling,  each one wanting to get a hold of the top of those hills to the  north so that he can control the town. It is going on right now.    [Saleh] Is the fighting only in the north of Kigali?    [Serushago] It is where I can see it is concentrated but  also the eastern (?hills) and the south, there are sporadic  shootings but not as heavy as that in the north. [end recording]    Not much has been heard recently of the transitional  government who fled Kigali to Giterama, south of the city. But  now, the commerce minister, (Justin Mugenzi), has turned up in  our office in Nairobi. Robin White asked him if now that the  cease-fire had broken down, it meant they would be fighting to  the bitter end.    [Begin recording] [(Mugenzi)] I understand that RPF does not  want anything else than fighting, fighting, fighting. We are  trying our best to get whoever can have influence on Ugandan  Government because all lies with the Ugandan Government, so that  Museveni can bring this RPF to reasoning and asked them to stop  it.    [White] Are you claiming that he controls the RPF in some  way?    [(Mugenzi)] Well, not only controls but he orders the men,  we are convinced that without him, RPF will not behave this way.    [White] Are you losing the war at the moment?    [(Mugenzi)] No, we are not. We are not losing the war, we  are only losing people, because people are dying in big numbers,  and this is a pity. It is a pity so many people are dying  because of this war. And we want to bring an end to the war so  that people can stop dying.    [White] But doesn't it look as you might shortly lose total  control of Kigali?    [(Mugenzi)] No, I don't think so. According to the  information I have, we are in a good position to stand the  invasion.    [White] But how can you claim to be in any kind of control  when the government itself has abandoned the capital and gone to  Gitarama    [(Mugenzi)] No, we did not abandon it, we only did not want  to work under those shells and those bombs because you can  imagine the kind of noise you have there and you know that in  any war, a government is always the first target. So if you  want to keep some kind of administration and control and power  over the country, you must make sure that the government is  safe. [end recording]</p>

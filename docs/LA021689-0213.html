			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD;  </P> <P> STATEMENT WAS MADE BY CLERK, NOT JUDGE  </P> <P> A story Wednesday incorrectly quoted Presiding San Diego Superior Court Judge  Michael I. Greer as saying that the county in the past has been faced with  having too many criminal cases and not enough judges, and that the problem has  lasted for up to two weeks. The statement was actually made by County Clerk  Robert D. Zumwalt.  </P></p>

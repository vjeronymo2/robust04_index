			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Artur Morka: "Better `Bad Credits'"] </F>   [Text] According to research results coming from the  Institute of Market Economy Research, so-called bad credits  (ones that have not been repaid by customers) constitute a  decreasingly significant problem for the seven biggest  commercial banks.    By the end of this year, bad credits will constitute about  23  percent of the entire credit portfolio of commercial banks. In  1996, the number of bad credits should go down to 7-8 percent,  which corresponds with norms usually adopted by banks in highly  developed countries.    Bad credits began to be a problem after 1989; that is when  economic conditions changed. Many enterprises could not repay  credits they had borrowed earlier because they had problems in  selling their products. But until they have repaid old credits,  they could not have borrowed new ones (which they needed to  modernize the production process.)    Bad credits began to also haunt the banks themselves. Even  though interest rates were rising on paper, bankers were  perfectly aware that once a debtor goes bankrupt, the chances to  recover the money will be very slim indeed. The only solution  was to write off part of the old debts for those enterprises  that have good future prospects.    In March 1993, a law on restructuring banks and enterprises  became effective. The banks researched by the institute were  provided special bonds, in return for which they had to  restructure their credit portfolios within a year.    The Institute of Market Economy Research examined the credit  situation at seven banks separated out of the National Bank of  Poland: Bank Gdanski, Bank Zachodni, Powszechny Bank Kredytowy,  Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy, Pomorski Bank Kredytowy, Bank  Depozytowo-Kredytowy, and Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy.    The conclusion is that banking reconciliation proceedings  [postepowanie ugodowe] was the most frequently applied method of  restructuring debts--it was applied in four-fifths of the cases.  The banks tried to recover about 15 percent of the debts by  using judicial conciliation proceedings, while, in the remaining  cases, Civil Code agreements were used.  <H5>  Conciliation Most Frequent </H5>   According to Finance Ministry data, enterprises had  initiated  over 190 banking conciliation proceedings by 31 March, out of  which 120 were completed. As much as 60 percent of the  proceedings were entered into by the banks researched by the  institute. The value of these conciliation agreements is  estimated at about 8 trillion zlotys [Z].    Banking conciliation proceedings covered primarily large  enterprises that employed on average over 1,300 employees. The  majority of the enterprises (72 percent) are state-owned or  Treasury-owned joint-stock companies.    The largest number of conciliation proceedings were  initiated  in the light and the electromachine industries, primarily in the  Jelenia Gora, Opole, Lodz, Wroclaw, and Walbrzych Voivodships.  As one can see, a majority of these voivodships are regions  facing the danger of structural unemployment in which the  industry's situation is very difficult.    In 30 percent of the banking conciliation agreements, the  principle of substituting financial claims with shares in the  enterprises was applied. This means that banks will have a  better way of controlling the remedying process [proces  naprawczy].  <H5>  Bankruptcy or Sale </H5>   In the case of 162 enterprises that have incurred debts with  the banks researched by the institute, courts declared  bankruptcies of the enterprises on motions by the banks. This  is the way the banks dealt with debtors who were without  prospects for repaying the loans. In most cases, these were  state-owned enterprises of the light or electromachine  industries. No bankruptcy was declared with regard to  enterprises of the fuel/energy or metallurgic industries.    Selling the financial claims [wierzytelnosci] of banks was  another method of getting rid of the claims by the banks. The  banks decided to put financial claims of 378 economic units up  for sale; the total of the debts of these units amounted to  about Z2.4 trillion. The prices ranged from 8 to 50 percent of  the total value of a financial claim. Claims with regard to  enterprises of the electromachine industry were the easiest to  sell.</p>

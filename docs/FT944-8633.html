			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Auction prices fluctuated only narrowly this week, with the Australian tendency slightly firmer, taking the market indicator 5c higher to 795c/kg. New Zealand and this week's Bradford sale of Scottish wool showed mixed changes, with some British carpet categories definitely dearer but the market in general no more than firm, The main factor affecting prices was currency, with the US dollar rising after the interest rate rise. Close connection with the currencies of the main wool producing countries means that major international wool users are paying more. The added price increases related to currency is not helping the flow of trade. Longer term wool supply and demand calculations continue to stress the likelihood of shortages in the earlier months of 1995, and maintain a firm view of the price outlook.</p>

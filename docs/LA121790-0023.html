			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BELFOUR MAKES HIMSELF AND BLACKHAWKS NO. 1  </P> <P> Ed Belfour is proof that training camp can be important.  </P> <P> When the Chicago Blackhawks began preseason preparations, the former North  Dakota University goaltender was No. 7 on the list of goalies. By the time the  season began, Belfour had moved to No. 1 for the defending Norris Division  champions.  </P> <P> The weak spot of the Blackhawks last season was their defense. Largely because  of Belfour, it has become the strongest.  </P> <P> Belfour turned aside 32 shots Sunday at Chicago in the Blackhawks' 5-2 victory  over the Minnesota North Stars to become the first goalie to win 21 games in  the NHL this season.  </P> <P> Jeremy Roenick provided the offense, getting a hat trick. Two of the goals came  when the Blackhawks scored three power-play goals in 4:29 of the second period.  </P> <P> Coach Mike Keenan credits Belfour for the Blackhawks having the best record in  the NHL -- 23-11-2.  </P> <P> "This team has united behind Belfour," he said. "And the crowd responds for him  at home."  </P> <P> Belfour, 25, played in only 33 NHL games previously, nine of them last spring  in the playoffs. There was no indication he would become the inspirational  leader.  </P> <P> "I have 21 victories," Belfour said, "but it's mainly because the players in  front of me have had a tremendous season. I'm lucky to have them."  </P> <P> Roenick, a second-year center from Boston, scored into an empty net for his  third hat trick and 17th goal.  </P> <P> Calgary 5, Vancouver 2 -- The Flames' special teams these days are just that --  special.  </P> <P> Joe Nieuwendyk and Al MacInnis scored power-play goals less than a minute apart  in the first period at Vancouver and the Flames extended their unbeaten string  to 6-0-3.  </P> <P> The Flames, who lead the league with 43 power-play goals, stretched their lead  over the Kings in the Smythe Division to five points.  </P> <P> MacInnis, a defenseman, scored on another power play in the last period and has  10 this season.  </P> <P> The Flames, among the leaders in penalty killing, also scored a short-handed  goal.  </P> <P> St. Louis 5, Buffalo 3 -- Brett Hull scored twice at Buffalo and the Blues kept  pace with Chicago.  </P> <P> The Blues, tied with Calgary for the second-best record, trail the Blackhawks  by four points.  </P> <P> Hull's league-leading 33rd goal broke a 3-3 tie in the second minute of the  third period. Hull is averaging a goal per game.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, Detroit 1 -- Former King defenseman Larry Murphy, recently traded  again, scored his first goal for the Penguins in this game at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Tom Barrasso, getting only his third start in the last 12 games, stopped 40  shots as the Penguins won their third in a row.  </P> <P> Joe Mullen, Bryan Trottier and Paul Coffey scored within seven minutes in the  second period.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Rick Tocchet scored what proved to be the  game-winner in the second period at Winnipeg.  </P> <P> The Flyers outshot the Red Wings, 39-21.

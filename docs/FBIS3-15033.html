In an interview with the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper,  Stasiukynas said the Lithuanian refinery gets many suggestions  to buy Russian oil but does not have enough money. The minister  said Mazeikiai will nevertheless purchase some oil from  companies which can wait for payment.    Stasiukynas commented on the suspension of an oil export  license issued to Lucoil. A decision to suspend the license was  made by the Russian International Economic Relations Ministry  Feb. 16 "to clear up the circumstances of oil trade." Lucoil is  blamed for cooperation with the Baltic states, LIETUVOS RYTAS  said with reference to a high-ranking Russian energy official.    Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas was unable to  comment on the fact during a press conference Monday [28  February]. Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said he does not  have any information about the temporary ban.    Dzhevan Chalakhayants, Lucoil vice president, told the  newspaper that "there were problems related to oil supplies to  Mazeikiai," but, in his words, the company will be allowed to  export oil again in March. Commenting on cooperation with the  Lithuanian refinery, he said Lucoil never promised to supply oil  to Lithuania but only refines it in Mazeikiai.    Bronislovas Vainora, Mazeikiai director general, said the  ban  will not affect the refinery because the oil supplied by Lucoil  is not regarded as export. He said Mazeikiai only refines oil  and gets 20 percent of the ready production for work.    Vainora noted that the refinery did not violate any  agreements with Lucoil. In his view, Russian officials simply  decided to check whether cooperation between Lucoil and  Lithuania is efficient and whether production returns to Russia.  This is not the first time that Lucoil's rivals initiate such a  check-up, Vainora said.    According to a contract between Mazeikiai and Lucoil, the  Russian company will refine 6 million tons of oil in Lithuania  by 1997.    Mazeikiai refined 3 million tons of oil last year and will  presumably refine as much as 6 million tons from different  sources this year.</p>

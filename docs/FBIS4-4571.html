			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Part one in the series "Active Fault in Nagata-cho": </F> "`Ozawa Operation' Under Way With the Transportation Ministry  Being Used as a Base; Ranking Official Sent to Detroit To Ward  Off Pressure of U.S. Industry"]    [Text] A little over seven months have passed since the  government changed hands. The long reign of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] has come to an end, and the political  regime of 1955 which made such reign a possible has collapsed,  but battles are now being fought on the political front lines  between a new group of parties that want to establish a new  order and the LDP, which wants to return to power. The future  of the political realignment is still not clear. We will  examine various phases of the ongoing war in the political world.    To find a breakthrough in the automobile issue, which  symbolizes Japan-U.S. economic frictions, Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa and other people  are now conducting a top-secret operation. This is an operation  targeting Detroit, the center of the U.S. auto industry.    On 8 March, Councilor Hideaki Mukaiyama, the Ministry of  Transportation's [MOT] second-highest-ranking administrative  official, was sent to Detroit for active talks with five senior  executives of the "Big Three" such as Ford Motors Vice President  Booker.    Six days later, on 14 March, Ozawa, who had not been seen at  public appearances since the beginning of the month and who had  been absent from ruling party representatives meetings and  regular news conferences, was at a Tokyo office--which he uses  for secret meetings--with Toshihiro Nikai, parliamentary vice  minister of transportation, where they were together waiting for  Mukaiyama, who had returned home the day before.    Mukaiyama reported on the results of the meeting with the  Ford vice president and other executives, and said, "They wanted  to obtain technical advice on how they can export without  hitches more automobiles to Japan."    The MOT had already decided to remove barriers on U.S.-made  vehicles by carrying out vehicle inspections on them in the  United States and by treating them as Japanese-made vehicles are  treated--in response to the U.S. charge that Japan's vehicle  inspection system is working as a barrier to exports to Japan.  The ministry plans to permanently station inspectors at the  Japanese Consulate General in Detroit beginning in April.    In other words, with this due to happen soon, Councilor  Mukaiyama was sent to Detroit to explain in detail to U.S.  automakers Japan's efforts--in hopes of stemming that industry's  pressure on Japan. Sending him was part of the operation.  Ozawa, who came up with the idea, appeared to have been content  with the results.    Meanwhile, the "operation" proceeded in Japan as well. The  MOT sent an unusual order to the Chrysler Japan Sales Company on  10 March, saying, "We need five Cherokees to be assigned to  national offices." A senior ministry official said, "We  eventually want to buy 100 of them altogether with the help of  concerned organizations such as the Airport Corporation." For  Ozawa, the purchase of U.S.-made Jeeps for a total of 300  million yen is part of the operation to "root out the trouble by  spraying insecticide on the roots." Ozawa's strategy is based on  the thinking that the only effective way of dampening the  pressure from Washington is to shut the mouths of persons from  U.S. industry.    Last July, having played a major role in changing the  possession of the government, Shinseito not only filled major  cabinet posts but also sent its confidants to key parliamentary  vice ministerial posts. And, under Vice Minister Nikai, who  twice came to serve as parliamentary vice minister--something  which does not often happen--the MOT continued changing into  Ozawa's "base in Kasumigaseki."    Around the end of 1992, there was the strife within the LDP  Takeshita faction consisting of the "pro-Ozawa group versus the  anti-Ozawa group" that started with former LDP Vice President  Shin Kanemaru resigning over the scandal of taking 500 million  yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Company. This strife culminated in  the creation of the Hata faction.    It was 27 December, the day before the Hata faction was to  be  launched at an inaugural meeting. In the office of the  Transportation Policy Bureau director on the eighth floor of the  MOT in Kasumigaseki, Tokyo, were gathered such high-ranking  officials as Administrative Vice Minister Michihiko Matsuo, and  Kuniji Toda, director of the Marine Technology and Safety  Bureau. The excuse for the gathering was to commemorate the  ending of the extraordinary Diet session that closed on that day.    The meeting started with the arrival of Nikai, former MOT  parliamentary vice minister. Director-rank officials exchanged  pleasantries and cracked jokes for about half an hour. Then  House of Councilors member Nobuya Izumi, an old MOT man (former  councilor of the ministry's Ports and Harbors Bureau), appeared  and bowed to his former superiors, who were sitting around  Nikai, and said, "Please continue your favors to me." Voices  shouting "cheers" went up around Izumi. It was at this moment  that the MOT witnessed Izumi joining the Hata faction.    Izumi's joining the Hata faction while the strife was under  way between the pro-Ozawa group and the anti-Ozawa group--which  sent ripples even to Kasumigaseki--meant that the MOT clearly  supported the Hata faction. A senior official of a different  government office recalled, "The MOT was impressed by the  political capabilities of Diet members Keiwa Okuda and Nikai,  who took the initiative in resolving the controversial Narita  Airport issue. The ministry wanted to strengthen its position  by deciding to ride along with Ozawa, whom these two people  supported."    The MOT has under its control a broad industry which covers  transportation services using automobiles, aircraft, and  railways; warehousing services, shipbuilding, stevedoring,  reclamation and dredging operations, and tourism. Winning the  ministry over to its side meant having control over an  organization with big pipelines to political funds, as well as  the power to collect votes. In fact, political donations to the  LDP amounted to more than 600 million yen a year, including  about 360 million from 16 major private railway systems -- to  mention only the portion of funds raised from the transportation  industry (based on the 1992 political fund revenue and  expenditure report).    At the end of the three-month-long strife, of a total of 15  Takeshita faction members elected from the upper house  proportional representation system who were backed by government  ministries and agencies, only three, including two former  Defense Agency officials, turned out to be supporters of Ozawa.  It was a bitter defeat for Ozawa. This may be all the more  reason for a senior Shinseito member's now insisting proudly,  "there is no question that the MOT supports Shinseito."    Ozawa previously had nothing to do with transportation zoku  [Diet members lobbying for the interests of the transportation  industry and transportation-related government offices]. There  is no doubt that in the background of Ozawa's having decided to  use the MOT as an advance unit of the attack forces in  operations concerning the important issue of Japan-U.S.  relations there lay this link between Shinseito, the MOT, and  the transportation industry from the days of his group's  splitting off [from the LDP Takeshita faction].    There are many industrial organizations which support the  old  LDP, which built up the politicians-bureaucrats-businessmen  triangle by mobilizing its "zoku Diet members." Meanwhile,  extremely bitter battles are being fought between Shinseito and  the LDP. There is the concern: Is Shinseito merely a party  which dresses differently [from the LDP] but which continues  "zoku governance"? From the "offensive against Detroit"  operation, one can see clearly the depths of Japanese politics,  which appear unable to be rid of the triangular political system  easily.    The MOT was ruled by the LDP's unyuzoku [Diet members  concerned with transportation] before. They had great authority  over transportation, including busses and trucks.  Traditionally, the LDP's Mitsuzuka faction was the most  powerful. Former transportation ministers--including Hiroshi  Mitsuzuka, chairman of the Mitsuzuka faction and former chairman  of the LDP Policy Research Council; Masajuro Shiokawa, and Akira  Ono--and Mutsuki Kato, former chairman of the LDP Policy  Research Council (who is a member of the Renewal and Reform  League) and who controlled the transportation industries, were  representative members of the Mitsuzuka faction.    On the other hand, the Takeshita faction--which was at the  top of the system, in which zoku Diet members ran government  ministries and agencies--sought to have many upper house Diet  members, who represented each industrial sector, become members  of it. The faction did this by placing economic ministries and  agencies--including the Ministry of Construction, the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry, and the Agricultural, Forestry, and  Fisheries Ministry--under its control. The Takeshita faction  had 109 members immediately after the lower house elections held  in July 1992. Of the 109, however, 41 were upper house members.  It was a faction which attached too much importance to the  upper house.    The Takeshita faction sent Kenzo Muraoka, senior member of  the faction, to the post of transportation minister during the  Kaifu administration. Keiwa Okuda, one of the "seven important  members" of the faction, became transportation minister during  the Miyazawa administration.    Shinya Izumi, who won a 1992 election for a  proportional-representation seat by obtaining the support of the  MOT, decided to run in the election while Okuda was secretary  general of the Takeshita office. He has been strengthening  steadily his control over the MOT.    Following a split in the Takeshita faction, however, there  was a fierce power struggle between Okuda, who supported Ichiro  Ozawa, and Okamura and former Transportation Minister Ryutaro  Hashimoto, who were anti-Ozawa. Izumi belonged to the Ozawa  group. The LDP Policy Research Council underwent a personnel  reshuffle after the split of the Takeshita faction, and  Toshihiro Nikai, who supported Ozawa, became chairman of the  council's transportation department. This created the  impression that Ozawa supporters, who are also members of  Shinseito, took over the main posts of the MOT.    Various changes are taking place among zoku Diet members  following the change of political power. While Shinseito and  the LDP are having a fierce battle over the control of the  different industries, the zoku Diet members are actively  following the new [transportation] sectors.    According to a rough calculation by the Ministry of Posts  and  Telecommunications, a new 123 trillion yen multimedia market  will be created by 2010. The ruling and opposition parties are  very much interested in the information and communications  sector. In October, Shinseito formed a Diet members league  (chaired by Kozo Watanabe) for the promotion of information and  communications industries. This league has the same name as  does the LDP's counterpart. Moreover, the ruling coalition  parties, including Shinseito, established a Diet members group  for information and communications (representative caretaker:  Mamoru Nakajima) on 23 March, as if this were not only  coincident with the establishment of NTT's multimedia promotion  team, which was formed in February. This coalition group is  composed mainly of Social Democratic Party of Japan lawmakers  who were former members of the Zendentsu, a labor union of NTT.  Each coalition party was asked to send a few representatives to  the group. This request was well received, and Sakigake  [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party [JNP] together sent 25  representatives. One of the group's members said: "It is a  cheerleading squad for NTT. The multimedia is not only a field  with a bright future, but the votes of Zendentsu members are  attractive to us."    As for education, some senior members of the National  Federation of Private College Associations (representative:  Shigeyoshi Tachibanadaka, Science University of Tokyo director)  -- which was shaken by a rumor that the budget for subsidies to  private colleges will be cut next fiscal year -- were confused  by a report that "Shinseito is saying that `no help will be  given at the time of budget allocations if the federation makes  a plea to the LDP.'" The federation just could not betray the  LDP. After all, representatives of the federation visited both  the LDP and Shinseito to ask for help. A senior federation  official said: "The LDP helped us a lot in the past. However,  we did not want to upset the current ruling parties, either. It  was difficult for us to do anything."    Shinseito has already formed sectoral meeting groups, which  are similar to those of the LDP, and it is trying to make these  look like those of the LDP. As for the Diet members league, the  party's is increasingly trying to rival that of the LDP. As for  schools, Shinseito formed several Diet members leagues --  including a Diet members league for the promotion of private  kindergartens (chairman: Tatsuo Ozawa) and a Diet members league  for the promotion of vocational and other schools (chairman:  Hajime Funada) -- from late last year to this January.    Moreover, the same party also formed in February a "Diet  members league for the promotion of affluent car companies"  (chaired by Keiwa Okuda), and a comprehensive league designed to  cover four automobile-related industrial sectors, including  busses and taxis. This is an enlarged version of the LDP's Diet  members league for car repair services.</p>

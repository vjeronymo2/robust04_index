			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALLERGAN LOWERS ITS EARLIER SALES PROJECTION FOR '89  </P> <P> Citing pressure from competing manufacturers and delay in the release of a new  product, Allergan Inc. said Wednesday that it is lowering its previously  announced sales expectations for 1989.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, the Irvine-based maker of eye-care products said that  sales were lower than anticipated in its Allergan Optical division due to  competition and a decline in the market for new contact lenses.  </P> <P> In addition, the company said, shipment of a new ophthalmic instrument  manufactured by its Allergan Humphrey unit has been delayed, based on results  of recent clinical evaluations and the emergence of new technology.  </P></p>

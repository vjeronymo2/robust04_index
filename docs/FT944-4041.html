			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Italy faces EU telecoms investigation The European Commission believes the last Italian government may have discriminated in favour of the state-owned telecommunications company by making competitors pay for the right to operate the country's second digital mobile telephone network. Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, said yesterday that Brussels was planning to extend its investigation into the liberalisation of Italian mobile telecommunications to cover the award of the mobile phone contract in March. A Commission spokesman said yesterday that Mr Van Miert was concerned that Sip, the state telecoms operator which is now part of Telecom Italia, paid nothing for the right to build the country's first, small, digital network. The international consortium Omnitel-Pronto Italia, which is headed by Olivetti, the Italian computer company, paid L750bn (Pounds 296m) for the second digital licence. Yesterday's comments by Mr Van Miert indicate that Brussels is likely to take a hard line if the government grants any further concessions to Telecom Italia. Telecom Italia wants the government to relax regulation of the existing national analogue network, over which it has a monopoly. The company wants the freedom to set prices on the analogue network, allowing it to compete directly with Omnitel on all mobile phone services. Telecom Italia is also seeking a reduction in the annual fee it pays the government. The ministers concerned are to debate Telecom Italia's demands on Thursday. The analogue service is only available to subscribers in Italy, whereas subscribers to the digital network can use their mobile phones in many other European countries which have adopted the 'GSM' standard. Yesterday, the company broke its silence on the issue, warning that if the government maintained the current tariff system, the long-term investment Telecom Italia had made in the analogue network would be jeopardised. The company also implied that such a decision would have repercussions on the forthcoming privatisation of its state-controlled parent company, Stet. Yesterday's statement by the Telecom Italia board was a direct reaction to a letter to ministers this week from Mr Giuliano Amato, former Italian prime minister and now head of the country's antitrust authority, warning that he might have to intervene if Telecom Italia won concessions on tariffs. The political sensitivity of the issue is heightened by the fact that in winning the licence Omnitel outbid a consortium which included Fiat and Fininvest, the media business owned by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who is now Italy's prime minister. He has deliberately taken no part in the cabinet discussions on the terms of the licence.</p>

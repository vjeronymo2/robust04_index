			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government, judging that the North Korean nuclear dispute has  entered a new phase with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's  visit to Pyongyang serving as a turning point, has decided to  concentrate on a peaceful solution to the issue through dialogue  such as a high-level meeting between Washington and Pyongyang.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, in close contact with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, is closely monitoring  Carter's second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il-song  Friday.    The government will announce its position on North Korea's  new sign of reconciliation after President Kim Yong-sam meets  with Carter over the weekend to discuss the results of his  Pyongyang visit.    But the government will continue to push for a U.N. Security  Council resolution on sanctions against North Korea if there is  no positive change in its nuclear policy.    The decisions came at a Unification and Security Policy  Coordination Committee meeting presided over by Unification  Minister Yi Hong-ku Friday to discuss the overture made by North  Korea at Carter's first meeting with Kim Il-song Thursday.    In case the high-level U.S.-North Korea talks resume, the  government will push to secure the transparency of the North's  past nuclear development activities.    Carter reportedly said the Washington-Pyongyang talks may  resume if North Korea freezes its nuclear program.    Preparing for the possibility that North Korea's peace  offensive is designed to avoid international sanctions through  delaying tactics, the government will continue seeking the  cooperation of China, Russia and other countries to gain U.N.  Security Council passage of a sanctions resolution on North  Korea.    Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyong-ki said the  government will reveal its position on developments during  Carter's visit to Pyongyang after President Kim is briefed by  the former U.S. leader Saturday.    The government will concentrate on finding a peaceful  solution to the nuclear issue through dialogue, he added.    Foreign Minister Han talked over the phone with Secretary  Christopher Thursday evening and Friday morning to discuss what  Kim Il-song told Carter during their meeting Thursday.    "Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci issued a  statement this morning as a result of Han's telephone  conversation with Christopher," the spokesman said.</p>

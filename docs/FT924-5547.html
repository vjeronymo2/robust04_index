			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Patten defends school 'leagues' THE WAR of words over the government's league tables of school performance intensified yesterday, with Labour dubbing them a 'comedy of errors'. But Mr John Patten, the education secretary, admitted only a handful of mistakes and pledged to publish more comparative information on schools over the next year. Appearing before the Commons education committee, Mr Patten made no apology for publishing last week's league tables. He said that of 83 complaints investigated, only five were errors made by the Department for Education or the data collection firms employed by it. Most of the rest, he claimed, were the result of inaccurate or invalid information provided by the schools themselves. Mr Patten told MPs the government would shortly publish comparative local education authority (LEA) statistics on performance in this year's standard assessment tasks for seven-year-olds in England. For the first time, the statistics will include figures for the expenditure per primary-age pupil in each LEA. The spending figures were needed 'so that judgments can be made about value for money at local level', Mr Patten said. 'More and better information for parents is the key to the achievement of higher standards in our schools. Under the Parent's Charter, the information about schools' performance made available to parents in comparative tables will build up systematically over the remainder of the decade.' Labour published a catalogue of errors, detailing claims of several hundred mistakes or omissions in the tables. However, Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, appeared to commit the party to publishing 'raw' exam results, which is opposed by the teachers' unions and many Labour LEAs. Mrs Taylor said: 'Labour has always been in favour of the publication of information for parents. 'Our proposed home/school contract would make clear the nature of schools' records, both for all pupils in general and for each specific pupil through their individual record of achievement.' She called for results to be published by LEAs, not the government. 'The fiasco of the last few days proves that national collection of results is not the best way to provide information.' Mr Patten said he was considering vocational qualifications for next year's secondary school tables. All independent schools will also be obliged to include their results. The Education Department said it would soon publish an analysis of the results of this year's tests of 14-year-olds in maths and science.</p>

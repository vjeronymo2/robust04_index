Lacson] </F>   [Text] Jolo, Sulu -- The joint national government-Moro  National Liberation Front (MNLF) cease fire committee decided  that MNLF gives security to the government panel during the  peace talks in Timbangan, Indanan, Sulu.    MNLF chairman Nur Misuari had earlier requested the town of  Indanan be made the next venue of the talks by the mixed  committees. The MNLF controls the town of Indanan. There are  no military men seen in the town.    Brig. Gen. Guillermo Ruiz, chairman of the joint national  government-MNLF cease fire committee, said that the government  will allow only 15 security escorts for the government panel for  the duration of the talks. He said that the rest of the  military forces in Mindanao will be alerted on stand-by basis.    Ruiz also said that the MNLF has agreed to keep its forces  at  least one kilometer away from the conference site. However, he  said, the MNLF will allow the members to get closer to the  conference site on condition that they do not carry firearms.    Meanwhile, the joint cease fire committee had also agreed in  principle to hold its next meeting in Zamboanga City on 5  January next year.    The meeting will finalize the ground rules and guidelines  for  the immediate implementation of the cease fire agreement in  Mindanao.    The committee will establish a cease fire monitoring station  in Zamboanga City after both parties agree on the ground rules  for the cease fire.    A similar monitoring station will be established in 13  provinces in Mindanao.</p>

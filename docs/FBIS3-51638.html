The recommendations of the seven workshops at the Congress for  National Salvation provide for the immediate formation of a  government of public security, setting aside the 1987  Constitution, dissolving the parliament, and enforcing the 1950  Constitution. On this second working day, Jean Luckenson met  with Herve Leveille. Let us listen to his report:    [Luckenson] We met with druggist Herve Leveille,  secretary general of the national congress, for explanation.  Leveille said that they have held this congress in order to find  a final solution to the crisis that the country has been  experiencing for over two years. The participants in the  national congress have come from the nine geographic departments  of the country and will have to form a government of public  security that can work with the international community in  finding a real solution to the sociopolitical crisis being  experienced by the country.    [Leveille] In the face of the imminent peril to the country,  in the face of the danger that the country might disappear,  we need the formation of a government of public  security.    [Luckenson] If I understand rightly, you have held this  national congress in order to form a government of public  security.    [Leveille] Yes, but it will be a beginning, it will be a  beginning because I must also give you additional  explanation. This congress is held by persons who.... It is  mostly groups of citizens who met in the nine departments and  sent delegations. As delegations from the civil society, they  will meet to see whether they can form a government that can  confer with the international community, can start a dialogue  with the international community so we can resolve the  crisis.    [Luckenson] Leveille went on to say that no  institutions -- whether the Army or in the democratic sector --  have representatives at the congress and that those who are  present have participated as simple citizens of the country. But  what can we expect from this national congress? Let us listen to  Leveille.    [Leveille] The only thing I would like this congress to  accomplish is that everybody become aware of the fact that all  of us are wrong, that all of us have put the country in this  situation, and that all of us should try to see what we can do  by putting our personal interests aside for a while.    [Luckenson] We saw in the room citizens from various  departments. We also saw political personalities such as Dr.  Montalvo Despeignes [former minister without portfolio under the  Nerette-Honorat government]; the Rev. Richard Vladimir Jeanty,  leader of the Haitian Party of God; Vanes Cherestal, national  coordinator of the National Confederation of the People's  Organizations of the Country; and General Philippe Biamby.</p>

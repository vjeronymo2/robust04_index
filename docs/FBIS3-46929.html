			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 24 December, the Broadcast Satellite System  Corporation [BSSC] (based in Shibuya, Tokyo, with Toshio Kataoka  as president), announced that it awarded a contract to U.S.  Hughes Corporation to build the BS-4, Japan's next-in-line  broadcast satellite. The BSSC, which has been set up for the  purchase of broadcast satellites, is funded by the Japan  Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) and other investors. Originally,  the cost of one such satellite was thought to be around 10  billion yen. Although the contracted purchase price was not  disclosed, it is believed to be considerably below this figure.  This is the first time the Hughes Corporation has won a  contract for building a Japanese broadcast satellite. A  consortium consisting of the U.S. Martin Marietta Corporation,  Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and NEC Corporation was  initially considered the likely winner of the procurement bid,  but wound up losing.    In addition to the Hughes Corporation and the Martin  Marietta  consortium, the U.S. Space Systems Loral (SSL) Corporation was  another participant in the bid for procurement of the BS-4.  Japanese firms had given up on entering the bid as main  contractors due to such problems as cost and the length of lead  time for delivery. Among major Japanese satellite makers,  however, Mitsubishi and NEC entered the bid in a consortium with  Martin Marietta, and the Toshiba Corporation similarly entered  the bid in a consortium with the SSL. Since the Hughes  Corporation entered the bid alone, Japanese firms have been  completely cut off from the project to build the BS-4.    The new broadcast satellite will replace the BS-3, which is  currently utilized by NHK and the Japan Satellite Broadcasting  Incorporated (operator of the WOWOW channel). It is the third  satellite the procurement of which became subject to  international tender since Japan and the United States concluded  an agreement in 1990 to open the satellite market. The main  satellite and a backup spare unit are scheduled to be launched  in the summer of 1997 and the summer of 1998, respectively.  They are said to be designed with an expected lifespan of over  10 years.    Originally, the general consensus was that the  Martin-Mitsubishi-NEC consortium would be the likely winner of  the procurement contract for the BS-4, since Martin Marietta has  taken over the aerospace department of the General Electric  Company (GE), which has so far monopolized the Japanese  broadcast satellite market. Concerning reasons for Hughes  Corporation's advance into the Japanese market, a majority of  sources concerned believe "the fact that Hughes was able to  offer a much better price than Martin Marietta was the decisive  factor in the former's emerging victorious in the bid."</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Call for new EU 'contract' France's minister for European affairs, Mr Alain Lamassoure, yesterday floated the idea that a hard core of European Union states should commit themselves in 1996 as 'new founders' of the Union to carry out all its policies - in order to stop a growing tendency of countries to apply only those policies that suit them. In an article published in yesterday's Le Monde newpaper, Mr Lamassoure argued that 1996, the year earmarked for a revision of the Maastricht Treaty, should mark the creation of a 'new founding contract'. 'A group of countries determined to set the example should announce its intention of applying at the outset all the (measures) provided for by the treaties - these are the 'new founders',' Mr Lamassoure said. Speaking later at the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse, Mr Lamassoure, explained that the EU was faced with the 'double urgency' of enlarging towards the east and retaining some efficiency in its decision-making. 'Neither goal can be sacrificed to the other' he said, 'and that is why I have come up with this concept.' Essentially, it would involve deciding that the planned 1996 constitutional revision of the Maastricht treaty would be 'if not the final one, then at least the last one for some 20 years,' the minister said. This would give countries like Britain 'the pause in European integration they say they need,' he said. Mr Lamassoure said France and Germany would both need to be among the 'new founders' in 1996. Mr Lamassoure has cited a single currency and joint policies on foreign policy, defence, border controls and crime as the aims of a 'hard core' of states.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel This Friday the sun will shine, the bands will play and the Queen and President Mitterrand will open the Channel tunnel. Eurotunnel's shareholders will be mightily relieved, although they will soon be tapped for yet more funds to stave off bankruptcy. The jaundiced would say that proves it never pays to use equity finance to fund massive infrastructure projects. Most UK institutional investors baled out long ago. But investors will increasingly have to bend their minds to the discounted cash flow investment models employed by Eurotunnel. Debt-laden governments around the world are considering how to entice private sector finance into infrastructure projects. Corporate financiers are already chattering about the second wave of privatisation as public projects are transferred to the private sector. In the UK, the private finance working party, chaired by Sir Alastair Morton, should play an important role in leading the debate. The fundamental challenge is to change the Treasury's culture to permit a more attractive balance of risk and reward for commercial investors. The government may have an important part to play in minimising risks and injecting seed corn funds before a project blossoms. Then such projects could develop into ideal investments for fund managers providing a buy-and-forget utility-style asset. It may not be long before they are comparing the investment merits of Thai roads with an investment trust launched to build hospitals in Staffordshire.</p>

But he keeps quiet about it, and is little known  outside of Westminster. Not for him bursts of oratory in the  Commons chamber, regular television soundbites or loud threats  delivered outside Downing Street. His preference is for a much  more effective course -- the short walk down a corridor in the  Houses of Parliament for a private word in the Prime Minister's  room. He is James Molyneux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, a  shrewd wheeler-dealer, the ultimate Commons fixer.    He holds the balance of power in the present Parliament,  just  as he did in Callaghan's Labour government between 1974 and  1979. The nine Ulster Unionist votes have saved John Major's  Government since the general election in 1992 and will do so  again. Everyone at Westminster believes Major and Molyneux have  a secret deal, as journalists like to describe it, or an  understanding, as MPs prefer to put it: the result is the same  however it is described, the survival of the Major Government.    Given the immense power he holds, Molyneux's behaviour over  the last few months has been puzzling. Why has this man,  steeped in the Unionist tradition, the leading voice of Ulster  Protestantism, been so relaxed about the Downing Street  Declaration? Surely, an agreement between London and Dublin  talking about self-determination for the whole island of Ireland  would have sent a shiver through the man who holds a senior  position in the Orange Order, Sovereign Grand Master of its  Royal Black Preceptor?    Yet on the December day that the declaration was announced  Molyneux had little to say, in contrast to the Rev lan Paisley,  leader of the smaller, hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, who  denounced it as a sell-out to "buy off the fiendish Republican  scum."    One piece of speculation was that Molyneux, aged 73 and  possibly coming close to retirement, wanted a legacy, a peace  settlement for Northern Ireland, to go down in history as the  man able to rise above his own particular brand of politics, an  Ulster Gorbachev. As a piece of speculation, it is complete  nonsense.    In a lengthy interview with THE SCOTSMAN, Molyneux explained  in detail for the first time why he was so relaxed about the  Downing Street Declaration. The reason was not that he had  mellowed but that he had successfully fought the Unionist  corner. He told how in behind-the-scenes meetings with the  Prime Minister, an original 30-paragraph Irish document was  slashed down to the 12 paragraphs that eventually appeared. He  neutralised it, removing anything of any substance, any  mechanisms that would have required action or set up joint  British-Irish structures. The final declaration was "a muddled,  tortuous one," and "while one didn't like the wording, it didn't  pose any threat to the Union."    The naive optimism that greeted the Downing Street  Declaration, a hope that it would bring an end to the killing  fields, has long since dissipated. Molyneux's explanation of  how he neutered the document explains why. He does not believe  the Irish Republican Army will accept the document.    "I never did think they would do it. They might have been a  bit more sympathetic if the British Government had agreed to the  30 paragraphs.... Once it was denuded of the mechanisms, it was  no good for them," he said.    Critics of Molyneux, while acknowledging his shrewdness and  political skill, say his biggest failure is his inability to  take the wider view of Irish politics. A member of the Social  Democratic and Labour Party, Northern Ireland's democratic  nationalists, complained: "We are interested in the  relationship between Northern Ireland and Dublin. He is only  interested in who rules in Northern Ireland."    The other complaint is that he is too fond of Westminster.  "He is very proud of being Right Honourable and will get a  peerage in due course," said one source close to Northern  Ireland politics.    This is true. But there is more to Molyneux's interest in  the Commons than just prestige: Molyneux has used it as a  powerbase, not only to consolidate Unionist power but to  strengthen it.    He has only once made a mistake, when he misread Thatcher.  He did not believe she would sign the British-lrish agreement  of 1985; but she did. He has not made any mistakes since, at  least from a Unionist point of view.    Molyneux's public visage is usually blank or mournful  looking, typically Presbyterian, though in private he is  cheerful and is often described as clubbable, the Westminster  phraseology for being easy-going. To Molyneux, having a blank  face is a compliment. He tells of how a party colleague, John  Taylor, turned to him after they had won a key vote, with order  papers being waved all around them: "The trouble with you is  that we can never tell whether you are glad or sad about  anything."    Molyneux said that on that occasion, as on others, he was  thinking ahead, his mind already moving on to battles that lay  ahead: not for him exuberant displays or histrionics on the  night of a famous victory. Politics, for him, is about  patience, about taking the long view.    Molyneux, as part of the price of supporting Major, has  succeeded in blocking proposals to privatise water in Northen  Ireland and in gaining agreement on a select committee for  Northern Ireland affairs, seeing the latter as a way of bringing  even closer ties to the mainland.    But his greatest service to Unionism came in the months  running up to the Downing Street Declaration. He said the  document first surfaced in the Irish Press on 19 November,  consisting of 30 paragraphs and confirmed by the Irish  Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, as authentic. Paisley and other  Ulster politicians went to see Major and made very public  statements afterwards.    Molyneux made few such statements and instead saw Major  about  twice a week in private. He could barely conceal, during the  interview, his sense of satisfaction at the outcome. The other  party leaders have to ask themselves, said Molyneux, who was  responsible for removing the contentious parts from the original  Irish document. From memory, he recited in detail a paragraph  that would have set up a joint British-Irish convention that  would have exercised a lot of power over a Northern Ireland  Assembly.    "Now this is not in the document. And now there isn't in it  anything, as opposed to when there were 30 paragraphs, not even  one cog or wheel of mechanism anywhere in it. It is just a  muddled statement of principles and aspirations and all the rest  of it but not a single commitment to do anything, unlike the  Anglo-lrish agreement which says `there shall be established,  the chief constable shall do this, that and the other, the army  commander shall do this.' There is no `shall' or even `may' in  it [The Downing Street Declaration]," he said.    His one concession was to Dublin's idea for a Forum for  Peace, an all-lreland political convention.    "The only thing I reluctantly...not reluctantly but which I  thought there was no harm in acquiescing to...was Reynolds  having a forum `within his jurisdiction.' These words were put  in deliberately. He can have a talking shop if he wants to. We  are not involved. The British Government is not involved. They  can do what they like. It is in their own sovereign territory."    He does not rule out a meeting with Reynolds, who sent him a  "friendly" letter in December to which Molyneux sent a reply  simply acknowledging receipt. But Molyneux is not particularly  interested in relations between Northern Ireland and Dublin.  What he considers to be much more significant is internal  democracy and the talks have been underway since last September  with the Northern Ireland minister of state, Michael Ancram,  about setting up an Assembly.    This has attracted interest in Scotland, where the argument  is that if Northern Ireland can have a legislative Assembly, why  not Scotland.    But Molyneux makes it clear that while the Government may  want a legislative Assembly, he does not, and what Molyneux  wants, he invariably gets. His plan is for a nonlegislative  85-member Assembly, a sort of glorified local government. It  would be more like Strathclyde Regional Council than a  full-blown Scottish Parliament as proposed by Labour.    If legislation was needed, this could be done by getting  private bills put through the Commons, just as English councils  do at present. He concedes that if the Assembly worked and  became a mature body, there might in the future be a case for  adding legislative powers.    Molyneux, who fought in the RAF [Royal Air Force] during the  Second World War, found himself on the Normandy beaches on  D-Day. It was partly an accident, having been transferred only a  few days earlier by a commanding officer who did not like him.  A lot of his life has been an accident.    He has been an MP since 1970 -- first for Antrim South and  now for the Lagan Valley -- and leader of the Unionists since  1974.    As Major's Commons majority of 17 dwindles further as a  result of inevitable by-election defeats, Molyneux's role over  the next few years will become more, not less, important.    In January 1985, Douglas Hurd, then Home Secretary,  frustrated by the intransigence of Molyneux and Paisley,  complained that "the Unionist tail cannot go on wagging the  British dog forever." The British dog has never been so  vigorously wagged as it is at present.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Czechs opt for early payout on state shares: A look at the rush to sell privatisation vouchers An offer of immediate cash is enticing thousands of Czechs to part with their privatisation voucher books now rather than wait for shares later in the Czech Republic's second wave of mass privatisation. The offer made by Epic, a Vienna-based consultancy and fund management company, has attracted great interest and publicity, with hundreds of people lining up outside offices in Prague and other Czech cities to sell their voucher books. 'We've had people queuing overnight. It's been a tremendous success,' says Mr Peter Goldscheider, Epic managing director. Competition for subscribers between investment funds has been particularly fierce with an estimated Kcs1bn (Dollars 35m) spent on advertising - roughly five times the amount spent by funds in the first wave of privatisation two years ago. In 1992 many funds tried to outbid one another with promises to buy portfolios from investors at some future date for several times the Kcs1,000 cost of their original voucher book. This assured investors a risk-free profit on a relatively modest outlay, and encouraged massive participation in the scheme. About 6m Czechs bought voucher books, and the funds gained control of more than 70 per cent of privatised companies' shares. Epic has gone one step further by simply offering an immediate Kcs7,000 to buy an investor's voucher book, with another Kcs1,000 paid later when the shares are issued. 'We're not making any promises or offering people loans as an incentive. 'We just cash out,' says Mr Goldscheider. Analysts say Epic's offer is likely to be well below the future market value of the privatised shares, but for many people it has the merit of simplicity as well as providing immediate cash. Mr Goldscheider will not say how many voucher books the company has bought so far, or how long the offer will remain in force. 'We have a target, and we'll stop when we reach it. We don't want to be too small or too big as this reduces flexibility,' he says. In the first wave, Epic attracted 110,000 investors with shares in about 60 companies to its Czech Coupon Invest fund, but it did not buy the shares outright. Interest in Epic's scheme has been especially strong among the elderly and the less well-off - those who have benefited least from the past four years' rapid transition to capitalism. 'Old people and people from the poorer regions tend to want to sell,' he says. But they are not the only ones. Epic's payment represents more than one month's average salary, and many voucher book holders prefer to have the extra cash now rather than wait until the shares are distributed. Others with shares from the first privatisations have found it difficult to sell them, or they are still waiting to receive money promised by funds almost two years ago. Many investors complain they have not received any dividends on their shares. Epic has taken on extra staff to answer phone calls and handle transactions across the country at offices temporarily rented from Cedok, the Czech travel agency. 'We have to move solicitors around the country to witness and register every contract. Our people are working day and night in three shifts just to process all this,' Mr Goldscheider says. Unlike individual investors, investment funds can afford to wait in the knowledge that they should easily recoup the costs of their investment. The average value of shares secured with a Kcs1,000 voucher book in the first privatisation wave is now Kcs20,000-Kcs30,000. Even after deducting Kcs8,000 for each voucher book, plus the costs of advertising and processing the transactions, Epic should not lose money.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: SMALL CAMERA STORES FEELING ECONOMIC SQUEEZE  </P> <P> Small, full-service neighborhood camera stores are a much needed resource to  the photography enthusiast because they offer service and knowledge along with  cameras, accessories, darkroom equipment, books, paper and film.  </P> <P> These full-service stores seem to be diminishing in number, while one-hour  photo-finishing franchises are popping up on every corner.  </P> <P> Basic economics is behind this switch from traditional service to quick sales.  The one-hour stores specialize in printing pictures, a high-mark-up item.  </P> <P> It's also a tough battle for the full-service stores because they must compete  against discount appliance outlets that offer cameras at lower prices.  </P> <P> Camera sales boomed in the early '70s with the introduction of the Canon AE-1  and other affordable, easy-to-use, 35-millimeter single-lens-reflex cameras.  </P> <P> In the past, the sale of a camera also meant the sale of several accessories.  But now, most automated point-and-shoot cameras come with built-in flash and  multiple lenses. They are complete units, making sales of additional  accessories minimal.  </P> <P> The cameras are easy to carry and operate, and they produce good results for  consumers who rarely have a print blown up larger than 8 by 10 inches. Even  many professional photographers use this style of camera for home use.  </P> <P> This trend has had a negative impact on the neighborhood store, shifting the  business to one-hour finishing shops.  </P> <P> Jerry Shepherd, owner of Foto-Hall camera store in Fullerton, has seen a lot of  camera stores go out of business.  </P> <P> "There is a very narrow profit margin in camera sales, virtually no profit," he  said. "You sell a $500 camera and make $15. You can't count on the cameras only  to carry you."  </P> <P> Shepherd started his business 15 years ago as a combination photo-processing  lab and Hallmark card store. Five years later he phased out the cards for  cameras. Today, photo processing is still a major portion of his business.  </P> <P> "There was a standing joke among camera salesmen: 'Sell it at cost and make it  up in volume.' But you can't do it," Shepherd said.  </P> <P> "Some of the New York mail-order operations created this dilemma by their use  of money. They could get the money in and sell the cameras at cost. They got  the money in advance so they could use the money for a few weeks.  </P> <P> "If you do a high enough volume and you're sharp enough in investing, you can  turn some bucks. Some of the operations in New York are sharp enough to do it.  They created low-ball camera sales. I don't know of any other business like  this."  </P> <P> Shepherd had a problem about five years ago with people who would come to his  store for information but buy at cheaper prices at discount stores.  </P> <P> "Most consumers can't be shipped a box and know how to work it properly," he  said. "Without the service camera store, the camera industry will flounder, but  by the same token, it's the catalogue and high-volume discount stores that are  killing us."  </P> <P> Bill Ventura, owner of Bill's Camera in Huntington Beach and San Clemente, says  small camera stores haven't prospered because they can't make enough profit  over the long term.  </P> <P> "Your mass merchandisers use cameras as a loss leader," Ventura said. "The  camera manufacturers cater to them. The bottom line is if you can sell 100,000  cameras to one supplier. I don't care who you are or what harm it causes, other  distributors are going to do it. I think that's basically why a lot of these  small shops can't compete."  </P> <P> Ventura also owns a photo-processing lab and a repair facility to complement  his retail outlets. He believes this keeps him competitive on the retail end.  </P> <P> "One thing that has never changed is that people come in for service," Ventura  said.  </P></p>

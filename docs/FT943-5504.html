			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Chips can't (yet) do everything: The world chess champion lost to a computer, but man still has the upper hand When a chip chopped a chess champ this week, commentators were quick to proclaim another famous victory for computers in their long struggle for mental superiority over the human brain. By knocking Garry Kasparov, the world champion, out of the Intel Grand Prix in London, the Pentium micro-processor certainly shocked the chess world - and saddened some people who thought its triumph would remove the game's intellectual mystique. Although computers have been beating good players for several years, few people expected their first serious victory at the highest level to come so soon. 'A lot of people thought there was a qualitative difference between most grandmasters and the elite handful of potential world champions,' says Manny Rainer, formerly an international chess player and now an artificial intelligence specialist with SRI, the Cambridge research consultancy. 'I'm beginning to think now that there might not be such a gap after all.' But Kasparov's defeat will have less psychological impact on artificial intelligence research than on the world of chess. In computing's pioneering era in the 1950s and 1960s, researchers learned a lot of important programming techniques by teaching computers to play chess. Things are very different today. Chess computers have become a minor sideshow with little relevance to mainstream research. Scientists trying to mimic human intelligence in machines now prefer to work on problems related to the everyday world, such as translating between languages, enabling a robot to steer around obstacles or assessing the creditworthiness of bank customers. For all its reputation as the queen of intellectual pursuits, chess is a self-contained small world with little scope for surprises - in other words, ideally suited to computing. The personal computer that beat Kasparov - containing Intel's latest Pentium processor and running a Genius 2 chess program - costs only Pounds 2,000 but it can carry out 166m calculations and analyse 100,000 possible moves every second. And that is fast enough to out-think a human player. 'Kasparov has relied on his experience and his strategic thinking, and that's no longer enough,' says Professor Bill O'Riordan, head of advanced research for ICL, the UK-based computer company. 'It comes to all of us - he is just too slow.' 'Watching the human being becoming more and more distraught, while the computer remained as impassive as ever, was strangely unsettling,' says Andrew Finan, a tournament official. 'Kasparov is feeling very very sore - he has gone underground and is not giving any interviews.' The Intel Grand Prix is admittedly 'speed chess'; each player has 25 minutes to make all his moves. Fast calculating is at less of a premium in a normal tournament, when 40 moves have to be completed every two hours. However no one doubts that, with the processing power of silicon chips doubling every two years, cheap computers will soon be able to beat the best human players under those conditions too. O'Riordan does not agree, however, that chess will be diminished as a game. 'On the contrary,' he says, 'once we realise that men will never again beat the machine, we should feel liberated and treat chess as a pure sport again.' In draughts (or checkers, as it is known in the US) the champions have also succumbed to the power of computers. But there are other intellectual games in which the human brain still reigns supreme. One is Go, which originated in east Asia 4,000 years ago, making it more than twice as old as chess. The rules of Go are simpler than those of chess but it has a larger board and more potential moves at every stage. As a result, the balance between long-term strategic thinking, which is the forte of the human player, and short-term tactics, at which the computer excels, is tilted in favour of the former. Good Go players need not fear defeat by a computer for many years. Chess and Go are 'games of perfect information'; nothing is hidden from the players. Computers are less successful at card games such as bridge, where the course of play is less predictable and psychological factors are more important. 'The best bridge computers today are not even up to good amateur standard,' Rainer says. 'The kind of skills you need for chess are not very useful for anything else  -developing a good bridge program would be much more useful for good artificial intelligence research. 'Bridge is a trickier game all round for the computer, because you have to reason about probabilities rather than certainties and you have to think about what your partner is thinking the whole time.' If machines are ever to become bridge champions, they may not be created by programmers dedicated to producing a bridge-playing equivalent of the Genius 2 chess computer. Instead, they may emerge from more general research into intelligent machines capable of learning human behaviour. The most ambitious research of this sort is in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's artificial intelligence laboratory. Scientists there are creating Cog, a humanoid robot which Daniel Dennett, one of the team, says will be able to 'interact with human beings in a robust and versatile manner in real time, take care of itself and tell its designers things about its condition that would otherwise be extremely difficult if not impossible to determine by examination'. If Cog can play bridge, this will be a by-product of its general learning skills, not its main raison d'etre. And unlike today's chess computers, it will be physically capable of making its own moves. Cog will have eyes to see the cards, arms to play them, ears to hear the bidding and a voice to speak itself. Although a primitive first-generation Cog exists, it will probably be several decades before the robot develops sufficient understanding and adaptability to play bridge with people. By then the thought of a human chess champion playing a computer will seem as ridiculous as it would be today for a sprinter to race against a Formula 1 car.</p>

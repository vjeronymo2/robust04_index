			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Schering soars after report from San Francisco Easing tensions in the Middle East, optimism for the ruling German coalition ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections and the unleashing of the Dow yesterday afternoon coaxed another decidely upbeat performance from German equities, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT accentuated the positive with bonds rising and, towards the end of the official session, Dax futures extending Monday's uptrend. The Dax index rose 46.27, or 2.3 per cent to 2,071.06, effectively doubling Monday's post-bourse rise to 2,048.56. In the afternoon, apparently unimpeded by wage demands of up to 6 per cent from the German engineering workers' union, IG Metall, the Ibis-indicated Dax climbed further to 2,087.71, up 1.9 per cent over 24 hours. The stock of the day was Schering, which recovered DM44 to DM942 following the presentation of rival multiple sclerosis drugs in San Francisco on Monday. Mr Mark Tracey, of Goldman Sachs in London, said that Schering's BetaSeron drug was unlikely to face productive competition until 1996. In the meantime, said Mr Tracy, Schering was looking at higher margins and sales, cost cutting potential, net cash equal to around 30 per cent of the share price and a p/e ratio of 13 to 14 for 1995 backed by prospective five-year earnings per share growth of 25 per cent per annum compound. Back in the broad market, there were big gains for Allianz, chemicals and carmakers. US buying for the latter took Volkswagen up DM11 to DM477, BMW by DM13.50 to DM791 and Daimler by another DM10.60 to DM789.50 although, according to the chairman of Adam Opel in Frankfurt, the European and German car markets will grow only modestly in the next five years and manufacturers will not match the profits they achieved in the early 1990s. PARIS finally broke through the 1,900 barrier as the CAC-40 index attained a session high of 1,924 before easing slightly to close up 20.70 at 1,919.02. Trading in Sanofi was suspended for a time ahead of its announcement that it was to sell a significant proportion of its bio-activities to Viag of Germany for FFr4.4bn. On resumption the shares put on FFr3.10 to close at FFr241.20. The sale comes as part of Sanofi's disposal programme to finance the acquisition of Sterling Winthrop's prescription pharmaceuticals activities from Eastman Kodak of the US. Initial reaction from analysts was positive, with the sale price at or above expectations. However, others remarked that Sanofi still had to dispose of the remaining part of its bio-activities, worth around FFr2bn, although the company said that it hoped to sign agreements for the remaining part of the business by the end of the year. ZURICH had mixed feelings about its pharmaceuticals and chemicals sector. Switzerland's three big drug companies are due to produce nine month sales figures over the next weeks, and the talk yesterday was that Swiss franc appreciation, and the policy of cost containment by leading customers will affect the outcome. Roche certificates recovered SFr95 to SFr5,880 but Sandoz bearers dropped SFr8 to SFr665, and Ciba bearers by SFr7 to SFr775. The SMI index rose 16.8, or 0.7 per cent to 2,570.24, led by banks which saw CS Holding up SFr14 at Sfr544 and SBC bearers SFr6 higher at SFr375. One of the best gains of the day came from Brown Boveri, up SFr33 at SFr1,100 in a technical recovery. MILAN was again rocked by political turmoil as rumours swept the market that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was about to be placed under investigation by magistrates. The allegation was firmly denied by a government spokesperson and the stock market made a late rally on short-covering. The Comit index ended the session off 3.23 at 636.83 in light turnover. Losses among stocks were evenly spread with Montedison off L27 at L1,223 and Pirelli down L80 at L2,190. Benetton recovered L230 to L19,900, as the company continued to recoup last week's losses. AMSTERDAM's forward momentum continued in moderate turnover. The AEX index improved 5.23 to 404.11. Philips, which was positive on Monday following news that it had signed a co-operation agreement with IBM for the production of semi-conductors, attracted renewed support, the shares rising Fl 1.80 to Fl 55.00. MADRID moved from a small decline in mid-session to a minor recovery at the close, th e general index rising 0.93 to 295.75. Mr Christopher Cooper of James Capel noted that Monday's turnover had been at, or near a low for the year of Pta14bn; yesterday produced an improvement at Pta18.7bn. Banks provided the base for the index improvement with BCH closing Pta35 higher at Pta2,975, Popular up Pta210 at Pta15,660 and Santander Pta70 better at Pta4,970. STOCKHOLM, and Ericsson Bs were inspired by nine-month figures from the telecommunications group's US competitor, Motorola. The Ericsson B rise of SKr21.50, or 6.3 per cent to SKr416 was followed by Volvo B, up SKr4.50 at SKr138, and the Affarsvarlden General index climbed by 22.80, or 1.6 per cent to 1,415.00.

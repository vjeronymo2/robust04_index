The rise was the biggest in 18 years, the economic daily said.    Because of the prolonged recession, however, the income of  salaried workers in Japan in the fiscal year ended March 31,  1993, grew at a record low rate of 3.5 percent, down from a 7.5  percent increase registered in the previous year, it said.    But the national income itself recorded the smallest growth  ever of 0.3 percent, making the workers' share relatively  higher, the newspaper said.    The higher ratio indicates that labor costs are heavier for  corporations and so employees are likely to face tough  resistance from their employers in the annual wage hike  negotiations this spring, it said.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> AUTO THEFT PROGRAM TO BEGIN  </P> <P> Starting Saturday, Alhambra residents can take advantage of a free program to  crack down on auto theft.  </P> <P> The "Combat Auto Theft" program is already in operation in other cities,  including Monrovia, Ventura, Van Nuys and Anaheim. Participating drivers place  a special decal in their car's right rear window and sign a document promising  not to drive between the hours of 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. A patrol officer who spots  a car with a decal on the road between those hours will be alerted to a  possible stolen vehicle.  </P> <P> City officials will begin registering residents for the program Saturday from  10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the parking lot on the north side of City Hall, 111 S. 1st  St.  </P></p>

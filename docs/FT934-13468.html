			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Volvo seeks remaining BCP shares VOLVO, the Swedish industrial group, yesterday launched a public offer for the outstanding shares in Branded Consumer Products (BCP), the company being formed from the non-drug operations of Procordia. The move was expected following the company's June agreement with the Swedish government, which will split Procordia into its pharmaceutical and consumer product businesses. It is not linked with the planned merger of the group's car and truck operations with France's Renault. The offer values BCP at SKr11.9bn (Dollars 1.5bn), or SKr47 per share, excluding SKr2.5bn of debt. It is essentially a mopping-up exercise, as Volvo will hold 85.5 per cent of BCP's votes and 73.7 per cent of its capital once Procordia is formally split next month. Volvo's offer consists of three alternatives: One new Volvo share for every six BCP shares. Based on the SKr412 price at which Volvo's shares closed yesterday, this values each BCP share at SKr68.7; SKr47 in cash for each BCP share; Seven shares in the new Procordia, to be renamed Pharmacia, for every 20 BCP shares. Behind the offer is Volvo's desire to balance its cyclical motor vehicle operations with a more stable consumer goods business. BCP comprises Swedish Match, Procordia Food, Procordia Beverages and Procordia Invest.</p>

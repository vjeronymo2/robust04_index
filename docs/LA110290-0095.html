			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER AIDE QUITS IN EUROPE POLICY RIFT;  </P> <P> BRITAIN: THE FORMER FOREIGN SECRETARY FAVORS A SINGLE EUROPEAN CURRENCY. BUT  THE PRIME MINISTER DOES NOT.  </P> <P> Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe resigned from the government Thursday after  a rift with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over Britain's commitment to  Europe.  </P> <P> His resignation came five days after Howe suggested in a television interview  that Thatcher would eventually drop her adamant opposition to a single European  currency.  </P> <P> In his letter of resignation, Howe said: "I am deeply anxious that the mood you  have struck . . . will make it more difficult for Britain to hold and retain a  position of influence in this vital debate (over Britain's role in Europe).  </P> <P> " . . . I do not believe that I can any longer serve with honor as a member of  your government."  </P> <P> Thatcher responded that she did not believe their differences "are nearly so  great as you suggest."  </P> <P> She said she accepted his resignation "more in sorrow than in anger," according  to the Press Assn., Britain's domestic news agency.  </P> <P> "Thatcher has been bitten by the man she treated as a doormat -- and she  deserves it," said Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party.  </P> <P> "This is a mortal blow to Mrs. Thatcher's government," said Paddy Ashdown,  leader of the small, pro-European Liberal Democratic Party.  </P> <P> Howe was the last Cabinet minister to have served continuously since Thatcher  came to power in 1979, but he had appeared to be out of favor since he was  replaced as foreign secretary last summer.  </P> <P> Tall, rotund and soft-spoken, Howe seemed an unlikely participant in a  controversy. Labor Party lawmaker Denis Healey once remarked that arguing with  Howe was "like being savaged by a dead sheep."  </P> <P> Because of his position on Europe, Howe was removed as foreign minister last  year and shunted into the newly created post of deputy prime minister. He also  held the titles of lord president of the council and leader of the House of  Commons.  </P> <P> His resignation as deputy prime minister followed yet another row over Europe.  Last weekend, Thatcher found herself standing alone against 11 other European  Community leaders on setting a timetable for adopting a single currency.  </P> <P> In a television interview in London, Howe suggested that Thatcher might  eventually change her mind.  </P> <P> "We've had occasions like this before," he said. "I've attended a number of  summit meetings with the prime minister on which, at this preliminary stage,  we've found ourselves expressing a sharply different view, or apparently  sharply different view."  </P> <P> Howe, 63, was first elected to Parliament in 1964, was out of office from 1966  to 1970 and has served continuously since then.  </P> <P> He was appointed chancellor of the exchequer, the top treasury official, in  Thatcher's first Cabinet. In 1983 he became foreign secretary and served until  1989.  </P> <P> His departure underlined the deep divisions within the Conservative Party,  which trailed Labor by 16 percentage points in two newspaper polls published  last weekend.  </P> <P> The appearance of disarray has been heightened by a series of Cabinet shuffles  and resignations, beginning with Howe's removal as foreign secretary in July,  1989.  </P></p>

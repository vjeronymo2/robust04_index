			<p>BFN     [Text] The reform plan based on the liberal system that the  Algerian Government has approved after its agreement with the  IMF has received extensive attention in different international  financial circles.    In light of this agreement, the Algerian Government economic  delegation led by Mr. Mourad Benachnou, the minister of  industrial restructuring and participation, is continuing its  talks in Washington with officials in the IMF and the World Bank  who are meeting within the framework of their annual joint  session.    The Algerian delegation's talks with the two international  bodies are focusing on the technical aspects of the Algerian  Government's reform plan.    An Algerian source in the U.S. capital explained that the  greater part of the discussions between the two sides is  centered on the release [tasrih] of the second part related to  banking systems in Algeria that comprises 14 plans on budget  correction.    It has become clear from these talks that the World Bank is  prepared to grant Algeria a 200 million dollar loan to be  invested in the field of water in Algeria. Official circles in  both the IMF and the World Bank have told our delegation that  they support the government reform plan. The same circles said  they considered this plan to be an important step on the way to  establishing Algeria's economy on sound foundations.    The same source says that preparations are being made for a  new plan related to the development of the housing sector,  adding that Mr. Mourad Benachnou's talks with World Bank  officials was fruitful. The talks also covered how to deal with  the problems of unemployment by relying on experiments that were  tried in other countries. This would encourage the private  sector to play its role in step with the expansion and promotion  of the activities of the productive sectors.    The Algerian delegation's talks will continue tomorrow,  Thursday, with a sector by sector review of the economic plan in  order to obtain support for the reform plan from the World Bank.</p>

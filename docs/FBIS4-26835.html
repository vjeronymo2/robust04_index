			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial work conference on halting deficits  and increasing profits was held in Shuangcheng city on 24 June.    The conference set forth: This year, the province should  attain the target of reducing 456 million yuan in deficits based  on the deficit figure of last year. The decrease rate is 11.7  percent.    The conference also urged all localities across the province  to conscientiously implement the central policy on grasping  favorable opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding the scale  of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability;  to make positive efforts to halt deficits; and to realize the  1994 targets for halting deficits and increasing profits.    The conference urged that all localities should emancipate  the mind, find breakthroughs from enterprises' bankruptcy and,  by extensive exploration of ways, rely on reform to change  mechanisms and enhance vitality, rely on science and technology  to speed up the pace of transformation and enhance strength,  rely on management to enhance internal strength and tap  potentials, rely on policies to optimize the environment and  expand external strength, and carry out the overall improvement  policy to make real headway in halting deficits.    The conference maintained: Last year, the province made  noticeable achievements in halting deficits. The budgetary  industrial, grain, forest industrial, commercial, foreign trade,  and agricultural production enterprises suffered 2.06 billion  yuan of deficits during the year, a drop of 839 million yuan or  33.9 percent from the figure of 1992. Viewing the economic  operation situation in the first five months of this year, we  know that there are great difficulties in realizing the 1994  target for reducing deficits.    The conference set forth: All localities should expand the  dynamics of the property right reform, balance the relations of  property rights, and solve the problems cropping up due to  unclear property rights and indefinite rights and  responsibilities. Enterprises should optimize their existing  assets and increase economic results.    The conference especially stressed: We should have the  daring to make a breakthrough and make bankruptcy become a kind  of mechanism for halting deficits. The enterprises that are  hopeless in halting deficits and those whose assets cannot  compensate for their debts should declare bankruptcy according  to the law governing bankruptcy and on the premise that the work  in all domains has been well handled.    The conference also discussed the province's manuscript on  relevant policy regulations on helping enterprises halt  deficits. Preferential policy regulations on creating both  internal and external conditions for helping money-losing  enterprises halt deficits have been stipulated in this  manuscript.</p>

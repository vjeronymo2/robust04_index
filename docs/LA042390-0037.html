			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEHRAN NEWSPAPER CALLS FOR RELEASE OF 2ND U.S. HOSTAGE  </P> <P> The Tehran Times called today for the release of a second U.S. hostage in  Lebanon after Robert Polhill was freed by pro-Iranian captors Sunday.  </P> <P> The newspaper, which is close to President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said that "to  contribute to the establishment of a general atmosphere of trust, the Lebanese  groups should release another American hostage."  </P> <P> "By so doing, they once more prove their goodwill and preparedness for the  settlement of the issue."  </P> <P> An informed Iranian source said that he expects another American to be freed by  Friday. The source, who asked not to be identified, said this should be  followed by the release by Israel of Shiite Muslim cleric Abdel Karim Obeid,  abducted by Israeli commandos from southern Lebanon last year.  </P> <P> Obeid is a senior member of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, an  umbrella group for various extremist organizations believed to be holding seven  Americans and other Westerners in Lebanon.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem, Israel declined to comment Sunday on whether the release of  Polhill was part of a larger deal to free Israeli-held Arab prisoners.  </P> <P> Yossi Olmert, the Government Press Office director, said, "We have no comment  on this, no comment at all."  </P></p>

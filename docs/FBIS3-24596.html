Makarov, Cellular Biophysics  Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino, Moscow  Oblast, Clinical and Experimental Medicine Institute, Siberian  Department, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Novosibirsk,  and Elementoorganic Compounds Institute, Russian Academy of  Sciences, Moscow; UDC 557.152.1]    [Abstract] The recent development of blood substitutes  based on fluorocarbons has led to the creation of  ``second-generation'' fluorocarbons that satisfy biomedical  requirements more adequately. Specifically, an emulsion of  perfluoroctylbromide [PFOB] emulsion that was initially proposed  as an x-ray contract medium is now being considered as the basis  of a promising universal blood substitute. PFOB was incorporated  as a component in a gas-transport emulsion and injected  intraperitoneally into female Wistar rats (weighing 180-220 g  each) in a dose of 10 ml/kg for 3 days. Phenobarbital was  analogously injected in a dose of 80 mg/kg. The microsomes of  the murine livers were isolated by differential centrifugation,  and the content of total cytochrome P-450 in the microsomes was  measured based on their CO spectra. When the fluorocarbon  emulsion was added to the microsomal membranes, an  enzyme-substrate complex, i.e., fully fluorinated organic  compound-cytochrome P-450, was observed to form. The spectral  characteristics of the PFOB-cytochrome P-450 complex were  similar to that of the complex perfluorodecalin-cytochrome  P-450. Injection of the PFOB emulsion into the rats resulted in  a 20 percent decrease in the amount of cytochrome P-450 in their  hepatic microsomes. An analysis of the kinetics of the formation  of Br[.sup]-[/] when reduced nicotinamide adenine  dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] is added to the murine microsomes  in the presence of a PFOB emulsion established that the  concentration of free Br[.sup]-[/] in the study specimens is  1-2 M higher than in control specimens. These findings were  taken as unequivocal confirmation of the possibility of  NADPH-dependent liberation of Br[.sup]-[/] from PFOB in the  presence of microsomal membranes. The experiments on induction  of microsomal monoxygenase were interpreted as confirmation of  the fact that PFOB is a much weaker inducer of the  ``phenobarbital'' isoforms of cytochrome P-450 II  B[.sup]1[/]/B[.sub]2[/] than the classic fluorocarbon  inducer of cytochrome P-450 (i.e., perfluorodecalin) is. It was  hypothesized that the anomalous cytochrome P-450-inducing  properties of PFOB may be linked to its ability to be  metabolized by hepatic microsomal monoxygenase. For this reason  it was concluded that the generally accepted opinion regarding  the inertness and invariance in the body of organoperfluoro  compounds containing both heteroatoms (N, O, H, etc.) and double  bonds needs additional verification. This study was said to be  the first successful demonstration of the fact that enzyme  systems of a living organism are capable of causing the  destruction of fully fluorinated organic compounds.

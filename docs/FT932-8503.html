			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Danes remain deeply split on integration DENMARK'S approval of the Maastricht treaty, and the Edinburgh opt-outs, is unlikely to expunge the country's reputation as the reluctant European, judging from Danish politicians' comments on yesterday's vote. The MPs, who refused to take a No for a no when the voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in a referendum last June, were happy with yesterday's endorsing vote. But their satisfaction was tempered by the realisation that the size of the No vote leaves the country deeply divided on the issue of European integration. The Yes vote was 'big, but not big enough,' said Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister for 10 years until last January. He felt that the size of the vote against the Maastricht treaty would limit the room for government manoeuvre as the shape of European union was hammered out over the next few years. Mr Holger K Nielsen, leader of the left-wing Socialist People's party which switched from opposition last June to support for a Yes as a result of the Edinburgh deal, said the size of the No vote 'places an obligation on the Yes side to ensure the Edinburgh agreement remains the basis of Danish policy. 'The big No vote emphasises that Denmark cannot go along with anything resembling a united states of Europe,' he said. Mr Nielsen's supporters failed to follow their leader yesterday, according to polling institutes; only about 20 per cent of them voted in favour. The Edinburgh agreement allows Denmark to opt out of the Maastricht treaty's clauses on a unified currency, co-operation on defence and police, and union citizenship. The country could choose to 'opt into' these policies in future, but not without new referendums. The vote in favour of the treaty, by 56.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent, still leaves a large gap between the popular vote and politicians. The Edinburgh agreement was endorsed by seven of the eight parliamentary parties and more than 90 per cent of members. Politicians and commentators last night attributed the swing since last year to two factors - the Edinburgh agreement and the change of government in January this year. The Edinburgh deal reduced fears that the treaty would erode the country's sovereignty and independence, the issue which most opponents cited last year as their reason for voting against it. The change of government brought the country's largest party, the Social Democrats, back into office after 10 years in opposition, with Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen as prime minister. 'It has made an impression on Social Democratic supporters that there is a Social Democratic government. It has given authority to our pleas for a Yes vote,' said Mr Mogens Lykketoft, finance minister. Last year Social Democratic supporters voted 60-40 against the treaty. This year, according to preliminary results, a narrow majority voted in favour. But it was enough to tip the balance.</p>

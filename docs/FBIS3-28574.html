It has been hailed by many as a move  that will be good for America, good for Vietnam, and good for  the international community.    Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has described  the U.S. position as good news, adding that it will help Vietnam  grow and prosper. And indeed it will as inflow of foreign  investments into Vietnam, especially by American businessmen,  will become a key factor in restructuring and boosting the  country's economy.    The lifting of the embargo, imposed three decades ago, has  been long overdue. In the United States, it has been a delicate  issue because the Vietnam War had taken a heavy toll on the  American servicemen's lives -- 61,000 in all -- and there are  some 2,238 soldiers listed as missing or (?counted) as prisoners  of war.    The U.S. President has said that he has made the move to  lift  the embargo not for economics, but because he thought it was the  best way to get the fullest possible accounting of those  missing, referred to as MIA. Whatever the reasons, it is a  wise, bold, and pragmatic move despite the fact that there may  be many Americans who are opposed to the measure. But it is the  first step toward normalization of relations between the two  countries. It is good that Vietnam has plenty to gain from the  lifting of the embargo. Even when embargo was in place, Vietnam  achieved a 7.5-percent economic growth. Now with the embargo  lifted, the country's economy is expected to grow by more than  10 percent this year.

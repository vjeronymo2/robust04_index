			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Budget hopes steady equity nerves EXPECTATIONS of an expansionary Budget from the UK government on March 10 continued to shield the UK stock market from the effects of this week's barrage of bad news from the international oil companies. Share prices closed steadily ahead of the opening on Monday of the last equity trading account before Budget Day. London benefited initially from the effects of Wall Street's overnight gain of 50 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had prompted advances across the range of other European bourses. But gains were soon eliminated as the stock index futures reacted sharply to a weaker trend in sterling and to the latest UK public opinion polls which indicated a lead of four points for the UK opposition Labour party. The implications for dividend yields in the UK market of the disappointing statements from BP and Shell also kept share prices subdued yesterday. By the close of trading, the market was no more than mixed. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,542.3 for a net loss on the day of 1.1 points. In early trade, the market was ahead by 11.7 but lost impetus as, once again, the institutions stayed away from UK equities until the outlook is clearer. The Footsie 2,550 mark is still seen as an important hurdle and strategists remained confident for the near term outlook in equities. A cut of half a point in UK base rates between Budget Day and the general election, expected on April 9, has now been virtually discounted by the London stock market. At last night's close, the FT-SE Index showed a gain of 25.1, or nearly 1 per cent, over the two week equity account. The gain came this week on sudden hopes in the City that interest rates might be cut earlier than expected. However, Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull was among those to warn that the trading results from BP and Shell may have sharply changed the market's earnings profile for the medium to longer term, and that projections of a fall of 12 per cent in earnings may now be shifting to around 17 per cent. This could undermine many projections for UK equities both for this year and next. Confidence in London is also restrained by continuing worries over what is seen as an over-generous valuation of Wall Street. Good results from Lloyds Bank helped London yesterday but left unanswered the underlying rumours that the UK banking sector will be the stage for a substantial restructuring during the current profits season. Retail, or customer, volume in equities rose sharply at the beginning of the week on hopes of early cuts in base rates but has now receded.</p>

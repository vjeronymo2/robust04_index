			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>   [Text] Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian resistance, has  urged the Iranian people to escalate the struggle against the  ruling regime in Iran, to pave the way for the liberation army  to pounce on the regime.    Addressing the sons of Iran during a gathering of thousands  of national liberation army fighters at one of the liberation  army's camps [in Iraq] on the new Iranian year, Rajavi said:  "Escalate your protests against the authority. These protests  will pave the way for the liberation army's major assault. The  regime is destined to fall."    The resistance leader gave an elaborate account of the  Iranians' tragic economic and social situation under the ruling  regime because of the $50-million foreign debt and the collapse  of the rial exchange rate.</p>

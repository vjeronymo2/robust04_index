			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (7): Flexible friend for lenders - Securitisation US BANKS and companies have been reaping the benefits of securitisation for years, but their European counterparts are much more recent converts to this flexible form of balance sheet management. Securitisation is a funding process which allows banks or companies to take loans off their balance sheets, thereby removing the risk of default and freeing capital which can be used to make new loans. 'The main objective of securitisation is to achieve capital efficiency and to maximise returns on shareholders' funds,' says Mr Guy Fletcher, director of BZW Asset Securitisation Group, part of Barclays Bank. In October, Barclays became the first UK bank to securitise personal loans when it raised Pounds 280m through an issue of floating rate notes backed by loans made to the bank's credit card customers. Securitisation works in this way: the originator of the loans (that is, the bank or company) places the loans in a special-purpose vehicle which then raises money by selling debt securities, backed by these assets, to investors. Interest payments on the so-called mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities are funded as the borrowers make repayments on their loans. Most of the loans which are securitised tend to be residential mortgages or consumer loans from banks, credit card companies, car manufacturers or leasing companies. Securitisation of commercial property loans is also increasing in the US, reflecting an unwillingness among banks to expose themselves too heavily to the commercial property developers after the property crash of the late 1980s. Although the banks or companies do not rid themselves entirely of the risk of default, their exposure is reduced considerably. Securitisation experts say they sometimes end up being responsible for the first losses on as little as 1 per cent of the total volume of securitised loans. Securitisation is firmly established in the US, where about half of the Dollars 2,500bn worth of residential mortgages are estimated to have been securitised. In addition, asset-backed securities make up about Dollars 75bn of the Dollars 600bn corporate commercial paper market in the US. Current volume of securities backed by commercial property loans in the US is around Dollars 12bn but this market is expected to grow rapidly in the next three years when Dollars 300bn worth of commercial property loans will need to be re-financed. By comparison, securitisation in Europe is still at an early stage. Most of Europe's securitised deals have originated in the UK though there has been activity in Spain, France and Scandinavia. In the UK, the most active issuers in the mortgage-backed market have been centralised mortgage lenders looking for funding to match the long maturity of their portfolios. Securitised deals were launched in the Eurobond market in 1985. Volume rose rapidly from Dollars 200m that year to Dollars 12.8bn in 1990 but then nearly halved to Dollars 7.2bn in 1992 as the economic recession and high interest rates in the UK cut demand for new loans. However, there has been a revival this year (Dollars 5.5bn has been raised) as lenders seek to expand their business without having to raise fresh capital. Mr Malcolm Veale, head of asset securitisation of National Westminster Bank, the UK's high street bank which raised Pounds 300m from its first mortgage-backed issue in September, gives several reasons why securitisation has been slow to get off the ground in Europe. First, European companies have not the same access to information technology (IT) as their US counterparts to enable them to build up data on the performance of their loans or leases. International credit-rating agencies are only willing to give a rating to a mortgage-backed or asset-backed issue if they have several years' worth of data on the assets backing the securities. Mr Veale says that European companies are becoming more conscious of the importance of ratings and have started to compile the necessary information on their loans. However, they are still several years away from being able to securitise these assets. He also notes that the actual volumes of credit card receivables which could be securitised in Europe are not as vast as in the US. For example, credit cards have taken off in Germany only in the past few years. The lack of a domestic market means that any European company or bank wanting to securitise assets would have to tap the market in the US or the UK. But the cost of hedging their currency positions could make the transaction uneconomic. Another drawback to the growth of securitisation in Europe is the lack of regulation on off-balance-sheet financing. In many countries in Europe, virtually no guidelines have been laid down. In the UK, the Accounting Standards Board's financial reporting exposure draft on off-balance-sheet financing is expected to become an accounting standard by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, June 24 (AFP) -- A north Yemeni parliamentary  delegation, seeking support for north Yemen's campaign against  southern secessionists, met here Thursday [23 June] with PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, official sources said.    The Palestine Liberation Organization leader stressed the  need to "continue efforts to reach a just solution that takes  into account the interests of the Yemeni people," the  Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.    The Yemeni delegation, which also met with Tunisian  parliamentary leaders and members of legal opposition groups,  accused Saudi Arabia of supplying arms to southern forces,  according to diplomatic forces.    Civil war erupted in Yemen on May 5 in the midst of a  political dispute between northern and southern leaders on the  administration of the country. The south proclaimed itself a  separate state on May 21.    Southern representatives are also touring north Africa. A  spokesman for the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic earlier  Thursday appealed to the international community to "impose a  ceasefire by force."    The Tunisian government has expressed concern at the  deteriorating situation in Yemen but has not taken sides in the  conflict.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Artists Protest Helms: Artists Charles Sherman and Cheri Gaulke team up today  for a free election-eve performance piece answering the question to Sherman's  controversial billboard campaign, "Who's Burning America?," which points to the  tobacco industry and its support from Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). Helms is in a  close race for re-election with Democrat Harvey Gantt, an architect and former  mayor of Charlotte.  </P> <P> Gaulke portrays Helms in the three-minute piece, which will be performed at 10  a.m. at the front entrance of the County Museum of Art. The performance  concludes when the Helms character torches a painting of the American flag with  an oversized cigarette. A new Sherman billboard, urging a stop to tax subsidies  for the tobacco industry, will then be revealed on the side of a truck at the  museum. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Rover takes export route to expansion: The 1,450 new jobs announced this week reflect a rising market share abroad Rover, the leading UK carmaker, remains uncomfortably dependent on its domestic market, but its exports are rising sharply thanks to an increasing investment in its foreign sales and distribution networks. The announcement earlier this week that it was creating 1,450 new jobs at its UK plants stemmed directly from the steady inroads Rover has been making into foreign car markets, even though its market shares remain unsatisfactory, particularly in Germany. However, its acquisition earlier this year by BMW, the German carmaker, should help overcome the scepticism of the country's car buyers. At the beginning of 1992 the company began a far-reaching restructuring of its sales and marketing operations with the creation of Rover Europe aimed at ending the unhealthy dominance of the business by the UK market. 'Despite what we said Rover was still a UK-dominated company,' said Mr Graham Morris, managing director of Rover Europe. 'The Europeans were always left behind.' Rover - languishing at the time with a share of about 2.5 per cent of the west European market and suffering heavy losses - set itself an initial target of winning a 3 per cent share. In the first nine months of the strategy sales in the whole of west Europe rose 9 per cent to 306,000 to give it a 3.3 per cent market share. It is still to achieve satisfactory earnings, although operating profits are rising strongly after two years of operating losses in 1991 and 1992. Last year operating profits totalled Pounds 56m on a turnover of Pounds 4.3bn. 'We should be making Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m a year with a 5 per cent to 6 per cent return on turnover,' said Mr Morris. 'We must enrich our sales mix and raise margins through the way we sell our cars.' Rover's retail sales in the first nine months worldwide rose 9 per cent to 371,805 from 341,075 a year earlier, with sales in continental Europe increasing 20 per cent, in Japan by 26.6 per cent and in North America by 127 per cent, where they were helped by the launch of the Land Rover Discovery range in the US. In the UK sales increased by only 3.2 per cent - but Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive, is willing to accept a fall in UK market share, as long as this is more than offset by rising exports. Rover's share in the UK fell to 12.4 per cent in the first nine months from 13.2 per cent a year ago. Mr Morris said: 'To establish Rover as a more up-market company in the UK we had to face the reality that that would mean a lower market share.' It is restructuring its UK sales network with a reduction in the number of dealers from 650 at present to 500 by the end of 1996. The continental European dealer network is also undergoing tough surgery. The number - about 1,500 - is unlikely to change significantly, but the make-up of the network is being transformed. 'In France in the last two years we have replaced 40 per cent of our dealerships either with new dealers or with new premises,' said Mr Morris. Rover has established a franchise plan for the whole of Europe covering network size, dealer locations and standards. 'It is the quality of dealers that will change and not the quantity,' said Mr Morris. It is making strong progress in France, Italy and Spain with rising sales and growing market share, but it is in Germany that it faces its stiffest task. 'We will only sell about 13,000 this year in Germany,' said Mr Morris. 'That is an increase of around 20 per cent, but the market share is only 0.4 per cent and that is unacceptable. Our network in Germany is our weakest in the whole of Europe.' It has set an initial target of 2 per cent for its German market share and is now spending heavily on advertising and promotion. Many small importers struggle in the German market against the entrenched domestic producers, but BMW is now actively encouraging its strongest domestic dealers to take on the Rover and Land Rover franchises. Rising sales in continental Europe as well as in important overseas markets such as the US and Japan should take Rover vehicle production well above 500,000 next year. The new jobs announced this week should not be the last.  --------------------------------------------- Rover sales: rising exports  --------------------------------------------- Sales January-September 1994                 Volume   % change    Market                (units)             share (%)  --------------------------------------------- Worldwide      371,805     +9.0         - West Europe    305,877     +9.0       3.3 UK             196,963     +3.1      12.4 France          35,839    +23.0       2.5 Italy           25,848    +29.2       2.1 Spain           16,259    +23.2       2.4 Germany*         7,764    +17.4       0.4 Japan*          11,650    +32.5         - US**             7,531   +131.1         -  --------------------------------------------- * January-August 1994 ** Land Rover only.

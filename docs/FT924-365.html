			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Recession clouds the crystal ball - Philip Coggan talks to leading fund managers and asks them what next year holds in store for the private investor IT HAS been a gloomy year for the UK economy but a reasonably profitable one for stock market investors. As 1993 approaches, investing prospects are clouded by hopes for recovery in the UK and the US, and fears of recession in Europe and Japan. To help private investors make their choices for the New Year, the Weekend FT asked leading fund managers to look into their crystal balls and forecast what would happen to the world's major markets. Michael Hart, joint manager of Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust says: 'I am reasonably hopeful about all the major markets in 1993. German interest rate policy will continue to be the dominating influence. The Bundesbank will probably reduce interest rates later rather than sooner but reductions are inevitable at some stage as the recession deepens in Germany. 'UK rates can probably be safely reduced another notch in the New Year and further falls will be possible later as German rates come down. The UK market should be encouraged by lower interest rates and a good corporate profits outlook based on rationalisation benefits, devaluation and lower financing costs. 'A target of 3000 for the FT-SE 100 Index seems within reach. Continental markets should also respond to easier interest rates with France a prime beneficiary. 'I am positive about Wall Street with a favourable profits outlook and inflation staying low but the largest part of the return in 1993 will probably come from a stronger dollar. 'Although I was proved completely wrong about Japan in 1992, I remain hopeful in the coming year. The market is discounting a great deal of bad news but the government will soon have to increase liquidity and implement the supplementary budget. A 15 per cent rise to the 20,000 level could easily occur.' Recalling the old Chinese proverb, Martin Wooller, fixed income director of Fidelity Investments in London, expects 'interesting times' in 1993. 'Global equity, bonds and foreign exchange markets will continue to diverge widely (and wildly),' he says. 'The cyclical trough has been seen for the US dollar and bonds. The currency will appreciate by at least 10 per cent trade weighted (Dollars 1.30/Pounds by end 1993) and the 30 year bond yield will rise to 8.5 per cent. 'In Europe, the implosion of the German economy will be the driving force for markets. Eventually, even the Bundesbank will ease - but probably not until March/April. When it does the speed and extent of the ease will astound most observers. This will provide the backdrop to an eventual valuation-driven recovery in European equities. 'The UK, struggling to re-ignite its economy, will follow the US approach - cutting short rates to 4 per cent by June, embarking upon competitive depreciation of the pound against the European partners (DM/Pounds at below 2.20) and steepening the yield curve until the long end of the sterling bond market offers outrageous value to the non-resident. Expect long gilts to reach near 10 per cent before they enjoy a brief, but sharp, rally in the latter half of 1993. 'By late 1993, though, markets will be concerned about the government's inability to control either the budget deficit (Pounds 55bn in 1993-94) or its current account deficit (rising towards Pounds 17bn). There is thus the significant risk of a 1976 IMF-style crisis during 1994. 'Finally, in Japan, recovery will come eventually - but probably not until the second half of 1993 as a second reflationary package, involving direct tax cuts is introduced. 'World growth in 1993 is likely to be anaemic', believes David Rosier, chairman of Mercury Fund Managers. 'Currencies will continue to have a significant impact on the relative performance of equity and bond markets. We expect the US dollar to strengthen further against sterling. 'In the UK, the debt burden, the depressed housing market and rising unemployment will restrain consumer confidence, leading only to a gentle economic recovery. However, the equity market should make reasonable progress as we now have a realistic exchange rate and lower interest rates, which will help corporate profits to recover. 'Given our view that corporate growth will be uneven and patchy, we believe that it is too early to overweight the highly cyclical recovery stocks and we therefore continue to emphasise growth stocks. The market is not outstandingly cheap for this point in the economic cycle but the rating is sustainable given that we are emerging from recession, inflation is under control and the real dividend yield is attractive. 'We expect that interest rates in Germany will decline in 1993, allowing rates in other major European markets to do likewise. As a result, we believe that the prospects for continental European markets are exciting, with the exception of Germany, where the economy will continue to slow. 'The US market seems now to be discounting much of the anticipated stimulus from Clinton's new administration but encouraging economic trends point to an acceleration in economic growth in 1993. We expect the best performance to come from the small and medium-sized companies. Japan remains expensive and risky with little recovery expected from the current recession. In the Pacific region, growth will remain strong but the progress of markets is likely to be volatile and influenced by political factors. 'As in 1992, sluggish economic growth worldwide and low inflation should also allow bonds to perform well, especially in Europe, given the outlook for interest rates and we believe that there is unlikely to be a wide divergence between the performance of bonds and equities. In an environment of falling interest rates, cash is our least favoured asset.' Alistair Haddow, investment director of Murray Johnstone Unit Trust Management, says: 'We expect 1993 will be a year of low, but almost non-inflationary, economic growth, suggesting a generally favourable background for equities as well as bonds. However, with the major economic blocs at different stages of the cycle, next year could be a story of two halves. 'Although the UK and US stock markets have been pushing into new high ground, it is in these areas that most of the corporate pain of restructuring and cost reduction have already occurred and the potential for a recovery in profits is therefore greatest. We would stay with these markets but at some point, possibly mid year, the good news will be fully in the price. Smaller companies may well keep running, as investors seek out undervalued situations. 'Also at about mid-year, the bad economic and corporate news currently unfolding in Japan and Europe will cease to shock and these markets will pick up, not in an expected profits recovery but in falling interest rates. From a UK perspective, the home market will be hard to beat over the full year.' 'Global growth prospects are not synchronised,' argues Paul Manduca, who is shortly to become deputy chief executive of the merged Henderson/Touche Remnant group. 'While the US is now emerging from recession and should show growth of 2 per cent during 1993, and the UK economy looks about to recover, the Japanese economy will remain severely depressed during 1993 and is likely to show zero growth. In addition, mainland Europe is on the point of entering recession. 'This picture suggests that world inflation is likely to stay low in 1993 and that commodity prices generally will remain soft. Although budget deficits are rising throughout the OECD for both cyclical and policy reasons, private savings rates are also rising while investment, except in the US, will remain further. This suggests that world interest rates will decline a bit more in 1993. Against this background, selective investment in bond markets could prove rewarding. 'Currencies are likely to reflect these economic cycles. The dollar should be strong while the yen and DM blocks weaken. Sterling looks undervalued against the DM but not against the dollar. The crucial test for sterling will come when the underlying inflation rate breaches the chancellor's current target, possibly in late 1993. Provided interest rates are raised at that point, sterling should finish the year strongly. 'As far as share prices are concerned, the US market looks fairly fully valued, although sterling investors may gain from dollar strength. The UK market should have a good year as economic recovery takes hold and profit prospects improve, particularly in the smaller companies sector. We remain nervous about the Japanese market, although prospects may look better later in the year. European stock markets hinge on lower German interest rates and on this basis, we expect good returns from France and Germany by year end. Finally, for high risk investors, we like Hong Kong and Australia, but would avoid Italy.' 'Next year should see the start of a slow but sustainable recovery in the UK economy, with low levels of inflation,' believes Dick Barfield, chief investment manager of Standard Life. 'There are many similarities with the recovery in the early 1980s, but one major difference. The amount of debt which was built up in the late 1980s will dissuade people and companies from borrowing much more for some time. 'The cost reductions which companies have undertaken, together with some improvement in demand for their products and the lower level of sterling, will cause company profits to jump by around 20 per cent in 1993. This, together with the low level of inflation, should enable UK equities to produce a return in excess of cash. Gilts should also show a good real return.' 'Equity market returns should also be positive outside the UK. The recovery in the US economy should continue. The US equity market is anticipating this so returns will be low, but should be helped, for a UK holder, a strong dollar. 'Japan is still suffering from its over-indulgence in the late 1980s when too much money was lent and property prices went through the roof. Inflation is very low there and interest rates should fall further in 1993. The equity market is unlikely to move up until there are signs of economic recovery, which may not be until later in 1993.' 'Germany is suffering from the costs of absorbing the East and its economy is weakening quite sharply. Interest rates should continue to fall but probably not very quickly. This will limit the opportunities for growth in Europe outside Germany and will probably continue to cause pressures in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. European equities might perform better late in the year, once policy in Germany becomes clearer.' 'Overall, we are optimistic about the returns which can be achieved in financial markets. Longer term returns will be lower than in the 1980s, but should be higher than inflation.' Peter Smith, managing director of AXA Equity &amp; Law Investment Managers, says: 'Strength in the US economy will be essential to the well-being of all other major markets during 1993. Although now trading close to record levels, with equities largely fully priced, the US market will respond positively to the emerging recovery under President Clinton. 'In the UK, corporate profits will benefit from the combination of low interest rates, stable inflation, currency devaluation and improved productivity. Coupled with better consumer sentiment, this should provide a powerful kick to the economy and hence to the equity market. 'Continental European investors will enter 1993 faced with numerous uncertainties. Although tentative signs of monetary easing are detectable, fiscal policy is still restrictive. The outlook for the ERM will continue to cause volatility in currencies and thus in markets, until the Germans show signs of reducing interest rates. We favour companies with an exposure to the US economy. 'The outlook for Japanese equities remains difficult. Slow economic growth will prevent a recovery in corporate profits. Given the high valuation of the market, the upside on the Nikkei 225 index appears limited to 19,000, but official support may prevent a fall below 14,000. Finally, someone who is not a fund manager but who has featured regularly on these pages as a pessimist about equities. David Kauders, a Taunton-based investment consultant, says 'equity markets perceived the policy changes of 1992 as miracle cures. 1993 may be the year that the miracles run out of steam. 'This recession is changing form; the squeeze hurts governments, which will be less willing to bail out ever-growing social needs. Financial institutions will also have less activity all around, and the combined effect must drain equity enthusiasm. 'US Treasury bonds continue to be the only market where the odds favour sterling investors. I see Dollars 1.50 as a pausing point on the way to purchasing power parity at Dollars 1. Gilts remain a hold, but otherwise most investments are too risky. My advice is stand aside and let others make the mistakes.'</p>

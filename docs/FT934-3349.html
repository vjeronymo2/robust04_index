			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / People: Wool Board's fresh head The British Wool Marketing Board has appointed Ian Hartley to take over as managing director when Maurice Grass retires in January. Hartley takes over at a crucial time for the wool board; this year British farmers lost government subisidies provided for wool production  - and at a time of depressed world prices. Hartley has been deputy managing director of the wool board since 1991 after joining it in 1986 as commercial director of wool growers. The wool board handles all British fleece wool - around 50m kg a year - worth Pounds 35m.</p>

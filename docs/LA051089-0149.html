			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUDGE ACQUITS TAYLOR IN DRUNK DRIVING CASE  </P> <P> New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor was acquitted today of drunk driving  charges stemming from a March arrest.  </P> <P> "The justice system works, and I'm happy for myself," the eight-time All-Pro  said as he emerged from the courtroom of Municipal Judge John Conte.  </P> <P> Conte found Taylor innocent based on testimony from two doctors, who said they  found that the NFL star suffered from food poisoning the night he was arrested.  </P> <P> Authorities alleged that Taylor was found sleeping at 3:30 a.m. March 24 behind  the wheel of his Jeep, which was parked on the shoulder of the Garden State  Parkway. He was charged with drunk driving despite his blood alcohol level  reading being .09%, below the .10% level considered legally drunk in New  Jersey.  </P> <P> Dr. Alan Lupinacci of West Paterson, one of two internists called as expert  witnesses by Taylor's attorney, said the NFL star suffered from acute food  poisoning, which caused him to vomit.  </P> <P> He theorized that Taylor became sick from an organism contained in poorly  prepared fettuccine Alfredo eaten on a flight from Atlanta to Newark the day  before his arrest.  </P> <P> "It is medically known that this type of organism is found in cream sauces and  can make a person present those symptoms," Lupinacci said.  </P> <P> Earlier, Taylor's attorney attempted to show that the arresting officer took  the football star into custody based on assumptions made from previous arrests  and not from the evidence obtained from Breathalyzer tests.  </P> <P> Trooper Robert Pohida, who arrested Taylor, said he was surprised that the  football star's breath test showed Taylor's blood alcohol level to be only  .09%.  </P> <P> "You expected the reading to be a lot higher?" asked James Acheson, Taylor's  attorney.  </P> <P> "That is correct," Pohida replied.  </P> <P> The trooper said Taylor could not perform simple coordination tasks that are  routinely administered to motorists who are suspected of driving while  intoxicated. Some of the tests included reciting the alphabet and touching his  index finger to his nose.  </P> <P> Based upon the alcohol reading and the dexterity problems, the trooper  suspected that Taylor may have been abusing drugs and ordered a urinalysis,  Pohida said.  </P> <P> Taylor has undergone drug rehabilitation twice in the last three years.  </P> <P> If convicted on the drunk driving charge, Taylor could have faced a fine and a  loss of his driving privileges.  </P></p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Limit on sea days will be suspended The government is to suspend the implementation of restrictions in the number of days fishermen can spend at sea pending a ruling by the European Court, Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, announced yesterday. Earlier this month the High Court referred to the European Court a government proposal to restrict the number of days that fishing vessels can spend at sea to 1991 levels. The restriction was aimed at conserving fishing stocks. The ruling came after a legal challenge by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which represents 6,000 fishermen in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

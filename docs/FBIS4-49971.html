			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Li Chi-kuang (2621 1323 0342)] </F>   [Text] On the morning of 20 April Yin Tsung-wen, director  of the National Security Bureau, gave a report to the National  Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan saying more than 3,000  mainland stowaways have gone into hiding in Taiwan. The  National Police Administration will handle these cases by  relying on letters of accusation and reports made by people, and  by offering rewards to informants; the Investigation Bureau will  be in charge of investigating the illegal entry of groups of  people from the mainland.    Yin Tsung-wen stated: From 1987 to March of this year,  public security and intelligence agencies discovered a total of  more than 28,300 mainlanders who entered Taiwan illegally, of  which 26,324 have been repatriated back to the mainland. About  60 percent of those were discovered inside Taiwan, and 40  percent were caught at sea or when they tried to make shore.  This shows the massive efforts taken by the National Security  Bureau are quite effective.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Hard labour in Bridgend to get people into jobs: Staff at a south Wales Jobcentre assure Lisa Wood that the figures are not being fiddled  - it is their efforts that are producing results UNEMPLOYMENT is falling and it is not as a result of the figures being fiddled, says Jobcentre manager Mrs Fay Evans. Mrs Evans, who works in Bridgend, south Wales, says hard work by her staff is helping to get more people into jobs. 'We are not fiddling any figures,' she says. 'We are doing our job better.' The Jobcentre and its sister organisation the Unemployment Benefits Office - where unemployed people sign on - must meet strict national targets. At local level they replicate the targets agreed between the Employment Service - which runs Jobcentres and Unemployment Benefit Offices - and the government. The targets, which have become more ambitious in the past two years, include placing 1.47m people into jobs this year, of which 27 per cent must be long-term unemployed. Staff must also weed out benefit fraud and check that people are entitled to unemployment benefit. Nationally, the government wants the Employment Service to refuse 9 per cent of applications. Bridgend Jobcentre recommends that the benefits of a small number of people be suspended because these individuals are not prepared to consider jobs which do not pay enough. Mrs Evans says: 'Ministers are very keen that we apply the rules, such as whether people are actively seeking work. That can include widening job searches and lowering expectations.' Last year Bridgend met some of its targets. This year some are tougher, which concerns Mrs Evans because her performance will be partly judged on meeting them. Her area manager, Mr Dewi Miles, will be one of her assessors. Mr Miles, however, says it would be over-simplistic if staff recommended particular actions, such as suspending benefit, because there was a financial incentive. 'We do not show people the door because we are afraid that bonuses may be withheld,' says Mr Miles. 'A manager is judged on the ability to do a whole job effectively.' Performance pay is awarded on overall performance. But failure to achieve one of a number of objectives would not necessarily affect performance pay. Mrs Evans says there are several reasons why unemployment has fallen in Bridgend. 'There are lots of reasons for the trend, such as companies in our area not laying people off any more and a few, very cautiously, recruiting again.' But she adds that her Jobcentre and the nearby Unemployment Benefit Office play an important part. She gives other reasons for the improved outlook for jobs in Bridgend. Her centre now attracts more vacancies from local employers than in the past. It also matches local unemployed people more quickly into jobs, particularly those aged 18 to 24 for whom it has a drop-in counselling service. Last year the centre aimed to place 570 long-term unemployed adults in work. It exceeded the target and this year the aim is 787 placements. So how are Employment Service staff more effectively removing people from the unemployment total and into jobs or training? Structural changes: Jobcentres and Unemployment Benefit Offices are moving to single sites, which helps staff direct those signing on to work opportunities. Policy shifts: Until recently Jobcentres were discouraged from actively seeking vacancies from employers because this brought them into competition with private job agencies. They are now allowed to do this, although ministers are reluctant to let them advertise their services for the recruitment of unemployed executives and professionals. Mrs Evans says she had received no complaints from local private agencies, and had directed some unemployed people in their direction. Jobcentres, which offer free services, can also arrange tailor-made training for businesses coming into an area, and draw up short lists of suitable applicants for employers. Changes in the law: Legislation introduced in 1989 requires the unemployed to be 'actively seeking' work. After 13 weeks an unemployed person can be called into a Jobcentre and asked to consider other types of job. Improved staff recruitment and training: Staff used to be recruited on academic ability. They are now taken on for their competence to do the job, including good communication skills.</p>

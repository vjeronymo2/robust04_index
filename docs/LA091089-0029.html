			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid fired Prime Minister Kasdi Merbah, but  Merbah refused to step down, declaring the move unconstitutional. Merbah, who  has been in office 10 months, announced his decision hours after Bendjedid  dismissed him and asked a top aide, Mouloud Hamrouche, to assume the post and  form a new Cabinet. Merbah had been charged with implementing sweeping reforms  designed to transform Algeria from a one-party socialist state into a  multi-party democracy. A political source said Bendjedid was frustrated at the  slow pace of the implementation of political and economic reforms launched  after rioting swept the country last October.  </P></p>

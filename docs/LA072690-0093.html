			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDS OKD FOR FLYERS ON AMNESTY PROGRAM  </P> <P> The Culver City Council voted 4 to 1 this week to spend almost $26,000 to print  and mail 33,000 flyers announcing an amnesty program for Zoning and Building  Code violators.  </P> <P> Owners of properties with illegal structures, room additions and garage  conversions will be given until Nov. 13 to report their violations and qualify  for amnesty, according to the flyer.  </P> <P> Under the amnesty program, they will be exempt from fines and penalties and  will not be required to correct the violations until the property is sold and  title transferred.  </P> <P> Health and Safety Code violations, however, although exempt from fines and  penalties under the amnesty program, must be brought up to code immediately.  </P> <P> Building and zoning violators who do not file for amnesty and are later caught  will be given six months to a year to bring their property into compliance with  the law, according to the pamphlet.  </P> <P> Councilman Jim Boulgarides, who favors stricter enforcement of the codes, voted  against the measure at the council's Monday night meeting.  </P> <P> The council in February approved a program to crackdown on "bootleg" apartments  and other illegal conversions, which city officials said are causing traffic  problems in residential neighborhoods and benefiting from city services without  paying taxes.  </P> <P> The council adopted the present amnesty program in May after homeowners  complained that the crackdown would penalize them for violations they did not  know about when they bought the property.  </P> <P> Residents with questions about potential violations can call (213) 280-5944.  Complaints will be kept confidential and anonymity will be respected for  callers inquiring about their own properties, according to the flyer.  </P> <P> The funds approved Monday also include about $8,000 to buy advertisements  announcing the amnesty program in local newspapers.  </P></p>

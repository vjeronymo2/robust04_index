			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Mazhar 'Arif Article: "The Security Council, a Game of </F> Nations!"]    [Text] What took place in the UN Security Council over Iraq  was, in my personal opinion, a game of nations: Two states  against three, and all of them permanent members. Yet, the  blockade was extended with the approval of all five on the  pretext of routine extension, and the dissemination of a good  measure of hope that the position would completely change in  favor of lifting the blockade after two months; that is, during  the next Council session in May. The proof was that the  traditional chairman's statement on the extension, which is  normally released every two months by the Council, was not  issued this time because of what they termed a "split" between  the permanent member states over the draft of that statement.  It is really unfortunate, in my opinion also, that our papers  have been carried away by this game of nations and have entered  into some kind of race between them to break the good tidings to  the citizen about an impending breakthrough in our tribulation,  while what was required, according to the science of politics --  and this is another aspect of the whole issue -- was that we  should not have tampered with the citizen's sentiments and  thoughts by relying on certain situations that developed here  and there connected with the motives and calculations of all  these sides in the Security Council.    The sides in the game of nations have reduced the issue of  the criminal blockade on Iraq, in which all the permanent  members and other world nations have taken part, into a mere  statement. On this basis, a Don Quixote-like battle has taken  place in which wooden swords were used, and here lies the  theatrical.    Those who opposed the draft of the chairman's statement and  insisted on including references to Iraq's cooperation with the  world organization, but could not do so due to the opposition of  the United States, Britain and Argentina, should have lifted the  blockade themselves or transformed the Council session into an  occasion for a general debate on the sanctions, which have been  imposed on our country, with the view to removing them or using  the veto against any U.S. endeavor to prolong the blockade --  which is what I referred to in my article last Saturday -- in  order to affirm the credibility of their new conviction,  interpret their words into actual deeds, but above all, affirm  something which is even more important; namely, their freedom to  determine their own foreign policy and to make decisions  according to national and international interests, not as they  are required to do by others now or at any other time.    In order not to deceive our people -- and this is a matter  that concerns us in the press and the other news media -- we  must convey to them the full picture about any situation. In  the case of the last UN Security Council session, we should not  have relied on ready-made analyses or answers concerning the  positions taken by the permanent member states of the Security  Council and other members in the Council. When we explain to  the people what happened by saying that this means the beginning  of a split between the big powers because some of them -- and  this is the prevalent talk now in political writings -- have  began to realize the danger of being continuously dragged behind  U.S. policy, and to clearly see their interests with Iraq, for  instance, which are long and historical interests, we should  also tell the reader that what took place in the Security  Council was a political exercise by some people for different  reasons that concern only them. Each state that spoke about the  positive points in the Iraqi position did so with the aim of  bargaining with the Americans over certain national and other  issues by using Iraq this time.    Therefore, as far as I am concerned, what took place in the  Security Council does not deserve the importance it was given by  our press or the foreign press. What took place was an attempt  to calm Iraq, reduce world public pressure to lift the blockade  on Iraq, and to busy everyone at least for the present time with  the game of the division within the Council without disturbing  or annoying the United States.    In the final analysis, this is a gain for the United States  and not really for Iraq. True, what took place -- and  regardless of the opinions expressed in this article -- was a  positive development in the positions of Russia and France in  particular, since China is known to have expressed its  reservations on every resolution adopted against Iraq right from  the beginning, we must not exaggerate that development, unless  it develops into a definite new relationship with Iraq, outside  U.S. trusteeship, as of now and without waiting for the next  Security Council session in May.</p>

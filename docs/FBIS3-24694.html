Police surrounded the court and held supporters of the outlawed  United Front for Djibouti Opposition (FUOD) as the four party  leaders were questioned by a judge.    The four, Mohamed Ahmed Issa, Galal Abdourahman, Kamil Ali  Mohamed, and Mahdi Ibrahim Goud, were detained in custody ahead  of a decision on their trial.    Legal proceedings were launched against the four after a  petition calling for the armed fight in Djibouti to be stepped  up was released during the second FUOD conference in Addis Ababa  on January 23.</p>

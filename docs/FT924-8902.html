			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Confidence low in east Midlands BUSINESS leaders in the east Midlands have given up hope of any improvement in trading conditions over the next six months, a survey of more than 900 businesses has found. The survey by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and Nottingham Business School shows that only nine per cent of the businesses predict an immediate improvement in business conditions. Indeed, 59 per cent of companies believe they have not yet experienced the worst of the recession. The study, published today, finds the faltering confidence of the business community is set against a background of falling profitability, persistent reductions in employment and uncertainty about future exchange-rate policy. The survey shows that a reduction in interest rates is the main priority for more than 80 per cent of the business leaders canvassed. This concern is echoed in the attitude towards the withdrawal of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism in September. More than 70 per cent feel that the withdrawal will be beneficial for their business because they believe it clears the way for cuts in interest rates. But there are divisions over the future management of sterling. Although 34 per cent favour a return to the exchange rate mechanism at some time, six per cent want a return at the earliest opportunity and 38 per cent would prefer a floating currency with interest rates at between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. The value of sterling does not appear to be a matter of great concern, with only 20 per cent of the sample favouring a lower exchange rate. There is much greater anxiety about the future of the housing market, where 46 per cent believe a revival is a prerequisite for recovery. East Midlands Business Survey, Autumn 1992.

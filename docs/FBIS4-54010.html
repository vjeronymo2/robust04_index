			<p>BFN     [Text] Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], met with Koichi Kato [former  chief cabinet secretary), representative of the "New Century  Group," a suprafaction action group for new policies in the LDP,  and others at a Tokyo restaurant in the evening of 18 May.  During the meeting, Mr. Mori said: "If the people ask the LDP  to forge an alliance with the opposition Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] after the Hata cabinet resigns en masse, the LDP  would be willing to do so. The LDP also intends to forge an  alliance with Sakigake [Harbinger Party]." In this way, Mr.  Mori indicated that the LDP will examine the possibility of  forging a coalition with the SDPJ and Sakigake after it submits  a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet to the Diet.</p>

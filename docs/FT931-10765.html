			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Govett American net assets up to 137.9p Govett American Smaller Companies Trust, formed from the reconstruction last year of Govett Atlantic, had a net asset value per share at December 31 of 137.9p against 100p when it commenced business on May 28. The fund aims to achieve capital gains through investment in North American smaller companies. Revenue after tax for the period totalled Pounds 24,000. Earnings per share amounted to 0.1p and, and as foreshadowed in the listing particulars, no interim dividend has been declared. The directors said it was too early to forecast whether it would be able to recommend a modest year end dividend.</p>

Provincial Party Secretary Yin  Kesheng attended and addressed the meeting, saying: The  instructions from the Central Commission on Politics and Law are  important guidance for the province's work in maintaining social  stability. These instructions give expression to the party  Central Committee and State Council's care and concern for the  people of Qinghai, and we should take effective meassures to  implement them.    Yin Kesheng pointed out: The most important point in  implementing the instructions from the Central Commission on  Politics and Law is to unify our thinking and improve our  understanding. The crucial point is to unify the ideas of party  leaders at all levels and to improve their understanding. In  this way, we will be able to maintain unanimity in action and  make achievements in our work. He said: We should fully  confirm our achievements in maintaining social stability since  the beginning of last year, coolly analyze the present  situation, and always remain sober-minded. For this reason, we  should do two types of work simultaneously and lay equal stress  on both. [passage omitted]    Yin Keshing continued: In maintaining social stability, we  should abide by the mass line, and should firmly trust the  masses and rely on them. He added: Whether or not a leading  comrade does solid work is an important criterion by which to  judge his sense of responsibility and his leadership ability.  [passage omitted]    There is a need to encourage people to do their work  creatively; to strengthen supervision over work; to work with  one heart; and to do a better job in maintaining social  stability, in expediting reform and opening up, in speeding up  economic development, and in promoting Qinghai's economic  construction to a new level.</p>

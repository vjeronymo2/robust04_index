			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / 250,000 jobless 'are black or Asian' NEARLY 250,000 of Britain's unemployed are black or Asian, according to figures released yesterday by the GMB, the general union. It said blacks and Asians are more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white people. One in four black workers have no job and just under one in every five Asians are unemployed. Based on figures from the April 1991 census and updated to take into account the rise in unemployment over the past 23 months, the survey said the worst area for Asian unemployment is the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, with as many as 45 per cent jobless. Liverpool has the highest proportion of black people without work, amounting to 38 per cent of the black labour force in the city. At its first national race conference yesterday, the GMB called on the Home Office not to go ahead with cutting grant funding to local authorities to help ethnic minority pro-jects. Meanwhile, a radical dilution of the definition of 'full employment' to mean that nobody should be unemployed for more than one year has been suggested by the influential Employment Policy Institute. The Institute, usually regarded as left-of-centre, yesterday launched a 'full employment year' designed to foster a wide-ranging national debate on how to solve mass unemployment. But Professor Richard Layard, one of Britain's best known experts on unemployment and a leading member of the institute, stressed that a new definition of full employment was required concentrating on combat-ing long-term unemployment. On present figures that could mean a state of 'full employment' with 2m people unemployed for periods of up to 12 months. He said: 'Some short-term unemployment is necessary to control inflation'. He also stressed the cost of unemployment to those in jobs and estimated that every tax-payer is now paying an average of Pounds 1,000 a year. Prof Layard has stressed that the cost of benefit and lost taxes through unemployment is Pounds 30bn a year. Those out of work for more than one year alone cost Pounds 8bn. Many unemployed executives and other professionals will not find conventional jobs again and should be encouraged to become 'self-employed portfolio workers' with two or three part-time jobs, according to Full Employment UK. The lobby group says that in spite of the recent reductions in self-employment it remains a vital source of future employment and should be promoted in next week's Budget through training credits of Pounds 250 to help portfolio workers get established. Full Employment UK says that 200,000 people could be helped in this way at a cost of Pounds 50m.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANDRESS TO RETURN AS CLEVELAND FOOTBALL COACH  </P> <P> Steve Landress has ironed out differences with Cleveland High administrators  and will return for his fifth season as the Cavaliers' football coach.  </P> <P> Landress told school administrators last fall that he would quit at the  conclusion of the season. But he reconsidered after the season.  </P> <P> "I was really frustrated during the season and I did quit," Landress said about  a decision he had kept private. "But I thought things over and I decided I  wanted to come back."  </P> <P> Principal Ida Windham agreed to take Landress back after a meeting Friday.  Landress had requested the addition of on-campus coaches to the program, a  condition satisfied when Lee Holden and Keith Wieser were promoted from the B  team to the varsity.  </P> <P> Landress, who co-coached Manual Arts to City Section 3-A Division titles in  1983 and 1984 with Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman, led Cleveland in '88 to a 5-5  record and a berth in the 4-A playoffs.

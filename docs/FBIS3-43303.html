			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Defections Healthy in New Political Era -- The defection to  the National Party, NP, of three African National Congress, ANC,  military wing members -- "described as 'commanders' in some  reports but whose status is downplayed by Umkhonto [Spear of the  Nation; ANC military wing -- MK) Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda  -- is neither surprising nor unwelcome," declares a page 8  editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 4 January. The  "enfranchisement of millions of black voters and the imminent  birth of a new political era has introduced a fluidity into  South African politics." THE STAR finds this "reshuffling"  healthy since it "breaks up the old racial ties and introduces  new loyalties based on shared philosophies and interests. MK,  the welfare of whose members has been neglected by the ANC, is  no more immune to these shifts than the NP, the IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] or the DP [Democratic Party]."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Criticism of Police Formalities on Killers Hiding in  Transkei  -- "Transkei military leader Bantu Holomisa has made the correct  response to suggestions that terrorist suspects are sheltering  in his territory," begins a page 6 editorial in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 4 January. Holomisa has told police  he will cooperate if they want to extradite anyone. All they  have to do is follow the "appropriate procedures". "It was  suggested at the weekend that police knew the identities of the  killers in the St James' Church massacre and other Cape attacks,  but they could do nothing because the suspects were hiding in  Transkei. The claims have now become less emphatic, and the  police say they need to establish names and addresses of the  suspects before they can start extradition proceedings. Really?  Surely such formalities can be overcome in pursuit of dangerous  killers now that Transkei will be rejoining South Africa in a  parliamentary democracy in a few months' time."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   KwaZulu Government `No Right' To Buy Luxury Jet -- "The  kwaZulu government would probably emerge looking better if it  conceded that it bought the R(rand) 33 million luxury jet  without serious thought about the implications," begins a page 6  editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 4 January. "For  one, the ownership of the plane was transferred when the kwaZulu  government had only a few months of life left. From April 27 it  ceases to exist." "KwaZulu has no right to take decisions for  the new Natal regional government."</p>

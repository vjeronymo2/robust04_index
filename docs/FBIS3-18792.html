			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by John Biffen: "Nothing To Lose in Europe"] </F>   [Text] Douglas Hurd has collected a small team of  relatively anonymous middle-ranking politicians and apparatchiks  to mastermind the forthcoming European elections. I have heard  few senior politicians complain that they have been excluded  from this inner council. This electoral contest is a thankless  challenge, fraught with risk.    The European election for British members of the Strasbourg  Parliament will be fought on three broad issues. First, there  will be a powerful media element determined to convert the  occasion into a personal trial of strength for John Major. His  qualities will not become a doorstep issue, but bad results will  be used by his media opponents to persuade those at Westminster  whose loyalty is brittle that a change of leader is essential.  The pundits will argue that heavy Tory losses provide the last  available pretext for change ahead of the autumn double of a  party conference and a new parliamentary session. In my view, a  change is highly improbable, but Mr Hurd dare not discount it.    Secondly, the Opposition will try to turn the European  contest into a nationwide by-election. That is what European  elections have been in the past. In current circumstances, this  could be devastating for the Government. At the last European  elections, Labour led the Conservatives by 40 percent to 35  percent. The current poll rating gives comparable figures of  around 50 per cent and 25-30 percent, indicating a swing to  Labour of nearly 10 percent. Furthermore, the Liberal Democrats  are now poised to do significantly better than in their  freakishly bad showing four years ago, when they were eclipsed  by the momentary splendour of the Greens.    The Opposition is determined to convert the forthcoming  Strasbourg elections into a national by-election for three  reasons. Such a strategy would concentrate the debate on  domestic economic and welfare issues, which give the Tories such  a miserable poll rating. Second it would demonstrate the  ability of the Liberal Democrats to gather tactical Labour votes  and to storm hitherto safe Conservative seats. Furthermore, it  would excuse the Opposition from having to argue their own  ill-formulated European policy. Douglas Hurd needs no guidance  on the implications of this.    Finally there is the option of emphasising the European  character of the election, and, as far as possible, wrenching it  from the national mould. This seems to be the obvious Tory  tactic. Even so, I suspect that some of Mr Hurd's associates  would argue for a low-key European campaign, since this would  minimise the risk of exposing Tory divisions.    This "hold your nose and think of Europe" approach should be  disregarded. It will take a monumental effort to introduce  European Union issues into the June election, but domestic Tory  interests, and wider considerations, require a high-profile  campaign. This means, in the first instance, that the European  election should be only incidentally about the Strasbourg  Parliament. Its activities, powers and procedures are  unfamiliar. The Tory link with the declining European People's  Party, agreed by Margaret Thatcher, is best left to history.  There are wider European issues to put to the British public,  and they cover not only British government policies agreed  through the Council of Ministers, but also our prospective  attitudes to the Maastricht renegotiation scheduled for 1996.    The June election will be an excellent opportunity for the  Government to look ahead and share its vision. A broader  European campaign could proceed under the terms set out by John  Major in The Economist last September. He then emphasised the  need to look afresh at how the European Union is developing:  "...it is time to look afresh at the Community and consider the  way ahead. Time to put away the old slogans, dreams and  prejudice."    At the centre of the changing Union is its enlargement --  almost certain -- from 12 to 16 members and probably upwards of  20 thereafter. Enlargement may imply tighter monetary controls  and Commission power, as Jacques Delors would argue, or it may  result in a looser form of Union foreseen by the terms  negotiated for Britain at Maastricht, with "opt-outs" in respect  of the social chapter and monetary union.    There is also public interest in how subsidiarity can be  used  to reduce the burden of the common agricultural policy. People  want to know how the burgeoning bureaucracy of the Union can be  reduced, and how Britain's freedom from the social chapter can  be maintained.    There is the opportunity for the Government to gamble on a  high-profile European election, which involves setting out its  post-Maastricht negotiating stall. Of course it involves the  risk of an open argument about opinions honestly held, but then  what are elections about? With a dismal poll rating, the Tories  can afford the risk of offering the politics of choice and not  those of passing domestic discontent.</p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Former head of tied agent sues Lautro for Pounds 6m The self-regulating body for the insurance industry is being sued for Pounds 6m by the former head of a now defunct investment company on the basis that its actions unfairly forced the company out of business. Mr Victor Tee, former majority owner of the Winchester Group, has issued a High Court writ alleging negligence and fraudulent misrepresentation against Lautro, the insurance watchdog whose operations are being taken over by the Personal Investment Authority. Mr Tee's action is one of the most serious legal challenges faced by Lautro, which in recent years has taken an increasingly tough line on insurance companies judged to be failing to comply with regulations to protect investors. The case is one of several hundred legal tussles involving former insurance salesmen and either their former companies or the regulatory authorities. Many of these cases stem from the large shakeout in the insurance industry over the past four years, during which about 100,000 sales agents have lost their jobs. The sackings have often been accompanied by disputes over money. Assuming that Mr Tee's case reaches trial, it will explore the degree to which Lautro's efforts to ensure consumers do not suffer from mis-selling may conflict with the requirement also to deal fairly and law-fully with affiliated companies. Lautro said it would vigorously defend itself against the writ. It would not comment further. Mr Tee is seeking compensation to cover loss of income and general damages arising from Lautro's actions which he contends conflicted with natural justice. The writ stems from an investigation in 1990 by Lautro into Winchester's selling activities. After finding evidence of breaches of its rules, Lautro served an 'intervention notice' in October 1990 that effectively stopped the Hampshire-based company from trading. Until the time of the notice, Winchester had been a 'tied agent' for Norwich Union, the insurance company, selling investment products on its behalf. After the notice, Norwich Union severed its connections with Winchester. At the time of the notice Winchester had a staff of 80 people with five branch offices. Since 1990 Mr Tee has fought a prolonged legal battle to challenge the Lautro ruling through a series of High Court and Court of Appeal hearings. Should Mr Tee be successful in gaining damages, the costs would fall on the members of the PIA, which is scheduled to complete its takeover of Lautro's operations by October. The members include insurance companies, banks and independent financial advisers.</p>

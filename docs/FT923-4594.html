			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Markets: 'Ugly' job figures spread gloom all over - Wall Street JUST WHEN they thought it could not get any worse, it did. Yesterday's employment report for August stunned everyone. Those affected included President Bush, for whom the figures were very bad news indeed; the Federal Reserve, which had hoped it could get through the year without another interest rate cut; and Wall Street, which had been anticipating some rare good tidings on jobs all week. The August employment numbers were described by one analyst as 'ugly.' Non-farm payrolls, which had been expected to rise by between 150,000 and 200,000, actually fell 83,000. Even that decline did not tell the whole story. The figures would have been worse had it not been for a federally-funded summer jobs programme which boosted payrolls temporarily by 100,000. A closer look provided even more gloom. Employment in manufacturing industry fell by 97,000 and the number of jobs in the goods-producing sector by 108,000, an indication that industrial production went into sharp decline in August. There was no comfort to be gained from the modest fall in the civilian unemployment rate, which dipped from 7.7 per cent to 7.6 per cent last month. Analysts said the decline was due to more people being discouraged about their employment chances and, therefore, not looking actively for work. Anyone who stops looking for work comes off the unemployment register immediately. So, how did the markets react? The bad news delighted fixed-income investors, as it always does. The benchmark 30-year government bond jumped more than a point yesterday morning, pushing the yield down to 7.26 per cent. There was an equally sharp fall in short-term yields. Shares showed little initial reaction, due partly to many stock market traders having taken the day off to extend the long Labor Day weekend. In the event, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded only a few points lower during the morning session, a muted response which probably disguised a tug-of-war between two opposing forces: renewed pessimism about the outlook for the economy, but fresh optimism about the the chances for another cut in interest rates. Any optimism about interest rate cuts was tempered, however, by the reaction of the foreign exchange markets. The dollar dropped more than two pfennigs to below DM1.40 as currency dealers anticipated that the Fed would respond to the jobs situation by easing policy, widening further the already large gap between US and German interest rates. But Wall Street was not convinced entirely that interest rates would fall. After the jobs data was released at 8.30am, many analysts predicted the Fed would ease - by lowering the discount rate and the federal funds rate (what banks charge each other for overnight loans) - by a full 50 basis points before the stock market began trading at 9.30. When that deadline passed without action, speculation intensified that the monetary authorities were holding their fire for fear of sending the dollar into free-fall. The consensus on Wall Street, however, remained that the Fed would cut rates again, despite the vulnerable dollar, because of political pressures. Almost as soon as the jobs data had been released, the Bush administration stressed yet again that the economy, not the dollar, should be the primary focus of monetary policy. The White House position is that a weak dollar is not necessarily a bad thing because it boosts export sales by lowering the cost of US goods to overseas buyers. In the end, the Fed did ease policy late yesterday morning by adding reserves to the banking system to lower the federal funds rate from its present target of 3 1/4 per cent to 3 per cent. Lowering the funds rate by a quarter of a point was regarded as the least the Fed could do without triggering a collapse in the dollar. Although the Fed's actions helped to stem the dollar's slide, they failed to lift stock market sentiment, which had been looking for a fully-fledged discount rate cut of at least 50 basis points. If the Fed continues to resist a more substantial policy ease, equity investors face a potentially difficult autumn. Sustained improvements in corporate profitability should provide some momentum for stock prices, but a continued lack of economic growth and a likely increase in political uncertainty as election day nears could make it an uncomfortable ride. Monday    3257.35 - 10.26 Tuesday   3266.26 +  8.91 Wednesday 3290.31 + 24.05 Thursday   3292.2 +  1.89 Friday    3281.93 - 10.27</p>

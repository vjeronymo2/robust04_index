			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dow Chemical plans to reduce headquarters staff DOW CHEMICAL of the US is planning to eliminate about 6 per cent of the jobs at its corporate headquarters, the company announced yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Midland, Michigan. The group posted a Dollars 489m loss for 1992, blaming a glut on the world chemical market and special charges relating to retiree healthcare benefits and income tax. Dow said the costs of the workforce cuts were covered by a Dollars 430m charge the chemical company took against its fourth-quarter 1992 earnings. Dow then said the charge would cover asset write-offs and write-downs, plant shutdowns, divestitures and consolidations. Between 225 and 275 jobs would be cut at the Michigan office, which employs about 4,000 people, said Mr Enrique Sosa, president of Dow Chemical's North American operations. The company said the cuts resulted from a combination of factors including slumps in the aerospace, automotive and construction industries, coupled with increased global competition in a shrinking and depressed worldwide chemical market.</p>

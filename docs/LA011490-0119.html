			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 12 CONTRACT LUNG DISEASE AFTER WORKING WITH BERYLLIUM  </P> <P> Twelve people who were exposed to the metal beryllium while working at the  Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant have contracted a deadly lung disease, an  Energy Department study obtained by a newspaper says.  </P> <P> Eight current Rocky Flats workers and four retired employees tested positive  for berylliosis, the Denver Post reported in Sunday editions.  </P> <P> They were among more than 750 employees at the federal complex 16 miles  northwest of Denver who have handled beryllium, a metal used in the manufacture  of plutonium triggers. So far, diagnostic tests have been given to 391 of those  workers.  </P> <P> No deaths have been reported, but the incurable disease usually proves fatal to  30% of those who contract it, doctors said.  </P> <P> The disease was discovered during a study of Rocky Flats financed by the Energy  Department and the National Institutes of Health.  </P> <P> Researchers say it is the biggest work force study of berylliosis to date and  is scheduled to be completed in 1993.  </P> <P> An estimated 800,000 American workers have been exposed to beryllium dust in  93,000 private and government plants across the nation. At Rocky Flats, the  Energy Department has spent $2 million in the past four years on a program to  improve safety conditions.  </P></p>

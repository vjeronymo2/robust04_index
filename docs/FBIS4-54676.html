			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Miller, minister of labor and social </F> policy, by correspondent Henryk Sroczynski; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Sroczynski] Why, in your opinion, do strikes keep  recurring in the raw materials, fuels, and power-generating  sectors?    [Miller] A strike in a textile plant or even in the whole  textile sector would not bring appreciable results for its  organizers. After all, they are interested in making their  cause heard. Therefore, notoriety can be gained only through a  strike that will affect coal mines, power plants, or the  telecommunications sector because it can paralyze life in the  country on a large scale. Thus, organizers will always select  the branches of industry in which the planned strike would,  first, be noticed. and, second, have a crippling effect on the  whole fabric of state life.    [Sroczynski] In this case, however, there is much talk of  the exceptional significance of the strikes and even of a "new  gust of air" that might inflame Solidarity again.    [Miller] That would be impossible in any circumstances now.  Today we have a completely different management and ownership  structure than we had in the 1980's. Nevertheless, Solidarity  will clearly continue to provoke strikes in order to give itself  a high profile, at all costs, and to paralyze many other  branches of the economy.    [Sroczynski] In the meantime, how do you assess the  condition of our economy?    [Miller] For the first time in a long while, we have a  decrease in the number of unemployed: It has gone down by  20,000. This may not be very much, but it is a heartening  indication that unemployment is no longer growing. The  inflation index for the first quarter of the year is 4.5  percent, which is the best result for the past seven years. In  addition, industrial output rose by 10 percent in the past  quarter, which is also an unusual thing.    [Sroczynski] Can we assume that this will be a permanent  trend?    [Miller] It seems so, but this optimistic outlook can be  easily shattered nowadays. This can happen as a result of the  strike wave that may hit at the economy's sensitive points or  the abolition of the popiwek [enterprise tax on above-normative  pay] act, which could cause rapid wage increases. In such a  situation, Poland could again become an unstable country.    [Sroczynski] When could the economic reforms bring tangible  advantages also to the poorest strata of society?    [Miller] If the advantageous trends I mentioned earlier  prove to be the dominant strands in the economy, a real growth  of wages as well as old-age and disability pensions could take  place for the first time in many years. The most important  aspect of that would be that the adverse trends would then be  halted for the first time in many years.</p>

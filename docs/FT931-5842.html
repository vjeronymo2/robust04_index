			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Treasury ahead of deficit schedule THE GOVERNMENT is well ahead of its schedule for financing this year's budget deficit, a Treasury report stated yesterday. The monthly monetary report said the public sector borrowing requirement was overfunded by Pounds 9.6bn by the end of January. The overfunding was almost entirely explained by intervention to support the pound before its departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in September. However, the financial year runs until the end of March, so it is too early to judge how overfunded the authorities will be at the start of the next one in April. The government is expected to have to finance a PSBR of about Pounds 50bn in 1993-94. The report also pointed out that the surprise public sector budget surplus in January was due partly to higher value added tax receipts, which have been temporarily distorted by the reintroduction of postponed accounting for VAT. Elsewhere in the report, the Treasury underlined prospects for an economic recovery this year, pointing out that UK retail sales remain on an upward trend and that output expectations have improved. "Retail sales rose strongly in January, more than recovering December's unexpected fall,' said the report. It added that 'UK demand and activity in late 1992 appear to have been, if anything, a little stronger than the Autumn Statement forecast assumed'. Although the report reiterates the government's optimistic view on inflation  -pointing to the sharp fall in retail price inflation in January, and a recent fall in pay settlements - it acknowledges the first signs that sterling's devaluation is feeding through to prices. The Treasury notes that output prices in the latest three months increased at a slightly faster rate than in the three months ending in December. The Treasury argues that the sharp rise in M0 in January and February appeared to be overstating the strength of the economy while the weakness of M4 may reflect the shift of funds into other assets. The report, the last before the Budget on March 16, provided no new statistics on the state of the economy and although no conclusions were drawn, the evidence appeared to underline prospects for an economic recovery this year.</p>

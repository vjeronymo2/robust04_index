			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Slovak prime minister [Vladimir Meciar] said  that he is not willing to hold talks on the Hungarian minority's  collective rights, because the rights of the Hungarian minority  in Slovakia, as he said, are already excessive.    At a Bratislava rally of his party, the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia, Meciar said, we quote: There is complete  freedom in Slovakia, therefore, those who want to leave can do  so at any time. He added that the Slovak Government will not  pursue a policy to suit certain circles of the Hungarian  Republic.</p>

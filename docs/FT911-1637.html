			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tender sale of NTL network could raise up to Pounds 200m BRITAIN IS to become the first country to privatise part of its television transmission network, with the sale by tender of National Transcommunications (NTL), formerly the Independent Broadcasting Authority's engineering division. Analysts believe the sale of NTL, which this year expects to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 77m, may raise between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m. NTL is expected to become one of the first new entrants into the UK's liberalised telecommunications market. It is already in negotiations with the Office of Telecommunications, the industry regulator, over a licence to use its network to transmit television, data and telephone services. It is thought likely that NTL might form alliances with other groups such as cable television operators which are seeking to take advantage of the government's recent decision to end the telecommunications duopoly held by BT and Mercury. NTL operates about 475 transmitting sites and has access to a further 475 which are run by the BBC. Its main business is transmitting for the ITV independent television companies, Channel 4, the Welsh fourth channel S4C, and 50 independent local radio stations. Its services in this area, which will this year generate Pounds 61m of its revenue, are governed by a price cap imposed by Oftel which limits annual price rises to 1 per cent below the annual inflation rate. Dr John Forrest, executive chairman, forecast that within the next few years a third of NTL's income might come from new business activities, transmitting for television's planned Channel 5 and local independent radio contractors. Mr Peter Lloyd, the broadcasting minister, said NTL would be sold by auction to private bidders, expected to include foreign telecommunications and television groups. The privatisation is due in 1996. Price Waterhouse, the government's lead financial adviser on the sale, said it had already received inquiries from between 30 and 40 foreign and UK companies. NTL's management favours a bid from a consortium that would include a 15 per cent stake for the company's 770 employees as well as bringing it access to European markets. Television South West, the ITV contractor for the west country, is backing the Channel Three Wales and the West consortium, bidding for the commercial television franchise currently held by HTV covering Wales and the west.</p>

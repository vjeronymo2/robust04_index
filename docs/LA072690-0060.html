			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> No Berry for Knott's: Knott's Berry Farm has canceled Aug. 11-12 appearances by  rock legend Chuck Berry.  </P> <P> Charges of marijuana possession and child abuse leveled against Berry last week  by Missouri authorities were "implied but not specifically" the cause of the  cancellation, park spokesman Stuart Zanville said Wednesday. "All parties  agreed it was best for him not to be here at this time. . . . Apparently there  was a scheduling problem on his part." Zanville added that no replacement for  Berry has been found yet. The performer's two Aug. 13 shows at the Strand in  Redondo Beach are still on. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

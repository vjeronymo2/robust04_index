			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS TRADE BANKS, GET NELSON  </P> <P> The Chargers traded linebacker Chip Banks Tuesday and added a running back in  separate deals that beat the National Football League's trade deadline by less  than half an hour.  </P> <P> The Chargers sent Banks, who has a history of drug problems, to the  Indianapolis Colts in a conditional deal that will bring them at least one 1990  draft pick and maybe more, depending on how well the former USC linebacker  performs in Indianapolis and whether he remains drug-free.  </P> <P> Banks, 30, recently completed a 90-day drug-treatment program in the San Diego  area after having been arrested five times in the last 18 months on  drug-related charges.  </P> <P> Charger owner Alex Spanos had agonized for weeks over whether to give Banks  another chance with his team after he had publicly said that the five-time Pro  Bowl player would never play for the Chargers again.  </P> <P> "I've never had this kind of pressure put on me," Spanos said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Spanos finally said that he would allow Banks to return to the Chargers next  season.  </P> <P> That apparently was not good enough for Banks, who informed the Chargers he  wanted to play in 1989. They accommodated him by making the trade.  </P> <P> In the other deal, the Chargers acquired veteran Viking running back Darrin  Nelson from Dallas for a fifth-round pick that the Cowboys immediately shipped  to the Vikings as a condition of the multi-player deal that sent running back  Herschel Walker to the Vikings last week.  </P> <P> Nelson, 30, refused to report to Dallas last week after the Walker trade and  threatened to retire. But he told his agent, Tony Agnone, that there were  certain teams he would play for if a trade could be arranged. The Chargers were  one of those teams.  </P> <P> In addition, the Cowboys also traded holdout quarterback Steve Pelluer to the  Kansas City Chiefs for a high draft choice in 1990 and 1991. The Cowboys also  acquired running back Paul Palmer from the Detroit Lions for a 10th-round draft  choce.  </P> <P> The Associated Press contributed to this story.  </P></p>

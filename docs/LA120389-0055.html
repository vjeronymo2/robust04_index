			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MOON DIAL' NEEDS CHRISTO'S TOUCH  </P> <P> I think the Beverly Hills City Council was too hasty in its decision to  dispatch George Herms' "Moon Dial."  </P> <P> I have a modest proposal that may satisfy all concerned: In the spirit of  Herms' desire to "bring some challenging art to Beverly Hills," I propose that  the city rescue the sculpture from storage and commission Christo to wrap it.  </P> <P> DAVID BISHAI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

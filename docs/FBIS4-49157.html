			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman  of the Chinese Central Military Commission, recently called on  all soldiers and officers to carry forward the fine traditions  of the Chinese Armed Forces and firmly March down the road of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    He also demanded that units of the People's Liberation Army  (PLA) be further revolutionized, modernized and regularized so  as to make new contributions to maintaining national defense and  the country's socialist system.    Zhang Zhen made these remarks during his review of troops  stationed in the northern part of Jiangsu Province, east China,  which began on April 22 and ended today.    He said the fine traditions of the Chinese Armed Forces  include the absolute leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,  serving the people wholeheartedly, the powerful ideological and  political work, strict rules of discipline, political, economic  and military democracy at the company level, and the unity  between the Armed Forces and the government and between the  Armed Forces and the people.    Zhang urged officers at all levels to take the lead in  carrying forward the PLA's fine traditions, to pass on the  cherished heritage of the people's Armed Forces from generation  to generation.    He particularly asked the soldiers and officers to carry  forward the PLA's style of working hard and arduously in the  present new circumstances. He pointed out that although the  economy has been developed and the living standards raised, the  tradition of hard work cannot be cast away. Building socialism  with Chinese characteristics requires arduous efforts of  generations of the people. Even after the country becomes  strong and the people become rich, the spirit of working hard  and arduously is still needed, Zhang stressed.    During his stay in northern Jiangsu, Zhang made surveys of  grassroots troops, military schools, logistics departments and  some military subareas.</p>

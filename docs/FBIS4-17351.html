			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Petrov] </F>   [Text] Omsk April 24 TASS -- Several thousand people have  joined the People's Conscience Party which Alexey Kazannik,  former prosecutor-general of Russia, is founding upon his  returning here.    Kazannik is again a profesor at the law department of Omsk  University. He devotes all his spare time to the elaboration of  programmatic documents and organisational structure of the new  party.    More than 5,000 people have joined the party within three  days in Yekaterinburg, the hometown of President Boris Yeltsin,  Kazannik told ITAR-TASS. The most active support in forming the  party is being given by scientists and faculty members of  Novosibirsk and Omsk institutions of higher learning, the  Academgorodok (science city) and other cities in Siberia, the  Urals and the Far East, by entrepreneurs and the work  collectives of industrial enterprises.    Kazannik said he was prompted to found a party of his own by  "the immorality and inefficiency of the present authorities at  all levels and by the impossibility to combine efforts with all  the already existing parties and movements for moral  considerations".</p>

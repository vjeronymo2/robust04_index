			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / People: Hugh Harris decides to retire early from Bank of England The management reorganisation at the Bank of England has prompted Hugh Harris, 58, to seek early retirement from his position as associate director with responsibility for the Bank's own central corporate services. Harris is the most senior official to decide to quit the Bank since the decision to eliminate a management layer and divide its operations into two broad 'wings' responsible respectively for monetary and financial stability. The changes at the Bank have already resulted in the departure of seven other senior officials and the closing down of its international division. Harris's departure, due later this year, follows a restructuring of the Bank's central services under which the heads of the Bank's personnel and finance divisions and the Bank's secretary will in future report directly to Rupert Pennant Rea, deputy governor. As part of these changes, John Footman, the head of the Bank's information division, will be promoted to secretary with effect from September when the present secretary, Geoff Croughton, retires. Footman will retain responsibility for press and information work. Gordon Midgley, head of management services and the Bank's computer specialist, will expand his empire and be put in charge of finance and resources after the retirement of John Rumins, finance director. Mike Phillips remains Bank auditor and will report to Eddie George, the governor. A new personnel director will be recruited from outside the Bank. Harris, who joined the bank in 1959, will fill this role on a temporary basis until the position is filled. (See Observer)</p>

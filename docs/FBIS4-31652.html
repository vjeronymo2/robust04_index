			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by B. Geroski: "Watergate for a Second Time"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, at a news conference, the President of  VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian National Unity]  Ljupco Georgievski distributed copies of a "document" to  journalists, which "confirms that the State Security Service  [SDB] is continuing its active telephone bugging of the main  opposition party's offices." Allegedly, this has to do with the  discussions held between [VMRO-DPMNE Deputy President] Dosta  Dimovska and the SDB "collaborator" codenamed "Coordinator" (the  allusion is apparently to Tomislav Stefkovski, until recently  the coordinator of the party's parliamentary group before  setting up a faction).    Georgievski claims that the "document" reveals that the SDB  is dealing with the VMRO-DPMNE under the codename "Lion," while  the whole operation is called "Division." Georgievski also  claims that the SDB has formed a command center on several  levels that "not only passively follows the work of the party,  but is also actively involved in it, with the purpose of  completing the operation [to split the party]." The VMRO-DPMNE  is publicly calling on the public prosecutor of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  to react and it hopes that the affair will end in court. Until  then, the party will not respond to the accusations and attacks  of the factionists.    According to Georgievski, the whole affair has been created  with the aim of distracting the attention of the public from the  real problems -- the Serbian threats to the security of  Macedonia and the incidents on the border. Moreover,  Georgievski indicated that they are in possession of a document  similar to this, but like the one codenamed "Cave," in which the  publicly known "Curve" is mentioned, there is another subject  entitled "Cocktails" (related to the so- called "bombing  campaign" in Veles), as well as some others. The VMRO-DPMNE  claims that it has also been informed about the SDB's criminal  activities against some private businessmen. When we asked him  if he was ready to produce the "evidence" of the claims that the  present deputy secretary of the SDB, Slobodan Bogoevski, handed  over to him confidential information on Boris Zmejkovski,  Georgiveski replied that he had a couple of witnesses who could  testify to this, and that if Mr. Bogoevski sued the leader over  his statement, these witnesses would testify in court.    Asked about the authenticity of the "document" presented to  the public, Georgievski demanded that an expert study be done on  the typewriter on which this document was written (in the Latin  alphabet). As far as the [7 June] meeting with President  Gligorov is concerned, Georgievski said that the head of the  state had neither confirmed nor denied his statements, so the  party leadership is satisfied with the discussions. The  presentation of this document, as Georgievski put it, is a  message to the SDB that the VMRO-DPMNE "knows a lot."  Georgievski underlined that his party is receiving such  documents from SDB people who were perfect strangers until only  yesterday, because they are displeased with what their service  is doing. Finally, Georgievski called on the Macedonian public  to put a stop to these SDB activities.</p>

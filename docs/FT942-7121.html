			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (15): Quiet revolution under way - Minas Gerais has become the most active state in global financial markets / Three states tackle economic and social problems with a variety of approaches In its own quiet way, the state of Minas Gerais is undergoing a revolution. As well as being set to challenge Rio de Janeiro as Brazil's second biggest economy, it has become the most active state in global financial markets following a pioneering Eurobond issue earlier this year. Development officials portray the state, which is larger than France in area, as a haven for businesses from the overcrowding, high costs and strong union organisation of neighbouring Sao Paulo. In the 16th century it was gold that attracted settlers to the state. Gold mining was largely replaced by iron ore but the colonial towns built by the settlers, such as Ouro Preto and Tiradentes, remain, and have become an important tourist attraction. State officials boast that Minas' share of national gross domestic product increased by three percentage points to 11.4 per cent between 1970 and 1990, while Brazil's other three largest economies - those of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul - saw their shares shrink. During the 1980s, Minas exports increased by an average 10 per cent a year. This growth was sparked in the 1970s by the arrival of big industrial companies such as Fiat and by a strategy to attract manufacturing and high technology companies, many from overcrowded Sao Paulo, by offering fiscal incentives and lower costs. The policy has been promoted by the state's development bank, BDMG, and its Industrial Development Institute. In the 1990s, the state has targeted companies in sectors such as vehicle parts, electronics and agribusiness. Nevertheless, iron ore still makes up about a quarter of Minas's Dollars 5bn in exports. With a GDP of about Dollars 42bn, the state is home to a large chunk of Brazil's newly-privatised, and profitable, steel industry as well as mining, aluminium and car production. Industrial giants with operations in Minas include the steel company Usiminas, the government-controlled mining company Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium producer. The economy has been helped by finance from the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank for infrastructure projects. The state government has also been active in international financial markets. In February it raised Dollars 200m through a Eurobond issue that offered options to buy stock in its electricity company Cemig. Despite the complexity of the operation and the fact that no other state had attempted a bond with equity warrant issue, the offer was successful and has opened the door to similar operations in the future, say state officials. They add that the state's conservative financial management has led to a balanced budget for the past three years. However, Minas Gerais also suffers from serious social problems, including shanty towns and an estimated 2m people or more living in poverty. Problems are particularly acute in the north of the state in areas such as Jequitinhonha. Mr Marcus Flora, general secretary in Minas for the left- wing Workers Party (PT), criticises the state government's policies. He says that investment has been over-concentrated in large civil construction schemes to benefit contractors and other political allies of the state government. 'Education, health and public sanitation have suffered and while the state produces 20m tonnes of cereals a year, 2m people are going hungry,' says Mr Flora. The state government and its agencies deny that social problems have been ignored. Officials point to schemes such as the Jaiba irrigation project for fruit farmers in the poor north of the state, and education projects such as the Curumim programme for children from low income backgrounds.</p>

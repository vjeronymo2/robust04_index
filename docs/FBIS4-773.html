			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kurt Swart] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 15 SAPA -- Prospects of further  violence in central Johannesburg loomed large on Friday [15  April] when the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Youth Brigade vowed  it would embark on "rolling mass action" in the city from Monday  despite a magisterial ban.    If police or the African National Congress attempted to stop  planned marches to protest against the elections and the killing  of Zulu marchers in the city on March 28, South Africa would  become another Bosnia, the Youth Brigade warned at a news  conference.    The IFP's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Youth  Chairman Charles Loliwe said the Youth Brigade called on "all  peace- loving Africans" to observe Monday as a day of mourning  "for the innocent Zulus massacred outside the ANC headquarters  in Plein Street and in Library Gardens by the SA Police and MK  [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing]  security guards".    Mr Loliwe said the IFP was also calling for a stayaway from  April 18 to 23 to demand the South African Government and the  Transitional Executive Council lift the state of emergency in  kwaZulu/Natal, which it regarded as "illegal".    The stayaway applied to everybody, including people who were  not IFP members. Only journalists, students and civil workers  were exempted from the call. The IFP would "enforce" the  stayaway. "Anyone who comes to town will do so at their own  risk."    The IFP would march at 10AM on Monday from Library Gardens  to  the ANC headquarters where wreaths would be laid in honour of  members killed at the spot nearly three weeks ago. A  commemorative service at the Library Gardens would end at 4PM.    On Tuesday the IFP would march from George Goch Station to  John Vorster Square police headquarters where it would demand  the lifting of the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal and the  withdrawal of troops from the townships.    On Wednesday a sit-in would be staged at the Johannesburg  Stock Exchange [JSE] "because the JSE is part of the government  and can put pressure on them".    On Thursday the IFP would march on the SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] to protest against bias favouring the  National Party and the ANC, and on Friday it would march on the  offices of the Independent Electoral Commission. "The police  have refused us permission to hold these marches, but we will  take the law into our own hands to pay tribute to our members  who lost their lives. We are going to march. If anything  happens to us we warn the government it could lead to a Bosnia  situation in Johannesburg," Mr Loliwe said.    Asked whether the IFP was not concerned its campaign would  lead to more loss of life, Mr Loliwe replied: "It is not the  first time people have died in South Africa. We are going to  march peacefully and it is the responsibility of the government  and the police to see that we are protected."    No arms would be carried by marchers as Monday was a day of  mourning but the IFP could not prevent the carrying of  traditional weapons.    Asked whether the stayaway applied only to IFP members, IFP  Youth Treasurer Mthandeni Mkhize said: "Non-IFP members are not  free to come to work. The ANC has enforced stawyayas like this  before. Journalists, students and civil workers are exempted.  Everyone else has to stay at home."    Asked how the IFP would enforce a stayaway by non-IFP  members  who wanted to come to work, Mr Loliwe said: "That is our  secret. We will not tell you how we will make this stawayay  successful, but it will be successful, I assure you. People  come to work on Monday at their own risk. We are going to  ensure people do not come to work."    IFP media spokesman Sipho Magubane said Putco [Public  Utility  Transport Corporation] would be asked to stop its bus services  during the stayaway. "It is well-known that taxis will not come  to town and we do not believe people will take the trains."    The campaign would show the`world, which had been led to  believe that all South Africans wanted the elections, that this  was not true.    Angered by journalists' persistent questions on whether the  IFP wanted war or peace and if its campaign was a declaration of  war, Mr Mhikze snapped: "If the government or the ANC attack  us, this country is going the same way as Bosnia."    Mr Loliwe said there would be no free and fair elections  until the government and the ANC met IFP demands. "From the end  of the stayaway, rolling mass action will begin and continue  until the election. This is the start off our struggle," said  Mr Magubane.    Within hours of the press conference, SAP [South African  Police] Gen Koos Calitz banned marches and gatherings in various  Witwatersrand magisterial districts, including the planned  Library Garden gathering and the marches to the ANC headquarters  and to John Vorster Square. "Members of the public as well as  shopkeepers in the Johannesburg CBD [Central Business District]  are apprehensive about the intended IFP march planned for April  18. The SAP will be out in force," said police spokesman Lt-Col  Eugene Opperman.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Markets: Grumpy or Happy? City looks for clues - London ALL HAS not been well in the square mile this week. The City of London has been transformed into a besieged city. Taxi drivers have become ever more grumpy as they attempt to dodge the bollards to enter the enchanted circle. Workers whistling their way to offices have found their roads blocked. It must be part of a complex plot by the administrators of Canary Wharf to persuade banks and brokers to relocate to docklands. Perhaps it was the road blocks which caused turnover in the equity market to fall this week, and the Footsie index to move into 'a consolidation phase', the strategists term for going sideways. Or possibly the start of a new half year has allowed fund managers to enter a more sleepy phase, keeping their books - already dressed up for the end of June valuations - prepared for the BT3 sale, the forthcoming interim results season, and their holidays. There has been little in the way of good UK economic news to shake them from their dopey state. The seven wise men said the economic recovery would be slow and patchy; car sales are strong but the housing market is stalling; consumer credit figures were lower in May than they had been in April and March; but the M0 measure of money supply is running above target. The UK market seemed unimpressed too - at least initially - by the Tokyo summit. A breakthrough on the Gatt talks, which promises lower tariffs and increased world trade, should be welcome to all. But it took the US market's rise on Thursday to demonstrate to London that this happy news might be translated into higher share prices. So it was Friday before the Footsie was showing a bashful rally just regaining the week's opening level before lunch. But then a weaker Wall Street opening had the market slipping again, to end the week 14.5 points down at 2843.2. This will not deter the bulls. The chart, which the boffins at Nomura Research Institute dreamed up, shows how the FTA-All Share index rose over the period from September 1979 to the end of 1982, and how the same index has been moving since September 1990. The two periods cover roughly the same parts of the recession and recovery cycle. The two lines follow a remarkably similar pattern. If that continues, the market has further to rise. But it will take some good news to prompt that. There has been a revival of hopes of lower base rates, partly as the word from Mount Fuji is that interest rates around the world need to fall further. At BZW the strategists have revised their forecast for base rates at the year end from 5 1/2 to 5 per cent, though they do not expect a cut until the autumn. Its not much, but it helps. Bulls are awaiting the results season, which kicks off towards the end of this month, for positive news of how companies have performed in the first two quarters of economic growth. If all goes well, earnings forecasts for 1993 should be underpinned or even raised as the season progresses. Companies which do not match up to expectations will be severely punished, as some found out this week. All has not been well in the Magic Kingdom. Euro Disney warned on Thursday that it would make a loss this summer, its second summer season since opening the EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris. Its shares slumped 145p to 638p in London between the announcement on Thursday and Friday's close. The concern is that Euro Disney's problems are not just a sneezy, summer cold, but a bout of double pneumonia. Doc Walt Disney has been called in from the US to administer a financial injection. Euro Disney has had to shelve plans to expand the theme park, and is looking at raising extra capital. All in all, those who wished on a star and invested in the great European leisure complex will have to wait a long time for their dreams to come true. All has not been well, either, in the UK holiday industry. Owners Abroad, the tour operator which squeaked a win against a hostile Pounds 294m bid from Airtours four months ago, has discovered that its current year profits will be about half the number the City was expecting. A rapid downward revision of forecasts to around Pounds 11m, and the departure of the chairman and the director in charge of tour operations, cut the shares from 98 1/2 p to 66p on Thursday, although they rallied on Friday to 72 1/2 p. The Takeover Panel was opening an investigation into some of the things Owners was saying at the time of the bid. There has been some good news though. Greycoat, the property group, has found its fairy godmother in the unlikely shape of Alastair Ross Goobey, the chief executive of Postel the largest pension fund in the UK. His fund has underwritten a Pounds 120m rescue package, which underlines the rising enthusiasm for commercial property. Like Postel, 3i the venture capital fund, has money it is keen to invest. It announced results this week showing pre-tax profits up 39 per cent to Pounds 56m in the year to March, despite some nasty provisions such as a Pounds 72m write-off against its stake in Isosceles, the Gateway food retail group. 3i has been cashing in a number of earlier investments as management buy-outs float on the stockmarket. Now it has nearly Pounds 1bn to invest, but is lacking takers. That is another indication that economic recovery is proving slow. If 3i cannot find sufficient homes for its money, Granada, the leisure group can. This week it took its stake in LWT, the London weekend television station, to 20 per cent and opened discussions to see how the two companies could help each other. Coming on top of other recent investments in the sector, the market in television shares has been turned on.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Mixed fortunes for the dollar THE DOLLAR had mixed fortunes in the currency markets yesterday, showing further strength against the D-Mark but weakening once more against the Japanese yen, writes James Blitz. Despite the lack of any fresh currency-related news in the European morning, the dollar rose against the German currency, peaking at about DM1.6170. The recent sell-off of the US currency has been strong enough to trigger some short covering by dealers in recent days. At the same time, there were growing expectations in the market yesterday that the Bundesbank might cut rates at its council meeting next Thursday, narrowing the differential between short term US and German rates which is capping the dollar's progress. However, the dollar eased off against the D-Mark at the end of the day, partly as a result of lacklustre US economic indicators. The Michigan university consumer confidence index raised new fears about the pace of economic recovery, falling to 84.0 per cent in April from 85.9 per cent in March. The market had been looking for a small rise. The US currency later closed in London at DM1.6135 from a previous DM1.6025. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, believes that the Bundesbank could ease rates on Thursday. Much will depend on the figures for M3 money supply growth which are due out next week. 'If these prove to be on the weak side, the Bundesbank might lean towards easing again,' he said. By contrast, the dollar was very weak against a yen that strengthened across the board. The main concern in the market was that neither President Bill Clinton of the US nor Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, would register any concern about the strong yen at their meeting yesterday. Although the Japanese authorities announced a large fiscal stimulus to the economy this week, Clinton administration officials appeared sufficiently concerned by the Japanese trade surplus to want to see the yen rise further. There were also signs yesterday that the Japanese are not too perturbed by their currency's progress. The head of research of the ruling LDP party in Japan said that Japanese exporters would not feel any pain from the yen/dollar rate until it reached the Y110 level. All this helped to boost the yen to a close of Y112.60 against the dollar in London from a previous Y113.20. The Japanese currency also performed very strongly against the D-Mark closing at Y69.75 from a previous Y70.62.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Daewoo to give units greater autonomy DAEWOO, South Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, plans to promote management autonomy among its subsidiaries in the first step toward the group's eventual dissolution, according to Mr Kim Woo-choong, the Daewoo chairman. South Korea's big conglomerates, or chaebol, have been criticised for becoming unwieldly and cumbersome due to their size and range of business operations. The government has tried to impose credit restrictions on the chaebol to force them to streamline activities and improve competitiveness. Although the chaebol have not reduced operations, they are promoting greater decentralised management in what is regarded as a preliminary step to the eventual break-up of these groups over the next few decades. Mr Kim, who founded Daewoo in 1967, said he would begin to give full managerial independence to profitable subsidiaries this year, detaching them from group control. Mr Kim may have made his decision in response to criticism among some senior executives that the group had grown too big for the Daewoo chairman to retain close management control over the conglomerate. Mr Kim said management independence would not be given to Daewoo's main shipbuilding and heavy machinery units until they are merged by the end of 1994. The government agreed in 1989 to provide rescue loans to debt-ridden Daewoo Shipbuilding, an unlisted subsidiary, on condition it would later merge with listed Daewoo Heavy Industries to improve the group's financial stability and rationalise operations. Officials originally ordered that the merger should be completed by the end of 1992, but agreed last month to delay it for another two years.</p>

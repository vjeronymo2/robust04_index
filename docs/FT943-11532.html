			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: John I Jacobs John I Jacobs, the transportation group, announced a 17 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 46,000 to Pounds 38,000 for the six months to June 30. Turnover was up some 9 per cent to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.45m), largely the result of a 40 cent increase in the shipbroking division. Mr Michael Kingshott, appointed managing director in a boardroom shake-up earlier this year, said this was a 'modest increase not anticipated' at the time of the circular to shareholders in June. Earnings per share fell to 0.1p (0.5p). The interim dividend is halved to 0.25p.</p>

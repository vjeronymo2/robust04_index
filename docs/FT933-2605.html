			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: MGN deal ahead Arthur Andersen, the administrator of Mirror Group Newspapers, acted to defuse speculation over the sale of its 54.8 per cent stake yesterday by announcing that it was preparing the details for a placing in the market. The stake, which represents some 220m shares, will be sold by Rothschild, Andersen's financial advisers, and Cazenove. The two firms will be joined by NatWest Securities, James Capel and SG Warburg. Mr John Talbot of Andersen said: 'In view of the success of the new management team in restoring MGN's fortunes and in removing a number of uncertainties overhanging the company' he was planning an offering of up to all the stake 'subject to appropriate market conditions'. No idea of price, date or method of placing was released but the appointment of so many leading securities houses to handle the sale implies that the timing and details will be well flagged before the placing takes place. Mirror Group slipped 5 to 181p yesterday.</p>

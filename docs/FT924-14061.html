			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / EC officials plan stiff defence of policy powers THE European Commission will today mount a vigorous defence of its powers to draft Community policy, striking back at critics before Friday's EC summit in Birmingham. In a high-level meeting in Brussels, senior Commission officials will finalise a paper on 'subsidiarity' - the principle of devolving powers to the lowest appropriate level, which EC governments believe is vital to recapture public support for the Maastricht treaty. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, presented an outline of the paper during talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, last Saturday. Both sides described the talks as helpful in the UK-led effort to prepare a political declaration on subsidiarity at the Birmingham summit. In its paper, the Commission is expected to propose limited reforms in order to counter charges that it is a remote, overcentralised bureaucracy. The reforms are likely to include a pledge to consult member states fully before proposing policy directives, as well as an explanation of why Brussels believes an EC-wide directive is necessary. The Commission is also likely to argue that no single area of Commission competence should be targeted for attack; and that its power to be solely responsible for drafting legislation must be left intact. As EC president, the UK is leading diplomatic efforts to forge an EC consensus on subsidiarity to help secure early ratification of the Maastricht treaty, both in Britain and ahead of a likely second referendum in Denmark. British officials said yesterday the summit in Birmingham would focus on 'the way things are done', but an agreement on the general criteria for subsidiarity might have to wait until the Edinburgh summit in December. Another reform gaining ground is for the Council of Ministers to conduct some of its business in public, to promote greater transparency in EC decision-making. Calming fears, Page 14</p>

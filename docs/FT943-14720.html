			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Succumbed to an aberration Sir, It is time to recall Michael Prowse, your north America correspondent; the man has gone native ('Why vegetarians will inherit the earth', July 11). It is his job to report the aberrations and foibles of the American people, not succumb to them by becoming a vegetarian teetotaller. His decision to eschew the pleasures of meat and alcohol seems to have been brought about by a belief that he is joining a sect that will grow until it rules the world because of the longevity, if not immortality, that such a diet must assuredly bring. It may be worth reminding Prowse that earlier this century a teetotal vegetarian thought he could rule the world. Adolf Hitler not only spurned the eating of meat and drinking of alcohol, he was also anti-tobacco. Ian K Lamont, Fairlight Cottage, Hickmans Lane, Lindfield, Sussex RH16 2PT</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / NHS cleaners covered by Tupe transfer rules The contracting-out of National Health Service cleaning work to private companies is covered by the European Union's transfer regulations, which protect the pay and conditions of workers for at least one year, according to a Liverpool industrial tribunal. Following an Employment Appeals Tribunal ruling last year it had been assumed that the Transfer of Undertakings - Protection of Employment (Tupe) regulations - which often make public sector contracts less attractive to the private sector, would not generally apply to NHS cleaning. In September Mr Justice Wood upheld an industrial tribunal judgment that Tupe did not apply when 107 cleaners at Orsett Hospital in Basildon were transferred from Initial Health Care Services to the Pall Mall Services Group. But the latest judgment has ruled that the contracting out of cleaning at Walton Hospital to Taylorplan Services in October 1992 is covered by Tupe. However, the two decisions are not necessarily in conflict as the Orsett case involved a transfer between two private groups. The significance of the decision is that it has established that an in-house cleaning operation, which had won the original tender to clean the hospital from 1986 to 1992, can be regarded as a separate 'undertaking', at least in an NHS trust, and a transfer can be deemed to have occurred in spite of the minimal transfer of equipment and premises. Unison, the public-service union, welcomed the decision on behalf of the 120 cleaners who will qualify for some compensation for the lower pay and sickness benefit they have received from Taylorplan. Some of the 25 people who were not taken on by Taylorplan may also be able to claim unfair dismissal.</p>

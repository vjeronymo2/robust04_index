			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Thai call for growth to avoid violence MR Anand Panyarachun, the Thai prime minister, yesterday called for close co-operation between the government and the private sector to revive the country's economy and avoid a repeat of last month's political violence. His comments, made in his first speech since his deadlock-breaking appointment on June 10, referred indirectly to two key issues that need to be resolved if public confidence is to be revived. These are the kind of government that will emerge after elections in August or September, and what will happen to military commanders who are still in their posts despite being blamed for using weapons of war to suppress demonstrations in Bangkok (leaving more than 40 protestors killed and several hundred missing). Mr Anand echoed the views of many analysts by attributing the conflict to the failure of the political system, traditionally dominated by the military, to keep up with the rapidly expanding business sector. His call for a greater business role in easing political tension as well as in devising economic policy coincided with moves by a group of leading business figures to promote 'better' politicians. The group announced yesterday it was setting up a fund to support candidates it believed would be less likely to buy votes and to engage in the politics of power and personal patronage that led to last month's protests. Members of the group said they would boycott members of the five coalition parties whose decision to back as their prime minister General Suchinda Kraprayoon, former army chief, triggered the anti-military campaign. Mr Anand made his speech at a seminar organised by industry, trade and banking associations. A former diplomat and businessman himself, he said he had accepted the invitation because the business community was determined not to allow a repeat of the conflict. He also said he would use closed-door diplomacy to work out a face-saving compromise on the future of the military leaders.</p>

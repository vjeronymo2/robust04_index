			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong dollar rally continues THE US DOLLAR yesterday rose to its highest level against the D-Mark since the autumn currency crisis, following a remarkable surge in consumer confidence data in the US, writes James Blitz. The dollar's mini-rally continued to dominate the light trading of the holiday period. But dealers think that there may be currency tension in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in the New Year, and a weak performance by the Irish punt yesterday added to concerns. On Monday, the dollar rose more than 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, closing in New York at DM1.6205. Analysts explained the surge in the dollar/D-Mark rate by the increasing tension in the Middle East and speculation that German interest rates will be cut in the near term. The surge continued to a high of DM1.6235 yesterday after the US consumer confidence index rose to 78.3 per cent after a revised 65.6 per cent in November. Forecasts for the December figure had been for a more modest 70.1 per cent. US housing data were also strong, with existing home sales jumping 5.0 per cent in November to an unadjusted annual rate of 3.85 million, the highest sales level since November 1986. The dollar lost ground in late European trading as the DM1.6240 level proved increasingly difficult to overcome. It later closed in London at DM1.6140, more than a pfennig up on the day. The US currency remained particularly strong against sterling. The pound fell below the Dollars 1.50 level for the first time this year to a low of Dollars 1.4988. Sterling last saw this level in January 1987. The pound later closed at Dollars 1.5135, down nearly two cents on the day. Sterling was significantly weaker on the Bank of England's trade weighted index, which measures the pound against a basket of other currencies. The pound closed at 79.0 on the index, having finished on Monday at 79.5. In thin markets, small orders can make a big difference to exchange rates, and dealers reported that dollar trading remained light. However, some analysts believe the dollar is set for a significant rally in the New Year. According to IDEA, the financial market analysts, strong consumer confidence figures should be the main factor behind a strong rise in the November leading indicator today. The French franc ended at a three-week high, as dollar strength lured funds out of the D-Mark. The franc closed at FFr3.404, up more than a centime on the day. However, the Irish punt alternated with the French franc throughout the day at the bottom of the ERM grid. Dealers are waiting to see whether the Dublin government will go ahead with its plan to lift exchange controls by the end of the year.</p>

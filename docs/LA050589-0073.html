			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> PETER SHELTON'S ECCENTRIC SHAPES AT LA JOLLA EXHIBIT  </P> <P> There's something wonderfully ridiculous about a bulging belly sticking out  from the wall right about your own belly level, and something indescribably  poignant about a pair of lopsided, carrot-like legs. When Peter Shelton is  clicking, his sculptures -- often made of semi-transparent wax over a visible  metal armature -- provoke all manner of inchoate feelings in the viewer.  </P> <P> Assembled in a show called "Waxworks" at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary  Art (through June 4), a flock of these pieces from 1983-88 range in tone from  spry and wondrous oddity to tight-lipped postmodernist severity.  </P> <P> The best pieces have a certain drollness that comes from borrowing elements  from human anatomy (like shoulders, necks, stomachs), nature (gourds, roots,  wings) and garments (shields, collars) and mixing them up in spare, irregularly  shaped objects made from variously obdurate and fragile-looking materials.  Adroit placement on the wall counts, too, as do Shelton's punning titles.  </P> <P> A gourd-like form ("Peckerhead") hung high on the wall sprouts a tall red  member that sticks straight up like a handle. "Clearbelly," the plump belly  piece, and "Pins," the dwindling legs, are also winners, as is "Littletrunk," a  white waxy piece with a long "trunk" and tiny stubs of legs -- like a cross  between a human figure and a tree branch.  </P> <P> When Shelton falters, the works seem overly manicured in a chic-gallery way.  </P> <P> "Blackboat," which looks rather like a giant half of a peanut shell with a  polished black interior and a textured gray exterior, offers no fey conceit and  seems too mutely elegant to pique the imagination.  </P> <P> "Blackwing," too, is a handsome mixed-media piece swinging out from the wall in  an elegant dark curve, but it doesn't tease at the psyche in any of the sly  ways Shelton has at his disposal. On the other hand, "Redwing," with its  aerodynamic shape and wood-grained veneer, suggests a curious conflation of the  shapes of human shoulders and arms, maple tree seed pods (the kind kids stick  on their noses) and an airplane propeller.  </P> <P> When he turns to cast metal, Shelton generally abandons the eccentric and  puckish qualities of his mixed-media pieces. Suddenly the work becomes a  Serious Art Object. "Ironfloater," for example, is an irregularly contoured  rusted iron container suspended from the ceiling. It seems to aspire to be a  lorn piece of flotsam -- once abandoned to the elements, now adrift in the air  -- but its presentation seems so rigidly formal that it cancels out allusive  content.  </P> <P> "32th" is a group of 32 cast copper objects -- they look somewhat like giant  teeth -- that hang (on small loops) from the undersides of a group of slender  metal bars suspended from the ceiling. The perplexed viewer tries to find some  Shelton-esque image or notion to hang onto here (besides the apropos silliness  of the made-up word, thirty-tooth and perhaps a nod to the fragility of the  human body), but the point remains elusive.  </P> <P> Yet "Redshoulder" retains something of the artists' unexpected, fresh vision  along with formal grace. The piece is simply a red rectangular solid pushed  gently out of shape so that it grows "shoulders." By such simple means Shelton  offers a delicious tension between ever-so-slightly humorous anthropormorphism  and sober purity of line.  </P></p>

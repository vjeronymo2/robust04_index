			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: London The gilt market remains nervous and volatile and there is little in the economic diary this week to suggest scope for a sudden rally. Inflation fears were not helped by last week's M0 numbers, although the market bounced back on Thursday and Friday, indicating that there are bond buyers when long yields start approaching 9 per cent. According to Mr Peter Fellner, gilt strategist at NatWest Markets, 'the markets need a period of relative calm and stability so people can regain their composure'. Wednesday's meeting of the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke and the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, is not expected to result in any immediate change in the level of interest rates. However, Mr David Walton, UK economist at Goldman Sachs, thinks that the governor may use the meeting to try to steer the chancellor away from the previous 'bias towards easing' and towards a more neutral stance. With only industrial production and consumer credit figures out this week, politics may be a key factor. Results of the European elections will not be revealed until Sunday, but exit polls should be available. 'If the political news is bad for the Conservatives, that might be an excuse for a sell off,' said Mr Fellner.</p>

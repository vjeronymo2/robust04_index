			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Norway nears accord on EU entry Norway was close last night to agreeing entry terms to the European Union, joining Sweden, Finland and Austria, which concluded membership negotiations last week. But the planned move from 12 to 16 member states by January 1995 was stalled because the UK and Spain - with lukewarm support from Italy - continued to refuse to countenance any dilution of their voting rights in an expanded Union. At a closed meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, the nine other current EU members warned London and Madrid that the enlargement could not go ahead if they remained obdurate. The Greek presidency of the EU and the European Commission held bilateral meetings with the British and Spanish foreign ministers, who were urged to contact their prime ministers, senior EU diplomats said. The UK and Spain insist on retaining the existing formula of 23 votes needed to prevent EU legislation - out of 76 votes distributed among the 12 roughly according to their size. Their partners want to shift the 'blocking minority' to 27 votes, to maintain the same percentage in a Europe of 16 sharing 90 votes. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, proposed a compromise of moving to 27, plus a committee of representatives of EU heads of government to study vote distribution before the Union's constitutional review in 1996. The committee would be mandated to consider British, Spanish, Italian, and German wishes to get a closer relation between national population and votes than now exists. A senior British official said: 'I can assure you there will be no settlement except on British terms.' Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign minister, said: 'If there is no solution to this problem, we will not unfortunately be able to celebrate what we all want, enlargement.' Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany - which does worst in the new vote share-out it is advocating in order to get the four applicants into the Union - said: 'There is no sense in agreeing on 23 (votes) because this will be rejected by the (European) parliament.' Amid this test of negotiating nerve, the EU and Norway looked close to squaring the other enlargement circle - Spanish insistence on recovering 'historic rights' to 7,000 tonnes of Norwegian cod against Oslo's refusal to concede a single extra fish. A Commission formula, which both Madrid and Oslo were prepared to consider, in effect recycles fish quotas Norway conceded when it joined the European Economic Area free trade zone, which started this year. That allowed 7,250 tonnes of fish in 1994, rising to 11,000 tonnes in 1997, for the EU's four poorest countries, nearly half of it earmarked for Spain. Under the EEA, the Union also gets 2.9 per cent of the Norwegian waters cod quota - about 40,000 tonnes this year. Norway's much-vaunted fisheries management foresees rises in the quota, however, and therefore a higher tonnage for the Union. The Commission proposes that that increment should go to satisfy Spanish demands. Czechs delay EU application, Page 3</p>

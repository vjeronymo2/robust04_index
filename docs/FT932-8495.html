			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Japan's trade surplus rises 44% to Dollars 10bn JAPAN'S trade surplus last month rose 44 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 10.25bn (Pounds 6.6bn), as the yen's appreciation led to a sharp increase in the dollar value of exports, while imports remained weak. The surplus with the US rose 22.6 per cent on a year earlier to Dollars 4bn, while the surplus with the EC fell 6.4 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn, mainly because of a 20.4 per cent fall in car exports that accompanied an increase in local production abroad by Japanese makers. Apart from a 14 per cent appreciation in the yen over the year, the surplus was fuelled by strong demand from Asian economies for Japanese manufactured goods, highlighted by a 56.3 per cent surge in exports to China. However, domestic demand for imports has fallen as the economy has slowed, resulting in a 1.7 per cent increase in imports in dollar terms, but, in yen, a 12.3 per cent fall. Mr Geoffrey Barker of Baring Securities said the trend indicates that the economy is 'bumping along the bottom'. The Ministry of Finance said the seasonally adjusted surplus was Dollars 11.2bn, up from Dollars 9.6bn in March, with exports 3.2 per cent higher at Dollars 31.5bn and imports 2.8 per cent lower at Dollars 20.3bn. Exports of ordinary machinery were 15.8 per cent higher, as were those of transport machinery, while those of metallic products, in particular steel, were 15.3 per cent higher, thanks to a trebling of orders from China. Demand from an overheated Chinese economy pushed up Japanese exports remarkably for a range of products. Car exports were six times higher than a year earlier, video camera exports were ten times larger, bus and truck exports were almost four times higher, and chemicals exports more than doubled. China has become Japan's second largest trading partner, surpassing Taiwan and South Korea and behind only the US, but the rapid increase in exports could create a new area of trade friction. Last month, China had a surplus in bilateral trade of Dollars 272m, but that does not include Japanese exports through Hong Kong, which have also risen sharply. Meanwhile, Japan's wholesale prices fell 0.5 per cent last month compared to the previous month, and were 2.8 per cent lower than the same month last year, the Bank of Japan said. Bank officials said the decline was because of lower prices for raw materials, made cheaper by the yen's appreciation.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Accountancy Column: Matters of doubt as results hit the deck  -Worries over accountancy exam standards and the 'Friday night scramble' HUNDREDS OF bleary-eyed trainee accountants woke up last Saturday knowing whether or not they had passed their exams before opening the results letter lying on the doormat. While their immediate concern was celebration or commiseration, their experience raises one of several wider questions over the existing exam process. The timing of the publication of results was one issue for the more than 4,000 people who sat the PE2 final professional exams for the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in July. Most important was the result. In line with a relatively consistent trend in the past few years, the pass rate among the 4,063 candidates was 52 per cent, with 15 per cent referred because they failed one of the four papers. This did not go unnoticed by Mr David Hunt, chairman of the institute's education and training directorate. 'While the best-qualified candidates acquitted themselves very well, the overall pass rate remains modest and we should like to see it improve,' he said in a statement accompanying the results. Intriguingly, the pass rate is substantially lower than in some other professional institutes, such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland. More 80 per cent of candidates for its exams passed last time. That might raise questions over the marking policies used. But Mr Phil Armitage, director of education and training at the English institute, insists standards are fixed, so it is the pass rate alone that varies. Mr Graham Hambly, editor of Pass, a monthly magazine for trainee accountants, says he is surprised by Mr Hunt's remarks about the need for improvement, given that the trend has been relatively static - and was higher this year than many others in the recent past. 'People have very short memories,' he says. While the institute lays stress on the number of students who ultimately pass after a number of attempts - which is much higher than half - he focuses attention on the frustrations for those who fail in the interim. He says a survey by his magazine showed that 92 per cent of students wanted a 'marking service', such as that offered by other professional institutes. Rather than simply receiving a slip telling students that they have failed a paper, the service would, for a fee, go through the answers and explain where candidates had erred. Meanwhile, there is concern from students and a number of training managers in leading accountancy firms over the way the results are published. Under the current arrangement, the institute sends out letters to every applicant on Friday, and at the same time distributes copies of the complete list of results to interested organisations. Results appear in the Saturday edition of the Times, alongside job advertisements for those who pass, and resit offers from training firms for those who fail. Theoretically, every student will have already received their results by post at the same time on Saturday morning. In practice, a rather different ritual has built up. Hundreds of trainees gather at main railway stations in London late on Friday to buy copies of the newspaper's first edition, which arrives before midnight and contains lists of all who passed or have been referred for retakes. Many students do not want to risk their friends finding out first - or even calling them with the results before they have found out for themselves. As a result, they join the Friday night crowds. Waiting for the results has taken on an extra urgency in the past two years, as accountancy firms cut costs in the recession and the threat of dismissal without a second chance looms for those who do not pass. Mr Hambly says: 'Students have waited eight weeks. They want the results as soon as possible. But I don't think this system works. It's all a bit tacky.' Mr Mark Dawson, national examination training manager at Price Waterhouse, says: 'There are people with champagne next to those in tears. It is a pretty disastrous affair, and so tense. It makes you wonder whether, if the people from the institute went along, they might change their minds.' He says that, after his results came out a few years ago, he went to Victoria station himself. His girlfriend got a paper first and found he had passed. She threw herself into his arms and said: 'Congratulations, Mark, you've passed.' Unfortunately, the station was so packed that she threw herself into the arms of someone standing near him by mistake - who also happened to be called Mark, but who had not passed. The process discriminates against those who live outside London and cannot obtain first editions of the paper. It has also caused tensions when typesetting errors have either omitted or placed wrongly the names of those who have passed. Mr Phil Armitage says the present arrangement began in 1988, when a postal strike threatened to delay results sent by mail. Since then, he says staff have found there are far fewer complaints about using the newspaper to publish the results than before, when postal delays caused widespread anguish. Price Waterhouse has no official view on the process by which results are circulated, although in common with other firms and several recruitment organisations, it provides a results hotline. Mr Dawson said he and several other training managers had approached the Times to ask the newspaper to provide a telephone hotline so students do not have to take part in a Friday evening scramble. He also said he would like to see publication of results delayed until Sunday, so students have the chance to receive individual results before they are made public. Most students who have passed want their results to appear in a newspaper, but want the chance to learn the results first in private. That is the more sedate approach taken by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland, which distributes its exam results to several Scottish newspapers for publication on a Sunday, after individual results should have arrived by post. 'It is very deliberate,' says Mr Ian Marrian, deputy secretary. 'We want students to get the information first.' Timing may hardly be the most important concern for students - or their employers. But another of Mr Hunt's comments certainly is. He raised worries that the PE2 papers in which students performed most disappointly were those requiring practical experience. That corresponds with the trend spotted by recruiters that salaries and demand among employers for management accountants has been far more buoyant than for the chartereds. In spite of recent efforts at reform, it raises a far wider question over the relevance of the existing chartered accountancy qualification.</p>

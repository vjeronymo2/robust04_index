			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices changes TODAY'S FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices table, published on the London Stock Exchange page, includes for the first time two new features approved by the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices Steering Committee last April. Total return figures, calculated at the close of each trading day, will now be shown for the FT-SE 100, FT-SE Mid 250, FT-SE-Actuaries 350, FT-SE SmallCap and FT-Actuaries All-Share indices. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, calculated in real time and displayed from yesterday on many information services' screens, will be shown both in its present form and without its investment trust company constituents. A further small improvement in the presentation of the table has been introduced, altering the order of the columns of calculated ratios so as to place dividend yield before earnings yield. The total return indices are designed to take account both of the price performance of stocks and also of the income received from dividends, thus providing investors with an accurate measure of each sector of the market against which the performance of a portfolio can be compared. The total return figures are calculated gross of tax and assume that dividends and tax credits are reinvested immediately on the ex-dividend date. Investors who wish to calculate their total return net of tax can do so by using the ex-dividend adjustment data already published daily in the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices table. The total return indices have been calculated since December 31 1992, when the value was set at 1000.00. Back data from December 31 1987 for the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index and the FT-SE 100 Index has been calculated by the London Stock Ex-change. The method for calculating the total return indices was designed by a working party set up by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries, chaired by Mr David Wilkie of R Watson &amp; Son. Calculation of the FT-SE Mid 250 Index without investment trusts is expected to show significant divergence from the performance of Mid 250 itself, based on experience since the start of this year when the FT-SE SmallCap was first calculated with and without investment trusts. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index currently contains 32 investment trust companies, accounting for about 10 per cent of market capitalisation. Their exclusion provides investors with an opportunity to measure the market in shares of medium-sized companies without 'double counting' of shares held in the investment trusts' portfolios. Information on the method for calculating the total return indices is available from The Manager, FT Statistics, One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL. Fax: 071-873-3090. Tel: 071-873-4007. Information regarding historical data for the new total return indices is available from FT Information Services at One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL. Fax: 071-873-4610. Tel: 071-873-4613.

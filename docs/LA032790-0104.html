			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIGHTER RULES URGED FOR WEIGHT CLINICS  </P> <P> Overweight people need better government protection from weight-loss clinics  that advertise slimness but deliver health problems, a lawmaker probing diet  programs said Monday.  </P> <P> "This subcommittee has found the medical field riddled with hucksters who ply  their dubious wares and their miracle cures while government regulators sit  snoozing on the sidelines," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chairman of the House  Small Business subcommittee on regulation.  </P> <P> Witnesses who said diet clinics caused them or their family members medical  problems told their stories to the subcommittee. One woman said she had to have  a gall bladder operation after rapidly losing weight through one clinic.  </P> <P> Wyden said he was glad to see the Federal Trade Commission going after the most  outrageous get-thin schemes, such as diet pills said to work during sleep. But  he said a potentially greater threat is the trend toward commercial weight-loss  clinics and physician-supervised diet programs.  </P></p>

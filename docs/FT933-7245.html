			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Arts: American soloists rescue vocal recitals - Musical events The vocal recitals have done it again. At the end of the festival's first week the music events had settled into a disappointingly unexciting run, when two solo singers came along and won spontaneous cheers that at last brought Edinburgh 1993 alive. Both were Americans riding to the rescue, but that is no surprise these days. The American singer is in the ascendant. They dominate in opera and, unlike many of their predecessors, present-day American singers want to make their mark in recital as well. Some help to broaden the repertoire away from solid German programmes by including music from various musical traditions, including their own; others have taken on German Lieder-singers on their home ground and won. Sylvia McNair is one of the first group. Her programme at the Queen's Hall on Saturday morning began and ended in English, passing through Italian, French, and German on the way. She is well-versed, eloquent in her own way in all of them, though the various styles are ultimately as one to her, to be treated to singing that falls as ravishing balm upon the ear. In the opening Purcell solos every phrase was shaped exquisitely and sung with beautifully poised tone - near to heaven. No wonder she chose 'The Blessed Virgin's Expostulation' as the last one. Four Schubert Italian settings (cleverly chosen for beauty of line and tone) and Debussy's Ariettes oubliees were so intimate that one wanted to hold one's breath. No matter how quietly she sings, McNair manages to keep the voice alive and intense, which is an important gift in recital. Inevitably, there are limitations, revealed most clearly here in her Wolf group. 'Nimmersatte Liebe', an extraordinary song about the masochistic joys of love, stayed unquestioningly innocent. At least, a knowing look afterwards at the pianist (Roger Vignoles superbly expressive) suggested the point had been understood; but the singing did not. A certain shallowness marred each of the Wolf. Then to end, songs by Bernstein in all his guises, the wry, the mad-cap, the sentimental. It is always good to have such varied recitals, doubly enticing when they are sung so well. For the evening the festival scheduled Thomas Hampson, one from the other category of Americans. With his good-as-native German, his intellectual grasp of poetry, his enquiring interest into song history, Hampson has bid fair to become an honorary European. His programmes prove as much, concentrating on German Lieder, both the common and the rare. Unlike his compatriot, he sang in the Usher Hall, Edinburgh's main concert hall, not designed for solo recitals. It is easy to see why: Hampson can draw a large audience, he has the charisma. He has the prodigality of voice, which can expand effortlessly to a venue-filling forte with no strain, no forcing. But it is a large hall and Hampson never truly drew the audience in. An element of the celebrity recital remained. He chose Beethoven and Grieg in the first half with a selection of German songs to the poetry of Robert Burns, a nice gesture, imaginatively worked out. After the interval the single work was Schumann's Dichterliebe. (Readers of Edinburgh's listings magazine hoping to hear a piece called Dick Ferliebe will have been disappointed.) Everything he sang was vivid, full of colour, verbally clear. But the Schumann cycle failed, not helped by the fact that Geoffrey Parsons's admirable accompaniment sounded distant and muddled in this big, resonant acoustic.</p>

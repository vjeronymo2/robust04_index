			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: LAWSUIT SETTLED  </P> <P> Los Angeles County and City of Industry have settled a 1988 lawsuit challenging  the city's attempt to declare 600 acres of city-owned pastureland a blight on  the community in order to declare it a redevelopment zone.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors agreed not to challenge the inclusion of the land just  north of the Pomona (60) and Orange (57) freeways in a redevelopment zone if  the city will forward to the county its full 57% share of property tax on new  development. The tax on new construction in a renewal zone usually goes to a  city's redevelopment agency.  </P> <P> Industry projects about 7.2 million square feet of new construction over a  35-year period in the disputed parcel. Industry City Atty. Graham A. Ritchie  said that the parcel is exempt from a state law requiring that new  redevelopment zones be 80% urban and blighted because it is publicly owned.  </P></p>

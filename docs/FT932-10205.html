			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Spanish in Pta18bn Portuguese bank bid BANCO Santander, one of Spain's biggest private banks, has launched a takeover bid for the 75 per cent of Portugal's Banco de Comercio e Industria it does not already own, AP-DJ reports from Madrid. A spokesman for Santander estimated the bid to be worth up to Pta18bn (Dollars 155m). Santander said the Portuguese bank's other overseas investors, the Royal Bank of Scotland with 15 per cent and Metropolitan Life Insurance with 3.6 per cent, have approved its offer. The Spanish bank will pay Esc1,400 (Dollars 9.53) a share for the bank, a 40 per cent premium over BCI's average share price in recent weeks. The bid must be approved by the Portuguese authorities. Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and BCI participate in a cross-border computer network with Credit Comercial de France. Santander and RBS also have a banking alliance, with the Spanish bank holding 9.9 per cent of RBS and the Scottish bank holding a 2.5 per cent stake in Santander. Mr Jose Sevilla, a banking analyst with Madrid brokerage FG Inversiones Bursatiles, said the move was in line with Santander's strategy in Portugal, where they are 'pretty aggressive in terms of introducing new pro-ducts.' Santander shares closed Pta10 down Friday at Pta5,060. BCI operates in retail and investment banking, as well as corporate finance and leasing activities. It has expanded strongly in the past two years, increasing its branches to 86 from 25, with another 20 scheduled to open this year. Assets rose 36 per cent in 1992 to Pta295bn, while deposits rose 40 per cent to Pta177.76bn. Net profit in 1992 reached Pta1.73bn, Santander said, without giving a year earlier figure.</p>

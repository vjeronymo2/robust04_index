			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 9 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- At the  closed sitting of the Mongolian parliament the legislators have  discussed and approved the proposal of the Mongolbank on issuing  new 5 and 10 thousand bank notes as well as new coins of 20, 50,  100 and 200 tugrug of value. The central bank is substantiating  the necessity for such a step by the growing rates in the  prices, wage, pensions and allowances. The coins supposed to  issue are to be serving as a means of fare payment in the public  transport or applying in slot-machines for rendering small  services.</p>

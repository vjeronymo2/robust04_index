			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Survivors of Teutonic hygiene - Common Markets GERMAN and Austrian markets are frequently disappointing places. An obsessive regard for hygiene in both countries tends to rob the stalls of the aesthetic and olfactory appeal of their counterparts in southern Europe. There is just a bit too much plastic wrapping to stir the gastric juices. In many cases, were it not for the much abused Turks, these institutions would have disappeared long ago; for like the British and the American, the Teuton prefers the bovine calm of the supermarket to the aggressive bustle of the streets. Still there are impressive market places in many German and Austrian towns and cities; superb sites such as the Viktualenmarkt in Munich. These days, however, people are more likely to descend on the Viktualenmarkt to scoff a brace of those veal and parsley sausages the Muncheners call Weisswurste than they are to stock up on food. In all German and Austrian cities the or a plate of sausage. The Viktualenmarkt's Viennese equivalent is the Naschmarkt, five minutes walk from the Staatsoper and just behind that art nouveau jewel, the Sezession. Indeed, for some the Naschmarkt is gentler on the eye than it is on the stomach: the buildings were constructed around 1900 when the Wien river was covered over and to the left and right are the Wienzeilen, terraces which contain splendid examples from this rich period in the history of Viennese architecture. The first stalls in the market should be ignored, unless you are looking for a shot of Bratwurst and a roll from one of the many Wurstelstande, a snack at the fish shops belonging to the German Nordsee chain or a look at a few cheese stalls and delicatessens. The stringency of the Austrian law on cheese production and storage makes it almost wholly without interest. In the delicatessens everything is swaddled in unsexy plastic. Further up on the left is a stall which enchanted me on my first visit to Vienna, almost a quarter of a century ago. It is a rare survival among the Turkish and Serbian fruit and vegetable shops in that the accent is wholly Germanic with its great tubs of Sauerkraut and brine-soaked gherkins. The acrid smell which emanates from these strategically placed barrels is to some degree off-set by the nearby spice merchants with their little packets of paprika. These are sold at varying strengths to ensure the correct mix for goulash. Much like Britain, Austria's gastronomic traditions were considerably enriched by borrowing from its subject peoples during the empire. It may be Hungarian in origin, but these days, no Austrian could survive for long without goulash Weekends can be a bore in Vienna. An offensive, frustrating law requires all Austrian shops to close at midday on Saturday. It means you are required to stock up for the whole weekend in the first hours of Saturday morning. The law is relaxed on just one Saturday a month when shops have the right to stay open all day. On Sundays, however, only restaurants are open, and a gloom descends on the city which makes even London look gay. Saturday morning is, however, the best time to visit the Naschmarkt. By ancient tradition Austrian farmers have the right to set up their stalls at the far end of the market, just before the flea market where, if you are on the ball, you occasionally come across interesting old books and records. The advantage of the Bauernmarkt or farmers market, is that fresh products are sold without the prudish plastic coating which is the rule at the Opera end. This is the moment to buy honey; Speck, or fat bacon, cut from the flitch; sausages, including excellent Blunz'n, or black pudding from Burgenland; ham; pumpkin seeds, which make an extremely good nibble with preprandial drinks, or better still Kurbiskernol or pumpkin seed oil from Styria. Virtually unknown in Britain, this dark oil is the soul of a Styrian salad. At vintage time you may also buy Most or grape juice, or Sturm, which is fermenting must, a drink which is meant to go well with onion tart. Only on Saturday mornings does the Naschmarkt live up to the promise of its lovely setting.</p>

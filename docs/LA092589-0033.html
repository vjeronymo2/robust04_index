David Polson, 41, was shot and killed Wednesday after he brandished a  gun at agents who had chased him eight miles from a restaurant. Authorities had  been tipped to his whereabouts after the case was featured Sept. 10 on the  television show "America's Most Wanted." Polson was wanted on an indictment  charging him with the murder of his live-in girlfriend, who disappeared  Christmas Day, 1986. Her body was found Jan. 18, 1987, dumped along a road  north of Las Vegas.  </P></p>

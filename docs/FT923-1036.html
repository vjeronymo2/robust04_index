			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exchequer Levy cut lifts Anglia to Pounds 4.83m ANGLIA Television yesterday announced a 58 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 4.83m, for the six months to the end of June. The growth came from the one-off reduction in Exchequer Levy for the last year of the old ITV franchise system. Anglia's levy payment in the period fell from Pounds 3.47m to Pounds 732,000. From January Anglia will begin paying to the Treasury Pounds 17.8m a year - the bid that regained it the East of England licence - plus 7 per cent of its advertising revenue. Operating profit declined from Pounds 5.45m to Pounds 4.27m in the half year. Expenditure on Anglia's own productions rose from Pounds 7.86m to Pounds 12m Sir Peter Gibbings, chairman, singled out for praise its programmes such as the Survival series, Fay Weldon's Growing Rich and the documentary adaption of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time. He said that after allowing for the increase in costs in both programme production and acquired programmes, the operating profit was similar to last year but below that of 1990. He was confident of further programme commissions under the new competitive ITV networking arrangements. Anglia's advertising revenue was Pounds 53.4m (Pounds 52.2m), with its share of ITV advertising increasing to 6.88 per cent thereby continuing a steady upward trend. Turnover totalled Pounds 67.2m, compared with Pounds 63.8m. Earnings per share rose from 4.35p to 7.04p, and the interim dividend is held at 2.86p. Sir Peter said that despite all the uncertainties over the timing of a recovery from recession, he remained hopeful of a satisfactory result for the year. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits for the full year of about Pounds 15m.</p>

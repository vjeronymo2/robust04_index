			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Observer: Ringing in the stars 1993 was hardly the year of the politician, and nowhere was the lack of inspirational leadership more apparent than at Westminster. But amid the pedestrian greyness of the cabinet and its Labour shadow, some staked a claim to a brighter future. The cabinet's stars, of course, are the Treasury's dynamic duo Kenneth Clarke and Michael Portillo. Clarke, 53, is now firmly established as heir apparent and Portillo, 40, as the next prime minister but one. Sorting out the rest of the runners in the next government reshuffle is more challenging. Stephen Dorrell, 41, a reformed wet and another member of the Treasury team, seems promotable. But there is little to choose between David Curry, 49, at environment, Jonathan Aitken, 51, at defence, Brian Mawhinney, 53, at health, David Heathcot-Amory, 44, at the foreign office, and David Davis, 45, in William Waldegrave's department. For Labour, Tony Blair, 40, the party's leading moderniser, and Robin Cook, 47, from the more traditional soft left, would lead the pack in any contest to succeed John Smith, 55. George Robertson, 47, the hero of the Maastricht debate, is less in the limelight now that he is shadow Scottish secretary, but a bravura performance by John Prescott, 55, at his party's conference confirmed him as a man of influence at the top. Men to watch one rung down are: Alistair Darling, 40, in the Treasury team, Brian Wilson, 45, Labour's rail privatisation expert, Geoffrey Hoon, 40, Robertson's sharp-witted ally in the Maastricht manoeuvrings, and Mike O'Brien, 39, an even younger version of the youthful Blair. But after that the field thins out. Unlike the Tory party, Labour's real stars remain an increasingly elderly bunch of backbench oldies. Peter Shore, 69, Tony Benn, 68, and, of course, Denis Skinner, 61, last year put many of their colleagues to shame.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Flag-carrier recharts growth plan - Daniel Green examines Singapore Airlines's restructuring strategy FOURTEEN hours flying time from Europe or the US may not be far enough for Singapore to escape the effects of recession in the western world. Singapore Airlines (SIA), which has seen capacity grow at 16 per cent a year for the last two decades, seems already to be suffering under the strain. But the world is not entirely to blame for the sharp fall in its profits. Part of the decline is the result of a restructuring at the start of the year which saw several new subsidiaries created in areas such as cargo and catering. Apart from the expense of the restructuring, the airline has seen operating profits hit hard as it is forced to pay commercial rates for engineering services from the newly-separate SIA engineering and maintenance division. The restructuring has a longer-term aim in mind than half a year's operating figures. It is intended to meet an immodest target of 8 to 10 per cent growth a year for the rest of the decade. The task is not an easy one. Mr Cheong Choong Kong, managing director, said SIA's optimism of as recently as 1990 'has been tarnished' by world recession and the possibility of international trade wars. The separation of the cargo division follows similar moves taken recently by the likes of British Airways and Lufthansa, the German carrier. They have all responded to industry forecasts of a more rapid growth in air cargo than passenger numbers: cargo volumes should grow by 40 per cent over the next five years. But Mr Robert Tan, chief executive of the airline's new engineering division, predicts even more rapid growth in his unit, with sales rising from SDollars 580m (USDollars 362.5m) now to SDollars 900m in 1997. If the strategic drive into engineering and maintenance achieves this kind of success, it will have been as much to do with geography and history as traditional airline management. For most of its history, Singapore was a quiet fishing village. Since the middle of the last century the port has grown rapidly as a natural safe haven on busy shipping lanes, helped by the availability of cheap ship repairs. Today, it is the second-largest port in the world. Singapore's ultra-modern Changi airport has suddenly found itself at a similar crossroads. The latest generation of long-haul aircraft can fly non-stop from Europe to south-east Asia, and the next generation, with aircraft being delivered from next year, can bridge the west coast of the US to south-east Asia in one hop. Singapore is a natural choice in the region for refuelling and crew changes. Changi regularly wins prizes for its efficiency, and the addition of a second terminal in 1990 doubled capacity. Passengers and air crew are half an hour from the city centre on a congestion-free motorway. Servicing charges are likely to be keen because the engineering division has a desperate need for new customers. The volume of business from Singapore Airlines is limited because the carrier's fleet is small even by Asian standards. And it has the youngest aircraft in the world, an average of just over five years old, which need less maintenance than those of other carriers. SIA's solution is to offer a 'one-stop' engineering service to other airlines, said Mr Tan. 'We have the facilities, tooling and skills for 90 per cent of accessories on Boeing 747s and 80 per cent on Airbus aircraft.' The division is already contracted to Vietnam Air and Bulgaria's Jes Air, and many others are on the list of potential clients. Mr Tan says he will be able to woo west Asian airlines away from their traditional links with Europe. He will have to move quickly. He admits there will be competition from companies once involved in now shrinking military maintenance contracts, and there are potential competitors elsewhere in the Far East where costs, especially of personnel, are lower than in Singapore. Costs are already a problem across SIA. The company is considering moving its accounting and data processing operations to cheaper centres in India or China. SIA is already marketing its new engineering services hard. It may not take long to see whether its has been nimble enough to capture a significant slice of the long-haul maintenance market.</p>

"They (North Koreans) might have something to give me, but  they needn't tell me to do this or that," he said.    A close associate said Yi thinks it undesirable to visit  North Korea when the nuclear issue remains so touchy. "But there  is no change in his plans to visit North Korea to help establish  smooth inter-Korean relations when an opportune time comes  along," the associate added.    On Tuesday, an unidentified spokesman for North Korea's  Supreme People's Assembly (parliament) issued a statement saying  the speaker's invitation for Yi to visit Pyongyang is still open.    The ruling Democratic Liberal Party also criticized the  North  Korean statement for its hidden motive to create confusion in  South Korean politics.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / The Business Traveller: Tips Top hotels pick up guests from the airport if arrangements are made beforehand. Otherwise, a taxi to the city centre or Sandton will cost about R85 (Pounds 17). Public transport in the city is poor. Visitors need to hire a car, use taxis or employ a chauffeur to get to appointments. Johannesburg has a first-world infrastructure. New visitors are often surprised at the quality of the roads and the telephone system. Staying in touch with the office back home is not a problem. The climate is excellent, but it is not always as clement as foreigners expect. A typical summer can be quite wet, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms and occasional wet spells. Also, although summer days tend to be warm (25-32 degrees Celsius), there can be quite a chill in the evenings. The winters can be cold, but are usually sunny and dry.</p>

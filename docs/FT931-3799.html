			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: A taste of the Pyrenees - The wines of south-west France interest Edmund Penning-Rowsell NORTH of the Atlantic-side Pyrenees, inland from Biarritz and Bayonne and within the big arc of the river Adour, is one of the most unspoiled parts of France. A visit based on Pau, Aire-sur-Adour, St Jean Pied-de-Port and the charming (if faded) small spa town of Salies-de-Bearn provides access to some small wine districts that are re-establishing themselves after decades of decline following the phylloxera ravages of the last century and the subsequent economic difficulties. Madiran and Jurancon have always managed to keep afloat and now have some enterprising private growers, but the region is dominated by co-operatives - without which few growers would have survived. All producers have a lively vente directe trade. The red wines are dominated by the tough, tannic Tannat grape but softened by Cabernet Sauvignon and Franc, and the whites are made from a number of local varieties, notably the Gros and Petit Manseng, the grape of Jurancon, the Petit Courbu, the Arrufiac and the Baroque. Tucked into the Pyrenees in the heart of the Basque country near the Spanish border, the 170 hectares of mountainous vineyards is claimed to be the smallest appellation controlee district in France. It is certainly among the most attractive, with St Jean-Pied-de-Port the walled local capital. Mainly red; most of the wines are made by the co-op in St Etienne de Baigory, but the leading private firm is Brana in St Jean which makes a dry white too, as well as distilling delicious Poire William from its own orchard. In Irouleguy, Ilarria, a small grower, makes excellent Tannat wine. Bearn-Bellocq. To the north of Irouleguy and centred on Salies-de-Bearn, this small district is best known for an attractive rose, made two-thirds white from Gros Manseng and another local grape, Raffiat de Moncade, which has a slight sweetness on the palate. The main co-operative's red wine brand, unsurprisingly in this region, is named Henri de Navarre. Tursan. Thirty miles north of Pau and based on the small town of Geaune, this is a VDQS rather than an AC district. The production is 50 per cent white and 50 per cent red, 90 per cent of this is made by the co-op. The red wine is Tannat blended with the two Cabernets, while the mainly Baroque white is a fairly strong countryish but fresh wine. Michael Guerard, proprietor of the famous spa restaurant and hotel in nearby Eugenie-les-Bains and the inventor of cuisine minceur, is a distinguished member of the co-op. He has his own 10 ha of white wine which is served in the restaurant. The British agent is Corney &amp; Barrow, London, EC2. Jurancon. The village is a suburb of Pau and the big co-op is in adjoining Gan, but most of its 600 hectares are to the south and west. The often spectacularly steep vineyards are on the first abrupt folds of the Pyrenees: lovely country threaded by a web of lanes. Until the 16th century Jurancon was red as well as white, but now is only white, made from the Gros Manseng for the dry and the Petit for the moelleux which is the district's delicious chief claim to fame. Sec was largely developed after the second world war, when sweet wines went out of favour. Tanners of Shrewsbury list the excellent Domaine Latrille's sec Ch Jolys '90 at Pounds 7.16 and the '89 moelleux at Pounds 7.19. Madiran. Twenty-five miles north of Pau, this is the largest and most distinguished AC red wine producer of the area, with nearly 1,300 ha and 50 owners who bottle and market their own wine. It is the centre of Tannat country, accounting for 70 per cent of output, with the two Cabernets forming the balance. Three co-ops make most of the 550,000 cases of AC wine  -although even today only 10 per cent is matured in oak. By the standards of the region there are several large estates. The biggest is Ch Montus and Ch Bouscasse with a combined 60 ha, owned by the energetic Alain Brumont, followed by the Laplace family property of Ch d'Aydie with 45 ha. The other leading vineyards include Chapel Lenclos, Dom. Berthoumieu and Lafitte-Peston. There are strong local efforts to improve quality and limit grape yields, as well as united promotional efforts to improve the image of this historically celebrated deep-coloured, bold, full-flavoured wine. A small amount of dry white is produced under the somewhat hard-to-sell name of Pacharenc du Vic Bilh, but it is welcome in the region's restaurants. In the UK Madiran comes and goes on merchants' lists, but deserves more exposure. Saint-Mont. Much the largest district, covering a wide area in the south-west of the Gers department, to the north of Madiran and the east of Aire-sur-Adour. It only acquired VDQS status in 1981 and is dominated by a union of three co-ops in Saint-Mont, Aignan and Plaisance that sell a large proportion of the 11m bottle output under the name Playmont, with Collection Playmont reserved for the better qualities. About 60 per cent of their production is the popular Vin de Pays Cotes de Gascogne, and a quarter of all Madiran is made at Saint-Mont. The top wine is the Tannat/Cabernet Ch de Sabazon, adjoining the fine, turreted 15th century castle.</p>

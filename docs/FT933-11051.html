			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Victor pledges to continue VAT fight MRS DIANA MADDOCK, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Christchurch, yesterday rounded off her by-election victory by returning to the issue that has always led her campaign - the government's proposal to impose value added tax to heating fuel. Speaking in an atmosphere of Liberal Democrat jubilation - albeit tempered by the low-key political style that has marked Mrs Maddock's campaign - she said the people of Christchurch had 'spoken for Britain'. She pledged that VAT would be her first political battle on arrival in Westminster. At her side Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, said the by-election had been a 'shout of rage' about the government's policies, and showed that the Liberal Democrats were the main opposition to the government in the south of England. The Liberal Democrats said they had been taken aback by the size of their victory. Mr Ashdown warned: 'It does not mean that we have got them (the voters) for ever. I will not predict general elections from by-elections - it's a mug's game.' On the other side of town disappointed and exhausted Conservative party workers insisted that they would regain the seat at the next election. But Mr Rob Hayward, the Conservative candidate, conceded that the government would have to re-examine some areas of policy if it is to prevent further by-election defeats. Speaking with the self-possession that has been the hallmark of his campaign, he said he had lost 'because the voters of the constituency wanted to register a determined protest'. Away from the television cameras some local Conservatives suggested that Mr Hayward's lack of local roots and the fact he is divorced had weakened him in this highly traditional constituency. His agent, Mrs Judith Jamieson, denied that Mr Hayward was becoming a scapegoat, but admitted that the size of the swing had taken many aback. But in spite of the political tremors that the by-election has sent to Westminster, the mood on the streets of Christchurch yesterday remained  - as always - restrained. A few holidaymakers and shoppers politely applauded Mrs Maddock as she made a triumphant tour in an open-topped bus, surrounded by a thicket of television cameras. But some of Mrs Maddock's constituents warned that she remained on probation. Pensioner Mrs Lily Warner said: 'I voted for her this time because I was fed up. But I don't know what I'll do next time. It all depends on her.'</p>

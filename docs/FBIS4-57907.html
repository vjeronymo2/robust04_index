			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Cuban Foreign Minister To Conduct Sweeping Diplomatic </F> Activities" -- PRENSA LATINA headline]    [Text] Havana, 24 May (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina will carry out intense diplomatic activities in  the next few days, beginning with his participation in the  upcoming conference of foreign ministers of the Nonaligned  Movement member-states.    Robaina will leave for Cairo, the host city, on Saturday. He  will head a Cuban delegation which, according to Foreign  Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, will present specific  proposals aimed at maintaining the island's active participation  in the activities of the movement. The meeting will last until  3 June.    From Cairo, Robaina will travel to Qatar, where he was  invited by the Qatar Government to review bilateral relations  and assist in the inauguration of the Cuban Embassy there.    After returning to Havana for a few days, the foreign  minister will, on 12 June, assist in a foreign ministers meeting  that will take place in advance of the Ibero-American Summit,  which will be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, and be  attended by the chiefs of state and government of the two  regions.    Another important trip by Robaina will be one in early July  that will take him to the installation ceremony for the  Association of Caribbean States in the capital of Barbados.    Speaking to a group of domestic and foreign reporters,  Alfonso described these trips as part of the "diplomatic  offensive" Cuba is waging right now. He pointed to the  continuous increase in diplomatic and consular relations between  the island and other nations.    So far, a total of 147 countries maintain diplomatic  relations with the largest of the Antillean islands, a situation  that exposes the lie about Cuba's alleged isolation in the world.</p>

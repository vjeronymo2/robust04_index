The official also appealed to authorities  not to let down their guard facing the subversive enemy so as to  prevent such terrorists from once again sowing unrest among the  people.    Espichan Tumay further noted that the respectable figure was  achieved thanks to the excellent work of the Judicial Branch and  military and reported that in 1993, 1,500 reformed terrorists  had cooperated with the courts.    While observing that the Peruvian people are convinced that  positive progress has been made in the fight, he repeated his  appeal to civilian, military, and police authorities not to rest  on their laurels.    "We must understand that terrorism will continue its  onslaught because some leaders remain at large. Peace will be  achieved only as the result of well-planned, transparent work  and while paying respect to human rights," he said.  <H5>  Presidential Instructions on Human Rights </H5>   He also reported that as a special mission entrusted to him  by President Alberto Fujimori, he has toured the country  explaining to civil authorities and officials in the Judicial  Branch and Attorney General's Office that they must take special  precautions when apprehending individuals.    "The Police have been technically and scientifically trained  and will find evidence proving whether or not a person is  responsible for a crime. Otherwise, the rights of any citizen  could be violated," he explained.    He said errors have been made in some cases and that the  proper authorities have been duly notified, but added that what  was important was "not to make any more."    Espichan Tumay said he is confident that with a titular  Supreme Court, things will improve.    "A great deal remains to be done. We still have many  prisoners who have been charged and all of Peru's higher courts  must also be instructed to follow the same procedures applied in  Lima," he said.</p>

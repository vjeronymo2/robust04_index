			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' CHOICE: UTRILLO'S MOTHER BY SARAH BAYLIS (RUTGERS PRESS: $19.95; 246  PP.)  </P> <P> "Baylis writes about art and politics, women and sex, oppression, freedom,  self-expression and social stigma from an ardently feminist perspective. Her  vision is frank and refreshing, sparing neither the sacred cows of  Impressionism nor our preconceptions of their world as portrayed in their  paintings." Heather Meredith Keeve  </P></p>

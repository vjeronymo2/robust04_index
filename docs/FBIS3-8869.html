			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Ex-Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar and four other members of his cabinet, at a  parliamentary meeting today, for the first time since the 1992  elections, presented themselves in a new role of opposition  deputies.    With the formal confirmation of the transition of the  coalition of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and  the Slovak National Party (SNS) to the opposition the parliament  house order has also been changed.    Since June 1992, of the HZDS 74 deputies only 56 were left  after the withdrawal of the eight deputies supporting former  Foreign Minister Milan Knazko, the other eight members of the  former Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik's Alternative of  Political Realism, a faction within the HZDS, and the other two  HZDS deputies who became independent.    The transfer of former Deputy Premier Jozef Prokes into  parliament after he left his post in the government increased  the number of the SNS deputies to the nine while the opposition  lost one vote at the same time as Prokes replaced Milan Janicina  who together with the National Democratic Club of the SNS former  Chairman Ludovit Cernak went into the camp of Meciar's opponents.    The current opposition surrounding Meciar has 67 votes in  the  150-member parliament. The camp of the arising government  coalition could rely on 83 votes at the best while a  three-fifths majority of votes (90 from 150) is required for the  key constitutional laws, for example, the law on early  elections, to be passed in parliament.    From the five parties which will be represented in the new  government, the Democratic Left Party (SDL) is the strongest  parliamentary party with 28 mandates, followed by the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH) with 18 deputies. "The Center Bloc"  is made of eight deputies from the Alliance of Slovak Democrats  (ADSR), eight representatives of the group surrounding Moravcik  and Roman Kovac and five deputies from Cernak's National  Democratic Club.    Egyutteles (Coexistence), a Hungarian minority movement, and  the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) are also  participating in forming a new government with their nine and  five deputies respectively. The new cabinet can apparently also  count on the votes of Marcela Gburova, an independent deputy,  and deputy Imrich Mori, who left the HZDS deputies' group.    The parliamentary arithmetic reflects, however, just the  momentarily state of things, which is quickly changing.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Management: Change while you are ahead - Hewlett-Packard is in good shape but its chief executive is fighting complacency Compared with his peers in the computer industry, Lew Platt seems to have a soft number. When he became chief executive of Hewlett-Packard in October 1992, the US company's revenues and operating earnings were growing strongly, while other large computer companies were suffering heavy losses. Yet Platt is not taking life easy. 'One of the tremendous advantages that I've had is that HP was in fundamentally good shape when I took on this job,' he says, 'but we can't let ourselves become complacent'. The fear of being lulled into a false sense of security by HP's current success is almost an obsession for Platt. 'People ask: 'What do you think about when you're in the shower or shaving?' Well, I think about how easy it is to just keep doing what you are doing today for a little bit too long. 'General Motors, Sears, International Business Machines were the greatest companies in their industries, the best of the best in the world. These companies did not make gigantic mistakes. They were not led by stupid, inept people. The only real mistake they made was to keep doing whatever it was that had made them successful for a little too long.' Resistance to change is the root cause of the demise of industry-leading companies, Platt believes. 'The real secret is to build an organisation that isn't afraid to make changes while it is still successful, before change becomes imperative for survival.' For HP, however, there is a strong temptation not to 'rock the boat'. It recently overtook Digital Equipment to become the second largest US computer company in terms of revenues. It is now the world market leader in 'open systems' minicomputers, computer printers, and test and measurement equipment. It ranks second in the market for computer workstations and eighth in personal computers. But getting there was not easy. HP went through a rough patch in the late 1980s and 1990 as it cut back its workforce, reduced bureaucracy and reorganised its operations several times in search of an efficient structure. With hindsight, it seems that HP was ahead of its competitors in making difficult adjustments to fundamental changes in the computer market. It 'anticipated well necessary changes in technology', says John Jones of Salomon Brothers, the US broking house. HP was in the forefront of the shift from proprietary computers to 'open systems' based on industry standards. The company was the first to implement Reduced Instruction Set Computing (Risc) technology in mid-range and mainframe computer systems, providing high performance at lower costs. HP has also been faster to come to terms with an industry-wide decline in gross profit margins as computer prices fall. Over the past five years, its operating expenses have declined from more than 40 per cent of revenues in 1988 to 28 per cent in the first fiscal quarter of 1994 (which ended on January 31). Achieving a 'leadership cost structure' in each of its businesses is a top goal. 'Each business has to stand on its own, be profitable and finance its own growth,' says Bob Wayman, chief financial officer. 'You make investments and take your losses for a period, but then you have to test the viability of a business by its profitability.' One of HP's core strengths may be that it is founded and run by engineers who enjoy inventing products. In contrast to its largest competitors, HP brings new technology to market - even at the risk of cannibalising sales of its existing products - to maintain competitive advantage. 'Withholding technology or the next price cut may seem like a good way to maximise profit margins, but it's a deadly game,' says Platt. Under Platt's leadership 'HP' now also stands for what he calls 'healthy paranoia'. Managers are urged to be 'always looking over your shoulder at the competition, always thinking about the next move'. In HP's prize printer division, this is practised almost to a fault. 'We sometimes tend not to celebrate our successes as much as we should,' says Rick Belluzo, head of HP's Computer Products Organisation, which includes printers and personal computers. The risk is that by focusing too much on competition, HP could lose sight of what customers really want. If success has not created a more relaxed environment at HP, it does at least allow top managers to concentrate on long-term market and technology trends. Platt has initiated a drive to create products and businesses that take advantage of the company's unusual combination of technology expertise in measurement, computing and communications (MCC)  - or 'MC squared' as he calls it. Last year, he created an MCC council, composed of top technical and marketing staff from throughout the company, to identify potential new 'multi-disciplinary' products. 'We're hunting for big game,' says Joel Birnbaum, head of HP's research laboratories. To make the most of its different technology groups, Platt is encouraging 'cross-organisational collaboration'. The booming telecommunications market, for example, is addressed by a marketing team drawn from both the computer systems organisation and the test and measurement business. Similarly, in sales and product development, geographic and business organisation boundaries are being breached. Platt admits he is unsure whether HP will have to create divisions to formalise these 'virtual organisations' at some point. For the moment, however, he seems to be resisting the inevitable upheaval of a reorganisation. In his 28-year career at HP, he has seen too many. That does not mean that he is not shaking up HP. 'Whatever we're doing that made us successful today won't be good in 1996, I can guarantee that,' he tells his staff. 'It might work in 1994. Maybe it'll even work in 1995, but it will kill you by 1996.'</p>

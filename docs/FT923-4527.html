			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Names look to reports for help LLOYD'S NAMES who have suffered multi-million pound losses from catastrophe reinsurance believe evidence from a Lloyd's investigation will help them win compensation, Richard Lapper writes. The interim report into the losses of Devonshire syndicates 216 and 833/834, prepared by a a committee headed by Mr Anthony Blake of accountancy firm Neville Russell, is one of several being prepared by Lloyd's to examine the losses of syndicates which participated in spiral reinsurance, in which syndicates and companies reinsured each other's catastrophe losses. Names, the individuals whose capital supports the Lloyd's insurance market, have suffered heavy losses from spiral reinsurance business. Lloyd's expects to disclose details of three other reports - into the Feltrim, Gooda Walker and Rose Thomson Young syndicates over the next four months. The Devonshire report alleges underwriters bought inadequate reinsurance and that the former board of the Devonshire agency failed 'to properly discharge its responsibilities'. Mr Christopher Stockwell, a Devonshire Name and leader of the Lloyd's Names Association Working Party, which links Names' action groups of lossmaking Names, described it as 'utterly damning'. During 1989 and 1990 losses by Devonshire syndicate 216 amounted to Pounds 338m compared with a stamp capacity (or capital base) of Pounds 43.4m, while the losses of syndicate 833/834 amount to Pounds 151m, compared with a stamp of Pounds 43m. The report says both syndicates have had difficulty in making recoveries from reinsurers.</p>

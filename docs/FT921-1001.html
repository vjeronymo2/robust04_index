			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium forecast to lead metals out of recession ALUMINIUM WOULD lead traded metals out of recession in the second half of this year, said Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, at a mining seminar in London yesterday. The aluminium price already had risen by 14 per cent on the London Metal Exchange since the begining of this year and it was about to benefit from the time when demand was seasonally at its strongest: in April-June. Uncertainty about supply was also being felt because 50 per cent of US capacity was affected by negotiations about labour contracts which expired on May 31. While exports from Russia to the west, which caused much havoc in the aluminium market last year, might reach 600,000 to 800,000 tonnes in 1992, this was below the 1m tonnes projected at the beginning of 1992. Mr Moore suggested that the record level of LME aluminium stocks - now at 1.16m tonnes - would not hold back the recovery in aluminium prices. Once consumers saw stocks going down they would know prices must go up and would buy as much as possible to beat the price increases. 'We will be surprised at the pace at which LME stocks will come down,' he predicted. The industry had already cut 952,000 tonnes of annual capacity or 6.3 per cent of western world output. But there was no room for complacency because planned new annual capacity to come on stream in 1992 totalled 645,000 tonnes. Ord Minnett forecast that aluminium's price would average 65 cents a lb this year, still well below the 75 cents which many producers said was needed to make new capacity worthwhile. Mr Moore predicted that copper would be the only traded metal with a lower average price this year than in 1992. Sumitomo of Japan had taken action that kept LME copper prices up last year and supply disruptions in Chile and Zaire had provided the metal with 'a bridge across the recession'. His colleague, Mr Geoff Campbell, said the gold industry was in crisis after 10 years of falling prices and rising costs. The industry was not able to sustain itself at today's gold prices and was cutting exploration expenditure and capital spending. 'In this climate people will not be going out looking for gold - or digging it out either.' However, he suggested the longer-term outlook for gold was positive because the industry had little alternative but to cut high-cost production and thus reduce supply. Present low prices should ensure demand would rise. Mr Campbell said it was likely that during the recovery there would be less forward selling by producers than in the recent past to put a 'cap' on the price.  --------------------------------------------------------                METAL PRICE FORECASTS                                   1991   1992   1993  -------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium (US c/lb)               59.1     65     78 Copper (US c/lb)                 106.1    105    112 Lead (US c/lb)                    25.3     28     32 Zinc (US c/lb)                    50.7     55     62 Tin (US Dollars/lb)               2.52   2.85   3.50 Nickel (USDollars/lb)             3.70   3.85   4.50 Gold (USDollars/oz)                362    375    400 Silver (USDollars/oz)             4.05   4.40   4.70 OECD Industrial output growth     -0.5%  +2.1%  +4.8%  -------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Ord Minnett  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

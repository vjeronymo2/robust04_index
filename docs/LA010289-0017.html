			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: DOCUMENTARY SERIES FOCUSES ON SOCIAL ISSUES  </P> <P> Four feature-length documentaries on social and political issues will be shown  over the next three weekends at the Monica 4-Plex. They will be screened  Saturday and Sunday mornings simultaneously but with staggered starting times:  Cathy Zheutlin's "Just One Step: The Great Peace March" (10:15), Martyn Burke's  "Witnesses: Afghanistan -- The Untold Story" (10:30), Morley Markson's "Growing  Up in America" (10:45) and Beverly Shaffer's "To a Safer Place" (11).  </P> <P> All of them are worthy rather than dazzling efforts, and they all tend to pound  out the points that their makers wish to make.  </P> <P> The most affecting is "To a Safer Place," an occasionally awkward and  self-conscious but rewarding study of Shirley Turcotte, a 36-year-old Vancouver  phone company executive, wife and mother, who reveals her nightmarish  childhood. From the time she was a toddler until she was at last able to escape  to a foster home at 14, she was the victim of her brutal father's incest. By  the time Turcotte was filmed she had already pretty much come to terms with her  past and had become an activist in the prevention of child abuse; consequently,  the film is more in the spirit of advocacy rather than self-discovery. Even so,  her conversations with her family and even former neighbors are strong stuff,  and the film makes clear the awful helplessness and guilt of the abused child.  </P> <P> "Just One Step: The Great Peace March" captures the tremendously spiritual  experience those 500 anti-war, anti-nuke protesters underwent in the course of  their 1986 nine-month march from Los Angeles to Washington. Unfortunately, the  film in its attempt to hammer home its message becomes repetitive and wearying  long before the marchers reach the District of Columbia. There are some nifty  moments along the way, however -- e.g., the elderly man who runs the Reagan  Information Center in the President's hometown, Dixon, Ill., and who reasons  that "more bombs make for more jobs."  </P> <P> "Witnesses" is an illuminating, comprehensive and utterly relentless account of  the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, focusing on the incredibly brave, resilient  and unyielding Afghans and a remarkable band of Westerners who are trying to  come to their aid. This is a sobering, invaluable account of a war that has  been called "Russia's Vietnam," but we're shown so much suffering that the film  becomes numbing.  </P> <P> On a lighter note "Growing Up in America" contrasts footage of a group of '60s  radicals with contemporary interviews with them. Inevitably, there's Abbie  Hoffman, who has kept the faith, Jerry Rubin, who thinks he has, even though  he's become a Manhattan entrepreneur, and Allen Ginsberg, who remains  wonderfully transcendent no matter how often he shows up in such documentaries.  Of the 10 subjects attorney William Kunstler is by far the most incisive. While  acknowledging that he has lived a good, fulfilling life he stresses that in  regard to racism and other social ills, America has actually changed very  little since the '60s.  </P> <P> Monica 4-Plex information: (213) 394-9741.  </P> <P> As a curtain-raiser to its weekend morning New Chinese Cinema series, the Nuart  is presenting Sunday and next Monday Xie Fei and U Lan's exquisite "Girl From  Hunan," adapted from a 60-year-old classic novel by Shen Congwen that indicts  the cruelty of child marriage. As it tells of the fate of a 16-year-old peasant  girl, Xiao Xiao (Na Renhua), already married for four years to a boy a decade  her junior, it exudes a sensuality that has been exceedingly rare in the  Chinese cinema and has some nude scenes that are, in fact, regarded as a first.  </P> <P> At first Xiao Xiao's life seems reasonably idyllic -- for one thing she somehow  escaped having her feet bound -- but then she and a farmhand (Deng Xiaotung),  too poor to afford a wife, become mutually attracted. Considering the zealous  puritanism of their community the film concludes surprisingly (though not  without irony). The film is set in 1910 but it might as well be antiquity, yet  it's clear that its feminist sentiments are meant to reverberate in today's  China.

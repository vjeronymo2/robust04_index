			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Nadashkevich </F> and Vilor Niyazmatov]    [Text] Tashkent 5 June -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov  called his South Korean counterpart Kim Young-sam to cooperate  in promoting a peace settlement of the Tajik-Afghan conflict.    Speaking about prospects for bilateral relations during a  reception in honor of the high guest, the Uzbek leader stressed  that all preconditions for these ties had been created during  the past two years.    Encouraging South Korean entrepreneurs to step up  investments  in Uzbekistan's key industries, Karimov described Uzbek cotton,  gold, well-organized chemical and metallurgical industries as  the best guarantee of their investments. The republic's  president also belives that Uzbekistan and South Korea could  closely cooperate in international political issues, for example  to work for a nuclear- free status for the Central Asian region.    In his turn, the South Korean president said he believed in  the great future of the newly-independent Uzbek state, which is  to play a key role in Central Asia in the near future.    Speaking about over 200,000 ethnic Koreans living in  Uzbekistan, Kim Young-sam thanked Uzbek people for their warm  and hearty attitude towards his compatriots. Were it not for  their assistance, the bitter fate of the Koreans deported from  the Far East under Josef Stalin's order would have been even  more tragic, the South Korean leader noted. He said he did not  worry about his fellow-countrymen living in Uzbekistan.</p>

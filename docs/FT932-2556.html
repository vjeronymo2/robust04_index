			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / 82% of 16-year-olds 'stay in education or training' CAREERS services yesterday revealed that 82 per cent of 16-year-olds in the UK are remaining in full-time education or training. A study by the National Heads of the Careers Service showed that in England and Wales alone, 65 per cent of 16-year-olds stayed in full-time education last year, 13.2 per cent chose youth training and 7.7 per cent employment. In England and Wales in 1989 18.2 per cent of 16-year-olds went into employment, while only 48.2 per cent stayed at school. Much of the increase has been caused by job scarcity. The take-up of youth training has also fallen, from 21.7 per cent in 1989. In Northern Ireland 66 per cent stayed in education and 4 per cent entered employment. A survey of 224 employers, published yesterday by Industrial Relations Services, the research organisation, shows that job scarcity will worsen this year. It found that only a third of employers would definitely recruit school leavers this summer, with a further quarter uncertain of their plans. Nearly 40 per cent said they would not recruit school leavers - compared with 11 per cent last year. School Leavers' Destinations 1992.

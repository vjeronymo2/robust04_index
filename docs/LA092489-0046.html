			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOORAY FOR HOSTS  </P> <P> My wife and I have just returned from our first vacation in New Zealand. It was  a great success, due to reading about June Hawes of New Zealand Travel Hosts  (Jerry Hulse's Travel Tips, Feb. 26).  </P> <P> The farms and B&amp;Bs that June reserved for us were excellent. These are not  the cheapest (nor most expensive) places to stay in New Zealand, but they are  the best. We feel that the people who were our hosts have become our friends.  They were important in helping us determine the best use of our time in their  areas.  </P> <P> The optional evening dinners that are available were the best food we had on  the trip.  </P> <P> We would recommend New Zealand Travel Hosts, especially for first-time  travelers to New Zealand. The address is New Zealand Travel Hosts, 279 Williams  St., Kaiapoi, Christchurch, New Zealand.  </P> <P> ROBERT A. MCKENZIE  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Ford to cut car output further FORD is to extend short-time working at its car assembly plant in Dagenham, east London, to the end of November in a further move to cut production in the face of weakening sales in the UK and continental European markets. The short-time working at Ford will affect about 5,000 employees in the Dagenham car assembly plant, which produces the Fiesta car and which exports around half of its output. For four weeks from next Monday, the plant will in effect work only the first 2 1/2 days of each week, with production halting after the Wednesday day shift. In the final week of November, the plant will work a three-day week with two shifts a day from Monday to Wednesday. The output of about 11,400 Fiestas will be cut during the next five weeks. That follows earlier cuts during September and October. Both Ford's car plants, at Dagenham and at Halewood, Merseyside, have in effect been working only a three-day week this month, and output has also been cut sharply at Ford's Transit van plant in Southampton. Ford has been forced to cut production at most of its assembly plants in continental Europe. The company said yesterday that it was still reviewing production plans for its Halewood plant during November. In a similar move, Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of Dutch commercial vehicle maker DAF, is stopping production at its van plant in Birmingham and on its light truck assembly line in Leyland, Lancashire, for two weeks in November.

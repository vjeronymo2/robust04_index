			<p>Language: <F P=105>Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. A. Abashkina, V. I. Korolkov, Ya. S. </F> Rimshans, Yu. I. Skryl, T. S. Tabarov]    [Abstract]Numerical calculations are performed for the  transient characteristics of vertical GaAs field-effect  phototransistors with various levels of lighting and voltage  values on the source and shutter, which creates a potential  barrier for electrons. Photocurrent, potential energy  distributions, and times to establish steady state and the gain  in phototransistors with a concealed shutter for small light  sources are calculated and the results presented. It is shown  that for both a small barrier and a large barrier, the times for  establishing steady photocurrent amount to several nanoseconds  and depend on the voltage on the shutter. As voltage on the  shutter is increased, speed increases. However, the photocurrent  of the structure simultaneously decreases. A reduction in  photocurrent at high voltages on the shutter causes a reduction  in the properties of the structure. 5 figures, 1 chart and 21  references.</p>

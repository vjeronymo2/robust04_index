			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Letter: Defending Britain's vocational education and training Sir, Your otherwise excellent article, 'Lessons to be learnt in vocational training' (April 27), perpetuates the fashionable myth that 'Britain's training regime is poor, with nothing comparable to Germany's 'dual system' of work-plus-training'. In fact, the quality of Britain's vocational education and training at the comparable craft/technician level is much better than that of Germany, or indeed France, despite the poorer foundation laid at school. Our problem is that not enough young Britons benefit from it. A higher staying-on rate is the proffered solution. But we are in danger of losing our lead on quality if more do remain, in schools especially, on poorly resourced vocational programmes which are not complemented with industrial experience. The funding regime is the key. The Germans and French do not expect employers to fund education and training which is not cost-effective. To the extent that the state does not pay, individuals do in the shape of income forgone, in return for national qualifications. Competence-based national vocational qualifications and Training and Enterprise Councils should help us with quality and numbers, if only the government would let both operate more flexibly within a national framework.

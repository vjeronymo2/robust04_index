			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY GETS 'VICTORVILLE 5' BRUTALITY CASE  </P> <P> Calling it a case about "truth, justice, freedom and the American way of life,"  a lawyer for five Mexican men allegedly beaten by Victorville sheriff's  deputies in 1988 asked jurors Friday to award them $6.7 million to "send a  message" that "we don't tolerate this kind of conduct here in the United  States, ever."  </P> <P> Stephen Yagman told jurors all they had to do was "look at the videotape" that  recorded the incident to see that the five San Bernardino County Sheriff's  Department deputies brutally beat the men and unlawfully arrested them in a  Victorville front yard on June 30, 1988.  </P> <P> Jury deliberations began late Friday.  </P> <P> In closing arguments of the three-week civil trial in Los Angeles Federal  Court, Yagman said of contradictory accounts from deputies: "God only knows  what these officers would have said happened if this videotape didn't exist."  </P> <P> But David A. Lawrence, attorney for the deputies, cautioned jurors that the  four-minute videotape of the confrontation offers only one, limited perspective  on the incident. Too conveniently, he added, it begins after one of the men  shoved a deputy and tried to grab the guns of two of the officers. Lawrence  asserted that jurors were being shown only part of what he believes was once a  longer videotape.  </P> <P> The case of the so-called "Victorville Five" is one of the first in which a  videotape has been used as evidence in a police brutality case in Federal  Court. Latino activists from San Bernardino County say the film also has  provided the first substantive evidence of what they allege has been a pattern  of racially motivated acts of brutality by deputies against minorities.  </P> <P> The videotape, made by a neighbor, "captures in living color the acts of police  brutality we have said all along take place in our community," Armando Navarro,  executive director of a San Bernardino-based civil rights organization, said at  a news conference on the courthouse steps Friday.  </P> <P> Relations between law enforcement and minorities have improved dramatically  since the 1988 incident, which began with a complaint about a loud, drunken  party, Navarro said. But it took this case and "the videotape of the violence  to begin a process of perestroika within the San Bernardino County Sheriff's  Department," he said.  </P> <P> Also named in the civil rights suit are Sheriff Floyd Tidwell and the County of  San Bernardino. U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima has ruled that claims  against Tidwell and the county would be tried separately by the same jury, but  only if jurors decide that the constitutional rights of one or more of the  plaintiffs were violated.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs -- Jose Serrano; his father, Efren Serrano; his brother, Victor  Serrano, and friends Auro Ruiz and Javier Ruelas -- claim that they suffered  serious bruises and injuries that went untreated. The lawyer for the deputies  has argued that the injuries amount to bruises and scratches, none of which  required hospitalization or immediate medical attention.  </P> <P> Yagman asked jurors Friday to award the plaintiffs $5,700 to cover medical  bills, a total of $1.7 million to compensate them for their pain and suffering,  and another $5 million in punitive damages as a message to the San Bernardino  County Sheriff's Department, and law enforcement agencies elsewhere.  </P> <P> In his closing arguments, Lawrence summarized contradictions in the testimony  of the five men about the alleged beatings. He said deputies did use batons,  fists, elbows and a chokehold to subdue the five men. But that force, he said,  was needed to control combative men who had been drinking beer for more than 12  hours in their front yard.  </P> <P> "It's very easy (for jurors) to look at that videotape . . . because there is  no risk involved," Lawrence told them. "It's very different if you are a deputy  (looking at the same situation)."  </P></p>

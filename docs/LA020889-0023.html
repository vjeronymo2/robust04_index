			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> HAMILTON STICKS WITH STANDARDS  </P> <P> Scott Hamilton, whose three day run at Alfonse's ends tonight, has become a  symbol of the jazz world's youthful traditionalists.  </P> <P> Despite exposure to (and respect for) all the vicissitudes of the tenor  saxophone during the post-swing era, Hamilton continues to convey through his  horn the warmly impassioned values one associates with the trend-setters of the  1930s and '40s.  </P> <P> He growls not, neither does he honk or squeal. All one expects from him is the  natural sound of this inherently beautiful instrument, brought to bear on some  of the great standard songs. Very rarely does he play a tune that was composed  after he was born. That was his modus operandi when he began his professional  career in Providence, R.I.; today, at 34, now an international star, he remains  happily unchanged in his ways.  </P> <P> Whenever possible Hamilton joins with a group of his old Rhode Island  associates. On this occasion, for the usual economic reasons, he is working  with a local rhythm section. This seems much less restrictive when you consider  that he is backed at Alfonse's by the Gerald Wiggins Trio, with Bob Maize on  bass and Jake Hanna on drums.  </P> <P> Wiggins is the all-purpose pianist, as rhapsodically compelling on a ballad  like "Skylark" as he is rhythmically engaging in an up-tempo blues. As for  Maize, a chorus by this limber performer is much more than a mere interlude  between piano solo and saxophone finale; it's an event, an important entity in  itself.  </P> <P> Hamilton chooses mutually compatible material: "I Hear a Rhapsody," "Candy,"  "But Beautiful." Without sounding derivative, he brings colorfully to life the  verities established decades ago by giants like Coleman Hawkins and Ben  Webster. Once described as a good wind who was blowing us no ill, he continues  nobly to live up to that characterization. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

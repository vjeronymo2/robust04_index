			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>   [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa  [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] (RAM) expressed  dissatisfaction over the performance of the government panel  lead by Prof. Alfredo Tadiar, saying the panel is incapable of  making important decisions regarding the ongoing talks.    In a briefing with BUSINESS WORLD, cashiered Army Lt. Col.  Gregorio Honasan commented the panel cannot make independent  moves, particularly on key issues surrounding peace negotiations.    Mr. Honasan said the release of alleged communist Secretary  General Wilma Tiamzon demonstrated the power of the government  panel tasked to negotiate with the communist National Democratic  Front (NDF).    The group has been asking for the release of six RAM members  who continue to be detained allegedly due to their participation  in the series of coups launched against the Aquino  Administration.    Ambassador Howard Dee, government panel chairman tasked to  negotiate with the NDF, was said to be one of those who  convinced President Ramos to release Ms. Tiamzon to save the  peace talks. Mr. Dee told BUSINESS WORLD he is also personally  arranging for the release of more or less 350 political  prisoners still detained in Muntinlupa and other parts of the  country.    On the other hand, Mr. Tadiar said the release of the six  soldiers should be left to "judicial discretion" and that the  matter should be left to the courts. "Bakit si Wilma Tiamzon  pinalaya nila? (Why did they release...) We have been asking for  the release of our comrades since 1992," Mr. Honasan said.    Similarly, RAM compared Mr. Tadiar's panel with the  government panel negotiating with the Moro National Liberation  Front (MNLF). Last March, Ambassador Manuel Yan, panel chairman,  allowed MNLF chief Nur Misuari to bring with him 100 heavily  armed bodyguards around Mindanao.    During the barangay [village] election period this month,  RAM  said they were not given permits to carry firearms. One RAM  member said Mr. Tadiar told the group he can only make  recommendations to the Commission on Elections (Comelec) for  them to be exempted. Mr. Tadiar told BUSINESS WORLD his panel  will be answerable to the Comelec if the procedure in applying  for gun ban exemption permit was not followed.    "They allowed Misuari armed bodyguards but they would not  allow us to bring guns to protect ourselves," they said.    As to whether or not the group wants Mr. Tadiar replaced,  Mr.  Honasan said "it's not for us to decide." If President Ramos  thinks Tadiar is good, it is up to him to retain the panel  chairman," he stated.    Still, Navy Captain Felix Turingan said they have been  consulted on the panel chairman's performance but "we refused to  comment."    Other RAM members who attended the press briefing were  former  Army Lt. Col. Jake Malajacan, Army major Abraham Puruganan and  lawyer Rick Blancaflor.</p>

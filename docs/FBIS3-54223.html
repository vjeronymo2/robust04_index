			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our correspondent in Rashayya reports that an  armored Israeli unit consisting of a tank and 15 soldiers  advanced 1 km north of the border strip from its positions on  the hill of Kawkaba. The force raked the area of Qilya and  Dallafah with heavy machine guns for one hour. No casualties  have been reported.    Meanwhile, our correspondent in Tyre cited arrivals from the  border strip that the Israeli forces reinforced their positions  in the western and central sectors with artillery batteries,  tanks, and personnel carriers. This followed the recent  resistance operations against a number of joint Israeli-South  Lebanese Army posts.    In a related development, Israeli warplanes flew over the  western and central sectors today, breaking the sound barrier.</p>

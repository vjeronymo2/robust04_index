			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, April 29 (AFP) -- Former King Mihai of  Romania on Friday [29 April] accused Romanian authorities of  preventing him from visiting his homeland for this weekend's  Orthodox Easter celebrations, saying it was acting out of fear.    "Despite their promises, those who govern you, who have not  overcome their fear of the links which exist between you and I,  are not allowing me to celebrate Easter with you, in Timisoara,"  the former king said in a message to Romanians.    The 72-year-old former king said he felt bitter that his  country's leaders were "upholding the unjust decision" taken  more than 40 years ago.    The king was forced to abdicate in 1947 and the communist  regime took away his Romanian citizenship a year later.    On Thursday, the former king said too many "restrictive  conditions" had been imposed on him by the Romanian authorities  for him to be able to visit.    "My fate is in your hands. My return to my country depends  on each and every one of you," he said in his message. He had  not lost hope of being able to return to Romania, he added.    Since the Romanian revolution in 1989, the former king, who  lives in exile in Switzerland, has only once been allowed to  return to Romania, for Easter 1992. He was welcomed by large  crowds.    The government was on Friday criticised by certain sections  of the Romanian press, who said it had no respect for people's  rights when those rights conflicted with its interests.    The authorities imposed a series of conditions on the former  king's proposed visit and insisted that he go to a town other  than Timisoara, the place where the 1989 revolution began and  whose mayor is a member of the opposition.    Presidential spokesman Traian Chebeleu said the authorities  had shown good will and had no responsibility for the  cancellation of the visit.    The authorities' refusal to allow the former king to attend  festivities last December caused a political storm and the  opposition boycotted official celebrations in protest.</p>

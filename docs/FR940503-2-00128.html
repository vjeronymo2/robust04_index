			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an interim solution, DTC proposed for comment the implementation of an additional $500 million line of credit dedicated to the completion of settlement in the SDFS system in the event a participant fails to settle after application of the unwind procedures. The additional line of credit would be supported by securities pledged to the SDFS fund and would not be included as a part of DTC's liquidity resources when determining a participant's net debit cap. DTC also proposed as a long term solution, a SDFS system enhancement that would conduct default scenarios to assure that unwind procedures would not cause a liquidity problem. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> DTC has proposed two SDFS system enhancements that will eventually replace the additional line of credit dedicated to settlement in the SDFS system. The future system enhancements will retain unwind procedures but will allow DTC to run intraday computerized double default scenarios ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> an MMI issuer default and an SDFS participant default due to debits created by the unwind procedures) to help assure that each participant's net debit is within DTC's liquidity resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the first system enhancement, DTC will subtract from a participant's actual overall SDFS net debit or credit amount the amount of the participant's largest provisional net credit due to transactions in any single issuer's MMIs. DTC then will limit the resulting net debit from all other SDFS transactions (``liquidity net debit'') to the amount of DTC's liquidity resources (``liquidity net debit cap''), which as of April 18, 1994, was approximately $760 million. If a transaction will cause a participant's liquidity net debit to exceed DTC's liquidity net debit cap, DTC will block and recycle the transaction until credits are received from transactions in MMIs of MMI issues other than those of the issuer of the largest provisional net credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the second system enhancement, DTC will subtract the amount of a participant's largest provisional net credit due to transactions in any single issuer's MMIs from the participant's collateral monitor (``simulated collateral monitor''). If a transaction will cause the simulated collateral monitor to turn negative ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> the participant's collateral would be insufficient to cover its simulated net debit after the transaction), the transaction will be blocked. Blocked transactions will be recycled until credits from other transactions in MMIs of issuers other than those of the largest provisional net credit cause the simulated collateral monitor to be positive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DTC expects to implement the two system enhancements subsequent to the industry conversion to same-day funds settlement that is scheduled for implementation in 1996. Letter from Richard B. Nesson, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, DTC, to Peter R. Geraghty, [Staff Attorney], Division of Market Regulation, Commission (April 18, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

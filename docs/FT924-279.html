			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Japan current account surplus tops Dollars 106bn JAPAN'S current account surplus in November rose 48 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 10.4bn (Pounds 6.8bn) bringing the cumulative total so far this year to Dollars 106.2bn, the first time it has topped Dollars 100bn. The government expects the surplus to go on rising in coming months, overshadowing the previous yearly record of Dollars 87bn in 1987 and possibly prompting an increase in trade tension with the US and European Community. Finance ministry officials said the surge in the surplus last month was caused by a fall in demand for imports (down 5.7 per cent) and an unusually large Dollars 1.1bn surplus in invisible items, which resulted from a decline in the travel account deficit and an increase in the investment account surplus. The travel account deficit has fallen for three consecutive months because of a decrease in tourism departures, a side-effect of the economic downturn, while Japanese companies are thought to be repatriating an increasing amount of their returns on foreign investment. In the long-term capital account, foreigners' net sales of Japanese shares were Dollars 1.48bn during the month, compared with net sales of Dollars 86m in October. Net purchases of Japanese bonds were Dollars 1.5bn, a sharp turnround from net sales of Dollars 3.6bn the previous month. Net Japanese purchases of foreign stocks totalled Dollars 994m, compared with Dollars 761m in October. The overall balance of payments showed a surplus of Dollars 149m, compared with Dollars 12.6bn in the same month last year. Leadership tussle, Page 3 Japanese stocks, Page 27</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Emmanuel Duvivier] </F>   [Text] The national Air Force could earn several billion  francs by selling its old aircraft. Several countries,  including Chile, could buy up to 20 Mirage-5 type aircraft from  Belgium. The planes were modernized recently before being  parked in a hangar as a result of the Belgian Armed Forces  restructuring plan. Emmanuel Duvivier reports:    [Begin recording] [Duvivier] Last September, these Mirage-5  fighters flew over the Bierset region [site of a major Belgian  Air Force base] for the last time as a consequence of the cuts  implemented by Defense Minister Leo Delcroix. Since then, the  planes have been kept at a military field near the border with  the Netherlands pending offers by potential buyers, and are  beginning to rust. The Charleroi-based SABCA [Belgian  Aeronautic Construction Company], which recently modernized the  aircraft, has been asked to investigate the international market  on behalf of the Belgian state. Preference will be given to  potential buyers from democratic countries. The most likely  candidates for now are the Philippines and above all Chile.    [Delcroix] Chile is a democracy. There is civilian control  over its Armed Forces. The president was elected after a real  democratic process. Thus, I believe that there is no problem in  this respect.    [Duvivier] A Chilean Air Force delegation is expected to  come  to Belgium some time this month and test the aircraft. If the  outcome of the preliminary contacts with that country is  favorable the national defense budget could be credited with 3  billion Belgian francs by next July. That amount would then be  used to help modernize the Belgian Armed Forces. [end recording]</p>

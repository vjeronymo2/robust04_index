			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKAGWAY, NOT SITKA  </P> <P> Having had the opportunity to take several cruises to southeast Alaska, I can  vouch for the many wonders about which Shirley Slater and Harry Basch  accurately wrote ("A Couple of Ways to See Alaska From Sea Level," April 8).  </P> <P> However, while it is true that in Sitka one can see many examples of Russian  architecture, one cannot see the ghost of con man Soapy Smith still stalking  the streets.  </P> <P> To appreciate the lore and legend of Alaska's greatest confidence man, one must  go to Skagway, walk the streets which Soapy walked during the gold rush days  and visit Soapy's grave. Soapy lives on, but in Skagway, not in Sitka.  </P> <P> DONALD L. SINGER  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by A. Peslyak including recorded interviews </F> with S. Lozhkin, deputy director general of Russian State  Television and Radio Company, and A. Lysenko, general director  of Russian State Television and Radio Company, outside the  Finance Ministry in Moscow, date not given -- from the "Vesti"  newscast]    [Text] [Peslyak] Being decided in this building today is  the question of whether Russian Television will continue to  exist; whether you will watch us or not, and whether we know you  are watching us.    [Lozhkin] No meeting with the heads of the Ministry of  Finance took place, but according to the information we have  received, the Finance Ministry's position remained unchanged.  It will meet about one quarter of the 1994 finance needs of  Russian television and radio.    [Peslyak] According to Anatoliy Lysenko, as a result only  news and childrens' programs will be left, along with a few  things on health and for pensioners, nothing more. No films or  shows!    [Lysenko] The destruction of Russian radio and television,  which comrade Anpilov and DEN have spoken so much about, is  indeed taking place.    [Peslyak] We are talking about Russian Television, but is  the  First Channel involved here too? What will happen to Ostankino?    [Lysenko] Exactly the same, just the same! I talked to  Aleksandr Nikolayevich Yakovlev today. Broadcasting there is,  altogether...[pauses] Well, we'll just have to get used to two  hours or an hour of television at a time, which will be  exclusively information.    [Peslyak] The practice of lobbying exists all over the  world,  and there are powerful lobbyists in Russia, too --  agro-industrial lobbyists, lobbyists from the military  industrial complex, and from defense. We, though, are hoping  for help from millions of television viewers and radio  listeners: They can influence deputies and the government.</p>

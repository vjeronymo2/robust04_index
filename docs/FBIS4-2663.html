			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Hong (1776 3216)] </F>   [Text] Los Angeles, 11 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wu Yi,  Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation says, the  practice whereby the United States deliberates China's MFN  status every year has resulted in a sense of great instability  in the minds of the broad industrial and commercial circles both  in China and the United States; should additional conditions be  attached the consequences will be even more serious.    At the opening ceremonies of the Sino-U.S. talks on trade  and  investment projects held today, this female Chinese minister  stressed that China hopes to resolve the MFN status  unconditionally. The MFN status is a pure trade issue; it is  unwise to link it to the "human rights" issue, nor does it  comply with strategic thinking.    The Chinese Government trade and economic relations  delegation headed by Wu Yi arrived in Los Angeles on 8 April and  will leave for Washington D.C. tomorrow to attend the Eighth  Session of the Sino- U.S. Joint Committee for Commerce and  Trade. During the four-day stay in Los Angeles, Wu Yi has  answered questions on the MFN status on several occasions put by  figures from various circles.    She said that the MFN status is the kernel clause in the  Sino- U.S. Agreement on Trade Relations signed in 1979. It is  not a favor bestowed by one country on another but an  arrangement of mutual benefit on an equal footing.    She believed that, should the United States cancel the MFN  status, China would suffer certain losses; however, the United  States would likewise suffer and its losses would be bigger than  those of China. The United States would lose the huge Chinese  market whereas more products, technology, and funds from other  countries would find their way into the Chinese market.    Today, Wu Yi repeatedly called on the United States to adopt  a practical attitude, weigh the pros and cons, and remove  manmade obstacles to enable Sino-U.S. ties in trade and economic  relations to develop healthily.</p>

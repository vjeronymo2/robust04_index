			<p>CSO     [Text] Six blast furnace companies such as Nippon Steel  will make a demand to China for a big boost in prices in joint  business talks on steel exports to China in the second half of  1994 (August to January 1995). The price hike will be the first  in three years, and the range of the hike is about 10 percent.  Previously, a "special price" has been applied to China that was  10 to 20 percent below the price for other Asian countries, but  they are taking advantage of the sudden increase in the demand  for steel in Asia to review this. If there is a permeation of  price hikes for China, which accounts for about 30 percent of  total steel export volume, it appears that it will be linked to  an improvement in earnings for blast furnaces manufacturers.    The joint business talks with China are negotiations every  half year with the Five Metal and Mineral Production General  Corporation of China on the prices of eight items such as  various kinds of steel plate, and this time they will be held in  Beijing beginning on 16 May. It appears that exports to China  due to the joint business talks will reach 1.7 million tons in  the first half of this year, but it is said that they "would  like to implement a price hike of at least 10 percent in the  second half even if it somewhat stifles volume" (blast furnace  maker officer).    The various blast furnace companies charge the various  Southeast Asian nations about $370 per ton for hot-rolled coil,  but 20 percent less than this for China. The various blast  furnace companies, who estimate an across-the-board deficit in  the March 1994 settlement of accounts, aim to eliminate this  price difference in these negotiations.    China appears to be opposed to the price hike in steel, a  basic material, but the various blast furnace companies view  that "a price hike environment is determined by the aspect of  supply and demand" insofar as the surplus export strength of  South Korea and others, who previously had put effort into  exports to China, is dropping.</p>

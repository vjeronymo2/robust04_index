			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / US arms were diverted to Baghdad says White House THE White House confirmed yesterday that Jordanian companies had been used to divert militarily useful US equipment to Iraq in defiance of the United Nations embargo, only weeks before the bombing of Baghdad in January. But it denied parts of a Financial Times article, published yesterday, which said the administration had ignored warnings about Jordan's role as an illegal pipeline for military goods into neighbouring Iraq in violation of the UN embargo in force at the time. According to the White House, several Jordanian companies were identified as conduits for the illegal shipment of goods to Baghdad during a joint investigation between the US and Jordan into middlemen suspected of acting for Baghdad in illegal US-Iraqi arms trafficking last December. But in a prepared statement which disputed parts of the FT report, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, said the administration had acted 'promptly and forcefully' whenever allegations of sanctions-busting had been received. 'We feel they (the sanctions) were very successful', he added. Mr Fitzwater said Jordan had co-operated in the effort to clamp down on illegal trafficking of spare parts and computer equipment to Iraq. He confirmed that Mr Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser, received a warning last December that shipments of sensitive US military equipment destined for Jordan were likely to be passed to Iraq. According to past and present US government officials, the White House failed to act on this and allowed the shipments, including diesel engine components for armoured vehicles and electronic testing equipment, to enter Jordan. The officials also said that it was only several weeks later - after hostilities had begun in the Gulf - that the warning was acknowledged. Mr Fitzwater disputed these allegations, declaring that the Continued on Page 24 administration had 'no intelligence information nor other information from the Department of Commerce that diversion of items shipped legally to Jordan was occurring'. Mr Fitzwater also said the Commerce Department had sought broader powers to inspect individual shipments to Jordan from the US. In the absence of any confirmation that shipments were being diverted to Iraq, several Federal agencies concluded it would be wrong to punish innocent Jordanian companies along with 'the few known diverting companies who were being closely monitored'. The conclusion of the review was that the individual companies with special licence privileges were not the Iraqi front companies of possible concern for violating the sanctions. The White House alerted other Federal agencies, including the Commerce Department, to monitor more closely and if necessary stop all shipments deemed to be at risk of violating the UN embargo. Mr Fitzwater said the US asked governments to investigate more than 800 suspected violations of the UN embargo, including by companies in Jordan, involving several Iraqi front companies.</p>

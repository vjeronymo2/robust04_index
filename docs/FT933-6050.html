			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Hoechst falls 31% on weak demand HOECHST, the big German chemicals group, yesterday blamed a 31 per cent slump in first-half earnings on weak domestic demand and restructuring costs. The German parent company recorded an unspecified operating loss, while its pre-tax profit fell by almost 50 per cent to DM342m (Pounds 136m) the group said yesterday. Business had continued to be weak in the first two months of the second half, and there were no signs of improvement. Forecasting a 'very difficult' six months ahead, it said cost-reduction and rationalisation measures would continue at speed. Group pre-tax profits of DM781m for the first half were worse than expected by most analysts, but fitted the pattern established last week when rival chemical groups Bayer and BASF reported pre-tax declines of 20 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. All have been hit by low demand, weak prices, the effects of health service spending cuts in Germany, and adverse movements in foreign exchange markets. Hoechst said that more than a third of its 2.4 per cent sales decline in the first six months to DM22.9bn was due to currency movements and lower prices. In the US, Hoechst Celanese reported a 6 per cent sales drop to Dollars 3.1bn (Pounds 2.09bn), attributable to lower volumes in pharmaceuticals markets and the effects of last year's sale of its polyethylene business. In Germany, the company said, its healthcare business was hit by an overall 6 per cent fall in pharmaceutical sales. Turnover in the European Community, which accounts for almost half annual sales, dropped 10 per cent. While government and economists claim the domestic recession bottomed out in the second quarter of the year, Hoechst's figures showed the situation worsening. In the three months to the end of June the group earned DM345m pre-tax, down 34 per cent on the comparable period of 1992. It blamed further deterioration in home markets, which had cancelled out an overall improvement in foreign business. First-quarter earnings of DM436m were 28 per cent lower on the year.</p>

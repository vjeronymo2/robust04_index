			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, a regulatory clarification to reflect longstanding policy concerning solicitations for newspaper subscriptions may be appropriate. Section 13(d) of the FLSA exempts from the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions (&sect;&sect;6, 7, and 12) ``*&blank;*&blank;* any employee engaged in the delivery of newspapers to the consumer.'' Accordingly, such work is outside the scope of the child labor regulations. However, the Department has held, on the basis of a legal opinion from the Solicitor, that the ``newspaper'' exemption does not apply when the minor is performing nonexempt work such as participation in a sales blitz where newspaper subscriptions are solicited outside the assigned paper route for delivery by other delivery persons. Should this enforcement position be incorporated in the provisions of Child Labor Reg. 3?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes the delicate balance between the value of jobs that provide positive, formative experiences, and the negative effects that excessive hours of employment of youth can have on their academic performance, and their health and well-being. Public comments, which should include supporting data whenever available, are specifically invited on such relevant factors as: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The need for safe and healthy employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The biological developmental factors, such as muscle coordination and attention span, present in 14- and 15-year-olds which should be considered with regard to their conditions of employment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The educational needs of 14- and 15-year-olds and the effect on their academic success of longer and/or later hours of work;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The correlation between longer and/or later hours of work and the safety and health of 14- and 15-year-olds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The correlation between employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds and their personal and educational development; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The potential effects of specific changes in the regulations on the employment opportunities of 14- and 15-year-olds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Nonagricultural Hazardous Occupations Orders for the Employment of Youth Under 18 Years of Age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first seven HOs were developed under the direction of the Children's Bureau between 1939 and 1946. In 1946, authority for the program was transferred from the Children's Bureau to the Department of Labor under Reorganization Plan No. 2. HOs 8 through 17 were issued by the Bureau of Labor Standards between 1950 and 1963. In the intervening years, the Department has made some clarifying modifications to these HOs that largely incorporate Departmental interpretations and enforcement policy, and hazardous occupations in agricultural were promulgated in 1970.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of various recommendations made by the Department's Child Labor Advisory Committee (CLAC), a notice of proposed rulemaking was published to clarify or modify HO 2, HO 10, and HO 12 on October 23, 1990 (55 FR 42812). The final rule, published on November 20, 1991 (56 FR 58626), clarified the existing HOs to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Eliminate exemption procedures contained in HO 2 which allowed minors under 18 years of age to work as school bus drivers; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Specify that restaurants, fast food establishments, and other retail establishments are subject to HO 10 prohibiting minors under the age of 18 from using power-driven meat processing equipment; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Specifically provide that meat slicers are meat processing equipment within the meaning of the HO 10 prohibitions; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Amend HO 12 to expressly prohibit minors under the age of 18 from using power-driven paper baling machinery in the processing of waste paper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CLAC made a number of additional recommendations which were not included in the HO 2, 10, and 12 rulemaking. For example, the CLAC recommended that HO 10 be amended to also include bacon slicing machines in the list of prohibited machines, and to prohibit the use of such machines without regard to the purpose of their use, i.e., power-driven meat processing machines used primarily for processing products other than meat. The CLAC also was of the view that food processing in industries other than meat processing, such as poultry, fish, and seafood processing, should be studied by the Department to determine the need for protecting young workers from hazardous activity. With respect to HO 2, the CLAC made several recommendations, including defining and delimiting the terms ``occasional and incidental'' driving and ``outside helper,'' specifically prohibiting the operation of trucks on private property, and specifically excluding motorcycles, mopeds, or similar vehicles from the ``occasional and incidental'' exception. With respect to HO 11, the CLAC recommended a complete ban on the operation of all power-driven bakery machinery, and also recommended further study of power-driven paper products machines addressed in HO 12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Christian Democrats probe Calabria scandal THE Christian Democrat leadership has decided to send a senior representative to Reggio Calabria to assess the consequences of the arrest of 12 of its leading members on alleged corruption charges on Monday, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Those arrested include four ex-mayors of the southern city and two Christian Democrat members of parliament, along with another Republican deputy. The charges all bear similarity with those levelled in the Milan municipal corruption scandal  - the concession of public works contracts in return for kick-backs for illegal financing of political parties. Also allegedly involved are two executives of construction companies, Mr Vincenzo Lodigiani, head of his family company of the same name and Italy's second largest constuction concern, and Mr Giorgio de Camillis, managing director of Bonifica.</p>

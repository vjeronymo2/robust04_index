			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Management: Acquiring a taste for the local cuisine - Dr Carol Cooper advises the business traveller abroad to take precautions when sampling certain foods / Health Check ENJOYING hospitality and sampling local cuisine are part and parcel of business trips abroad. While travel may broaden the mind, many people know that it can also loosen the bowels. About 40 per cent of travellers suffer from acute gastro-intestinal upsets. Delhi Belly, Gyppy Tummy and their variants may last only three days, but when chasing a vital contract these could be the most important days in the calendar. The risk of acute diarrhoea is highest in developing countries and around the Mediterranean. Although often said to be due to a change in the water, traveller's diarrhoea is spread by something more specific in the water - viruses, bacteria and parasites which originate in human faeces and contaminate water supplies, and therefore food and drink. More serious infections, such as typhoid, cholera, salmonellosis and hepatitis A, are transmitted by this route too. Many of these can be prevented. The golden rule is to avoid salads, raw vegetables, unpeeled fruit, tap water, ice, ice-cream, prawns, shellfish and raw fish. Salads are often unwashed, or rinsed in contaminated water and some are also grown with the aid of human manure. Ice and ice-cream may be made from dubious water supplies, while prawns and raw fish, especially in the Mediterranean, come from contaminated sea-water. Bear in mind that you need to stay fit until the last minute; on many trips nothing is clinched until moments before you head for the airport and your flight home. Keeping the visiting businessman on tenterhooks till the end is a well-known negotiating tactic. It is wise to steer clear of sauces or anything else left out for long periods on the table and of any dishes which look fiddly, as if many hands have lovingly arranged each plate. Beware, too, of unpasteurised milk. TB and brucellosis are the main problems here, not diarrhoea. Food that is heavily contaminated with microbes need not look, smell, or taste 'off'. In fact the reverse may be true, because rotting food sometimes inhibits the growth of germs that transmit diarrhoea. As long as it is eaten immediately, well-cooked food is safe, since high temperatures for more than 15 minutes kill most microbes. When offered steak, ask for medium or well-done: meat should be brown all the way through, without a trace of red. Freshly cooked rice, stews, bread and thoroughly cooked eggs are almost universally safe options. Chips, which have to be freshly cooked, are too. Fruit peeled by yourself - with a clean knife - should cause no problem. It helps to wash hands before eating, but beware of grubby handtowels afterwards (kept in a pocket, a small packet of antiseptic wipes or even baby wipes is useful). Avoid eating with your fingers if possible, or else discard the bit you have handled. It is easy to decline cold snacks, but not so business lunches. If you are worried about eating something too exotic, let your hosts order for you. They will help you find something acceptable to western palates. Faced with a suspect meal, one can diplomatically claim tiredness, jet-lag, illness or allergy. In serious cases you could say that you are, regrettably, following strict instructions from your specialist. The locals may find you slightly eccentric, but then a moment's embarrassment is better than 72 hours spent contemplating the tiles in the hotel bathroom. In the Arab world and elsewhere, repeated entreaties to eat can make refusal out of the question. In that case, have a small portion - tiny helpings contain fewer germs. In developing countries, tap water can be made safe by boiling or adding iodine or chlorine - fine for brushing teeth, but impossible when lunching out. Mineral water is available almost everywhere and the sparkling variety is less likely to have been refilled straight from tap or river. Or order Coca Cola, which is said to have done more for the eradication of cholera than any health programme. Ice is a bad idea. Research confirms that spirits do not kill the germs in it, so it is probably better to have whisky and fizzy mineral water, or gin and tonic, both without ice. A visit to the chemist is wise before the trip. If you do succumb to gastroenteritis, loperamide (Imodium) can help. It sometimes prolongs the illness, but makes it milder. Rehydration fluids (for example, Rehidrat, Dioralyte, Electrolade) help replace fluids lost and make one feel better. They have to be made up with water. Boiled water is best, but suspect water is better than none. Or have plenty of soups and fruit juices and bananas, which contain potassium. Carbohydrates in bread, rice and crackers also help shorten attacks of diarrhoea. Diarrhoea containing blood or mucus needs medical attention, as does a high fever. Antibiotics cure almost all attacks of travellers' diarrhoea. However, they can have side-effects, including allergy and diarrhoea, so their use is controversial. It may be worthwhile for a business traveller with a pre-existing disease to take them, either continuously for the duration of the voyage, or in case problems develop. As they're prescription-only medicines, negotiating with the GP is necessary. The author is a London GP.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Murashov and V. Peremyshlev: "All Roads Lead </F> to the Capital"]    [Text] A press conference with the director of the  Moscow railroad, I. Paristiy, took place yesterday in the  railroad administration building. Opening the press conference,  S. Bogatko, director of the Ministry of Railways (MPS) press  service, told the journalists that the capital main line is a  unique transport association, on the capability of which the  stability of the work of the whole railroad network to a large  extent depends.    It must be said that the meeting, organized by the MPS press  service, was very crowded for the first time in many years. One  thing indeed is clear: The problem of the largest mainline in  the country interests both its customers and journalists.    It seems that there was a graphic example of the  implementation of a currently fashionable concept--transparency  of decisions, that is, of the actions of management. The  conversation turned out to be frank to the utmost degree and  maximally exhaustive. The work of the railroad and its current  situation were presented with great clarity.    The impression was created that even such specific concepts  as the technological work of the stations was not only  understood by the journalists but sympathetically received by  them.    In a brief explanation, I. Paristiy, the director of the  railroad, recalled that the Moscow railroad was formed within  its present boundaries in 1959. It includes 13 departments and  the Board of Directors of international and tourist  transportation. The length of the main railroads that have been  developed consists of 13,500 kilometers, almost a third of the  circumference of the globe at the equator. Seventy-one stations  on the railroad handle arrivals and departures of passengers.    So it turned out that attention was indeed principally paid  to His Majesty the passenger. And this is not surprising since  the Moscow junction is the largest in the world with respect to  serving passengers. It is also the largest in the railroad  network--it accounts for about 40 percent of the passenger  transportation in the network. In suburban rail traffic alone,  3.5 million people make use of the services of the main line  daily. And the situation today is such that you do not acquire  new cars right away; the prices for new cars are such that it is  very difficult to provide a complete stock of cars. This is  clearly illustrated by the fact that the railroad, which in past  years acquired 200-300 cars on average, last year added only 32  cars. It is true, though, that this year another 50 new cars  appeared. The situation with respect to cars for suburban trains  can be substantially improved over time by the Demikhovskiy  plant, one of the creators of which was B.N. Yeltsin, then first  secretary of the Moscow City CPSU Committee.    Capacity load freight trains and long passenger trains--24  cars for long distances and cars for suburban travel--have  appeared on the Moscow railroad for the first time. Under  conditions of general nonpayment through mutual settlements and  barter, which have already been conducted here for five years,  wages are being paid without delay, housing is being built at an  increasingly rapid rate, and hospitals and polyclinics are being  put into operation on the main railroad line.    We are not sitting around doing nothing, we are not waiting  for manna from heaven, said Ivan Leontevich. And the facts bear  this out: With a stock of suburban rail cars, 35 percent of  which have outlived their scheduled life, the intensity of  traffic is being maintained through the development of depot  repair and reconstruction of repair enterprises. The tendency of  local authorities, in particular capital and oblast authorities,  to ignore the needs and problems of the main line has been  successfully overcome; in the budget for the capital, R25  billion is being designated for acquisition of rolling stock.    There was a very refreshing ring to the report about the  creation on the capital main line of a sanitary zone within a  radius of 50 kilometers of the city, about the fact that looters  on suburban trains are subject to punishment of fines of ten  times the minimum wage.    It is not possible in a short report to dwell on details.  But  we are fully confident that readers and listeners not only in  the capital and the oblast but throughout Russia will learn a  lot about the work of the Moscow railroad from the reports of  those who were present at the journalists' press conference.    The one thing for which we can hope is that such productive  meetings will be held more frequently.</p>

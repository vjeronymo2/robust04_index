			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, June 2 (AFP) -- The Iranian-backed Hizballah  vowed to fight the Jewish state "on all fronts" after Israeli  warplanes killed at least 45 guerrillas in a devastating raid on  Thursday.    "From now on the battle with Israel is open on all fronts,"  Hizballah spiritual leader, Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah,  said in a statement.    "It's the biggest challenge ever. Moslems, the mujahidin and  the oppressed have decided there is no place for Israel among  us. The forces of world oppression will no longer have a say in  our region," Fadlallah said.    "Israel and the forces of world oppression can win several  rounds but satans big or small trying to devour us will not  frighten us," he added.    Fadlallah described the United States as a "wolf which  devours man, peace and life."    "We know that every shell and every Israeli warplane is in  fact an American shell and an American warplane," he said.</p>

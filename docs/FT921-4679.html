			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Aristocratic families set to lose a pile over leasehold reform TWENTY-FIVE years after the Leasehold Reform Act fundamentally altered the rights of landowners, Sir George Young, housing minister, this week announced plans for extending its reach. The proposed changes, which have cross-party support, go to the heart of the age-old political issue of property rights and will transform ownership of some of the most historic parts of London. The proposals to give all leaseholders the right to buy their freehold has provoked bitter exchanges between leaseholders and their freeholders, notably the aristocratic families who see themselves as guardians of their estates for future generations. The beneficiaries will be leaseholders with houses capable of commanding rents of more than Pounds 25,000 a year, which were excluded from the right to buy under the 1967 act. The Leasehold Enfranchisement Association, comprising more than 2,000 households, says leaseholders are at the mercy of house-price fluctuations, are in an unfairly weak bargaining position with their landlord, face big bills for repairs or to renew their leases, and risk becoming homeless when leases expire. Mr Jeremy Newsum, chief executive of the Grosvenor Estate, owner of the elegant, stuccoed terraces and mews houses of Mayfair and Belgravia, says the government's proposals 'amount to a massive infringement of two long-standing democratic principles: the right for a private citizen to own and enjoy his private property as he wishes, and to uphold contracts freely entered into'. He says the proposals will cause the break-up of the 300-year-old Grosvenor Estate and amount to confiscation. The Grosvenor Estate argues that leasehold reform should be aimed at improving bad practices, rather than affecting good and bad landlords alike. Mrs Joan South of the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association says the great estates of central London are as rapacious as any other landlord. 'Forty years ago the Grosvenor Estate was very much more gentlemanly. Now it is run by people who have been to business school.' The aristocratic landowners say the appearance of central London may deteriorate without their influence. Their critics counter that listed building regulations, planning controls and conservation areas have reduced the need for custodians such as the Grosvenor Estate. Another dispute centres on whether the changes will increase the stock of houses available for rent. Mr Stuart Corbyn, chief executive of the Cadogan Estate, says: 'If the government gets its way, there will be nobody buying residential investments.' The proponents of change say it will make no difference as leases of under 21 years are not affected. The break-up of the large estates is likely to take decades. The Cadogan Estate found that after the 1967 act, leaseholders tended to buy their freehold when they planned to sell the property. Freeholders and leaseholders are divided on the question of compensation. The Tories propose that landlords should be compensated with the market value of the property, plus half the 'marriage value' from putting the leasehold and freehold together. Leaseholders think they will not be able to afford market rates and claim that they have added to the value of the property. The estates argue that the occupier will get an undeserved windfall gain from receiving half the 'marriage value'. Labour says agreement will have to be reached between leaseholder and freeholder, with recourse to an arbitration panel if necessary. Leasehold reform can be expected in the next parliament, extending to flats for the first time in England and Wales. Last summer the government announced proposals that would affect about 250,000 leaseholders in flats, many of whom feel they pay too much in service charges, wait too long for repairs and encounter difficulties in selling their properties because building societies are unwilling to lend money on short leases. Both Labour and the Tories support a new form of tenure called commonhold as a means of sharing a freehold between a group of owners of flats. The move to compulsory commonhold has been attacked by professionals - the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors thinks disagreements between commonholders will be difficult to resolve and would seriously jeopardise the position of the minority who do not vote for enfranchisement. Whatever the possible problems, there is little doubt that commonhold would be popular with owners of flats. This has not escaped the attention of politicians. The concentration of dissatisfied owners of flats in marginal constituencies in London, such as Hampstead, Dulwich, Westminster North, Kensington and Wandsworth, has probably concentrated politicians' minds even more sharply on reform.</p>

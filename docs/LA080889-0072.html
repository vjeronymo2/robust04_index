			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Soviet oil tanker is feared to have sunk off the northern Philippines, and  initial reports said 16 people are missing and that 12 have been rescued. The  Manila Rescue Coordinating Center said the ship was identified as the Vishru,  which sent a distress message Sunday saying it was leaking and listing badly. A  reconnaissance plane from the U.S. Navy base at Subic Bay circled the area but  found no trace of the ship, the center said. A center spokesman, citing U.S.  military reports, said that another Soviet vessel picked up 12 survivors.  </P></p>

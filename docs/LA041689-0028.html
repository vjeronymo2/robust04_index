			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE COMPETITIVE PULL TO NATIONAL HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> Ten years ago, any red-blooded American business leader caught even whispering  the notion of national health insurance would have been asked to turn in his  pinstripe suit. And, of course, the medical Establishment saw any greater  government role in health care as the possible end of Western Civilization.  </P> <P> Well, don't look now, but there's a big crack in the dike. More and more  business people are not just whispering but talking out loud about making  health-care financing a government responsibility. And the prestigious New  England Journal of Medicine, which had never before supported national health  insurance, said in January that maybe it's time to try something new.  </P> <P> I'm not ready to turn over all the responsibility for health-care financing to  Washington, but the reason the idea is getting more attention is simple. We've  waged a war on health-care costs for more than 10 years and lost it. Those  costs have gone up year after year at almost double the rate of inflation, and  they now account for about $550 billion a year.  </P> <P> In the United States, the only major country without some kind of national  health-financing program, our per-capita health bill is 41% higher than  Canada's, 61% higher than Sweden's, 85% more than France's, 131% more than  Japan's and a whopping 171% above Britain's.  </P> <P> Our life expectancy is no better than the rest of the industrialized world, our  infant mortality rate is one of the worst, and we have 37 million people  without any health coverage at all.  </P> <P> For businessmen like me, the issue is competitiveness. Health costs have become  a major drain on America's ability to compete in the world.  </P> <P> That's because American business pays a substantial part of the cost of our  overpriced system. Those costs go directly into the price of our goods, and  that has the effect of an export tax when we try to sell abroad.  </P> <P> In the case of my company, more than $700 of the cost of producing a vehicle in  the United States goes to pay for health care for employees, retirees and their  families. But we have plants in Canada, too, and there our cost is only $223 a  car. So, most of our foreign competitors have a $300- to $500-cost advantage  over us just in health costs alone for every car and truck they build.  </P> <P> And the gap doesn't go away when a foreign company builds a plant here, because  there are no retirees to cover and the new work force is always younger, and  therefore, healthier.  </P> <P> Chrysler has an aggressive cost-containment program that has probably saved the  company more than $1.3 billion since 1981. But even with that, our health costs  have grown at the rate of 8.5% a year. (For American industry as a whole, it's  been more than 16%.)  </P> <P> So the "unmentionable" is getting mentioned in business circles: Maybe we  should learn about the national health-care systems in Europe and Japan, and  design one for the United States. For any program to work, of course,  government, management and labor would have to come together.  </P> <P> It is not a comfortable thought, however; the idea of turning over the job of  financing health care to a government that hasn't balanced a budget in 20 years  and which is already spending a half billion dollars a day more than it takes  in.  </P> <P> Still, other countries do it. But they also have some strict rules and we'd  need to adopt them to avoid bankrupting the country. A major reason our health  costs are wildly out of control is that many Americans are able to demand more  health-care services than they need. Every national system has to discipline  itself. That means denying some services that people may feel they're entitled  to. So would we, and a lot of people wouldn't like it. But the competitive  pressures to try something different are building.  </P> <P> The last big push for national health insurance came in the late '70s, and it  was shut off by the so-called "voluntary effort." That was the private  commitment by doctors, hospitals, insurers, employers, unions and everybody  else involved to curb rising health costs. Thousands of cost-containment  programs were created. No doubt they helped, but one look at the cost figures  tells us they've barely made a dent.  </P> <P> National health insurance would be a huge risk, given our lousy record in this  country of federal financing of social services. If it isn't done intelligently  and with discipline, it could be an absolute disaster. But we're already  running a big risk with a system that is wasting billions of dollars a year,  that isn't buying us better health care and that is sapping America's  competitiveness.  </P> <P> The debate is likely to heat up again, and this time some of the old opponents  will at least be willing to listen.  </P></p>

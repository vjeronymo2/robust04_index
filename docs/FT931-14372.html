			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The carrot and the stick THE ESCALATING confrontation between Iraq and the western allies has all the grim inevitability of a play in which both sides are playing prescripted roles when neither can be sure of the ending. President Saddam Hussein constantly tests and taunts the allies' resolve; the US, Britain and France respond with shows of military force that are designed to punish him but may serve to bolster his standing at home and in the wider Arab world. What the allies lack at present is a coherent political strategy to match their military muscle. This is worrying, for without one they may be condemned to further escalation almost for its own sake, with the eventual risk of a serious foreign policy debacle. It is not that a specific rationale is wanting for the west's individual actions. The air raids on anti-aircraft missile systems last week and yesterday are politically justifiable in that they are designed to remove threats to the implementation of the no-fly zones imposed over the north and south of the country in defence of Iraq's Kurdish and Shia Moslem populations. Sunday's cruise missile attack on a nuclear component plant in the outskirts of Baghdad was defensible as an appropriate response to Saddam's persistent refusal to give UN inspection teams unconditional access to military facilities. But as the attacks, and Saddam's 'cheat and retreat' tactics, continue, it must be asked: what, overall, is the west trying to achieve? And in what way do its actions, taken as a whole, bring that goal closer? Far from clear If the answer to the first question is Saddam's removal from power, it is far from clear from official statements in Washington, London and Paris. The emphasis, rather, is on the more limited tasks of enforcing the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire and helping to protect Iraqi citizens from their leader's worst excesses. This obfuscation is understandable. It would be hard to imagine a strategy aiming explicitly at the toppling of Saddam securing a consensus in the UN Security Council, any more than such an objective was a formal aim of the broad-based coalition that fought the Gulf war two years ago. Even if the western allies did spell out their desire to remove the Iraqi leader, they are most unlikely to be able to do the job themselves. It may be argued, by extension, that further explanation of western strategy is unnecessary, that measured, ad hoc military strikes are sufficient to contain the threats posed by Saddam to his neighbours (through invasion or the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction) and to his own citizens. The problem with this line of reasoning is that it condemns the allies to a pace and intensity of action determined by the level of provocation offered by Saddam. This is doubly true at a time when the leadership of the western world is in transition. Saddam is watching intently for any sign of diminished resolve on the part of the incoming US president; the logic of force almost demands that he step up the pace. Searching reappraisal Mr Bill Clinton will have to conduct a searching reappraisal of US Gulf policy. First, he has no alternative to continuing to seek full Iraqi compliance with the Gulf ceasefire. Second, he must build on the existing effort to protect the Kurds and Shias, whose repression is acknowledged as another source of regional instability, by warning Saddam that western air power will be used against attempts to interfere with international relief supplies. Third, he should muster a broader international force to defend Kuwait's borders, which remain alarmingly vulnerable to Iraqi incursions. Fourth, and most important, he should attempt to elaborate a political strategy aimed not at directly toppling the Iraqi leader but at encouraging Iraqis to do so. Alongside the stick of military action, he should hold out the carrot of US co-operation provided Iraq adopts a regime that respects the will of the international community and the dignity and well-being of its own citizens. In place of the unmitigated despair Iraqis are experiencing today, he should offer the conditional hope of a lifting of sanctions. By clearly enunciating such a prospect, he may just make it possible.</p>

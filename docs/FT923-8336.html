			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Intl Paper pays Dollars 120m for stake in Polish unit INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US forest products group, yesterday announced its first venture in eastern Europe with the acquisition of an 80 per cent stake in Poland's second biggest paper manufacturer. International Paper will pay Dollars 120m for its stake in Kwidzyn Pulp and Paper Company. It will also invest another Dollars 175m over the next four years as part of a programme to modernise and expand the company. The deal was announced by Mr Janusz Lewandowski, Poland's minister of privatisation. Kwidzyn, which started production in the early 1980s, recorded sales of 930bn zlotys (Dollars 71.5m) in the first five months of this year and pre-tax profits of 45bn zlotys. It is Poland's only integrated bleached pulp and paper company. The move comes when International Paper has started to look further afield for acquisitions, after expanding aggressively in the US and western Europe in the 1980s. About Dollars 4bn of the company's roughly Dollars 13bn in annual sales comes from western European operations. International Paper has agreed not to make any Kwidzyn employees redundant within the next 18 months and to maintain existing social benefits. In the US, International Paper ran into trouble with its unions in 1987 over proposed cuts in wages and benefits which resulted in a lock-out at one mill and a 16-month strike at three others. Mr George Adler, an analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham in New York described the investment as 'very interesting. This seems to be a fairly modern mill - the first machine was put in there in 1985'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 4 Mar (TANJUG) -- Christian Bruner, an  International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] official in  Banja Luka, has told a TANJUG correspondent that there will be  no large-scale evacuation of the Muslim and Croat population  tomorrow as intimated by some of the world's media, including  the Croatian and Muslim media.    Bruner says the situation in Prijedor is much better  following the order of Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska  republic, that an investigation into the killings in Prijedor be  completed so that those responsible are discovered.    Bruner says that it is only possible for permission to be  granted for the resettlement of a number of people who have  expressed great fear for their lives and who want to leave  Prijedor. This resettlement will not begin tomorrow either but  will be carried out over the next few days.    He stresses that security guarantees from the Serb  authorities are needed during their transportation for this  resettlement to take place. He added that talks will begin  tomorrow between ICRC representatives and the Srpska republic  authorities and that he believes that all the necessary  gaurantees will be given.</p>

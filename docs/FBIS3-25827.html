According to Lin, the province will increase its total  installed capacity of electric power by one to 1.2 million kw  annually in the succeeding six years before the year 2000, in a  bid to meet the needs of its booming economy.    Reform of the investment structure of the power industry  will  be furthered enhanced. Those who invest in the power sector  will be granted priority in using power.    Lin also noted that foreign business people are welcome to  invest in the power sector.    According to local sources, the province is expected to step  up preparatory work for the construction of a nuclear power  station.    Official statistics show that last year the provincial total  electric energy production hit some 19.6 billion kwh, 10.7  percent more than in 1992.    However, at least 20 percent more is still required for the  development of the economy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Defense Minister Lajos Fur by </F> Zoltan Fekete; place and date not given: "The Forum Overcame  Its Internal Conflicts"]    [Text] Defense Minister Lajos Fur resigned from the  position of executive chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] on 26 May 1993. Although he maintained his membership in  the Executive Committee, Lajos Fur accepted larger political  roles in the party's internal life only recently.    [Fekete] Would you accept a renewed nomination for the  position of executive chairman or the position of party chairman  if you were asked now, or your volunteer withdrawal continues?    [Fur] I do not hide from rational challenges of fate.    [Fekete] In other words, you would accept the nomination.    [Fur] If I am asked to or if I am elected, I will accept.    [Fekete] What has changed since your resignation?    [Fur] My party has changed a lot since I wrote my letter. I  do not mean here the change in the external and internal image  of the party, but mostly the changes that took place in the  people's souls. Of course, we should not forget that the MDF  did not disintegrate after the split and, after the well-known  internal conflicts, we are now much more united than before.  Our members have a goal again: To be successful at the  upcoming elections. We not only have goals, but our old  enthusiasm has returned, and this clearly proves that the MDF  has overcome its internal conflicts. I feel as if the  enthusiasm of 1989-90 has returned, and this gives cause for  optimism.    [Fekete] Will the MDF be able to replace the late party  chairman and prime minister, Jozsef Antall?    [Fur] No one is irreplaceable and no one is replaceable.  Both opinions are true. Jozsef Antall was a great democrat.  It is impossible to replace him overnight. No matter who it  is, the future party chairman can grow into a key figure as  Jozsef Antall used to be. Everyone has the fieldmarshal's baton  in his bag, but the standards are very high.    [Fekete] Has Jozsef Antall's death not thrown Hungary's  position back? I mean here primarily our foreign policy.    [Fur] Although some statement that appeared especially in  the West mentioned this, and there are also some voices at home  according to which the government drifted to the right after  Jozsef Antall's death, these are unfounded opinions. With its  new interior minister, the Hungarian Government is working  according to its well- known program. I must say that, during  my talks so far, I did not feel any deterioration in Hungary's  leading positions. I met recently not only with the heads and  defense ministers of the Visegrad countries but also with  high-ranking U.S. politicians and leaders.    [Fekete] As a party chairman, would you be able to create a  unity similar to the consensus achieved during the legislation  of the defense law as a defense minister?    [Fur] It is much easier to compromise in the Parliament in  the benefit of the country and society than within the party.  However, a political party is always created by a common  ideology, common interests, and common goals.    [Fekete] You spoke of enthusiasm. In your opinion, for what  election results is this enthusiasm sufficient?    [Fur] If our enthusiasm grows, our calm continues, and  "reason prevails" in our society, then our chances will be very  good. Even if we cannot repeat our last success of 42 percent,  we can get more than 20 percent of the votes, and we can even be  the first with this number of votes.    [Fekete] What do you mean by the society's "reason"?    [Fur] If most people accept the fact that this coalition  government carried out what its possibilities allowed it to  carry out, if understanding also mingles with the justified  criticism, and if an increasing number of people realize that  another government could not have done much more in this period  and after such preliminaries, the chances of the MDF will be  really good.</p>

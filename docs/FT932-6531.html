			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / France plans to privatise 21 state-run companies FRANCE's new centre-right government announced wide-ranging plans yesterday for an ambitious privatisation programme. Its plans involve the sale of 21 public-sector companies including the Renault motor group, Air France and the banks Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris. The proposals, intended to complete and extend the sale of state assets begun by the last conservative administration from 1986 to 1988, immediately ran into controversy when Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist president, warned the weekly cabinet meeting that some companies should remain under state ownership to 'protect the national interest'. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister and architect of the privatisation plan, described the proposed share sales as central to the new government's efforts to create a 'modern and sound economy'. The new proposals abandon the 20 per cent ceiling on foreign investment in privatised companies. Mr Alphandery has also introduced initiatives to encourage individual share ownership and to persuade employees to invest in their own companies. Mr Alphandery did not specify how much he planned to raise from the sales, due to start in September. The last centre-right government's privatisation drive involved selling 29 companies worth FFr120bn (Pounds 14.2bn). Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, has already announced that the state hopes to generate at least FFr40bn by the end of this year. The names of those companies to be privatised first will be announced immediately after the privatisation legislation has been passed through parliament. Mr Alphandery said the timing of individual sales would be determined by market conditions. There is no time limit for the new programme, which could be extended after the 1995 presidential elections. Analysts have voiced concern that the French government may find it more difficult to sell off its assets in the present recessionary climate compared with the buoyant economy of the mid 1980s. One snag is the strength of the franc, which might deter international investors. Another is the sluggish state of the Paris stock market, which has been virtually static since the start of this year and yesterday was stable, with the CAC-40 index on 1,890. The privatisation candidates include 13 companies scheduled for sale by the last centre-right government. Among them are three insurers - Union des Assurances de Paris, Assurances Generales de France and Groupe GAN - and the Thomson electronics group, Bull computer company, Elf-Aquitaine oil group and Rhone-Poulenc chemicals concern. Among others are Air France, Renault, the Usinor-Sacilor steel group and Aerospatiale, the aerospace concern, all previously considered too 'sensitive' to be in the private sector. However, stakes of more than 5 per cent in health, defence or security stocks will be subject to government approval. Mr Alphandery has also revived the concept of the 'golden share', whereby the state can vet shareholders and block takeover bids in certain privatised companies. The 'golden share' has now been extended from five years to an indefinite lifespan.  -----------------------------------------          UP FOR AUCTION  ----------------------------------------- 1993 additions to privatisation list  ----------------------------------------- Aerospatiale Air France Caisse Central de Reassurance Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance-Assurances Cie Generale Maritime Renault SEITA SNECMA Usinor-Sacilor  ----------------------------------------- French left-overs on the block, Page 23 Balladur heads off rift, Page 2 French left-overs on the block, Page 23 Lex Page 24</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Day of reckoning In the long months of struggle to maintain sterling's parity within the ERM, it has become fashionable to see fixed rate bonds as a more attractive investment than equities. The chancellor's decision to suspend ERM membership means that question must now be re-addressed. Whatever arrangements are finally made for sterling in its relationship with other European currencies, the credibility of a policy designed to eradicate inflation has been undermined. Had the government chosen a lower central rate, or else to follow the Bundesbank in raising interest rates last December, its ERM adventure might not have come to quite such a sticky end. As it is, yesterday's 2 point rise in base rates was too late to establish credibility. Not only is the policy now revealed as questionable; its implementation was also cack-handed. This is not to say, however, that inflation will immediately return with a vengeance. Demand is so subdued and consumers have been so badly burned by the great deflation that it is hard to see price pressures reasserting themselves very quickly. Besides, much depends on how long base rates are held at 12 per cent. To be sure, sterling is already some 10 per cent below its peak against the dollar. There should be some economic stimulus from that. But it will take much lower interest rates to restore confidence to the housing market. The equity market was thus right to dismiss yesterday's attempt to raise base rates to 15 per cent as untenable unless the government was determined to engineer a slump. Maybe the market is now at the turning point. In that case investors must also address relative values, a process which will favour cyclical stocks rather than defensive ones like utilities and pharmaceuticals. Still, caution is called for. The ingredients for growth are not yet in place and it is not clear how policy will settle down. The government may hope to salvage some anti-inflation credibility by climbing back aboard a reconstituted - though certainly weaker - ERM. Another interest cut by Germany would help. But before Sunday's Maastricht vote in France, there is no telling whether re-entry will be possible, or at what exchange or interest rate. What is clear is that there is little point in floating freely outside the ERM and in keeping interest rates high in an attempt to track the system. Sweden has shown the cost of life in the twilight zone. If there is any logic in floating free, it must be to set interest rates at a level that reflects the state of the economy and allows the exchange rate to find its own, much lower level. Were that the government's ultimate plan, equities would be an outstanding buy. By the end of next year, however, inflation could then be more like 5 per cent than 2. The gilts market could not ignore that, even though there are some consoling factors. The premium over German government bonds has already moved out to 200 basis points compared with around 120 after the election. Yesterday's heavy intervention will reduce immediate funding needs. If sterling were allowed to stabilise at a significantly lower level, foreign buyers might not demand a much greater increase in the premium over German paper. Even a large PSBR could then be quite easily funded. That said, it is now no longer plausible to expect gilt yields to converge with those in Germany. The attractions that seemed so real in April have grown elusive. Equities have not quite regained their former glory, but watch this space.</p>

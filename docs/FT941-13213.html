			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (10): Dell dips as Zenith zooms - Contrasting market fortunes Few contrasts are more stark in the mobile computing market than the 1993 fortunes of Dell Computer and Zenith Data Systems. While Dell had to recall its systems and withdraw from the notebook market after poor sales, Zenith rebounded after a lean period to claim sales gains in North America last year of 86 per cent. Dell's misfortunes began with the release of its lightweight 320SLi notebook computer - which aimed to combine long battery life with a low price. The design, however, did not hold up well to the rigours of portable computing. Users complained about 'easy to lose' rubber covers over expansion ports, the lack of a backlit screen (a feature designed to save battery power) and overheating when in use for an extended period. The overheating was so serious that Dell had to recall the systems. However, the Texan computer maker says that it is committed to introducing new notebook and subnotebook computers this year - and recently hired Mr John Medica, a former Apple Computer executive, as a vice-president. Mr Medica was instrumental in the design contracting of Apple's successful PowerBook range of mobile computers - developed in conjunction with Sony of Japan. US analysts already predict that Mr Medica will seek Sony's help in the design of new Dell products - and that these will be subnotebook systems with both colour and monochrome displays. Sharp is expected to supply the colour screens for these systems, which may be launched in the second half of this year. In the meantime, Dell is likely to unveil a range of 'interim' mobile computing systems that will be the result of Original Equipment Manufacturer agreements currently under negotiation with portable computer maker AST Research. These machines will probably be based on AST's Bravo range of notebook systems. While Dell has been suffering, laptop PC pioneer Zenith Data Systems (now a subsidiary of Paris-based Groupe Bull) has been crowing about its recent rebound in the notebook computer market. The company claims to have shipped more than 150,000 portable computer systems to North America alone last year  -almost twice its volume in 1992. At the heart of this success has been the company's Z-Lite subnotebook computer range, which has earned high marks from reviewers for its long battery life, comparatively low price and expansion options. According to Mr Alan Soucy, vice-president of the ZDS mobile systems division, one key to the company's current philosophy about mobile systems is that docking stations - the add-on boxes that portable computer makers have traditionally used to provide desktop expansion power for their systems  -have no place in the market any more. Instead, Zenith is offering PCMCIA-compatible expansion slots on all its subnotebook computer products - and at less than Dollars 1,000, a new 'personal server' designed to offer desktop functions to portable PC users in a more flexible way. The personal server features Ethernet network connections to portables. It is about the size of toaster, yet offers room for lots of storage, as well as hard-to-add devices such as a CD-ROM player. In addition, several portable computer users can connect to the personal server at once. Mr Soucy says that docking stations, by contrast, require that only one user can connect at any one time, that the connection be made with an often-clumsy, multiple pin - and that users buy a new docking station every time they get a new model or brand of portable computer. The other big push for ZDS in 1994 will be in the personal digital assistant market. Three products will be launched in the current calendar year - one for wireless local area network connection to PCs, another with embedded wide area communications capabilities and the third designed more along industry-standard lines. It is expected that the first two of these systems will be more 'personal communicator' products than full-blown handheld computers - while the third is likely to be based on a variation of the Microsoft at Work architecture and to use an Intel microprocessor. All systems will offer pen-based input. ZDS will price at least one of the systems at around Dollars 500 to make high volume inroads into the market - responding to press criticism at the high prices of Apple's Newton and the Tandy/Casio Zoomer.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: PWA unveils record deficit for year PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, yesterday unveiled a record 1992 loss of CDollars 543m (USDollars 433m), or CDollars 11.37 a share. Last Friday Air Canada, its bigger rival, reported a final 1992 loss of CDollars 454m, or CDollars 6.13 a share. Together the country's two leading airlines lost almost CDollars 1bn in 1992, reflecting the long recession, overcapacity and vicious fare discounting in the domestic market. Small charter airlines are the only ones remaining profitable in Canada. Both Air Canada and Canadian are struggling to complete ownership and operating alliances with US-based international airlines but expect to suffer more losses in 1993. PWA's 1992 loss included a CDollars 333m special charge to cover the expected costs of its proposed alliance with AMR, parent of American Airlines, which is yet to be completed, and also staff severance and other special items. Revenues were CDollars 2.88bn. In 1991 PWA lost CDollars 161m or CDollars 3.66, including special items. Its 1992 operating loss before special charges was CDollars 108.7m, against a deficit of CDollars 112m in 1991. Operating expenses were steady, but the gain in revenues was only 0.2 per cent.</p>

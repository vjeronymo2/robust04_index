			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Stanley awarded CVT status in France MORGAN Stanley, the US investment bank, has become one of only five correspondants en valeurs du tresor (CVTs), or brokers in government bonds, appointed by the French government. The approval stops short of full specialiste en valeurs du tresor (SVT) status, under which banks act as primary dealers in French government securities. Morgan, which has an investment banking presence in Paris, said it hoped to set up a new separately-capitalised securities operation in the coming months to take advantage of its new status. The operation is expected to develop in a wide range of French securities. The move to become a CVT is expected to be a prelude to the bank seeking full SVT status.</p>

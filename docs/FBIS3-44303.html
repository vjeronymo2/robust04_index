The deteriorated "dual political power" crisis, involving  the  pro-radical-reform government and the rebel parliament, was  culminated in a bloody October incident in Moscow and the Moscow  authorities were totally taken aback by the outcome of the new  parliamentary elections in mid-December. President Boris  Yeltsin came to the conclusion a week ago that all the people  have again come to see how complicated and contradictory the  situation is in this country.    On the surface, the bloody incident in October seemed to be  the result of the white-hot dispute on power distribution  between the parliament and the president. In essence, it  reflected the profound and irreconcilable differences existing  in the society in general regarding economic reform, the state  political system and the state foreign policy.    Although the use of armed force brought an end to the "dual  political power," it cannot in any way resolve the piled-up  social problems.    The December 12 referendum and the results of the ensuing  parliamentary elections indicated that while Yeltsin's  supporters, the so-called "reformers," have been somewhat  weakened due to the surfacing of their internal bickering, the  opposition has gained some strength, and the resentment among  the people is growing.    President Yeltsin himself admitted that "people have to a  large extent lost their forbearance."    The new state constitution, designed to affirm presidential  rule, has been adopted, but the supporting rate of the voters  for the president has declined from 42.7 percent of the  registered voters in the presidential election in June 1991, to  the 37.7 percent in the April national referendum and further  down to a mere 30 percent in the vote on the new constitution.    Although a new parliament has emerged, it is not at all the  one the president hoped for. In the race for seats in the State  Duma among various political parties, the Liberal Democrats led  by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy obtained 22.79 percent of the votes,  while the so-called "presidential party," "Russia's Choice,"  garnered a mere 15.38 percent. Noteworthy is the fact that as  many as one third of military servicemen reportedly supported  the Liberal Democrats.    The parliamentary election results showed that the three  opposition parties -- the Russian Communist Party, the Agrarian  Party and the Liberal Democratic Party -- reaped a total of  43.04 percent of the votes, while the three factions of the  ruling "democratic reformers" won only 29.97 percent. People  might differ over the reasons for the defeat of the reformers,  but one can hardly deny the fact that the election results  represented an objective reaction of the voters to the existing  internal and external policies.    First, the majority of voters are not in favor of the  radical  economic reform, the "shock therapy." in the April referendum,  50.2 percent of the voters backed the president and the  government's reform policy. But in the December parliamentary  elections, only 15.38 percent of the voters sided with "Russia's  Choice" led by Yegor Gaydar, a typical representative of the  radical reformers, and backed by President Yeltsin.    Second, following the collapse of the former Soviet Union  over two years ago, Russia has pursued a foreign policy of  "assimilating to Western civilized society" and "returning to  Europe," which many Russians accuse of having resulted in "loss  of national dignity" and "damage to national interests."    Calls for an independent foreign policy in relations with  the  West are growing in Russia and this helped the Liberal Democrats  pick up a considerable number of additional votes in the  parliamentary elections as they explicitly pointed to the urgent  need to safeguard Russia's national interests.    Third, the psychological impact the bloody October incident  had on the Russians and the varied attitudes of the people  toward the incident were also accordingly reflected in the  results of the elections.    On how the situation in Russia will develop in the future,  the pro-government newspaper, "IZVESTIYA," on December 22, had  this to say, "The post-election political reality is more  worrying than the passage of the new constitution." The  "ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI" added on December 24 that the election  results "have virtually crushed the illusion about the possible  alleviation of Russia's political tension," and "serve as the  basis for prediction of confrontation between the new parliament  and the executive branch of the state power."    In face of the post-election new situation, President  Yeltsin  has pledged to stabilize the situation in general, promote  reform, carry out partial readjustment and make changes  accordingly in organization and in personnel. Meanwhile, he has  also expressed his readiness to cooperate with all the parties  that have been elected into the parliament within the framework  of the new constitution.    Observers here predict complicated and delicate relations  between the president and the new parliament in the new year.  It is widely believed that the key to stability in the country  lies in a substantial improvement of the economy -- the  emergence of a realistic government economic policy, the  restoration and development of production and an early apparent  improvement in people's life.</p>

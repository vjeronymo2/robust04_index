			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'American investors fuelled gold price rise' A surge in investment demand in North America and parts of Europe helped boost the gold price last year, says the Gold Fields Mineral Services consultancy group, in its latest interim report today. A drop in sales by central banks and other governmental organisations and less hedging and forward sales by gold producers also contributed to the price rise. However, jewellery makers, the most important element of demand in the gold market, substantially reduced their purchases. There was also a drop in the buying of gold bars for hoarding. But jewellery fabrication still accounted for more than all the newly-mined gold last year, according to GFMS estimates. The supply of newly-mined gold rose only slightly, by 1.7 per cent, from the 1992 level of 2,231 tonnes to 2,269 tonnes. GFMS, which has the financial backing of two big gold producers - Gold Fields of South Africa and Newmont Mining, the largest US gold group - says that the fall in offtake by the jewellery industry, by 6.8 per cent from 2,675 tonnes in 1992 to an estimated 2,493 tonnes last year, was due in part to price-sensitivity but also to the effects of economic weakness in Japan and Europe, the austerity drive in China and the plentiful stocks of gold that had built up in many Middle Eastern and Far Eastern markets. Bar hoarding, down more than 32 per cent at 195 tonnes, was similarly affected by higher prices and a range of local economic factors. During 1993 the increase in investment demand was quite broadly-based, suggests GFMS, encompassing the re-appearance of significant private demand in Germany after the removal of value added tax on financial gold at the start of the year; the investment in gold futures and over-the-counter positions by US funds; and the return of Swiss portfolio investment to gold. 'Even if the latter has been primarily on a derivative basis, such as the purchase of gold call warrants, the impact on demand has been substantial.' Official sector sales increased not only because some central banks took the opportunity to sell as prices rose in the second half of 1993 but also because many of the 'call' options written by central banks earlier in the year expired 'in the money', resulting in a substantial quantity of the underlying gold being sold. GFMS estimates net official sales last year were 440 tonnes, nearly one quarter below the 582 tonnes in 1992 but still the second-highest level of annual sales from this sector since 1979. The rising price and reduced contangos (forward premiums) persuaded many producers to allow their forward positions to run down in the second half of 1993. GFMS estimates that forward sales contributed 131 tonnes to supply last year, a 13 per cent fall from the 150 tonnes in 1992. Option hedging, after contributing 91 tonnes to supply in 1992, contributed nothing last year. Mr Stewart Murray, GFMS chief executive, suggested last night that, compared with the flat trading in 1992 and the market's overheated state in the second quarter of 1993, the market now appeared to be returning to normality. He said the market was entering 1994 'in good shape'.

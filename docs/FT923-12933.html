			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans fail to make sale on bananas with US - 'Mixed signals' cause concern IN AN increasingly desperate battle to hold on to their preferential access to the European market, Caribbean banana producers have tried, but apparently failed, to recruit to their cause one pivotal player in international trade. In recent weeks the prime ministers of several banana producing countries in the Caribbean have visited Washington, asking President George Bush and other key figures in the Administration to throw their weight behind proposals which would continue protection for Caribbean bananas marketed in Europe. After the meetings several were left confused by what they said were 'mixed signals' from the US administration. 'At one level, the United States administration is aware of the problems we face with bananas, and is sympathetic to the fact that we face potentially serious damage from free trade in the fruit,' said Mr PJ Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'At another level in the administration, however, there is a move to have bananas brought under the Gatt and be freely traded.' The division is between the White House, on the one hand, and the Office of the Trade Representative and the State Department, on the other. While Mr Patterson declined to elaborate on which was the 'sympathetic' part of the administration, Dame Eugenia Charles, the prime minister of Dominica, did not. 'President Bush is sympathetic, but Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, is adamant that there should be no exemptions,' Dame Eugenia said. 'The argument is that if there is an exception for bananas, then there will have to be for rice, for dairy products and all other farm products. The United States is dead against us on this.' The African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group, which supplies one-fifth of the bananas consumed in the European Community, had been worried by the proposals made in the text of the Gatt negotiations that trading conditions for current export volumes be maintained for all sources until 1999. Anything above this would be subject to tariffication, with tariffs being reduced progressively by an average of 36 per cent between 1993 and 1999. The banana producers are hoping for relief from three sources. One is the undertaking, 'the legal commitment,' says Mr Patterson, of the EC to ensure that changes in the marketing of bananas will not leave the ACP states 'in a less favourable situation than in the past or at present'. The second is the proposal by the European Commission earlier this year to impose quotas on fruit from non-ACP sources, mainly the Latin American countries whose fruit is more competitive than that of the ACP exporters. The third area of solace for the ACP producers would have been US support for the use of quotas rather than tariffs. Officials in the Caribbean say the White House, preoccupied with an election, will hardly be in a position to redirect those parts of the government that are unwilling to consider bananas as a special case. Yet, they say, US support is important if there is to be any success with efforts for a derogation to the rules of international trade. 'There is also the fact that US companies are heavily involved in banana production in the Latin American countries,' explained one St Lucian official. 'It is unlikely that the US position will be one which will ignore the desires of those companies, and the Latin American governments, to open up the market.' Caribbean bananas, which cost about 30 per cent more to produce than do Latin American fruit, could not compete on an open market. 'The Latin American producers have virtually declared war on us,' said Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia. 'They are trying to drive us out of the European market.' Regional diplomats say that some leaders who met President Bush early last month in Washington to seek his support for the use of quotas rather than tariffs on bananas, were more than slightly taken aback when the discussion turned quickly to other matters, mainly developments in Haiti and the repatriation of Haitians seeking asylum in the US. 'This reflects the distraction of the White House in an election year,' explained one envoy. 'There is nothing much to be gained by the White House, and perhaps something to be lost, by publicly agreeing to support the Caribbean requests and overriding the clear wishes of the companies involved in the Latin American industry. Haiti is much more politically sensitive.' 'We cannot move the United States on this issue, although they themselves treat agricultural products as a special case, and they subsidise their own very heavily,' said Dame Eugenia. 'There appears to be no consideration that US agriculture is as important to the US economy as bananas are important to ours.' Dominica's economy is 60 per cent dependent on banana exports. US officials have refused to comment on claims that the US government has written to London suggesting that Britain reviews and changes its position in support of quotas for European banana imports as from next year when a single European market is created.</p>

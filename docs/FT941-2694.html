			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Japan seeks better links with China / Preview of Mr Hosokawa's visit to Beijing Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will be less direct than the Americans and yet more frank than his own predecessors when he starts his first official visit to China today. Chinese leaders will welcome Mr Hosokawa's low-key demeanour, a contrast to Washington's recent bluntness towards China. So he can expect a warm reception, in contrast to the chill that greeted Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, last week, when he was strongly criticised for Washington's decision to link renewal of China's trade privileges under its most favoured nation (MFN) status to an improvement in human rights. Mr Hosokawa's visit, the first by a Japanese prime minister for three years, marks an increase in Sino-Japanese official contacts. This reflects a sharp rise in two-way trade and Japanese investment in China, and Beijing's eagerness to sound out Japan's first non-Liberal Democratic Party government for 38 years. Only last month, Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, met Mr Hosokawa and members of his government in Tokyo, while Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, visited Beijing in January. Yet Mr Hosokawa will also show on his three-day visit that Japan's attitude to China has changed, if only in tone, from the emollient stance shown by Liberal Democratic Party governments during its 38 years in power. Japanese officials say they want relations with China to mature, in the sense that both sides should speak more freely. Mr Hosokawa shares strong views on human rights with his foreign minister, who told Chinese leaders in January that Tokyo would be more frank in discussing sensitive issues. 'We expect China to take a more positive attitude,' said a Foreign Ministry official yesterday. Mr Hosokawa is also expected to suggest to Beijing that it could make its allies less nervous by giving more information about its planned 22.4 per cent rise in military spending this year. He is likely to register Japan's worries over China's resumption of nuclear weapons tests last October and call for more help from Beijing in enticing North Korea away from nuclear weapons. The environment is also on Japan's agenda. One side effect of China's economic growth has been concern over acid rain from its coal-fired power stations reaching Japan. Mr Hosokawa is due to sign an environmental protection agreement, which should go some way to assuaging Japanese worries. Japan is also moving for the first time towards using its weight as Beijing's largest provider of bilateral aid to try to influence policy. Officials have indicated future cheap loans could be used to encourage Beijing to be more open about defence spending and to come up with environmental projects, a change from Tokyo's previous policy of disbursing Chinese aid without conditions. Japan's five-year Y810bn loan programme for China, the only country to get long-term loans from Tokyo, runs out at the end of next year, so the subject could come up. Beijing wants another long-term programme, fixed in yen, but Tokyo is understood to lean towards tougher conditions: shorter loans at a floating exchange rate. At the same time, neither side wants to let sensitive topics spoil their very good relations. Japan, for one, needs to protect its fast-growing economic interests in China. Until three years ago, Japanese companies were cautious. But the rapid growth of China's economy - 13 per cent last year - has sucked in a sharp increase in Japanese investment and trade. Two-way trade rose by 31 per cent to a record Dollars 37.84bn last year, when a 45 per cent rise in exports to China made it Japan's second-largest foreign market. Corporate Japan has turned increasingly to China as a cheap production site to escape the blow to its own competitiveness inflicted by the rising yen. Japanese companies signed Dollars 2.2bn-worth of investment contracts in China in the first nine months of last year, slightly more than in the whole of 1992, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. China is now Japan's biggest new investment location, according to a survey by the Export-Import Bank of Japan. Yet Japan's caution has made it relatively late in the race for the Chinese market. By the middle of last year, it had completed Dollars 5.2bn of investment in China, set to rise to Dollars 6bn this year, making it only the third foreign investor after Hong Kong and Taiwan. China, too, wants to develop the relationship. A recent commentary in People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, shows high hopes of Japan as a source of investment and advanced technology. China's long-term growth rate of 8-9 per cent had created conditions for prosperity in both China and Japan, and this was now accepted by the Japanese political and business leadership, it said. Japan is funnelling about Dollars 200m into China annually to help train Chinese managers and enhance Chinese expertise in various areas, including environmental protection. There is a chance that Mr Hosokawa might confront another sensitive subject: Japan's wartime atrocities in Asia. This appears to be the minds of the Chinese public, judging by yesterday's demonstrations for compensation outside Japan's Beijing embassy. Mr Hosokawa won respect from some of his Asian partners when he first issued an apology, on becoming prime minister last August, for Japan's wartime behaviour. Whether he chooses to repeat the gesture, that episode in history is a brooding factor in the general background of Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese themselves are not averse to manipulating Japanese guilt to their own advantage.  --------------------------------------------------------------                   JAPANESE INVESTMENT IN CHINA                         Contracts signed  -------------------------------------------------------------- Date                  Dollars m         Number of contracts  -------------------------------------------------------------- 1989                     438                    294 1990                     457                    341 1991                     812                    599 1992                    2170                   1805  -------------------------------------------------------------- Date                                   Contracts carried out  -------------------------------------------------------------- 1989                                            356 1990                                            503 1991                                            532 1992                                            710  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Japan External Trade Organisation  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Protests over murder hit Bombay business: Strikers mourn anti-corruption campaigner Strikers protesting at the killing of a leading member of the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party yesterday brought parts of Bombay to a standstill. Hundreds of people attended the funeral of Mr Ramdas Nayak, who was shot on Thursday by gunmen using automatic rifles. The strikers, mainly organised by Shiv Sena, a radical ally of the BJP, disrupted railway services and forced shopkeepers and market traders to close. Banks and big public institutions stayed open but saw little business as most workers remained at home. The Bombay Stock Exchange was open but trading was negligible. Shiv Sena called the strike to put pressure on Mr Sharad Pawar, chief minister of Maharashtra state which has Bombay as its capital. Mr Pawar faces mounting criticism about the rise of violent crime in the city and growing evidence of ties between politicians and underworld bosses. Mr Nayak was a leading anti-corruption campaigner. But police have said it is too early to know whether his murder was linked to his attacks on corruption. In New Delhi, Mr S B Chavan, the home minister, promised in parliament to call an all-party meeting on 'the criminalisation of politics' in response to concerns voiced by MPs about Mr Nayak's death and about the killing of eight children in a bomb blast on Thursday in the troubled northern state of Jammu and Kashmir. Six more relatives of Mr Tiger Memon, who Indian investigators believe helped organise last year's bomb blasts in Bombay, have been arrested. They were taken into custody in Dubai and brought to Delhi by air on Thursday. Those detained are Mr Memon's father and mother - Mr Abdul Razak Memon and Mrs Hanifa Abdul Razak Memon - three of his brothers and the wife of one of the brothers. A fourth brother, Mr Yakub Memon, was arrested in Kathmandu earlier this month and smuggled into India, where investigators claim he has provided evidence about the blasts. Mr Yakub Memon has said that the only family member involved in the bombings was Tiger, who is thought to be in hiding in Pakistan. The whole family left Bombay for Dubai on the eve of the blasts, on March 12. The circumstances under which the family has been taken into custody are unclear. There is speculation that they might have a secret agreement with the Indian authorities to provide evidence in return for guarantees about their safety.</p>

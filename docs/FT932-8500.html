			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Brazilian negotiators reach preliminary accord with commercial creditiors BRAZILIAN negotiators have reached a preliminary accord with commercial creditors over a new balance of debt conversion options in its 'Brady-style' agreement reached in principle last July, according to bankers, Christina Lamb reports. Creditors have agreed to Brazil's demand to set a maximum of 40 per cent of the Dollars 41bn (Pounds 26.6bn) debt for conversion into par bonds and a minimum of 35 per cent into discount bonds. Par bonds are fully guaranteed for principal and 12 months' interest and are the most expensive instrument for Brazil. Discount bonds are also fully secured but are less attractive to bankers because they carry a 35 per cent discount and pay only market interest rates, which are at a historic low. The next step is for lawyers on both sides to go over the fine print of the debt agreement. Brazil still faces the hurdle of negotiating an accord with the International Monetary Fund to provide money for guarantees. The latest figures show that the total stock of Brazil's foreign commercial debt has fallen from Dollars 44bn to Dollars 41bn, partly as a result of payments but also because of large purchases of debt titles by Brazilian banks.</p>

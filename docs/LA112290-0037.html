			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> MORE BARS:  </P> <P> Tia Juana's Long Bar &amp; Mexican Cafe Deluxe, 14988 Sand Canyon Ave., Irvine.  </P> <P> The bar is open 11 a.m to midnight Sunday through Thursday, till 1:30 a.m.  Friday and Saturday. (714) 551-2998. Housed inside a restored 95-year-old lima  bean warehouse, this is the kind of cavernous bar where you might actually have  room to breathe. Order a cerveza (they claim to serve any Mexican beer you can  name) or a hand-shaken margarita, and pretend you're inside some upscale,  south-of-the-border restaurant that actually has napkins.

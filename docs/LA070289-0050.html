			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARADISE LOST  </P> <P> My wife and I look forward eagerly to your Travel Section every Sunday and  enjoy reading about all the places that we hope to visit some day. We  especially enjoyed the June 18 article by Georgia Hesse -- "Voyaging Between  the 'Lost Islands' of Micronesia." But the article's dateline puzzled us since  Tarawa Atoll has always been part of the Gilbert Islands and, although nearby,  not part of the Marshall Islands. Thanks again for all the inspiring travel  articles which propel our daydreams.  </P> <P> ALAN AND SHARON JOHNSON  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

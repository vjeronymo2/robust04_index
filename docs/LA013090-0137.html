			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LANDMARK SET TO BUY BANK OF ORANGE COUNTY ;  </P> <P> ACQUISITION: THE DEAL, SUBJECT TO RESOLUTION OF A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE TARGET  BANK, WOULD GIVE LANDMARK A KEY BRANCH IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY.  </P> <P> Landmark Bancorp said Monday it is close to agreement on terms for the  acquisition of Bank of Orange County in Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> But no firm price has been set, and the purchase is subject to resolution of a  lawsuit pending in San Jose against Bank of Orange County and some of its  current and former directors.  </P> <P> Craig Collette, Landmark's president, said he believes that the suit -- brought  by federal regulators acting as receiver for the failed Bank of Northern  California -- should be resolved in three to six months, clearing the way for  the acquisition.  </P> <P> Bank of Orange County is involved in the suit because its holding company,  Orange Bancorp, was a major shareholder in Bank of Northern California and its  former president, Lawrence Holmes, was a co-founder of the San Jose bank.  </P> <P> Roger Pratt, Bank of Orange County's president since early 1988, said  settlement talks with federal regulators are stepping up as an April trial date  for a $53-million negligence suit approaches. He said any settlement figure  should be "manageable" and should not significantly hurt his bank, which has  regained financial stability after several troubled years.  </P> <P> Pratt said he and Collette are longtime friends who have developed similar  business plans. He said his bank would be "an excellent addition" to Landmark's  operations. Landmark was the highest of five bidders who recently sought to  acquire the small Bank of Orange County, Pratt said. He wouldn't say what that  bid was.  </P> <P> The acquisition would give Landmark -- holding company for Landmark Bank -- a  strategic branch in an area where it has been picking up a number of business  customers. Landmark also would try to keep the doctors and other medical  professionals who currently bank with the Bank of Orange County.  </P> <P> Pratt said key people at his bank already have been offered jobs in the merged  operation.  </P> <P> A consolidation would create one of the county's larger banks, with nearly $208  million in assets, based on results from the banks at the end of December.  </P> <P> Landmark, with offices in La Habra, Anaheim, Lake Forest and Santa Fe Springs,  had $173 million in assets at the end of the year. Neither bank has yet  released earnings for the year.  </P> <P> The 10-year-old Bank of Orange County, a money-losing operation through most of  the 1980s, earned $210,000 through the first nine months last year. It has  turned in modest profits in recent years and has wiped out the problem loans it  had in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Landmark, an 11-year-old bank, earned more than $1.4 million in the first three  quarters of 1989.  </P> <P> Bank of Orange County, once touted as a model for aggressive independent banks  in California, began losing money in 1984, a year after Holmes, its founding  president, tried to expand by investing heavily through Orange Bancorp in Bank  of Northern California. Orange Bancorp owned 51% of the San Jose bank, which  Holmes co-founded with a group of Northern California investors.  </P> <P> In mid-1984, Holmes abruptly resigned his $300,000-a-year post and left the  area, defaulting on $275,000 in personal loans that he had obtained from three  other area banks. Shortly after his May departure, Orange Bancorp reported a  $1.4-million loss for the first half of the year.  </P> <P> In August, 1985, with Holmes gone and losses mounting at both banks, Orange  Bancorp sold its interest in Bank of Northern California to a group of Santa  Rosa investors.  </P> <P> In 1986, Bank of Northern California was declared insolvent and seized by  regulators. A suit filed by the bank and its minority shareholders alleges that  the investors who bought Orange Bancorp's controlling block of shares ran Bank  of Northern California into the ground with bad loans.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was cited in mid-1987 by the holding company for Pacific National  Bank as a reason that it was withdrawing its offer to acquire Bank of Orange  County.  </P></p>

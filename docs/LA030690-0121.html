			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH: SIGNS OFTEN GO UNHEEDED  </P> <P> The fatal frenzy of the heart that on Sunday apparently killed college  basketball star Hank Gathers takes the lives of about 400,000 Americans each  year. Experts say one reason may be that physicians as well as patients  underestimate early warning signs that could lead to sudden cardiac death.  </P> <P> Those warning signs -- such as blackouts and heart palpitations reflecting an  invisible defect in a person's heart -- can now be explored using various new  techniques, and may be effectively treated to prevent the development of  something worse.  </P> <P> But some physicians are unaware of the seriousness of those signs and the  importance of getting patients to specialized centers for screening, experts  say. And some patients, particularly athletes, resist taking drugs that can  impair their performance.  </P> <P> "We're very steamed about this issue, because there are so many cases of this  around," said Dr. David S. Cannom, director of cardiology at the Hospital of  the Good Samaritan and co-chairman of a group called the Coalition for the  Prevention of Sudden Death.  </P> <P> "There are still well-meaning people that don't realize the potential risk to  the patient," Cannom said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, cardiologists said Monday that it can be difficult to assess  precisely the degree of risk a person faces from a heart abnormality. And it is  a rare case in which a physician can tell a patient absolutely what exercise to  do and not to do.  </P> <P> They also emphasized that sudden cardiac death occurs only in people with  diseased or damaged hearts. There is no evidence, they stressed, that exercise  poses any risk to people with normal, healthy hearts.  </P> <P> Gathers, 23, the sixth-leading collegiate basketball scorer in the country,  died Sunday after collapsing during the first half of the Lions' West Coast  Conference tournament semifinal game between his school, Loyola Marymount, and  the University of Portland.  </P> <P> The precise cause of Gathers' death was not known Monday. The Los Angeles  County coroner's office performed an autopsy Monday afternoon, but no results  were to be released for at least several days pending completion of  toxicological tests and tissue studies.  </P> <P> However, Gathers was known to have had so-called cardiac arrhythmia, an  abnormality of the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat. The condition had been  diagnosed during tests performed in December after Gathers passed out during a  basketball game.  </P> <P> Arrhythmia, caused by a disturbance in the electrical impulses to the heart,  can lead to cardiac arrest. It is often related to structural defects in the  heart, either congenital or acquired through disease.  </P> <P> In interviews Monday, cardiologists said sudden cardiac death occurs most  frequently in older men with heart disease. But perhaps one in 10 cases occurs  in people under age 30, many of whom have had no previous indication that  anything was wrong with their heart.  </P> <P> Approximately 10 to 20 young athletes succumb each year to sudden cardiac  death, said Dr. Steven Van Camp of San Diego, who has been studying such cases.  Almost invariably, he said, an autopsy turns up some sort of defect or disease  in the heart.  </P> <P> "We have no evidence that exercise damages the healthy heart," said Van Camp,  vice president of the American College of Sports Medicine. "But if people have  significant heart disease, then exercise can present an increased risk."  </P> <P> "Of the millions of apparently healthy athletes in this country, all but a  handful are fully able to compete," Van Camp said. "The issue is how to find  the handful who are at greatest risk."  </P> <P> One tip-off can be difficulties brought on by exercise -- an unusual shortness  of breath, chest discomfort, irregular heart rhythms or blackout spells. People  who experience those symptoms should be evaluated carefully to assess their  degree of risk, specialists say.  </P> <P> Such an evaluation might involve monitoring the patient's heart during  treadmill exercising, examining the heart's structure using ultrasound and  recording with an electrocardiogram the electrical impulses that precede  contraction of the heart muscle.  </P> <P> If necessary, additional tests can be done to pinpoint the cause of an abnormal  rhythm, Cannom said. Those include an angiogram to look for evidence of  coronary artery disease, a biopsy of heart muscle tissue for infection, and  other more elaborate procedures.  </P> <P> Using those tools, it is now possible to estimate whether a patient is at low  or high risk of cardiac arrest and sudden death, Cannom said. Patients,  physicians and families must then decide how aggressively they wish to treat  the condition.  </P> <P> The choices include anti-arrhythmic drugs, which suppress the excitability of  the heart, and a device called a defibrillator, which can be implanted in a  person's chest to shock the failing heart back into normal rhythm when it goes  awry.  </P> <P> "Some may decide that it's a one-in-100 risk (of cardiac arrest) and they'll  live with it," Cannom said. "Some will decide it's one in 20 and not to live  with it and to have a defibrillator put in."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, each treatment has drawbacks. A defibrillator can cost $50,000  to install and there can be complications. Anti-arrhythmic drugs can lower  blood pressure, decrease heart rate and affect performance.  </P> <P> "Young people often are not compliant with their medication," Van Camp said.  "And athletes especially may be reluctant to take medications which they feel  are affecting their performance, especially if they have been doing well for  some period of time."  </P> <P> Gathers, who began taking anti-arrhythmic drugs after his blackout in December,  appeared lethargic initially and blamed the medication. Friends said Sunday  night that Gathers had reduced his dosage or stopped taking medication  altogether.  </P> <P> It is often unclear how much to restrict a patient, physicians said.  </P> <P> "The concept is: How much smoke is there?" said one specialist who asked not to  be named. "There are some very clear-cut cases in which people are restricted,  and other cases in which they are not at high risk. Then there is a whole  spectrum in between.  </P> <P> "Then, if they are found to have abnormalities, and they are on medication, the  issue is (whether) the medication is controlling the abnormality well enough,  and will the patient take the medication," the specialist said.  </P> <P> Furthermore, an underlying abnormality in the heart may not be the whole story.  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas N. James, president of the University of Texas Medical Branch at  Galveston and a cardiologist who has studied sudden death and cardiac function  among athletes, said sudden cardiac death is more often attributable to several  factors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PATH OF A HEARTBEAT  </P> <P> There are many types of abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmias. Some --  occasional skipped heart beat -- do not interfere with daily activities. Others  -- very rapid or very slow heart beats -- can cause lightheadedness or  fainting. Extremely abnormal rhythms prevent the heart from pumping blood and  are often fatal.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: C1  </P></p>

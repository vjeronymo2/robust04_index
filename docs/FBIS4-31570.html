			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Council for Reunification has  expressed its indignation over the replacement of the state  anthem of the Republic of Moldova, as decided by the Chisinau  parliament. In a communique sent today to the ROMPRES news  agency, that council assesses that the decision to make such an  alteration sanctions, quote, the delusion perpetrated by leaders  who call themselves Moldovans and the legitimizing of  neocommunist, anti-union, and anti-Romanian forces, unquote.  The document also accuses the campaign of depriving the  Moldovan people of their national identity and progressively  sovietizing territories stolen from Romania, from the inside.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Brussels seeks to target road haulage industry MR Karel van Miert, the European Community's transport commissioner, yesterday came out strongly in favour of making road transport companies pay the full cost of the damage they do to the environment His appeal came as the European Commission published a green paper which called for environmental factors to be taken into account when setting transportation policy. The paper noted that over the next 20 years, the growth in road haulage would be 42 per cent, rail cargo 33 per cent, air passenger traffic 74 per cent, while the number of cars would increase by 45 per cent. It was particularly essential, Mr Van Miert said, for road hauliers to bear the full costs of the damage they did to the environment. He called for action to bring vehicle taxes into line across the Community to prevent distortions in competition. Increased taxes would provide more incentive to use other forms of transport such as the railways, inland waterways and the sea, he added. In another move to make EC transport more environmentally friedly, the Commission yesterday proposed that governments should cut excise duty on biofuels, made from agricultural products, to one tenth of that on regular petrol and diesel. Such a move would provide alternative uses for Community farm surpluses and reduce pollution. The Commission claimed that with such a tax incentive biofuels could become a commercial proposition, accounting for perhaps 5 per cent of overall petrol consumption in the long term. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC commissioner responsible for tax matters, said recent technical advances had brought down the cost of making biofuels. For instance, the wholesale price of 'diester', a fuel derived from vegetable oil, was now about Ecu300 (Pounds 212.70) per 1,000 litres, not very far above that of diesel, which was around Ecu200 per 1,000 litres. According to the Commission, use of biofuels would cut pollution from carbon and sulphur dioxide. But the European Environmental Bureau in Brussels said these reductions would be marginal from a tax scheme which might only encourage more driving and more 'industrial' farming. Though there appears to be some government and industrial interest in France, Italy and Germany in the Commission proposal, many EC governments will not want to see their excise revenue reduced. All EC tax plans require unanimity to pass. The Commission yesterday put on hold controversial proposals that would require environmental vetting to be built into planning procedures across the EC far earlier than is now the case, Reuters reports from Brussels. Commission sources said that Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment commissioner, failed to win backing from a majority of his colleagues in the 17-member EC executive for issuing such a proposal in the near future. His plan, the precise scope of which is still being discussed, would oblige public authorities to assess the environmental impact of development decisions well before they turn into concrete projects. Internal drafts of the proposal have already created a furore in Britain, which is at loggerheads with the Commission over a charge that environmental assessments carried out on seven large projects around the country were not adequate. Present rules agreed by governments in 1985 require such vetting - for new motorways, industrial plants and other large schemes - only at the project stage. Many say this is often too late to minimise damage to the environment. The plans have also met stiff opposition from aides to the Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, who have argued that planning procedures should be left to national authorities to determine, the sources said. They said Mr Ripa di Meana's plans would be reconsidered when the Commission discusses proposals to revise the existing rules for vetting projects.</p>

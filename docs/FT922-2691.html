			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: London Stock Exchange A serious point of principle underlies the London Stock Exchange's disagreement with the Inland Revenue over the treatment of expenditure on the Taurus electronic trading system. Should such outlays, much of which involve the salaries of people engaged in systems development, be treated as capital spending and depreciated over time? Or should they be charged to profit for tax purposes as they occur? The Stock Exchange favours the latter but, in recognition of the possibility that the Revenue may determine otherwise, it has sharply increased its tax provisions for the current year. This raises the broad question of what actually constitutes capital spending in an age where metal-bashing is giving way to high technology. Doubtless the Stock Exchange, whose aim cannot be much more than break-even plus, has an interest in charging whatever it can to profits. But Reuters says it also follows a similar policy with this kind of expenditure. Perhaps it will need a swift consultation with its tax advisers if the Revenue's view of Taurus is upheld. Nor is the approach of the Stock Exchange entirely consistent. While it regards the Taurus spending as current for tax purposes, it shows some sympathy with its members when they complain that they are having to pay now to develop a service which will only bring benefits for future users. That makes Taurus outlays sound like capital spending in spirit, if not in law.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE URGED TO ADOPT INITIATIVE  </P> <P> The news that Torrance Councilman Dan Walker's initiative on banning the use of  hydrogen fluoride may have qualified for City Council or ballot action has  brought the expected response from Mobil Oil. Wyman Robb, Mobil's manager, is  quoted as saying that the probability of a Bhopal-type disaster is "one in a  billion years." Maybe, but with Mobil's recent accident record, the year might  well be 1989 or '90.  </P> <P> Mr. Robb's statement reveals more than he realizes. His concentration on  minimizing the probability of a disaster is tacit admission that the magnitude  of a disaster caused by a major release of hydrogen fluoride would be  Bhopal-size. There is a lesson too in his continued use of soothing syrup as  the major attack on the real danger. Mr. Robb says, in effect, "There is no  real danger." Let's credit him with integrity. He believes there's no real  danger, so why spend money to eliminate a non-existent peril? I can see  corporate heads from Exxon, Ford, Cal Nev pipeline, Chernobyl and Three Mile  Island nodding in agreement.  </P> <P> For the corporate officers, the bottom line is profit. For the people who live  near Mobil, the priority is staying alive. The Torrance City Council should  take steps to implement the initiative when it is certified. Arguments about  the sponsor's motives are irrelevant. A cloud of hydrogen fluoride will kill  you whether you are running toward Sacramento or away from it.  </P> <P> The initiative is simpler, less drastic and quicker than the current court  action undertaken by the city of Torrance. A measure coming from the popular  initiative route may be harder to thwart by hostile court action. In any case,  it does not contradict the council's action, and two measures for defusing a  ticking time bomb are better than one.  </P> <P> BERNIE HOLLANDER  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

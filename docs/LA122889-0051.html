			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONUMENTAL;  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE WEIGHS ACQUISITION OF HISTORIC ARGUS COURT  </P> <P> Occidental College in Eagle Rock is exploring the purchase of a historic, but  currently dilapidated, bungalow court on Colorado Boulevard for off-campus  faculty housing, officials said last week.  </P> <P> Carl Vance, vice president of business and finance for the liberal arts  college, said the 16-unit Argus Court is of interest as part of an initiative  by the college's new president to extend ties to the surrounding community.  </P> <P> The 65-year-old Tudor-style court at 1760 Colorado Blvd. was one of three  Northeast Los Angeles structures designated last week as historic cultural  monuments by the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> Also receiving the designation in a council vote Wednesday were two houses in  the 4200 block of North Figueroa Street, both nominated by the Highland Park  Heritage Trust.  </P> <P> The owner of those houses, Juang Hsieh of Arcadia, supported the nomination.  After negotiating with the Highland Park group, Hsieh agreed to scrap his  initial plans to demolish the houses. Instead, he will build 10 units on vacant  land around them, retaining the two 1907 Craftsman-style structures as part of  the development.  </P> <P> Charles Fisher, a Highland Park resident and member of the Heritage Trust,  praised the developer for his willingness to work out a plan with the community  group.  </P> <P> "We feel that this development can be a clear signal that preservation and  responsible development can go hand in hand," Fisher said.  </P> <P> The nomination of Argus Court in Eagle Rock did not go as amicably. The  nomination was made by The Eagle Rock Assn., a community group that is  promoting the protection and restoration of older buildings as part of  ambitious proposal for the revitalization of Colorado Boulevard.  </P> <P> The organization identified the court, near La Roda Avenue, as a landmark in  jeopardy of being razed, said Jeffrey Samudio of TERA.  </P> <P> In an application to the Cultural Heritage Commission, Samudio wrote that the  court, designed by Edward C. Taylor, is one of only two of the distinctive  courts surviving in Eagle Rock. Its 16 bachelor cottages all retain original  1923 plumbing fixtures, Samudio said.  </P> <P> Samudio said the nomination was opposed by Argus Court owner Tony Anton of JNA  Colorado Ltd., who has stated plans to build a 28-unit apartment building on  the property. Anton could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Ronald M.  Dorffman, did not return phone calls from The Times.  </P> <P> The monument designation means that Anton would have to apply to the Cultural  Heritage Commission for permission to make any changes in the structure that  would damage its historic character. The commission has the power to block the  issuance of permits for up to 12 months.  </P> <P> Samudio said the college was one of two potential buyers TERA approached in the  hope of presenting Anton an option to sell the property instead of waiting a  year to redevelop it. The second potential buyer has asked not to be  identified, Samudio said.  </P> <P> The Eagle Rock Assn.'s overture to Occidental was well received, largely  because of initiatives by the college's new president, John B. Slaughter, to  embrace the community around the campus. Before Slaughter's appointment last  year, Occidental historically remained aloof from Eagle Rock, cultivating its  own image after that of the Eastern Ivy League schools.  </P> <P> Slaughter, formerly chancellor of a campus of the University of Maryland, has  made it clear he wants remold the college as an urban campus engaged with its  environment.  </P> <P> An opportunity to work with a community group to protect an endangered building  may serve that goal, Vance said.  </P> <P> "Our response was we certainly would want to consider it, for, among other  things, faculty housing, but it would depend on the cost and the cost for  renovation," Vance said.  </P> <P> At this point, the college has not contacted the owner of the courts. Before  initiating negotiations, college officials will have to inspect the property,  Vance said.  </P> <P> "We're examining the structures ourselves and trying to determine what we think  might be the cost of renovating them to some useful life. They're extremely run  down at this point."  </P> <P> Vance said the inspection will probably be made in mid January.  </P></p>

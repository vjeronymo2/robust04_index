			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / IMF puts conditions on Hungary credit accord HUNGARY has reached a 'gentleman's agreement' with the International Monetary Fund which clears the way for a new credit facility and the country's return to financial respectability. Under the accord, agreed in Washington this week by Mr Ivan Szabo, the finance minister, and Mr Peter Bod, the central bank governor, Hungary promised to bring the country's wayward public-sector deficit down from more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992 to 5.5 per cent next year. The Hungarian authorities plan a package of tax increases and spending cuts. Some will come into effect this year but most will bite only in 1994. Government officials were confident the measures would pass through parliament this month, allowing the formal signing of the accord with the Fund afterwards. An upward statistical revision of Hungary's GDP will make the targets easier to meet. In return the IMF will disburse a credit of SDR560m (Dollars 394m) over this year and next. Clearance will also release a Dollars 100m tranche of the World Bank's structural adjustment loan to Hungary. The agreement ends a year of embarrassment for Budapest since the Fund called the alarm on Hungary's budget deficit suspended the country's three-year SDR1.14bn credit. The resumption of IMF funds will have a marginal direct impact on the financing of Hungary's Dollars 21.4bn gross foreign debt, the largest per capita in eastern Europe. The National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, has had little difficulty in raising a record Dollars 2bn through international bond issues in the past six months. But the IMF's blessing is psychologically important. It should make international capital markets 'even softer' for Hungary, Mr Frigyes Harshegyi, NBH deputy president, said yesterday. The economic benefits of budgetary restriction may come at a heavy political price, however, for Hungary's conservative coalition government. The package would hit voters' finances in the run-up to scheduled elections in spring 1994 which the opinion polls say the government will lose heavily. Hungary's difficulties with the IMF began last year when recession, a collapse in taxable profits at banks and companies, and tax evasion, caused government finances to buckle.</p>

Yu Xiaosong, vice-minister of the State Economic and Foreign  Trade Commission, made the remarks at a conference held at the  prompting of the Preparatory Committee for the Hongkong Special  Administrative Region under the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress.    The conference put forward many constructive proposals on  how  to improve the management of Shenzhen port and promote the  prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.    In the spirit of the conference, the land ports in Shenzhen  will simplify the procedures for examination of incoming and  outgoing vehicles and collect a package fee so as to improve  efficiency. Concerned documents will be clarified for public  supervision and work hours of ports will be extended. Upon the  completion of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen expressway, the Huanggang  port will experiment with around-the-clock service.    Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  under the State Council and some members of the Preparatory  Commission for the Hongkong Special Administrative Region  attended the conference.</p>

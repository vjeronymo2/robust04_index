			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAMOUNT LIFTS OFFER FOR TIME TO $200 A SHARE  </P> <P> Playing to its Wall Street and courthouse audiences, Paramount Communications  on Friday raised its hostile bid for Time Inc. to $200 per share, or 14% more  than the $175-per-share offer spurned by Time directors a week ago.  </P> <P> The offer is conditioned on several factors, and Paramount has publicly  admitted that it won't be able to actually purchase Time's shares by July 7,  the day the new offer is set to expire.  </P> <P> But in one bold stroke, Paramount increased the pressure on Time's 12-member  board and the Delaware judge who will decide whether Time's anti-takeover  defenses are legal -- including Time's recent decision to acquire Warner  Communications for $14 billion.  </P> <P> Paramount intends to use the new offer as a "referendum" to urge Time  shareholders to send in their shares by July 7 so that Paramount lawyers can  argue at a crucial Delaware hearing on July 11 that most Time shareholders  favor the cash offer on the table.  </P> <P> That strategy -- anticipated by professional Wall Street traders and confirmed  by a member of the Paramount team -- won't hurt Time shareholders, because  federal securities law allows shareholders to withdraw any shares they have  tendered at any time before the offer expires. Even though Paramount is setting  a "cutoff" date, it expects to extend the solicitation to allow time for the  Delaware court ruling.  </P> <P> At the same time, Paramount's sweetened offer is meant to erode Time Inc.'s  argument that the earlier Paramount bid was "inadequate."  </P> <P> The Time board deeply angered some investors one week ago by spurning  Paramount's cash offer yet substituting no plan that would deliver some cash to  its own shareholders.  </P> <P> Instead, the Time board elected to pursue a 4-month-old plan to merge with  Warner but changed the terms of the deal to avoid a shareholder vote. No longer  would Time and Warner exchange shares in a tax-free deal: Now Time is committed  to shouldering massive debt to acquire half of Warner's shares for $70 each,  with the remainder to be acquired for a combination of cash, stock or debt  equities valued at $70.  </P> <P> The tender offer for Warner is set to expire July 17.  </P> <P> When asked about possible consequences for Warner of Paramount's new offer,  company spokesman Geoffrey W. Holmes said: "This is a matter for the Time board  of directors to deal with. We have a firm agreement with Time to which we  remain committed."  </P> <P> Paramount's increased bid received a quick but inconclusive response from Time,  which advised its shareholders not to act until they hear more from the  company. A spokesman for the media giant said its board will consider the new  Paramount offer but he declined to say when the board will convene.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stock Price Jumps  </P> <P> Although Paramount's announcement came after the close of New York Stock  Exchange trading, shares of Time rose $10.50 to $165.875 on speculative trading  pegged to a Page 1 story in USA Today, which reported that Paramount would soon  raise its bid to "around $200 a share." Paramount closed at $58, down 50 cents,  with more than 1.1 million shares changing hands, while Warner closed at  $58.625, down 50 cents.  </P> <P> Even though the new bid would increase Paramount's costs by $1.44 billion, a  Paramount spokesman insisted that the company intends to hold on to all pieces  of Time and Paramount, rather than sell off assets to ease the debt burden.  </P> <P> But some analysts were skeptical. Lisa Donneson, analyst with County NatWest  USA, said the sweetened bid will put Paramount's debt at about $12 billion in  1990, or about 8.5 times its annual cash flow from operations.  </P> <P> That debt burden is higher than the load carried by many entertainment or  publishing companies; it is even higher than the debt load of many cable  operators, which tend to be heavily leveraged, she noted. "To me that seems  very high," she said. "That could mean asset sales."  </P> <P> Kathryn Harris reported from Los Angeles and Paul Richter from New York.  </P></p>

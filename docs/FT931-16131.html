			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lower margins leave Reg Vardy at Pounds 1.9m THIS WINTER's revival in car sales came too late to help interim results at Reg Vardy. The Sunderland-based motor group reported an 8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 1.86m in the half-year to October 31, writes Matthew Curtin. The shares fell 8p to close at 125p. Turnover improved from Pounds 95.6m to Pounds 108m, but shrinking margins led to a fall in operating profits from Pounds 2.74m to Pounds 2.3m. Earnings per share were 3.01p, against 4.22p, on a larger number of shares in issue. The interim dividend is held at 1.3p. Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said attempts by some manufacturers to stimulate demand by dropping prices had not been entirely successful. However, he added lower interest rates and the removal of the special car tax, which came too late to revive sales in 1992, would stimulate demand this year.</p>

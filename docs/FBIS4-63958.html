			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Selivanov from Odessa under the "Ukraine" </F> rubric: "In What Mountains Is Vitaliy Radetskiy Going To Fight?  Army Exercises Have Taken Place in the Carpathians"]    [Text] The Carpathian-based mountain training center of  the Ukrainian Army has engaged the personal attention of  Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy. In mid-May he  attended the combat training drills of motorized infantry, tank  and artillery units that were held in the mountains. The  minister was displeased with the degree of his subordinates'  readiness to operate in mountainous terrain and recommended that  unit commanders "place particular emphasis" on the subject.  Curiously, the last time close attention was paid to the  troops' mountain training was at the beginning of the 1980s,  when the Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan and effectively proved  themselves unable to counter the mujahidin operating in local  mountains.    It seems unlikely, however, that the Ukrainian Army is  planning a new march to Kabul. Still, the mountain ambitions of  the Kiev minister are entirely explicable if one recalls that  the sole mountainous area on Ukrainian territory excepting the  Carpathians is the Crimean peninsula. The stepped-up mountain  training of Ukrainian Army units could be interpreted as a clear  sign of Kiev's comprehensive preparations for the forcible  settlement of the Crimean problem. Moreover, one should realize  that so specific and purposeful an activity by the Defense  Ministry indicates that the stage of making a political decision  in principle on the matter is long past. Apparently, it is the  existence of a specific mission that explains Mr. Radetskiy's  concern over the state of the troops' mountain training.    However, one cannot read without a smile a report by the  Kiev-based GOLOS UKRAINY newspaper which, while analyzing the  Ukrainian troops' combat readiness, cites an inadequate grasp of  the state language by soldiers and officers as one of the main  reasons for the drawbacks exposed, something that "jeopardizes  the command and control of troops." I think that the Ukrainian  journalists' fears about a lack of command and control of troops  are somewhat exaggerated. Vitaliy Radetskiy and all his  subordinates have a perfect grasp of Russian, in which they  actually express themselves when discussing any more or less  serious matters.</p>

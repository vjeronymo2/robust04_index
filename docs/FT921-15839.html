			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: Education: the casualties and the consensus Sir, as a member of the Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (CATE), I rather object to the claim in your leading article that Mr Kenneth Clarke's proposal to move part of teacher training from colleges to schools demonstrates a failure on his part to 'consult widely' or to 'consider expert opinion'. As he stated in his speech at Southport, the secretary of state has worked closely with CATE on the new proposals and has certainly listened to what CATE has had to say. Moreover, the current proposals are even now being put out for consultation. Furthermore, far from there being no consensus about the shift in teacher training, as you claim, both the inspectorate and most of the teacher unions, at least, consider it to be sound in principle. The period of consultation now upon us will doubtless refine the practicability of the scheme. Anthony O'Hear, professor of philosophy, University of Bradford, Bradford, W Yorkshire, BD7 1DP</p>

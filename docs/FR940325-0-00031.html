			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, EPA believes that it has adequate information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at this time to determine the appropriate credit accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure. As described above, EPA has sufficient information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now to make these determinations. Implementation of LIFO credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting has demonstrated to EPA's satisfaction that LIFO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit accounting does not fulfill the intention of the ABT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to provide engine manufacturers the flexibility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentives needed to generate environmental benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers generated credits in MY 1990 which they anticipated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being able to use in MYs 1991&hyph;1993. At the same time, they have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated credits in MYs 1991 and 1992, which are valid to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used through MY 1996. However, because any credit usage that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs in MYs 1991 and 1992 must, according to LIFO credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting, be offset first by the credits generated in MYs 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1992, the result is that the credits which are valid until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996 are being withdrawn, while older credits, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled to expire in MY 1993, are sitting in the bank. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LIFO credit accounting, if a manufacturer wanted to utilize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits generated in MY 1990, they would be required to withdraw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all the 1990 credits before generating new credits. Thus, there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is little incentive to introduce cleaner technology until all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits have been withdrawn. In addition, the PM standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tightening after three model years, and manufacturers have little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity under LIFO credit accounting to both adjust to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 standard and generate credits for the 1994 standard change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a delay in this rulemaking would prolong the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disincentives associated with LIFO credit accounting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRDC and MECA raised various concerns about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impact of these changes, many of which were based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on serious reservations about ABT programs in general. They were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that credits did not reflect real innovations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution control, but merely reflected the difference between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification levels and the level of the standard. Increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits therefore provided no net benefit to the environment. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that context, they were concerned that application of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the 1993 reports on the 1992 model year engines would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly increase the number of credits available to engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, and therefore ease the burden in complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more stringent emissions standards applicable in model years 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 1996. This artificial extension of credit life would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worsen air quality by allowing continued production of older,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dirtier engines beyond that allowed without the credit accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change. NRDC claimed that the proposal's theoretical arguments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the credit change have a weak analytical support, and do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the suggested rule change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

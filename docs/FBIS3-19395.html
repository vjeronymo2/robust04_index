A  red-green government following the Bundestag election in October  is "not a desirable alternative," Stihl told journalists in  Munich today.    Stihl told the DDP/ADN news agency that industry also  rejects  the idea of a social democratic-liberal coalition involving the  Social Democratic Party [SPD] and the Free Democratic Party, as  the left wing of the SPD is pursuing a policy hostile toward  industry and which threatens jobs. His skepticism toward a  change of government was shared by Klaus Murmann, president of  the Federal Confederation of German Employers' Associations,  Tyll Necker of the Federal Association of German Industry, as  well as Herbert Spaeth of the National Association of German  Skilled Crafts.    The industrialists met with Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the  "top-level Munich talks of German industry."</p>

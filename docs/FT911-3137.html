			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / IMF/World Bank Washington 1991: Japan suggests SDR issue to meet finance demands MEMBERS of the International Monetary Fund's policy making Interim Committee will be asked on Monday to consider plans to pump additional reserve assets into the global economy. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, disclosed yesterday that Japan has suggested that the Interim Committee should discuss a new allocation of special drawing rights, the international reserve asset issued by the IMF, to help meet the world's high demand for finance from the end of this year. An SDR allocation could help some countries overcome short-term financing difficulties. Some developing countries, for example, are so short of currency reserves that they have problems obtaining much needed imports. The Japanese suggestion marks a change of heart concerning the SDR by the IMF's second-biggest member. Until now Japan, along with the US, Britain and Germany, has opposed new issues of SDRs on the grounds that they would constitute an unnecessary and potentially inflationary addition to global liquidity. It is thought that Tokyo's decision to raise the idea has been prompted by concern that that there will be insufficient funds to meet the financing requirements of eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The SDR is a basket currency, made up of the US dollar, yen, D-Mark, sterling and French franc, and is worth about Dollars 1.33. It was introduced in the 1970s to expand global liquidity and 21.4bn SDRs are held in the reserves of IMF members. The last SDR issue was in 1981. Mr Camdessus said yesterday that the world should be able to cover its financing needs this year. The question was whether it would be able to do so from next year onwards. The IMF's management was consulting with the fund's executive board on the merits and demerits of an SDR allocation and would be 'delighted' if the IMF membership agreed to launch an in-depth study of the issue. However, it is uncertain whether the idea will attract the necessary 85 per cent support among fund members to be adopted. To be implemented, an SDR allocation must have the backing of the US, but yesterday Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international monetary affairs, said Washington would not be able to support such proposals on the grounds that it would be unconditional liquidity. It is also unclear how large any SDR allocation should be and how it would be made.</p>

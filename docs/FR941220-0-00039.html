Section 307(a) of Public Law 103&hyph;332 required that no funds made available in the Act may be expended by an entity unless the entity agrees that in expending the funds they will comply with the ``Buy American Act.'' As it did in FY 1994, the Department continues to interpret this requirement to apply to assistance programs. Section 501 of Public Law 103&hyph;316 only states that it is the sense of Congress that, to the greatest extent practicable, all equipment and products purchased with funds made available in the Act should be American-made. Therefore, the Department is taking the position that Congressional intent was different for awards made by the Bureau of Reclamation. As such, only the provisions in the regulation addressing the sense of Congress (&sect;12.700) and the notice requirements (&sect;12.710) will apply to awards made by the Bureau of Reclamation using appropriated funds for FY 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> December 20, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Dean A. Titcomb, (Chief, Acquisition and Assistance Division), (202) 208&hyph;6431. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On September 30, 1994, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (``the Act'') was signed into law. Section 307(a) of the Act was entitled ``Compliance with Buy American Act.'' The section applied to funds appropriated or transferred pursuant to the Act for the purchase of any equipment or product that may be authorized to be purchased with financial assistance. Section 307(b) expressed the ``sense of the Congress'' that entities receiving the assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 307(b)(2) required that in providing the financial assistance under the Act, the Secretary shall provide to each recipient of the assistance a notice describing the requirement. No other specific guidance was given regarding the implementation of this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is revising Subpart E of 43 CFR Part 12, to implement these requirements for awards made using appropriated funds for FY 1995. No specific guidance was provided by Congress, so the Department decided to continue its implementation of these requirements based upon the final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36713). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the applicability of different appropriation acts and the fact that the requirements are different, the notice in paragraph (b) of &sect;12.710 has been changed to account for the reference to language in Pub. L. 103&hyph;332. A separate notice included in paragraph (c) of &sect;12.710 has been amended to account for the reference to language in Pub. L. 103&hyph;316 and its use only for awards made by the Bureau of Reclamation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of Good Cause for Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and for Making Rule Effective Upon Publication <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is usually the practice of the Department to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the Department waives notice and comment on these regulations under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)). This section provides that notice and comment for rulemaking is not required when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. The Department believes further public comment on the revision of this regulation is unnecessary because the substance of these provisions is based on statutory requirements governing the award of assistance with appropriated funds for FY 1995, that the Department is unable to change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrative Procedure Act provides that rules be published at least 30 days prior to their effective date, except as otherwise provided by an agency on a finding of good cause (5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)). In this case, because this requirement is a statutory condition of expenditure of appropriated funds in this fiscal year, the Department has determined that the rule must be effective upon publication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since it is anticipated that no additional costs will be imposed on a substantial number of small entities as a result of the rule.

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (8): 'Cost effective with a sound framework' - The island's status is not that of a flag of convenience. Its ships fly the red ensign THE ISLE of Man's shipping register is more than 200 years old and is part of the greater British register. Until 1984, it was used for registering local vessels based in the island's four harbours. Legislation enacted in 1984 saw the beginning of the register's expansion to take on vessels from other areas. The register has 130 ships, compared with 76 in 1986. Unlike Liberia or Panama, which have 1,605 and 4,953 ships respectively, the Isle of Man's status is not that of a flag of convenience. The ships fly the red ensign. Mr David North, minister of the Manx department of highways, ports and properties, said: 'The Isle of Man is recognised as being highly reputable and totally acceptable to shipping companies that want to be offshore but with the British flag. The island provides a cost-effective operation and has a good legislative framework with its own merchant shipping acts.' The legislation enacted in 1984 established the Manx Marine Administration, with its own surveyors. This ensured that international conventions were complied with by ships on the register. Ships qualifying as British must be owned or managed by an Isle of Man-registered company that has its principal place of business in the island. The island also gained full Maritime Convention status, which means that internationally recognised agreements for seafarers also apply to the Isle of Man. Because of this, the Marine Administration can issue globally acceptable international certificates. Fees charged by the administration cover registration, survey and certification of ships. The government has set the fees to cover only the administrative costs involved. No additional registration tax or tonnage fee is charged. 'The register does not make money for the island. But the Manx government is looking to economic spin-offs, such as employment locally and the use of financial services available in the island,' said Mr North. In the first 18 months after enactment of the legislation, about 100 British-registered ships transferred to the Manx register. By 1988 there were 139, and since then the register has remained at about 130, with some movements on and off. Approximately 80 of the ships are ocean-going cargo vessels or tankers. The balance are coastal ships, supply boats and tugs. The island also has a growing yacht register, which currently holds around 300 vessels, ranging from small yachts to large, luxury ocean-going vessels. All ships are inspected by the administration surveyors when they first go on the register, to ensure that they comply. Thereafter, inspection takes place at least once every five years, though for some it is several times a year. Of 24 ship management companies based in the Isle of Man, eight are deemed international. 'There are not the British companies left to transfer now,' said Capt David Bruce, the Manx chief marine surveyor. 'We have begun looking beyond the UK to expand the fleet base. The Manx register appeals to British operators, because we follow British regulations and require British senior officers. This may make expansion outside the UK slightly difficult.' Capt Bruce initially targets Europe for further growth, and observes: 'Maybe the requirement for British senior officers will be replaced by a requirement for European officers.' In December, the island introduced legislation permitting 'bareboat' charter of vessels. This allows companies to split the jurisdictions for ownership and operation of a vessel. 'This type of registration gives the ship-owner a flexible and attractive package,' explained Capt Bruce. Jurisdictions differ in their attractiveness, in considerations such as mortgaging facilities or manning requirements. The vessels must comply with all regulations for a Manx-registered vessel, except ownership requirements. No ships have yet registered under this legislation, but Capt Bruce believes this will change shortly. 'Once we have the first couple of vessels, then the other companies will see that it works.' Mr North sees the way forward as adoption of a package approach that will appeal to shipping companies. He hopes to see them use the Isle of Man for more of their activities, such as insurance, fund management and other financial operations. 'This will provide the shipping community in the island with a broader base and encourage expansion in the whole business community,' he said. 'We are looking this year to joint marketing of the island as a centre for shipping  -jointly with the Manx Treasury, insurance authority and Financial Supervision Commission, as well as the island's private business sector.' This package deal will be marketed not only to potential Isle of Man clients, but also to companies with ships already on the Manx register that currently obtain these additional services elsewhere. Mr North sees shipping as a highly competitive market, but feels that the island may be able to lure companies away from places such as Bermuda. 'The Isle of Man has a lot to offer in terms of its regulatory authorities,' he said.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Serbian court rejects plea for Draskovic SERBIAN opposition leaders were meeting last night to decide whether to call mass protests in Belgrade after the supreme court rejected an international appeal to release the ailing opposition figure, Mr Vuk Draskovic. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia yesterday ignored a plea from Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, the French president's wife, to release Mr Draskovic who last week began a hunger strike in protest against his imprisonment. Mr Draskovic and his wife were arrested and severely beaten at a demonstration in Belgrade last month at which a policeman and a protester were killed. 'He (Milosevic). . . . did not conceal his displeasure at having to see her,' said a member of the Serbian delegation who attended the one-hour meeting. Mr Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Serbia's ruling Socialists, dismissed as 'cynical' the intervention of Mrs Mitterrand 'while Serbia was in a dungeon'. Leaders of the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), Serbia's biggest opposition party, held closed-door meetings after hospital doctors said Mr Draskovic's condition had 'deteriorated'. Diplomats in Belgrade yesterday said the 'arrogance' of Mr Milosevic could backfire and prompt unrest in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. 'People may take to the streets. The prognosis on Vuk is so bad. The supreme court has basically said it works for the regime.' Meanwhile, Serb and Croat commanders at the last minute pulled out of talks with the commander of the Bosnian army which were to have been held yesterday at Sarajevo airport on the establishment of a ceasefire and the safe havens issue. Reports from all three sides said fighting continued yesterday in north, central and southeast Bosnia. In the southwestern city of Mostar, Bosnian radio said Croat forces fired on the 16th century Ottoman bridge, which is a UN landmark and the symbol of the battered city. Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio said Serb forces in Brcko in north Bosnia brought in reinforcements after suffering heavy losses in fighting with Moslems. The UN said many key roads were blocked in central Bosnia where Moslems and Croats, allies against Serbs earlier in the war, are fighting for territory.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Leading Article: EC plan from Mr Delors BY HIS discussion of European Community competitiveness at the Copenhagen summit yesterday, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, prodded EC leaders to take a few tentative steps on a long journey. Unfortunately, not all of the steps seem to be in the right direction. The difficulties start at the beginning, with the excessive emphasis on EC 'competitiveness'. The idea of a life and death economic struggle with competitors abroad may help politicians overcome entrenched obstacles to needed reforms. But it is a dangerous misrepresentation of reality, since it reinforces the notion that EC's relations with its trading partners are a zero-sum game. The issue is not 'competitiveness', but EC economic performance. The US did not create 29m jobs between 1970 and 1990, compared with only 9m in the EC, because it was more competitive than the EC. It did so because its labour markets worked better. This is only the preamble. At the heart of Mr Delors' plan are eight points: movement towards the single EC currency; completion of the Uruguay round, along with fairness in world trade; investment in research and development; investment in transport and telecommunications networks; investment in the technological revolution; reform of education systems; improvements to the fiscal basis for economic development; and a different focus to labour market policy. Some good ideas The plan is excellent in parts, in its support for vouchers to allow lifelong training, for example, for active labour market policies and, above all, for completing the Uruguay round. But it is far from ideal. Mr Delors argues, for example, that member states must pull their economies back into line on the road to a single currency. But implementation of the convergence criteria in the Maastricht treaty will fail to provide immediate help to the EC economy. Equally worrying are some proposals for EC involvement in the international trading system. Mr Delors shows courage in his willingness to confront France's growing doubts about liberal trade. But he also suggests that a prospective world trade body should take account of currency movements, of capital flows, of the need to share the costs of environmental protection and of support for social progress. Unless carefully handled, such ideas could become excuses for protectionism. Also disturbing is the crudely quantitative approach to industrial policy. Spending on research and development should, says Mr Delors, be increased to 3 per cent of gross national product from the current 2 per cent; EC transport and telecommunications networks, costing Ecu30bn, must be established; and the EC should invest in the technological revolution, including a new and expensive information system. How can Mr Delors, or any official, know these are either the right plans or the right numbers? Labour market There are too many such ideas for wish-driven public spending and too little reliance on the market. The latter is truest of attitudes towards employment. There is no mystery why the EC's employment record is so poor. EC member states have robbed participants of incentives. For far too many people it makes little sense even to seek employment. Similarly, there is too little incentive to offer employment. The wedge between what it costs to employ a worker and what the newly employed worker receives is too great. Things will not improve if the character of labour market intervention does not change. Here Mr Delors puts forward at least one excellent idea, which is to shift taxation away from labour and towards natural resources. But Mr Delors rejects substantial changes in labour protection laws and the design of EC welfare states. He is wrong. Both will have to alter. EC member states must find ways to support personal incomes that do not push so many people out of the labour market. This agenda is, like the curate's egg, good only in parts. It is good to the extent that the issue of the EC's economic future is being seriously addressed. It is good too in some of the ideas being advanced. But Mr Delors has not yet advanced a convincing plan. His task is to do so, ideally by next December.</p>

Mr. Bekker said in a radio program this  morning that one could also ask whether the report would have  seen the light if the IFP was going to participate in the  election. On the alleged involvement of a prominent Transvaal  IFP leader, Mr. Thembo Khoza, Mr. Bekker said the IFP believes  in the legal principle that one is innocent until proven  otherwise.</p>

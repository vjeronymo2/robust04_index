			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Istanbul, June 8 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin on Wednesday [8 June] said that Turkey supports the  expansion with time, of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  adding however that NATO-Russia relations should not overshadow  its ties with other members.    He was speaking to reporters prior to a NATO ministers  council meeting and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  meetings which will start in Istanbul and will end on Friday.    Reminding that Russia accepted the Partnership for Peace  plan  during the meeting last January, he added that the most  important factor there is that former Warsaw Pact members and  Russia will sign a single agreement.    A joint document is expected to be signed at the end of the  NATO meetings and paragraphs directly concerning Russia are  expected to take place in the meeting.

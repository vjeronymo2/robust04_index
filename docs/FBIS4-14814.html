			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe April 2 TASS -- Tajikistan Parliament Chief  Imomali Rakhmonov has described the results of his three-day  visit to Pakistan as highly productive. A whole package of  documents and first of all a treaty of friendship and  cooperation between the two countries was signed during the  talks, he said.    At a news conference on Saturday, Rakhmonov emphasised that  the Tajik delegation had found understanding and interest on the  part of the Pakistani side on all matters discussed. The Tajik  leader devoted special attention to economic aspects of the  talks, pointing out that the Pakistani Government favours closer  economic cooperation with his country, particularly in  hydropower engineering and road building.    The discussion of the inter-Tajik problem figured  prominently  during the meetings between the heads of state, the Tajik leader  said. The Pakistani side welcomed Dushanbe's initiative  concerning a peaceful settlement of the conflict and forthcoming  talks in Moscow with representatives of the opposition with the  participation of Russia and the United Nations organisation, and  measures to repatriate Tajik refugees as soon as possible.    "We stated that we are prepared to launch a dialogue with  any  sober-minded opposition forces that are sincerely interested in  the termination of the armed confrontation," Rakhmonov said.    "We do not put forward any pre-conditions except putting an  end to provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border and to terrorist  acts inside the country and allowing an unhindered repatriation  of Tajik refugees," he said.    Speaking about the initiative proposed by Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev to establish a Euro-Asian union, Rakhmonov  pointed out that the idea merited attention.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PEOPLE FLEE TO BEACH AS THE MERCURY SOARS  </P> <P> Record-breaking temperatures in parts of Orange County sent tens of thousands  of people to the beach on Sunday, while a dense layer of smog prompted health  officials to urge those most affected to stay inside.  </P> <P> The mercury was pushed to 91 degrees in Santa Ana on Sunday, breaking a  previous record temperature of 89 degrees set in 1957, said Steve Burback, a  meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides weather information for The  Times.  </P> <P> Burback said record temperatures were probably set in other parts of the county  as well, but immediate information was not available. Temperatures "should  start cooling off by a couple of degrees on Monday," he said.  </P> <P> Anaheim reported the highest temperature in the county at 94 degrees, according  to WeatherData.  </P> <P> To escape the weather, thousands of people flocked to the county's beaches.  </P> <P> "This was the most crowded day we've had so far this year," said Huntington  Beach lifeguard Brent Peters, who estimated that more than 60,000 people showed  up on that city's beaches.  </P> <P> The hot weather was aggravated by a thick layer of smog, which prompted the  South Coast Air Quality Management District to call a first-stage smog alert in  North Orange County. A stage-one alert means that a potential health hazard  exists.  </P> <P> A first-stage episode usually affects only smog-sensitive people with chronic  lung or heart disease, the elderly, the chronically ill and youngsters who are  exercising. A more advanced-stage smog alert indicates a possible hazard to  everyone.  </P></p>

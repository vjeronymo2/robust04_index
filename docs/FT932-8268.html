			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food issues weaken Reports of aggressive views from the chairman of French food manufacturer BSN weakened related stocks in the London market. Mr Antoine Riboud said BSN was being pressured by retailers to lower prices. While resisting this, he said the group would respond aggressively on price to protect its market share. Food specialists also took fright at comments on the downturn in trading in Europe as recession took its toll. United Biscuits fell 9 to 412p. BSN is the top biscuit producer in Europe. Unilever, which competes with BSN on some frozen products, lost 22 to 1036p. Cadbury Schweppes relinquished 9 to 447p.</p>

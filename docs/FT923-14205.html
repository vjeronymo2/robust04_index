			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Marine insurance claim fails THE WONDROUS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Lloyd, Lord Justice Nourse and Lord Justice McCowan): June 16 1992 A SHIP'S loss of earnings arising out of its inability to leave port because of failure to pay port dues is not covered by loss of hire insurance incorporating the new Institute War and Strikes hulls clauses, unless it tries to leave and is forced to stay, in that there is no 'detainment' within the meaning of the policy, or if there is it is a conditional detainment dependent on a conditional infringement of customs regulations and is excluded from the policy as being 'by reason of' infringement. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by Ikerigi Compania Naviera SA and others, owners of the Wondrous, from Mr Justice Hobhouse's decision that they could not recover from underwriters, Mr GCF Palmer and others, under two policies of marine insurance. LORD JUSTICE LLOYD said the Wondrous was chartered to load 30,000 tons of molasses at Bandar Abbas in the Persian Gulf for carriage to Europe. It arrived on March 10 1987. It did not sail until October 17 1988. By then huge liabilities had been incurred for port dues and demurrage. On October 20 1987 the shipowners claimed against the Hellenic War Risks Club for constructive total loss of the vessel. On July 14 1988 the club compromised the claim. It paid fifteen-sixteenths of the insured value of the hull but declined to accept notice of abandonment. So the shipowners were left with the vessel, which they sold, and the proceeds of insurance. They also received gross freight of Dollars 644,000 when the vessel eventually discharged at Aarhus in Denmark, plus Dollars 84,000 dead freight. Out of the gross freight they paid port dues and other charges. The net freight received was Dollars 326,607. The shipowners were covered under a loss of hire policy for 'war loss of hire and/or earnings'. The policy was subject to the Jardine Glanvill Ltd war loss of hire wording No 1, 17.4.84 which provided that the policy should only pay if, in consequence of the risks enumerated in the Institute War and Strikes Clauses Hulls Time 1.10.83, the vessel was prevented from earning hire. By clause 1.2 of the hulls clauses the insurance covered loss to the vessel caused by 'seizure, arrest, restraint or consequences thereof'. By clause 4.1.5 it excluded 'arrest, restraint, detainment . . . under quarantine regulations or by reason of infringement of any customs or trading regulations'. The shipowners said the vessel was prevented from earning hire in consequence of being 'detained' within the meaning of clause 1.2, and that they were entitled to recover Dollars 900,000. The underwriters relied on the clause 4.1.5 exclusion of detainment 'by reason of any customs or trading regulations'. Mr Justice Hobhouse found that until October 1988 the vessel did not have clearance under local customs regulations to leave Bandar Abbas. If it had tried to leave it would have been forcibly detained. There were two requirements to be satisfied before it could obtain clearance. The first, which was the vessel's responsibility, was payment of port dues plus a local tax on freight. The second, which was the exporter's responsibility, was the furnishing of a foreign currency guarantee (FCG) in respect of the cargo. As to the first requirement, the judge found that the immediate cause of the detention was failure to comply with local custom laws. But he referred to 'detention' in the conditional sense that if the vessel had tried to leave before paying port dues it would have been forcibly detained. In that sense only was it being detained. As to the furnishing of the FCG by the exporter, he found that if the owners had been prepared to put up the foreign exchange, the Iranian authorities would have been satisfied. As to clause 4.1.5, he held that the exclusion of loss arising from restraint or detainment 'by reason of infringement' of customs regulations applied. He said 'restraint' and 'detainment' had to be given a wide commercial interpretation and in a commercial sense the vessel was detained 'by reason of infringement' of customs regulations. It was the customs regulations that made it illegal to sail. That reasoning was correct. The judge correctly emphasised that the detention was conditional. The threat of detainment depended on prior infringement. Therefore, if 'detainment' in clause 1.2 must be read as including conditional detainment, so must 'infringement' in clause 4.1.5 include conditional infringement. Mr Hallgarten for the shipowners argued that infringement must mean 'actual infringement'. That was an oversimplification because: (1) In the case of quarantine regulations there did not need to be actual infringement - it was sufficient that detainment was 'under' the regulations. Why should the parties have required something different in the case of customs and trading regulations? (2) It did not make commercial sense to distinguish between actual and threatened infringement. If the vessel had attempted to leave but had been stopped the exclusion would have applied. Why should owners recover merely because they made no attempt to leave? (3) 'Capture, seizure, arrest etc' in the context of a war risks policy referred to political or executive acts. Clause 4.1.5 identified the sort of arrest, restraint or detainment the draughtsman had in mind. If that was the right approach, failure to obtain normal customs' clearance, for whatever reason, was outside the cover whether or not there was an actual infringement of customs regulations. If there was a detainment within clause 1.2, there was an infringement within clause 4.1.5. But it was preferable to say reading the two clauses together that there was not a detainment within clause 1.2 at all. It was common ground that if there was no detainment within clause 1.2, the shipowner's claim under the loss of hire policy must fail. Clause 4.1.6 excluded loss or damage 'arising from . . . any financial cause'. The judge thought failure to provide the FCG was not a financial cause since 'financial cause' must be read as applying to the ship and owners but not to cargo. There was no reason to confine the words to causes for which the shipowners were responsible. In the context of a war risks policy they should be given their ordinary meaning. The shipowners were also covered under a freight policy for risks set out in the Institute Time Clauses Freight, and the Institute War and Strikes Clauses. The judge held there was no loss of freight. He was right. Gross freight was earned on the cargo when the vessel discharged at Aarhus. The policy did not cover the increased cost of earning the freight, or the charterers' failure to pay freight when earned. Nor was there a partial loss of freight. Inman (1882) 7 App Cas 670 decided that, where there was a deduction from freight under a discretionary power conferred by charterparty, there was no loss of freight, total or partial. There was no difference between a discretionary power conferred under the charterparty and a subsequent agreement whereby shipowners agreed to defray certain expenses out of gross freight receivable. The claim for partial loss of freight was rejected. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed, but Lord Justice McCowan took the view that in the wording of clause 4.1.5 the parties had chosen to distinguish between quarantine regulations and customs and trading regulations, and that the courts were not entitled to redraw the bargain for them. For the shipowners: Anthony Hallgarten QC and Charles Haddon-Cave (Davis Grant &amp; Horton, Plymouth). For the underwriters: Nicholas Legh-Jones QC and Timothy Young (Hill Taylor Dickinson).</p>

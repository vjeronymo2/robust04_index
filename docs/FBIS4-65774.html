			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Unilateral Action in European </F> Policies"]    [Text] Vienna -- The 1993 foreign policy report, which has  been submitted to parliament, focuses on the European Union  [EU]. In the report, Foreign Minister Alois Mock mentions the  difficulties that Austria would be facing if it were forced to  "go it alone" as far as European policies are concerned.    Mock also tries to dispel fears that the Austria's foreign  policy has narrowed in scope because of its orientation toward  the EU, referring to Austria's participation in the Council of  Europe and the European Free Trade Association, as well as to  its commitment to the CSCE and the United Nations.    Mock noted a particular focus on human rights. The report  deals extensively with the United Nations and the Council of  Europe. The country's commitment to the Council of Europe shows  that, for Austria, European policies are not identical with the  EU. Generally, the report assesses the Council of Europe as a  catalyzer for the process of European unification.    In 1993, too, the cruel war in the former Yugoslavia was the  darkest chapter in Austria's foreign policy, according to Mock.  "Our most important concern was to prevent efforts aimed at the  partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina," he stressed. The foreign  minister expressed satisfaction at the creation of safety zones,  which Austria has demanded for a long time.    The foreign policy report explains the need for European  integration with the argument that internal and external  security can neither be ensured at the national level nor  achieved against each other. The future Europe must share  common values and a common political culture. For Austria, the  EU is the center of the new Europe.    Referring to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy,  Mock stated that Austria is working from the premise that  participation in the common foreign and security policy is  compatible with its constitution. Legal amendments will be  required as a result of Austria's entry into the EU. However,  this does not entail any obligation to participate in wars or to  join military alliances.    Commenting on the Western European Union (WEU), the report  stresses that it should be expanded as an instrument to  strengthen NATO's European pillar. In this context, the report  refers to current cooperation with regard to the embargo against  Serbia. After entry into the EU, Austria wants to apply for the  status of "observer" with the WEU.</p>

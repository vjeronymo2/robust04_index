			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPLES;  </P> <P> WHAT DO CHEFS DO WITH APPLES?;  </P> <P> RECIPES: CAMPANILE AND PATINA RESTAURANTS HAVE RISEN TO THE WASHINGTON STATE  APPLE COMMISSION'S CHALLENGE TO CREATE ALL-APPLE MENUS.  </P> <P> Restaurant chefs are always being asked to put together special "theme" menus.  Wine dinners are the most common -- the idea is to create dishes that flatter  some visiting wine-maker's product. When truffles are in season, chefs often  build a meal around them. (Ken Frank of La Toque went so far as serving truffle  ice cream -- it sounded weird, tasted swell.) All-garlic menus are frequently  offered.  </P> <P> And sometimes special meals are put together for promotional purposes. If, say,  the Potato Board is about to launch a new TV campaign, you'll find some chef  somewhere tossing potatoes into every course, from delicate hors d'oeuvres to  dessert (potato brownies aren't bad at all). One of the strangest of these was  a lunch Michel Richard of Citrus did for the French soda pop, Orangina. Anyone  for Orangina beurre blanc?  </P> <P>  A relatively more reasonable request was made recently by the Washington State  Apple Commission. Chefs around the country are being asked to create all-apple  menus. In Los Angeles, Campanile and Patina accepted the challenge. Here are  the results.  </P> <P> Campanile Apple Menu  </P> <P> Duck consomme with apple brunoise and potato Gorgonzola ravioli, Foie gras with  apple spaghetti, Roasted Squab With Applesauce and Polenta, Buckwheat Crepes  With Fried Apple Slices  </P> <P> ROASTED SQUAB WITH APPLESAUCE AND POLENTA  </P> <P> 4 squabs  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Olive oil  </P> <P> Applesauce  </P> <P> Polenta  </P> <P> Apple Brandy Sauce  </P> <P> Season squabs to taste with salt, pepper and little olive oil. Grill squab to  create linear marks, if desired. Roast at 500 degrees 8 to 10 minutes. Detach  breast from squab and slice thinly. Leave legs whole.  </P> <P> For each serving, put some Applesauce on each plate, place 2 Polenta triangles  on top. Arrange sliced squab over with legs. Spoon Apple Brandy Sauce and more  Applesauce over. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Applesauce  </P> <P> 4 Granny Smith apples  </P> <P> 1/2 cup Riesling wine  </P> <P> Peel and finely diced 3 apples.

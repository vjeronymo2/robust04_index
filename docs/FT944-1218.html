			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Mid-States intent on Nasdaq quote Mid-States, the US motor parts distributor quoted on the USM, said yesterday it still intended to proceed with its application to be traded on the US Nasdaq market. Shares in the company have halved this year from a high of 122p in late January to a low for the year of 61p on Monday because of repeated delays to its planned Dollars 15m (Pounds 9m) American Depositary Receipts issue. The shares rallied 2p to 63p yesterday. The listing is primarily aimed at moving away from a mainly UK shareholder base and attracting American investors to the company, which operates through its subsidiary, Mid-State Automotive Distributors of Nashville, Tennessee. Instead of placing the new issue straight away, the company now intends to list the minimum number of existing shares on Nasdaq early next year. A new issue would come later. In the nine months to September 30 turnover improved to Pounds 58.7m (Pounds 48m) while pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 4.61m). Gearing at the period end was 44 per cent.</p>

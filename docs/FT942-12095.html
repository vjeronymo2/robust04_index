			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Dutch poll set to break the mould Voters in the Netherlands go to the polls today in national elections which could well force the governing Christian Democrats (CDA) into opposition for the first time since 1918. The party appears to have made slight gains recently, according to an opinion poll yesterday, but is still behind its Labour party partners. A Nipo poll for Dutch television gave the Christian Democrats 32 seats in the 150-seat Lower House and Labour 35. Last week, opinion polls were giving the CDA 29 seats and Labour 35. At the last elections in 1989 the CDA won 54 seats and Labour 49. The Labour party, led by Mr Wim Kok, the current finance minister, is likely to emerge as the largest party overall. This would put Mr Kok in the running to become prime minister once the tortuous negotiations on the next government coalition are completed. Much will depend whether Mr Elco Brinkman, hand-picked successor of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the CDA leader who is stepping down, can rally the party rank-and-file in the last few hours of the campaign. Mr Ger Schild, director of the Nipo polling organisation, said yesterday a larger number of people than ever before would be going into the voting booth without knowing exactly how they will vote. 'A far larger proportion of people who voted CDA the last time around are as yet undecided about whom to give their vote than are people who supported other parties last time,' he said. The crumbling of support for the current coalition will benefit the right-wing Liberals, forecast to pick up seven more seats for a total of 29, and the left-of-centre D66, up 15 seats at 27. If these predictions hold true, Labour, the Liberals and D66 could rule without the help of the CDA. The CDA and its forerunner parties have belonged to every government coalition since full universal suffrage was introduced in 1918.</p>

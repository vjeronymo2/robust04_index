			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Traub and Maho scrap agreement TRAUB and Maho, two of Germany's largest machine tool makers, have scrapped a collaboration agreement announced three months ago. The link, which was to start with joint distribution and service networks and extend into buying and product development, was broken because of structural differences, Traub said. Instead, the company, Germany's second-biggest lathe maker after Gildemeister, has joined forces with Berthold Hermle, a much smaller milling and drilling machine specialist. At present, Hermle does around 70 per cent of its business in Germany, although its Swiss subsidiary Aciera and a newly founded US arm put in a strong performance last year. Overseas sales rose 27 per cent in the first nine months of last year to DM27m (Dollars 16.8m), while turnover at the German parent fell 25 per cent to DM64m. Reporting these figures in December, the company warned shareholders to expect heavy losses. In 1991, the last year for which figures are available, Traub lost almost DM30m. Meanwhile, Maho is understood to be continuing negotiations with rival Deckel on co-operation in manufacturing.</p>

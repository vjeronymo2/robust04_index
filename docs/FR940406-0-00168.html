A new &sect;86.1009&hyph;2001 is added to subpart K to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;86.1009&hyph;2001  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Calculation and reporting of test results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Initial test results are calculated following the Federal Test Procedure specified in &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001(a). Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28 (a)(4)(i)(B)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one additional significant figure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this section for each test vehicle or engine, dividing by the number of times that specific test has been conducted on the vehicle or engine, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional significant figure. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Final deteriorated test results.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The final deteriorated test results for each light-duty truck, heavy-duty engine, or heavy-duty vehicle tested according to subpart B, C, D, I, M, N, or P of this part are calculated by multiplying or adding the final test results by the appropriate deterioration factor derived from the certification process for the engine or evaporative/refueling family and model year to which the selected configuration belongs. For the purpose of this paragraph, if a multiplicative deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is less than one, that deterioration factor shall be one. If an additive deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is less than zero, that deterioration factor will be zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exceptions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are no deterioration factors for light-duty truck emissions obtained during testing in accordance with subpart O of this part or with &sect;86.146&hyph;96. Accordingly, for the CST and the fuel dispensing spitback test the term ``final deteriorated test results'' means the final test results derived in paragraph (b) of this section for each test vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The final deteriorated test results obtained in paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section are rounded to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard.

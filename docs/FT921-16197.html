			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Rift caused by conflict in Tbilisi could be hard to heal: Georgians are starting to wonder if either side is capable of bringing democracy to the republic GEORGY is not the sort of man you would expect to find standing on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Avenue dressed in mirrored sun-glasses and camouflage jacket and holding a Kalashnikov. He is an ordained priest in the Georgian Orthodox Church. He claims to have a religious reason for his opposition to Georgia's president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. 'He is Satan,' Georgy says simply. 'I am fighting against the anti-Christ.' The severity of the fighting in Tbilisi in the past two weeks has been more than matched by the near-hysterical language used by each side. The opposition is especially fond of religious and diabolical imagery to describe a man who says he prays twice a day. 'This is a man with three sixes on his head,' Mr Tengiz Kitovani, one of the two leaders of the opposition's military council, told reporters last week, in reference to the Great Beast of the biblical Revelations. Mr Gamsakhurdia is only slightly more measured in his denunciation of the opposition, referring to them variously as terrorists, criminals, hooligans, bandits, agents of Moscow and Mafiosi. This kind of propaganda, and the fiery Georgian temperament and tendency towards exaggeration, are all playing their part in inflaming conflict. As fighting enters its third week, both sides have made mistakes, both sides have told lies and both have fired on unarmed civilians. Georgians are starting to wonder if either side is capable of bringing democracy to the republic. Strangely, their leaders are neither career politicians nor soldiers. Mr Kitovani and Mr Dzhava Iosseliani, heads of the opposition's military council, are a former sculptor and a professor of dramatic art. Mr Gamsakhurdia, meanwhile, is the son of Georgia's most famous 20th century writer, Konstantin Gamsakhurdia, and a former English lecturer. All three were imprisoned as dissidents under Soviet rule and participated in the movement to 'liberate' Georgia from the Soviet Union in recent years. Mr Gamsakhurdia and Mr Kitovani were in the same class at school and until last year were close friends. Only Mr Tengiz Sigua, the former prime minister, and now appointed alternative prime minister by the opposition, lacks an artistic, dissident background. He is a former engineer. The issue which divides the opposition and Mr Gamsakhurdia is their charge that he has attempted to become a dictator. While he does not deserve to be compared with the likes of Ceausescu or Saddam Hussein, his rule does bear many of the hallmarks of a dictatorship. After his election with 87 per cent of the vote in May last year, Mr Gamsakhurdia broke his election promises to liberalise the economy and allow private ownership of land. In addition, the opposition claims, he took over the KGB and used a network of 85 directly-appointed prefects to impose absolute rule in the republic. Opposition deputies and former members of the government accuse him of refusing to heed other's opinions, appointing unsuitable and incompetent ministers, and ultimately attempting to rule without parliament. Mr Gamsakhurdia has also imprisoned several political opponents, including Mr Iosseliani, closed newspapers and attempted to control state television, prompting a strike among journalists. But his biggest crime in the eyes of the opposition was his ambiguous reaction to last August's attempted coup in Moscow when he obeyed instructions from the coup leaders to disarm the Georgian national guard. He refused to denounce the coup and publicly censured deputies who did. Defying the order to disarm, Mr Kitovani, founder of the national guard, led rebel soldiers into hiding outside Tbilisi. Mr Sigua resigned. Both went into opposition, forming a loose alliance with a range of political parties and armed groups, and the slide towards civil conflict began. That conflict could continue for some time. The opposition has begun to retreat from its recent threat to storm the government building where Mr Gamsakhurdia is under siege, perhaps realising that it lacks the firepower to be certain of victory. They may fear a popular backlash against any action resulting in heavy bloodshed. Mr Gamsakhurdia, while short of weapons and ammunition, apparently has more trained troops at his disposal than the opposition. He has also been bequeathed by Georgia's former Communist leaders a fortified bunker with electricity and running water. Supply lines from outside are still open. The opposition hopes he will give himself up or be forced out by those around him. Certainly, he has cracked under pressure before when, as a political prisoner, he was persuaded by the KGB to denounce fellow-dissidents on television in return for a reduced sentence. Whatever the fate of the president, the question of whether the opposition can successfully seize power and hold new elections without the conflict escalating into civil war depends on the level of support for the two sides in the provinces. There has so far been little response to the president's call for a general strike, but some observers suggest the rifts between fellow-Georgians caused by the ugly situation in Tbilisi may be difficult to heal.</p>

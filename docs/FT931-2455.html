			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Government closer to pits deal: Four power companies accept arbitration over coal contracts THE GOVERNMENT yesterday persuaded at least four electricity companies to accept binding arbitration to resolve disputes over contracts for coal-fired power. Ministers have blamed the disputes for delaying a white paper aimed at saving some of Britain's 31 threatened pits. The arbitration is the latest, and ministers hope the last, in a series of government initiatives over more than eight months to cajole the two generators in England and Wales and the 12 regional electricity companies into concluding deals with British Coal. Ministers are pushing the industry to conclude a final deal so that the government's white paper and the new contracts between British Coal and the generators, backed by deals with regional power companies, can be published before April 1. Existing deals between British Coal and the generators run out on that date. The Department of Trade and Industry is still uncertain whether the remaining obstacles can be overcome during the next few days but has provided time at next Thursday's cabinet meeting for government approval of the scheme. Ministers are also continuing to play down expectations on the number of pits which might be saved. Legal advice on the cross-Channel interconnector published yesterday was said to have undercut significantly the call from the Commons trade and industry select committee for a 16m-tonnes expansion of the market for coal. Senior Conservative MPs believe that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is preparing opinion at Westminster for a deal that might save fewer than 10 of the 31 threatened pits. The arbitration initiative follows a statement to MPs by Mr Heseltine on Wednesday that he would not publish a white paper until the electricity industry had signed contracts on coal-fired power. Most power industry executives believe a deal can be reached on 'base' contracts for 40m tonnes of coal next year and 30m for each of the next four. However, several regional companies are against signing anything until they see how the white paper affects the energy market. Talks between British Coal and the generators for additional contracts, thought to involve only about 40m tonnes over five years, have been put on hold while the base contract problems are resolved. The base contract differences involve National Power, PowerGen and at least four regional companies. Both the generators and at least two regional companies have agreed to arbitration.</p>

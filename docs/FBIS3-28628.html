			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- The Central People's  Committee and the Administration Council of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea today sent a message of greetings in  joint name to the international seminar on the chuche idea of  independent development and mutual cooperation of the world  people which is due to be held in Kampala.    The message says:    It is a significant event to hold the international seminar  on the chuche idea to discuss the question of independent  development and mutual cooperation of the world people in a  historical period when independence has become an irresistible  trend of the times.    To dismantle neo-colonialism, the leftover of the old era,  and achieve complete economic liberation of countries and  consolidate their political independence is an urgent  requirement of the present time which is advancing along the  road of independence and a common task of the peoples of the  developing countries.    The chuche idea is the most humanitarian and democratic idea  which opposes all manner of domination and subjugation and  defends human dignity and national sovereignty. It is a genuine  internationalist idea which requires friendship and cooperation  among the peoples be strengthened for the common prosperity of  mankind.    The Korean people could build a socialist country,  independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and  self-reliant in national defence, and strengthen the bonds of  friendship and cooperation with the peoples who champion  independence as they have regarded the chuche idea as the  guiding idea in the building of a new society and applied it in  all domains of social life.    There is no doubt that when the people advance under the  banner of independence and cooperation as required by the chuche  idea a historical change will be brought about in building a  free and prosperous new society, a new world.    Now the people's cause of justice is undergoing trials due  to  the moves of the old forces seeking domination and subjugation,  but no force on earth can arrest the historical trend of the  times toward independence, and the aspirations of the people who  want to live independently would surely be realized.    Firmly believing that the seminar will greatly contribute to  strengthening the independent development and mutual cooperation  of the world people, we sincerely wish the seminar success in  its work.</p>

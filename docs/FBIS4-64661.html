			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuensdorf (DPA) -- Colonel General Matvey Burlakov,  supreme commander of the Russian troops in Germany, has  resolutely rejected a farewell ceremony for Russian soldiers in  Weimar. "Weimar is absolutely unacceptable for us," said  Burlakov in an interview with the German Press Agency at the  Russian military headquarters in Wuensdorf (Brandenburg) on 5  May. The German side suggested a festive ceremony with Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in  Weimar on 31 August, and subsequently, a brief farewell for the  troops in Berlin.    Burlakov voiced the hope that the decision on the place and  type of the ceremony would be changed during Yeltsin's visit to  Bonn beginning on 11 May. "Weimar has nothing to do with our  stay here," said Burlakov, adding that it was the U.S. troops  that had taken Weimar at the end of World War II. The general  again referred to the former concentration camp of Buchenwald  near Weimar, where, among others, 19,000 Soviet citizens were  assassinated.    The chief of the Western Group for his part suggested that  all troops deployed in Germany should be seen off in a common  ceremony, immediately following the meeting of the seven most  important Western industrial states and Russia in Naples early  in July. So far, a separate ceremony -- without the Russians --  has been envisaged for the three Western allies in Berlin on 8  September. "We are liquidating the consequences of World War  II," said Burlakov. "There should be a common farewell ceremony  for all armies from Germany." He added: "I think the  Americans, French, and British would agree." If the German side  did not accept this, the former four occupation powers should  each be seen off separately, said the general.    "The president agrees with me on this problem," stressed  Burlakov. He said that chief of state Yeltsin had submitted the  Russian proposals to Chancellor Kohl in writing. "It was Berlin  where World War II ended, and it should be Berlin from where the  last Russian soldier should go back home," said Burlakov.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (1): Challenge looms from Japan - Hints of recovery in the US and predictions from forecasting groups suggest the executive car industry's problems should soon be over. But there is a subdued, cautious air in western boardrooms. John Griffiths looks to the east for an explanation Stirrings of recovery in North America, the world's single most valuable market for executive and luxury cars, are producing some cautious sighs of relief in the boardrooms of Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Jaguar, BMW and other European companies specialising in the sector. Although total car sales in the US so far this year are responding only sluggishly to President George Bush's efforts to prod life into the economy, the executive sector appears to be pointing the way to sharper growth in the future. Thus Mercedes' US sales in the first five months of the year were up by 18 per cent, BMW's up by nearly a quarter and those of Jaguar - among the companies hardest-hit last year - by more than a tenth. More positively still, in May both Jaguar and Rolls-Royce reported a doubling of sales compared with year-ago levels. For most of the European companies, however, it is a case of one step forward after two steps back: Mercedes' US sales dropped by one quarter last year, for example, while Jaguar's sales fell by one half. Audi, Volkswagen's executive car arm, is enjoying sales up nearly 20 per cent this year - but only after seeing its sales nearly halved in 1991. For a few European companies, there is not even the step forward: five months into 1992, luxury sports car maker Porsche's US sales have sunk further, to fewer than 2,000 units, compared with annual sales of up to 30,000 a year in the late 1980s. On the surface, at least, the predictions now emerging from several of the industry's leading forecasting groups suggest that the executive car industry's problems should all soon be over. According to DRI-McGraw-Hill, for example, the sector will remain the fastest growing one in North America, at least until 1996, as a result of post-war 'baby boomers' moving into middle-aged affluence and their disposable income rising as their children leave home - a phenomenon being replicated, to a lesser extent, in much of Europe. For cars typified by Mercedes' mid-range 300 Series, Volvo's 700 Series and BMW, DRI says it believes there is the potential for 60 per cent sales growth in the US over the next five years or so. The growth forecast is far from confined to North America, however. On DRI's projections, all the leading car producing nations of the world will soon be starting a sharp upturn which by 1996 should see global car sales of a record 40m units, some 21 per cent above last year's level. There are good reasons, however, for the subdued, cautious air in the western industry's boardrooms. If the European companies are starting to enjoy renewed growth in North America, their Japanese rivals are, for the most part, enjoying more. While everyone else lost sales last year, Nissan's Infiniti, Toyota's Lexus executive and luxury car franchises actually added sales, as did Honda's Acura operation. In the first five months of this year, Lexus sales have risen by more than 70 per cent and Infiniti's by nearly 40 per cent. Europe has yet to feel anything like the full force of Japanese competition in the executive and luxury sectors. Japanese manufacturers are taking a 'softly, softly' approach to gaining share in an area of the market which traditionally has provided Europe's indigenous producers with high profit per unit. The European industry knows, however, that in the longer term it faces a challenge within Europe no less severe than that already being experienced in North America. Later this year, Toyota and Honda will join Nissan in producing cars in the UK. The production of all three, however, is targeted at the volume car market, giving the Japanese producers the flexibility to import many more high-value cars from Japan, without seriously running foul of the EC-Japan 'understanding' under which Japan will continue to market cars 'prudently' throughout the transition to an open market. Whereas only a few years ago chief executives of companies such as BMW and Mercedes were prone to put on a bold front about such competition, implying that the Japanese industry would not be able to match the Europeans in areas such as design sophistication and engineering integrity, the mood now is sharply different. Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, chairman of BMW, now accuses the Japanese industry of 'an aggressive policy of conquering markets, creating a scenario of ruinous competition everywhere.' In perhaps the most outspoken attack on the Japanese industry made by a senior German motor industry executive, he attributed the Europeans' problems in the US market 'not to the products as such, but rather to the prices of our cars - particularly when other manufacturers dump their products below cost'. German concern is being heightened both by the immediate sales prospects for Europe and by the fact that costs are becoming an acute worry within Germany. While some big markets such as the UK and Spain are starting the process of recovery, their growth is likely to be almost entirely offset by the fizzling out of demand in Germany as the boom generated by unification goes into reverse. Germany accounts for 30 per cent of all European sales. The prospect is of fierce competition for executive car sales in Europe. At the same time, the fast growth - albeit from a very small base - that European executive car exporters to Japan had been experiencing has largely gone into reverse. The bursting of the Japanese 'bubble' economy last year took new car sales down by 4 per cent. Part of the problem is that, for example, Mercedes' smallest car, the 190E, sells for roughly the same price as a fully-equipped Lexus in Japan. Cutting costs is perhaps the single biggest problem facing the European industry, and Germany's in particular. Current estimates are that the Japanese industry has a cost advantage of about one third over its German counterpart. Another form of competition is also emerging. General Motors, the world's biggest car maker, has been undergoing a massive restructuring of plants and products in an attempt to defend its still-shrinking market share. Its Cadillac division is now eyeing Europe for a renewed sales push. Chrysler has just started production of its up-market 'minivans', also pitched at the executive sector as an alternative to conventional cars, in Austria. Competition from North America may become an established feature of the European scene by the late 1990s. Adding to the industry's concerns within Europe is the continuing controversy over differential prices charged by manufacturers within the EC, fuelled initially by consumer group claims that prices in the UK were far higher than some other markets in Europe. The UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the EC competition Commission have both produced reports on the subject. The MMC found no evidence of systematic profiteering but the EC report found differences, in extreme cases, of up to 40 per cent. Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, has warned that the industry must 'put its house in order'. Overall, the likely effect is to be, if not actual price cuts, a slowing down of the rate of price increases, putting yet more pressure on costs and profitability. Needless to say, this is a prospect not at all likely to bother both business and private users of executive and luxury cars. The current buyers' market is likely to remain for a very long time to come.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luckenson Jean -- recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] At the initiative of the  unofficial office of the Senate of the Republic, presided over  by Senator Bernard Sansaricq and that large group of senators  elected on 18 January who are contested, a meeting took place at  the Senate at approximately 1100 on Saturday, 23 April between a  delegation of Republican congressmen from the Black Caucus and  several Haitian opposition political parties and groups. The  delegation of Black Caucus Republican congressmen was headed by  Dr. (Thomas Ferguson), its chairman. [name and title as heard]  (Ferguson) was accompanied by his wife (Siegrid Furguson) and by  (Lerone Toltson), executive chief, assisted by Mr. (Herb  Barsman).    The chairman of the Republican Black Caucus, Dr. (Furguson),  stated he came to Haiti so as to inform the [U.S.] Congress all  about what the delegation sees during its stay in Haiti. The  delegation did not come to interfere in the nation's political  affairs because Haitians have enough experience and education to  solve their problems by themselves. [passage omitted]    Dr. (Furguson) went on to say that Haitians are determined  people, and they can manage to establish democracy in Haiti. If  foreigners do not want this, those who do not agree should leave  Haiti and go home. Dr. (Furguson) said he talked with the Army  commander in chief for two hours. He talked to them [not further  identified] so they can help the Haitian people establish law  and democracy. (Ferguson) forcefully condemned those who are  asking that the embargo against Haiti be strengthened. [passage  omitted]    After Dr. (Ferguson's) speech, more than 12 political  leaders  or heads of people's organizations presented their grievances to  the black Caucus senator [position as heard], hoping he would  pass their messages on to President Bill Clinton.    The secretary general of the Revolutionary Front for the  Promotion and Progress of Haiti, which is the neo-Duvalierist  party headed by Toto Constant, presented a somber report on  Haiti for the period from 29 November [1987] to the present.  Secretary General Constant seized the opportunity to ask the  people of the United States, as a people, that is, in his  opinion a moral people, to help the young Haitians who are the  future of Haiti so they can rebuild the country and set it on  the democratic track. [passage omitted]    For his part Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the Mobilization  for National Development, one of the biggest opponents to  President Aristide's return to power in Haiti, said, in a speech  approximately 15 minutes long, Dr. (Ferguson's) presence in  Haiti constitutes a guarantee for the progress of the democratic  struggle. De Ronceray considers (Furguson) the ambassador for  the Haitian cause. [passage omitted]    Unionist Jean-Auguste Mesyeux; Dr. Sylvan Jolibois, leader  of  the Patriotic Urban and Rural Union; and Richard Vladimir  Jeanty, leader of the Haitian Party of God joined the president  of the Senate of the Republic and Hubert de Ronceray in  forcefully condemning the embargo.    In conclusion, Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of the  unofficial [Senate] office, who spoke like a prophet, asked Dr.  (Furguson) to ask President Clinton to change his policy toward  Haiti and to ask Ellen Cosgrove, a political officer of the U.S.  Embassy in Haiti; Stanley Schrager, U.S. spokesman in Haiti; and  Ambassador William Lacy Swing to stop interfering in Haitian  political affairs because they, in the Senate of the Republic,  are working very hard to find a solution to the Haitian crisis.</p>

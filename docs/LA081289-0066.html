			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Participants in the fraud and tax-evasion trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter began a  three-week vacation Friday.  </P> <P> The U.S. District Court case, in which Hunter is accused of 234 counts related  to the giant J. David &amp; Co. Ponzi scheme, began April 18 after a three-week  jury-selection process.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have so far presented more than 100 witnesses. Two jurors and two  alternate jurors have been released because of family illnesses, work  conflicts, and, in one case, for knowing a witness.  </P> <P> When the trial resumes Sept. 6, federal prosecutors are expected to spend two  weeks before resting their case. Hunter's attorneys recently said they expect  to take about three weeks presenting their theory that Hunter was blinded by  love for convicted swindler J. David (Jerry) Dominelli and was unaware of any  fraud.  </P></p>

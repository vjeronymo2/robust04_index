			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Cash flow boosted for employers - Staged deductions under PAYE and NIC It is planned to raise by Pounds 150 a month the level below which deductions under Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) can be paid to the Inland Revenue quarterly rather than monthly. For deductions made in periods beginning after April 5 1995 employers will be able to pay quarterly if their average monthly payments are less than Pounds 600. The present limit is Pounds 450 a month. The chancellor's intention is to give an additional 100,000 employers the opportunity to benefit from improved cash flow and reduced administrative costs. This will bring the number of employers who could benefit to 750,000  -more than 60 per cent of employers. The change will also apply to payments by contractors in the construction industry. At present, employers whose average monthly payments to the Inland Revenue of PAYE and NIC are less than Pounds 450 in total can choose to pay quarterly rather than monthly. This limit will be increased to Pounds 600 for deductions made in periods beginning after April 5 1995.</p>

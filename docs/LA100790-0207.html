			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY ATTY. MYERS IS 'COMPETENT, DECENT'  </P> <P> I commend Julio Moran on his article "Political Brawl Over Homeless," Sept. 27.  </P> <P> He did an excellent job of describing the situation in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> As a 14-year resident, I would like to add my own observation about City Atty.  Robert Myers. He is a very competent attorney and a person who behaves in a  strikingly decent manner which transcends politics. He has always put his  reputation where his beliefs are. One cannot help but admire such an  individual. There are few in public office.  </P> <P> NAN LEWIS  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

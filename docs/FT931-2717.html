			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / New York banks find new enthusiasm for Latin America THE rediscovered enthusiasm of New York banks for Latin America is not yet shared by most other banks that suffered at their side during the 1980s debt crisis. Non-US banks, in particular the Germans and Japanese, for tax reasons were slower to sell off bad loans and will be slower to return, if they ever do. In 1992, German bank and US commercial bank exposure to Latin America was roughly equal at about Dollars 37bn: seven years earlier, US commercial bank exposure at more than Dollars 80bn was five times that of the German banks. Others, such as the UK clearing banks have, by and large, become more domestic in focus during the 1980s.</p>

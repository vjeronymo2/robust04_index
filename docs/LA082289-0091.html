			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT BARS WOMEN'S GROUP FROM PRAYING AT WESTERN WALL  </P> <P> Israel's Supreme Court barred a Jewish women's group Monday from chanting  prayers or reading the Bible aloud at Jerusalem's Western Wall, Judaism's  holiest site.  </P> <P> Ultra-Orthodox men and women have complained about the Women of the Wall group,  which prays once a month at the Western Wall, a remnant of the Second Temple  that is also known as the Wailing Wall.  </P> <P> They say that, under Jewish law, women worshipers should not be heard in the  presence of men. Female police officers dragged a dozen praying women from the  wall earlier this month.  </P> <P> The court order remains in effect until a final hearing in December on the  right of women to hold collective prayers at the wall.  </P> <P> The hearing will consider also whether the women may don prayer shawls worn by  men or read from the biblical Torah scroll.  </P></p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Observer: Royal treatment But now for a bank that has at least got something right. For, in this age of high-powered manipulative image-making, it's a rare treat indeed to discover a low-key corporate PR tool which has served its purpose for 75 years, and is still going strong. The Royal Bank Letter, published six times a year by Royal Bank of Canada, is more akin to Reader's Digest - without the ads - than a corporate brochure. It carries the bank's logo but otherwise eschews suggestions of anything so vulgar as a sales pitch. Instead, the four-page essays - sent free to readers - deal with such homely and safe subjects as science in our lives; middle age; strength of character; and 'the civilised workplace'. Royal Bank tried to save money in the early 1980s by culling the subscriber list - to no avail. Circulation has soared from 100,000 to 270,000 in the past decade. Most newspapers can only look on in wonderment.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PERES PUSHES CONVENT REMOVAL  </P> <P> Israeli Vice Prime Minister Shimon Peres, on a pilgrimage to Auschwitz, urged  Polish authorities today to remove a Roman Catholic convent from the former  Nazi death camp as soon as possible.  </P> <P> "I hope this stain will be taken away soon. I discussed the issue with the  Polish government and they promised to deal with it," Polish-born Peres said as  he stood by the death camp's outer wall, to which the Carmelite convent is  joined.  </P> <P> The convent was established in 1984 to allow nuns to pray for the 4 million  people, most of them Jews, killed at Auschwitz by the Nazis during World War  II.  </P> <P> An international dispute started when Jewish leaders demanded the convent's  removal. Poland's Roman Catholic church eventually agreed to move the nuns but  has not said when it will do so.  </P></p>

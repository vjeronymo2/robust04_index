			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (13): Distinguished ancestry - Profile: Senator Eduardo Frei Senator Eduardo Frei, leader of Chile's Christian Democrats and front-runner in the race for the presidency, is not exactly known for his fiery oratory or barnstorming campaign style. But at least, according to one political analyst, 'he has learnt how to smile.' A sombre, rather taciturn businessman, Mr Frei is consistently the country's most popular politician in the opinion polls behind President Patricio Aylwin. His position as leader of the biggest party in the ruling coalition has given him a seemingly unbeatable hand against the divided opposition. Despite a distinguished political ancestry - Eduardo Frei Senior was president from 1964-70 - Mr Frei only ran for office for the first time in 1990, when he won his senate seat. However, he joined the Christian Democrats in 1958 at the age of 16 and says he was always active in the party. Mr Frei denies charges that he trades on the reputation of his late father - a popular and charismatic politician, and a founder figure of the Christian Democrats. 'It's foolish to deny that people remember my father. But not all sons of presidents follow in their fathers' footsteps. Ultimately people will judge me by what I do, not by my name.' His father, he adds, gave him 'a vision of this country and of public service.' A key element of Mr Frei's political credo is a determination to preserve the ruling Concertacion coalition 'for as long as it is efficient and rational to do so.' The Aylwin government, which effected the transition from military to civilian rule, 'achieved high economic growth, political stability and increased social spending. For me, that proves the value of working together,' he says. If elected president this December, Mr Frei promises to 'continue and deepen' the reforms of the Aylwin administration. But he highlights poverty, weaknesses in the education system and bottlenecks in infrastructure as obstacles to continued growth. Mr Frei is unequivocal about the need for constitutional reform to remove the checks on the elected government handed down from the Pinochet era. 'This is a matter of principle for us. I don't know of any other democratic country where the head of state or civil authorities don't have control over the chiefs of the armed forces.' The Senator may be well placed to succeed where the Aylwin government faltered - a constitutional reform package failed to win the required two-thirds majority in Congress this March. 'Frei has a strong sense of how power works in this country,' says Mr Oscar Godoy, head of political science at the Roman Catholic University of Chile. 'He is no great orator - he knows that - but he is a good team player, chooses his people well and he likes taking decisions.' Mr Frei rarely departs from the language of gradualism and consensus. Even the attempt by the Socialist party and its ally the PPD to offer their own candidate, Mr Ricardo Lagos, for the coalition's presidential nomination is 'absolutely normal and unsurprising in a presidential system,' he says, smiling.</p>

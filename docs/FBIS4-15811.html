			<p>BFN     [Text] Crimea -- Viktor Alsufyev, head of the Crimean  Central Electoral Commission, held a news conference at 0900 on  11 April which was devoted to the results of the second round of  elections to the Supreme Council of Crimea and the Supreme  Council of Ukraine. Forty-nine people's deputies of Crimea were  elected in 49 electoral districts. Thus, the elections in  Crimea are valid. Out of 98 seats in the parliament, 94 have  already been occupied and the Supreme Council of Crimea has a  real possibility to begin its work. In the words of Viktor  Alsufyev, the Russia bloc won 64 mandates (57.4 percent of those  elected); the Communist Party of Crimea will have two deputies;  the Party for the Economic Revival of Crimea will have one; the  Kurultay of the Crimean Tatars, 14; the Russia Party, one; and  the Union of Officers of Crimea, one (who is Vice Admiral  Oleksandr Frolov, deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet). As  Viktor Alsufyev said, seven deputies were elected from the old  Crimean parliament.    According to the current Constitution of the Republic of  Crimea, the first session of the Supreme Council of Crimea will  be held on 10 May, that is, 30 days after the end of the second  round of elections.

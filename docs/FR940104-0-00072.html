			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In short, the procedures used by a school that uses alternative origination differ in two ways from the procedures of originating schools. The first is that a school under alternative origination may choose to designate the alternative originator as the manager of promissory note/disclosure statements. The second is that a school under alternative origination does not manage the funds draw down process; instead, the school receives funds drawn down by the alternative originator only for those completed promissory notes in the possession of the alternative originator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary anticipates that issues related to participation of alternative originators in future years will be subject to the negotiated rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Federal Direct PLUS Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Direct PLUS loans are made through a process similar to the one used in the Federal PLUS loan program. The parent obtains a combined application/promissory note from the school and, after completing the combined application/promissory note, sends it to the school. The school completes the school section of the application/promissory note and forwards it to the Direct Loan Program Servicer where data from the note is key entered and a credit check is performed. Alternatively, a school enters data from the note using the software provided by the Direct Loan Program Servicer and electronically forwards this information to the Direct Loan Program Servicer. In either case, the Direct Loan Program Servicer performs a credit check to determine, as required by section 428B(a) of the HEA, whether the parent has an adverse credit history and notifies the school and the parent of the results. If the loan is approved, the Direct Loan Program Servicer sends a disclosure statement to the parent. If the credit check indicates an adverse credit history, the Secretary advises the parent of available options; for example, the parent could obtain an endorser without an adverse credit history. If the loan is approved and the school originates loans, the school may draw down money and disburse loan funds in the same manner as it would for other loans made under the Direct Loan Program. If the school does not originate loans, the alternative originator electronically transmits the funding request for the school based on the application/promissory notes that the Direct Loan Program Servicer holds for that school.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Loan Servicing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is responsible for servicing and collecting Direct Loans. As noted above, a notice specifically concerned with repayment and collection will be published shortly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A school's interaction with the Direct Loan Program Servicer during the servicing and collection of the loan is similar to the interaction schools currently have with lenders and guaranty agencies in the FFEL Program. Schools must respond to periodic student status confirmation requests as well as to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad hoc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requests for information regarding borrowers from the Direct Loan Program Servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Borrowers who default on Direct Loans are added to ED's debt collection system and are subject to all legally authorized default-collection activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Impact of Other Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of the provisions of the FFEL Program that are applicable to the Direct Loan Program have been incorporated into this notice of standards, criteria, and procedures. The Secretary adopted those provisions because schools are familiar with them from their participation in the FFEL Program. Certain policies and procedures currently being developed through negotiated rulemaking for FFEL Program regulations will be adopted in the Direct Loan Program, including policies relating to borrower forgiveness for students who attended schools that have closed or whose eligibility was falsely certified and policies controlling the deferment for economic hardship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII.

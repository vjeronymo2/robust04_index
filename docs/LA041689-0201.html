			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDING THE PENTAGON  </P> <P> Regarding your review of "The Pentagonists" and "The Whistle Blowers" (Book  Review, March 19):  </P> <P> It seems to me that choosing a member of the military establishment (Col. Harry  G. Summers Jr.) to review books about Pentagon corruption is a little like  having Al Capone review an expose of the Mafia, and the results were just about  as predictable. I'll give him this -- Summers is a pretty good hatchet man. He  used all the tricks: avoid the real issues, bring in a lot of irrelevant  nonsense like the Trilateralists, and divert attention from the message by  attacking and ridiculing the messenger. The problem is, he forgot to review the  book.  </P></p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Colefax and Fowler declines to Pounds 704,000 Difficult trading conditions prompted a further decline at Colefax and Fowler Group, the wallpaper, fabric and furnishing company. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-April were Pounds 704,000, against Pounds 1.18m last time and Pounds 4.01m the year before. Mr David Green, chief executive, said that overall trade sales in the UK fell by 11.5 per cent reflecting a fall off in contract orders. Retail sales were also badly affected, he said, and the group was examining ways of reducing costs. In contrast, continental sales showed a near-8 per cent expansion, with a particularly good performance by Jane Churchill products which jumped by 44 per cent. Mr Green reiterated that future growth, scheduled to be achieved through expansion of product and services, was dependent 'on the rate of return of consumer confidence.' Turnover dipped to Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 30.2m). Earnings per share, helped by a Pounds 221,000 tax credit, emerged at 3.7p (4.7p). A same-again final dividend of 1.3p maintains the total at 2.6p.</p>

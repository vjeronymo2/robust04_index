			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Business Link for London  -The start of an umbrella advice organisation Greater London's 200,000 businesses are about to get their own Business Link organisation after more than a year of acrimonious turf battles between the agencies supposedly supporting them. To be precise, the capital is likely to be getting 10 Business Links. On November 23, a national assessment panel will review the first bid, for Business Link London, which will act like its counterparts in England and Wales as a one-stop shop providing advice and support services. Business Link London will act as an umbrella over nine local Business Links throughout the capital. The case for a unified Business Link system bringing together the myriad support agencies in the capital was forcefully articulated last week by Earl Ferrers, the new minister for small businesses. 'In London there are 33 chambers of commerce, 26 local enterprise agencies, nine training and enterprise councils, 32 local authorities and all the DTI support services,' Lord Ferrers told the London Chamber. 'All of that can be pretty daunting to a humble minister and one wonders if it is not pretty daunting to the customers too.' These 'customers' have not been uppermost in the minds of all support networks as they shaped Business Link London. The partnership has been fashioned against the wishes of a number of chambers of commerce, fearful they might lose members and their raison d'etre. And some Tecs are only on board after the DTI wielded a stick and refused to let them provide their support services independent of a Business Link organisation. One of the philosophical debates concerned whether London's Business Links should be helping regenerate economically depressed areas, as some local authorities wanted. Brian Wright, chief executive of the London Enterprise Agency, says the opposite view has prevailed - that Business Links should be concerned with supporting businesses with growth potential. Irrespective of which organisations wither and which adapt, London's businesses should have a clearer idea where to turn for advice by next July when Business Link London hopes to open its doors. As the proposals currently stand, the London-wide organisation will have responsibility for those support areas where local duplication would not be cost effective. So, the Business Link London will look after information services and the new information technology network which will require extensive investment. Specialised services, such as export support, will also be organised centrally. At the local level, the Business Links will look after the personal business advisers who visit companies, assess their needs and refer the businesses to a specialist. These local operations will also develop local specialities - a knowledge of the rag trade in the east of London, for instance. David Grayson, chairman of the national assessment panel for Business Links, believes London's businesses will finally receive the kind of customer-focused service they require if they are to be internationally competitive. One area that might suffer in Business Link's new world are start-up companies and other micro-businesses; while there will be exceptions, the Business Links network is targeting businesses with 10-200 employees. Wright agrees this is potentially a problem. But he believes these companies can be served by Local Enterprise Agencies. This may be possible for organisations such as the London Enterprise Agency, which are partly funded by private-sector sponsors and have freedom to decide which start-ups to support. But many Enterprise Agencies are dependent on funding from the government's Enterprise Initiative programme and as a result mainly support businesses started by the unemployed. From next year, the budget for this initiative will disappear into the government's new single regeneration budget for inner cities. Enterprise Agencies recognise their start-up support programmes may receive meagre rations from this pot.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Wanted: easy test for venereal disease One million dollars (Pounds 650,000), one of the largest medical prizes, is to be given by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York for the development of a low-cost and easy-to-use diagnostic test for two sexually transmitted diseases, gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Applicants must develop a test for use in the developing countries, where there is neither refrigeration nor electricity. The operators of the scheme believe the test will also be widely used for screening in the developed world. Rockefeller Foundation: US, 212 869 8500.</p>

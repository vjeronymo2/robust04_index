			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: High costs force CIS farmers out of business AGRICULTURAL REFORMS are faltering in Russia and elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent States as higher prices and mounting shortages put the new private farming sector under pressure, reports Reuter from Moscow. Russian officials at a Moscow grains conference said farmers breaking away from the state sector faced daunting problems. 'Many farms cannot compete in the current economic situation, with mounting inflation and many barriers to development,' said Mr Leonid Vashukov, head of the food and agriculture section of the CIS Statistics Committee. He reported that more than 3,000 new private farms had folded. Russia announced plans last year to dismantle unprofitable collective farms and give farmers rights to buy and sell land. Other former Soviet republics launched similar programmes, aiming to curb the role of big state agrobusinesses blamed for decades of food shortages and crippling import bills. Mr Vashukov said sharply higher prices for equipment and fertilisers had made life tough for the new private sector. Prices for some equipment were currently 20 times higher than at the start of the year. Delegates from other republics attending the grains conference, organised by US grain exporters and Russia's Exportkhleb, stressed the need to become self-sufficient in grain production. But for the moment many countries would need to import grain, either on world markets, or from Kazakhstan, which this year reported a record harvest of 32m tonnes, Exportkhleb official Ms Svetlana Melshina told the conference. She put the 1992-93 CIS harvest at 182.4m tonnes, up 20 per cent from last year but a little below the 185m tonnes estimated by Mr Vashukov.</p>

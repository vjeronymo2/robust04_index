			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-'Urayqi: "YSP Boycotts Presidential </F> Council Meeting in Sanaa; Cabinet Forms Number of Committees to  Implement Covenant and Accord Document; Yemeni Tribe Kidnaps  Three Dutch Engineers"]    [Text] Sanaa--News Agencies--The YSP [Yemeni Socialist  Party] boycotted the Presidential Council meeting that was held  in Sanaa yesterday. Salim Salih, Presidential Council member and  YSP assistant secretary general, was scheduled to participate in  the meeting. But political sources have said that Salim Salih  has not gone to Sanaa. At a meeting in Aden two days ago, the  Yemeni Council of Ministers decided to form a number of  committees to implement provisions of the Document of Pledge and  Accord. The council also decided to present a plan to arrest  escaped suspects and prisoners. The work of these activities is  connected with eliminating armed manifestations from the cities  and returning military units to their positions. The work also  includes drafting laws and regulations to codify relations and  to define the powers and duties of the Presidential Council and  of its president, vice president, and members in accordance with  the Constitution. It further includes reviewing the Council of  Ministers law and the Presidential Council bylaws. At an  ordinary session held two days ago, the House of Representatives  adopted a resolution mandating implementation of the Document of  Pledge and Accord.    On the other hand, Yemeni tribesmen kidnaped three Dutch  engineers last Friday and demanded rent in return for the  utilization of their lands by oil companies operating in Yemen.  Official sources have said that the "Jaham" tribe has detained  the three Dutchmen in the Khawlan area, located 100 km east of  Sanaa, the capital. The same tribe last year kidnapped a U.S.  diplomat and then released him unharmed. The Netherlands Foreign  Ministry has said that its embassy in Sanaa is working with the  Yemeni authorities to secure the release of the three engineers.</p>

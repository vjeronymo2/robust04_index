			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN THE EXAM FAILS STUDENTS;  </P> <P> FAIRER, BETTER SAT TESTS WOULD BE A BOON FOR HIGHER EDUCATION  </P> <P> The Scholastic Aptitude Test, a requirement for the college-bound, may soon get  a much needed overhaul. College Board trustees are expected to vote next month  on proposed revisions of the standardized test, which measures general math and  verbal skills. The revamping, the biggest in 50 years, is long overdue.  </P> <P> The changes probably won't make the rigorous exam any less difficult, but the  revisions are bound to include more relevant information and address complaints  that the test is biased against women and minorities.  </P> <P> Nearly 2 million high school juniors and seniors annually take the SAT in  search of a high score -- 1,600 is perfect -- that will open the door to  college. The College Board, which administers the test, claims that it is an  indicator of future academic success. Critics complain the exam is biased in  content and form. On that point, a federal judge ruled last year that New York  state discriminated against women when it used SAT scores to award  scholarships.  </P> <P> Girls tend to score lower than boys on the SAT, although young women tend to  get better grades in high school and college. Educators who believe the test  under-predicts female achievement specifically criticize the multiple-choice  format and the content of some questions.  </P> <P> Multiple-choice tests hint at answers, encourage guessing and reward quick  decisions. They also lend themselves to expensive test-coaching courses that  emphasize speed and test-taking tricks. The new SAT would include some math  questions without multiple-choice answers. That skills-oriented approach might  more accurately measure math ability. The exam would test vocabulary by having  students read passages of writing. That could also provide a better measure of  critical thinking and classroom abilities.  </P> <P> The new test may also feature an essay question as a measure of writing  proficiency. College administrators applaud that proposal, but some Asian and  Latino educators believe the requirement would penalize students for whom  English is a second language. To ward off further complaints about ethnic bias,  the Educational Testing Service will need to proceed carefully.  </P> <P> The College Board denies any bias, but the examiners cannot deny the gap in  scores between white males, and black and Latino students. The revision process  will provide an opportunity to address that concern.  </P> <P> Excelling on the SAT can make a profound difference in a young person's future.  Every student deserves a fair shot at success.  </P></p>

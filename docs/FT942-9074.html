			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Lloyd's reports loss of Pounds 2.05bn: Increase in reserves to meet US liability claims was 'single largest factor' in result Lloyd's, the London insurance market, yesterday reported a loss of Pounds 2.05bn for its 1991 year of account, bringing cumulative losses since 1988 to more than Pounds 7bn. An increase in reserves to meet US liability claims, mainly from asbestos, pollution and other health hazards, was the single largest factor in the result, according to Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman. Mr Rowland said the loss would put further strain on Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market, but dismissed fears that it would affect its ability to continue trading. 'Lloyd's has had terrible losses but we will trade forward as certainly tomorrow as we have for the last 300 years,' he said. The market, which reports its results three years in arrears, softened the impact on Names by taking into account some Pounds 533m of so-called 'double counting' for the first time. This occurs when Names who have made losses make claims of their own against: 'stop-loss' policies (which provide cover for losses over pre-set limits), 'errors and omissions' policies (which give cover if agents are successfully sued for negligence), or 'estate protection policies' (which cover the losses of deceased Names). The elimination of double-counting also allowed Lloyd's to reduce its 1990 loss, reported last June, by Pounds 596m to Pounds 2.32bn. Lloyd's will allow Names to borrow against profits, which the market expects to make this year. Sharp rises in insurance rates over the last two years are allowing most syndicates to underwrite profitably, with profits also expected for the 1993 year. Managing agents, who administer syndicates, are being encouraged to defer cash calls when they have no immediate need for funds. Even so, Mr Rowland conceded that the market would call cash 'of the order of Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 1.7bn' this year. There are fears that many Names, especially those who are taking legal action to recover their losses, may be neither willing nor able to pay. 'The sums needed are usually only obtained with a mask, a gun and a getaway car,' said Mr Tom Benyon, director of the Society of Names, which represents loss-makers. 'The 'cannot and will not' losses will have to be picked up by other Names with the deepest pockets,' he added. Hope mingles with fears at troubled Lloyds, Page 8 Lex, Page 22</p>

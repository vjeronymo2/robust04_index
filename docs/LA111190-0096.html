			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY WANTS TOUGHER LAPD OVERSEERS;  </P> <P> POLICE: THE MAYOR IS CREATING AN ACTIVE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS THAT WILL PROBE  DEPARTMENT MISCONDUCT AND STAND UP TO CHIEF GATES.  </P> <P> In a series of abrupt moves over the last month, Mayor Tom Bradley has begun  reshaping the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners into an activist body  that will challenge the way the Police Department is run, according to his  aides and several City Council members.  </P> <P> Bradley and a growing number of council members say they want a commission that  will tackle tough policy matters, aggressively investigate police misconduct  and evaluate the performance of Chief Daryl F. Gates.  </P> <P> "The mayor wants an active, progressive Police Commission," said Deputy Mayor  Mark Fabiani, "and he's determined to appoint commissioners who will take  seriously the responsibility of directing the department."  </P> <P> An activist commission would be a marked departure from the style of the  current five-member panel that oversees the 8,400-member Police Department.  </P> <P> In a session typical of its weekly meetings, the commission on Tuesday met for  20 minutes, taking up routine matters like granting parade permits and  canceling security alarm licenses -- all at a time when controversies are  swirling around Gates and his department.  </P> <P> While commissioners were silent, Bradley was moving quickly. He demanded an  investigation of possible police impropriety in the so-called "39th and Dalton"  drug raid, ordered a management audit of the Police Department and, in an  unusual public exchange of insults, he criticized Gates for having made "dumb"  remarks.  </P> <P> In rapid succession, the mayor replaced one commissioner with a longtime  political ally, attorney-lobbyist Dan Garcia, and then announced that  Commission President Robert M. Talcott would be resigning Dec. 1.  </P> <P> Bradley periodically shakes up the city's numerous commissions, sometimes  because they drift too close to the officials they are supposed to monitor,  sources said.  </P> <P> Two months ago, shortly after Gates was sharply criticized for suggesting that  casual drug users should be shot, the Police Commission, rather than  questioning him in public about his remark, gave him a round of applause to  mark the anniversary of his 41 years of service.  </P> <P> If the commission begins to assert greater authority, sources said, the 1990s  could be a time of turmoil for a city agency long accustomed to enacting its  own agenda with little interference.  </P> <P> For Gates, the changes could be a watershed. A range of critics within and  outside the department have said that after 12 years as chief, Gates sometimes  appears uninterested in the details of his job. Sources said privately that the  commission will expect Gates to become more deeply involved in managing the  department or step aside.  </P> <P> Gates, however, recently expressed confidence in his job at a press conference  at Parker Center, and stressed that he was not going to leave the department  until he was ready to go.  </P> <P> "This is a well-run department," the chief said. "I manage well. I may not do a  lot of things. I may have a big mouth. But I know how to manage a police  department. I know how to manage an organization like this."  </P> <P> He also denied allegations that he had "co-opted" the current police  commissioners into supporting his policies. "What's wrong with the fact that  we're getting along?" he asked. "What's wrong with the fact that the Board of  Police Commissioners and I are seeing eye-to-eye?"  </P> <P> In the 1970s, the commission forced several changes in the Police Department,  such as a crackdown on police intelligence-gathering activities and a revision  of the department's shooting policy.  </P> <P> However, in the last decade, the panel has been reluctant to buck the  department on a number of controversial issues.  </P> <P> In 1983, after months of negotiations sought by the homosexual community, the  commission recommended changes in department policy to encourage active  recruitment of homosexuals, including advertisements in gay and lesbian  publications. However, Gates objected and the policy was never enforced.  </P> <P> This fall, the commission balked at conducting an inquiry into the propriety of  Gates' public pronouncement that casual drug users "ought to be taken out and  shot." Bending to pressure from the City Council, the commission changed course  and promised an inquiry.  </P> <P> And, the commission took a back seat to the department in ongoing  investigations stemming from a drug raid two years ago during which police  officers trashed a number of apartments near 39th Street and Dalton Avenue.  </P> <P> Outgoing president Talcott said in a recent deposition that he had only a  "general idea" of the scope of the 39th and Dalton investigations. His lack of  knowledge surprised some critics, who noted that scores of officers have been  disciplined, four face criminal charges and a civil lawsuit against the city  and the Police Department goes to trial in U.S. District Court next month.  </P> <P> If such a police scandal were to surface in the future, the commission would be  expected to investigate what conditions or management failures in the  department might have encouraged such police activity, said one source familiar  with the mayor's hopes for the revamped commission.  </P> <P> Talcott, an attorney who has headed the panel for five years, said in his  deposition that some of his "important" duties as a police commissioner were  attending Police Academy graduations and funerals of police officers.  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times earlier this week, he said his commission work  was a part-time job that paid only $50 for each weekly meeting he attended. He  said it is difficult for commissioners to follow every aspect of the daily  operations of the Police Department.  </P> <P> "We are citizen-soldiers, so to speak," he said. "We are there to assist as  public-minded individuals in the operation of city government. It may not be  the most effective way, but it's better than most cities that have no interplay  or interaction between the public and the bureaucracies."  </P> <P> Stephen Yagman, a lawyer and longtime police critic who is suing the city and  the Police Department in the 39th and Dalton drug raid, said he was amazed at  how little the commissioners seemed to know about the highly controversial  case.  </P> <P> "This Board of Police Commissioners is essentially window dressing," he said.  "They sit on their hands and do nothing over there. They are the equal of Nero  who fiddled while Rome burned."  </P> <P> Even City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who as chairman of the council's Public  Safety Committee has been an advocate for the department, agrees that the  commission needs to change. "I think it's clear that the mayor is interested in  . . . appointing people who are going to be more aggressive in oversight," he  said.  </P> <P> Some critics say the commission knows only what department management wants it  to know, and acts accordingly.  </P> <P> George Aliano, president of the Police Protective League, said the commission  under Talcott ignored the needs of rank-and-file officers. He said the  commission was particularly bad at ruling against officers who filed grievances  against their supervisors.  </P> <P> "It's almost like we didn't exist," he said. "There was no response from him.  Rarely -- I can't even remember a single time -- when a grievance was ever  approved at the police commission level.  </P> <P> "He never tried to resolve confrontations," Aliano added about Talcott. "He  turned a deaf ear on everything."  </P> <P> Looking ahead, the union president said the new commission members should be  more open-minded to the problems of officers.  </P> <P> "We need somebody who makes decisions and gives us an answer as to why they  make a decision," he said.  </P></p>

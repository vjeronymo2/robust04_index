			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, today  briefed the Kashmiri leaders about the two-day foreign secretary  level talks [with India] which ended in Islamabad. He gave them  the background of the talks and said Pakistan reiterated its  principled stand that the Kashmir problem must be resolved on  the basis of UN resolutions which provide for holding plebiscite  for the realization of the right of self-determination to the  people of Jammu and Kashmir. The foreign minister regretted  that the Indian side did not show any flexibility on any aspect  of the issue. He, however, informed that New Delhi has  formulated specific proposals on various issues, including  security of the Line of Control, Siachen, Wullar Barrage, Sir  Creek and nuclear nonproliferation. The foreign minister told  the Kashmiri leaders that Pakistan informed the Indian side that  our response to their specific proposals would be conveyed after  these proposals have been received and examined on their merit  and in the light of ground realities in Jammu and Kashmir. The  president and prime minister of AJK [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] and  leaders of various political parties of Kashmir were present in  the briefing.    Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali also spoke to PTV correspondent  Habibullah Farooqi on the outcome of the Pakistan-India Talks:    [Begin recording] [Farooqi] The secretary-level talks  between  India and Pakistan has produced no result. The Indian foreign  secretary has termed the UN resolutions on Kashmir as  irrelevant. What are your comments?    [Ali] My comments are that principles do not become  irrelevant. It is the principle of the UN Resolution 242 which  is timeless, universal and will always remain dynamic. If the  UN resolutions according to the Indian foreign secretary are  irrelevant, then the Simla Agreement is also irrelevant. That is  our position.    One significant thing that happened in the talks was that  out  of four sessions of the talks -- the seventh round of talks, two  and half sessions were used just for discussion on the Kashmir  problem -- Indian-held Kashmir dispute. This is a significant  improvement in the sense that at least the Indians are now  admitting that it is a very serious problem. Regarding our  position, we have said so very clearly that there cannot be any  compromise on our position. We will continue to support the  Kashmiri people diplomatically, politically, and we will keep  the option of using international forums as and when we think it  is necessary for the support of the Kashmiri people. But our  main thrust and emphasis is that they must improve the ground  situation in Kashmir. They must not indulge in human rights  violations. They must lift the siege of the Hazratbal shrine  and they must release the leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat  Conference. Only if we see some improvement in the ground  [situation] in Kashmir, then and then only we will agree to the  future agenda of the talks. [end recording]</p>

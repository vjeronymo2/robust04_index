			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's leading writers have formed a chapter of the international  writers organization PEN and, in their first action, appealed for revocation of  calls for death for Salman Rushdie, author of the novel "The Satanic Verses."  The writers declared that they condemned both insults to religious and ethnic  feelings as well as demands for retribution, the weekly Literary Gazette said.  Iran's leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has called for the death of  Rushdie for what he considers insults to Islam in the novel.  </P></p>

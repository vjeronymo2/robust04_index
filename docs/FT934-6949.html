			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / New offer may end compensation row Germany's coalition partners will today decide whether to accept fresh proposals for compensating former property owners in east Germany. If accepted, it could pave the way to ending a two-year-old dispute which has hindered investment in the region. The proposals, drawn up by a working group led by Mr Friedrich Bohl, head of the Chancellery office, would increase the amount of money paid to former owners, as well as abandon a controversial tax penalty which would have been imposed on those receiving compensation. The compromise package will leave the finance ministry with a deficit of DM10bn (Pounds 3.9bn). But it could speed up investment in eastern Germany which has been plagued by outstanding property disputes. Fewer than a quarter of eastern Germany's 1.2m claims on 2.6m titles have been resolved. Those who had property confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, and by the communists between 1949 and 1990 are entitled to full restitution or compensation. Owners of property expropriated by the occupying Soviet forces between 1945 and 1949 cannot get their land back. But under the latest draft proposals, they will receive the same levels of compensation. The Compensation Fund, set up to pay former owners, will be increased by DM4.5bn to DM17bn, and financed partly by income earned by the Treuhand privatisation agency. Those entitled to compensation will receive coupons which can be cashed in from 2004. The value of the coupons will be based on the 1935 valuation of property.</p>

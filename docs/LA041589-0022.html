			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVERS TAKE SEIZURE OF LINCOLN CALMLY;  </P> <P> BUT INVESTORS IN PARENT'S BONDS SEE LITTLE HOPE OF REPAYMENT  </P> <P> It didn't seem to matter much that the federal government is already feeling  the strain of bailing out the nation's troubled savings and loans -- a project  that has already cost $40 billion and makes banking experts nervous.  </P> <P> Confidence reigned Friday, for the most part, among customers at Lincoln  Savings &amp; Loan Assn. after the 7 a.m. seizure of the troubled Irvine  institution by federal regulators.  </P> <P> "I have complete trust in the federal government," declared one Irvine customer  as he conducted business at Lincoln's Barranca Parkway branch. "I can't believe  the U.S. government will run out of money."  </P> <P> Lincoln and its 29 branch offices in Southern California were placed in  conservatorship Friday on grounds that the institution's assets had been  substantially dissipated and that it was operating in an unsafe and unsound  condition.  </P> <P> But while Federal Home Loan Bank Board officials stationed at various Lincoln  branches Friday said business volume was heavier than normal in the morning,  there were apparently no runs on deposits and no panic by customers.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of telephone calls in the morning, but it had all died down by  noon," said David Loveday, a spokesman for the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corp., the agency that insures deposits at such S&amp;Ls. Loveday was  camped out at Lincoln's headquarters branch in Irvine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Plan to Switch  </P> <P> Not that the seizure, in the wake of the bankruptcy filing Thursday by  Lincoln's owner American Continental Corp., didn't have some fallout among  customers.  </P> <P> "I plan on withdrawing all my money from this bank and finding a new one," said  Lisa Spielmann of Anaheim.  </P> <P> But Louise Jacobs of Santa Ana was nonchalant as she left the S&amp;L's Santa  Ana office: "I hadn't thought much about it. I don't have that much money in  here, so I don't feel like I have a lot to lose."  </P> <P> Sally Frueh, an Irvine customer of the troubled S&amp;L, said she is  vacillating about her family's Lincoln account.  </P> <P> "I keep trying to decide whether to close our account or not," Frueh said. "I  don't know what to think. We just have a checking account here. If it was a  savings account, I would have pulled it out already."  </P> <P> Investors in American Continental -- many of whom are customers at Lincoln --  were far more vulnerable. American Continental's petition under the Chapter 11  bankruptcy laws jeopardized the holdings of some 12,000 Southland investors who  own about $200 million in American Continental debt.  </P> <P> "We have a situation where the tens of thousands of people who own debentures  have nowhere to turn," said one investor and depositor who asked that his name  not be used. "This (the debentures) is an uninsured product that has no  backing" beyond the implied backing supplied by Lincoln, which is now in  serious financial trouble.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sales Were Stopped  </P> <P> Much of the American Continental debt was sold in small denomination bonds to  customers of Lincoln's branches in Southern California.  </P> <P> Many of those bonds were sold through American Continental desks stationed in  Lincoln offices until the state regulators ordered Lincoln to stop the practice  last year. State law prohibits an S&amp;L from selling the corporate debt of  its parent.  </P> <P> Jean and Donald Bowman invested $120,000 in American Continental bonds -- money  that she fears she'll never see again.  </P> <P> "There isn't too much hope really," Jean Bowman said Friday. "This is not my  life savings. It's just a portion, but it's enough to sting."  </P> <P> It's not as if the Bowmans were entirely unsophisticated investors. Don Bowman  had read American's bulky prospectus and said it looked very safe, Jean Bowman  said.  </P> <P> She said sales representatives at the Lincoln branch where the Bowmans invested  an initial $20,000 told them that American Continental Chairman Charles H.  Keating Jr. had "one of the most successful private enterprises in the U.S."  </P> <P> "They implied that everything he touched was very safe, and that's what I fell  for," said Jean Bowman, who lives in the San Fernando Valley. "They said what  good condition Lincoln was in. They weren't high pressure, but they made you  feel like you were very safe. They were very sweet."  </P> <P> Times staff writer John O'Dell also contributed to this story  </P></p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / New threat to Volvo merger Volvo's ambitious plans to merge with France's Renault were under renewed threat last night after the Swedish group's third-largest shareholder joined a growing chorus of opposition. The call by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken Funds, which controls 5.7 per cent of Volvo's voting capital, for the merger to be postponed brought to seven the number of Swedish institutional shareholders that will not support the deal at a shareholders' meeting on Tuesday. Volvo's share price rose steeply yesterday on speculation that the merger would fail. The most-traded B share closed at SKr444, up SKr30. With only two Swedish institutions independent of Volvo pledged in favour of the merger, opponents called on Volvo not to proceed. Volvo declined official comment, but a senior executive said: 'We are of course taking the situation very seriously.' Votes committed against the merger still trail those in favour by a margin of between 10 and 6 per cent of the votes. But the Yes camp includes Renault's 10 per cent holding and the opposition now holds a clear lead among the independent institutions. Volvo has said it is reluctant to push through the deal on a narrow majority. Renault said that while yesterday's developments were obviously unwelcome it had no new plans before the shareholder vote. A French government official adopted a similar stance, adding that the French side had done all that it could to reassure Swedish investors. Yesterday doubt was also cast on the decision of one of the supporting institutions. The board of the Fourth Fund state pension fund, the biggest Volvo shareholder after Renault, is set to reconsider its narrow 8-6 vote in favour of the merger at a meeting tomorrow. Today attention will focus on a decision expected from the SPP insurance company which holds 4.5 per cent of the Volvo votes. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive of the insurance company Skandia, another large shareholder opposed to the merger, said in a newspaper interview yesterday that Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman, should resign.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia plans to maintain about 30 military bases on  the territory of the former Soviet Union. President Boris  Yeltsin has issued an official decree on the creation of 30  bases in accordance with proposals from the Russian ministries  of defense and foreign affairs. Most of the bases are to be  located in the CIS, in the 12 former states of the USSR that  have arisen since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with one  base in Latvia, at Skrunda.    In Latvia and Estonia there is still a contingent of Russian  troops, about 20,000 men, due to be withdrawn by the end of the  summer.    As Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of staff of the Russian Armed  Forces, stated, nearly all former Soviet republics have  expressed the wish to have Russian military bases set up on  their territories.    Aleksandr Rannikh, ambassador of the Russian Federation, was  summoned to the Latvian Foreign Ministry today and requested to  present by tomorrow an explanation for the decree signed by  Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 5 April. (Maris Riekstins),  secretary of state at the Foreign Ministry, expressed a  categorical protest at the intention, formulated as a decree, to  create military bases of the Russian Federation's armed forces  in the CIS states and the Republic of Latvia, for the purpose of  ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and the  countries indicated, as well as trying out new arms and military  techology; this is in clear contradiction with the agreements  reached at international talks and the position of (?free)  Latvia.    After the seminar being held by the Cabinet of Ministers on  the national programs, there is to be an extraordinary session  of the government at Jurmala this evening, at which an official  statement from the Latvian Government is due to be adopted  regarding this decree of Yeltsin's.</p>

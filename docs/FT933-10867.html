			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Barrage jolts PM's dream for Lebanon: The battle to rebuild the nation goes on MR Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, yesterday itemised the physical damage to his country wrought by nearly seven days of heavy Israeli bombardment: 128 people killed, of whom eight he says were Hizbollah fighters, 470 injured, 300,000 refugees, 10,000 houses in the south destroyed and 20,000 houses or apartments damaged. The human cost of the barrage is self-evident. The economic costs are only now being tallied. The Health Ministry reckons it will cost at least Dollars 25m for immediate humanitarian relief. Mr al-Hariri, who made his multi-billion dollar fortune in the construction industry, says it will cost around Dollars 900m to rebuild the broken villages. This alone, even given the Dollars 500m pledged by Arab League states over the weekend to be split between reconstruction and strengthening the Lebanese army, will further burden a country that had just begun to heave itself towards reconstruction, after a 17-year civil war which ruined swathes of Beirut, countless villages and itself left perhaps half a million homeless. But the greatest immediate cost to Lebanon may be the damage Israel's bombardment has inflicted on confidence - the most vital ingredient in the prime minister's eight month old effort to put the country back on its feet. 'Definitely this has jolted confidence in Lebanon,' says Mr Tewfik Mishlawi, a local journalist, 'and has undermined considerably Hariri's hopes and ambitions - it's a great blow to him.' The dream of restoring Beirut, and indeed Lebanon, as a magnet for Middle Eastern banking and trade, has rested squarely on the hope that other Lebanese will follow Mr al-Hariri's own fierce belief in his country, which the businessman-turned-politician is undertaking to back with millions of his own dollars, and bring themselves and their wealth back home. This dream, enshrined in Mr al-Hariri's showpiece Dollars 13bn, ten-year, Horizon 2000 redevelopment project, required faith enough. For a country with GDP of only Dollars 3.5bn and a budget deficit for the first five months of this year of Dollars 360m, raising the sums for Horizon 2000 always looked ambitious. There has been some success: international donors have already pledged Dollars 1.35bn towards specific projects and, as a sign that diaspora Lebanese have begun to repatriate their wealth, private deposits in local banks have risen 13 per cent in the past five months. But even before Israel's bombardment, some Lebanese investors and contractors were starting to grumble about the pace of progress. 'It's really a lot slower than I expected,' says Mr Jo Mehtar, one Lebanese engineer who returns from 15 years' exile in the US to set up a construction company to exploit the rebuilding programme. 'I've achieved 20 per cent of what I thought I would.' Mr al-Hariri, however, remains undaunted. 'Yes, the rebuilding programme has been delayed,' he said in an interview. 'By exactly one week.' And he seeks to deflect the suggestion that the seven-day bombardment might have shattered confidence, by arguing that Lebanon's political resilience in the face of it demonstrated a new national unity. 'If this had happened two years ago,' he says, 'the country would have fallen apart. Now we have a government where all the Lebanese are behind it.' Indeed, the manner in which the country united in opposition to the raids, and in its efforts to deal with the humanitarian crisis, surprised and impressed even local commentators. Christian and Moslem-owned news media stood firmly behind the government throughout the crisis, while Christian activists raised money for the Moslem refugees. 'There is a great sense of unity,' says Mr Mishlawi, 'in contrast to the 1982 Israeli invasion.' This unity, however, is a modest, albeit necessary, starting point for Lebanon's mammoth remaining task. And the past eight days have spotlighted more starkly than ever the extent to which success in rebuilding the country will depend ultimately on the broader success of Middle East peace talks. Hizbollah's attacks into Israel, the pretext for Israel's resulting collective punishment of the south, occurred outside the control of Lebanon's government. It also took days of talks in Damascus, under US pressure, between Iran and Syria, Hizbollah's sponsors, to win an 'understanding' that there would be no further rocket attacks into Israel. 'All we have seen in the last few days is a proxy war between Israel and Syria,' says one political analyst, 'fighting to the last Lebanese.' Mr al-Hariri acknowledges that his dream for Lebanon depends finally on reaching a durable Middle East peace. But he refuses to believe that in its absence investors will fight shy of the country. 'There are people also who take risks,' he says. 'And I have a lot of friends - don't forget my background.'</p>

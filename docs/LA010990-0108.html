			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> RIZZITELLO'S JURY SELECTION TO START  </P> <P> Jury selection is scheduled to begin today in the second trial connected to the  1987 shooting of Mustang topless bar financier William Carroll.  </P> <P> Michael Anthony Rizzitello, 62, who has a long history of racketeering and  fraud convictions, is accused by prosecutors of shooting Carroll three times in  the back of the head, leaving him permanently blind. Prosecutors claim  Rizzitello wanted to take over control of the Mustang and decided he would have  to eliminate Carroll first.  </P> <P> Convicted of attempted murder last month in the Carroll shooting was Joseph  Angelo Grosso, 48. Prosecutors claimed Grosso assisted Rizzitello by holding  Carroll down when the shots were fired. Grosso testified that Rizzitello was  the shooter, but denied any involvement himself.  </P> <P> Carroll, 56, was found in a Costa Mesa parking garage on May 1, 1987. Two of  the three bullets remain lodged in his head. For a year and a half Carroll  refused to say who shot him, but eventually named Rizzitello and Grosso.  </P> <P> Rizzitello's trial has been assigned to Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr.,  the same judge who presided over the Grosso trial.  </P> <P> Separate trials were ordered for the two defendants when Rizzitello's lawyer,  Anthony P. Brooklier, was tied up in a federal court case and Grosso would not  agree to a postponement.  </P> <P> Rizzitello was one of five men convicted in 1980 in Los Angeles' biggest  racketeering case in which federal authorities claimed that it was the first  time they had been able to bring down the entire hierarchy of an organized  crime family. Rizzitello, considered by federal authorities a captain in the  Milano crime family, was sentenced to four years in that case.  </P> <P> Rizzitello is being held in Orange County Jail without bail after authorities  claimed at an earlier bail hearing that he would be a threat to eliminate  either Grosso or Carroll before the first trial.  </P> <P> If convicted in the Carroll shooting, Rizzitello would face an automatic  sentence of 26 years to life in prison, the same sentence Grosso received.

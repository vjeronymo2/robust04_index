			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Blow to Balladur as trade minister resigns The wave of French corruption scandals last night claimed its most prominent victim with the resignation of Mr Gerard Longuet as trade and industry minister. His departure is a blow to the centre-right government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Mr Longuet was one of the most senior cabinet members and regarded as a key ally in Mr Balladur's campaign to win the presidency next year. Mr Longuet's resignation follows that of Mr Alain Carignon, who stepped down in July as communications minister to face corruption charges. Earlier this week he was detained in a Lyon prison. A number of France's top businessmen have been placed under investigation in a series of corruption cases. Mr Longuet has been under increasing pressure to resign following charges of illicit payments for the building of his holiday villa in St Tropez. He is also one of the targets of a separate investigation into illegal corporate funding of the centre-right Republican party. Mr Longuet is the president of the Republican party, the second-largest party in the ruling RPR Gaullist and centrist UDF coalition. Despite his resignation, aides indicated that Mr Longuet would remain head of the Republican party. His departure will cause uncertainty over the course of French industrial policy. Mr Longuet has pushed strongly for privatising the more profitable parts of state-owned industry such as Renault, the car group and for restructuring loss-makers like Bull, the computer company. Government officials said no decision has been taken on Mr Longuet's successor, but that it was possible that his sprawling industry dossier, which includes trade, posts and telecommunications, might be split up. One possible candidate for the industry post appears to be Mr Jean-Claude Gaudin, a Republican senator. Pressure for Mr Longuet's resignation has grown steadily since the leaking of a judge's report to the justice ministry last month, accusing the minister of corruption. The justice ministry, with Mr Balladur's backing, granted Mr Longuet until the end of this month to clear himself of the allegations before the filing of formal charges. This, in turn, brought the prime minister under increasing criticism that he was sheltering a political ally. Mr Longuet's aides insist that he will succeed in disproving charges that he allowed a friendly contractor to subsidise the building of his villa, but that 'the desire for blood in this case' had made his position untenable.</p>

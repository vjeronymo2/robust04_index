			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 18 (XINHUA) -- United States  President Bill Clinton today reiterated the U.S. support for  lifting the U.N.- sanctioned arms embargo against Bosnia, but  said Washington cannot do so unilaterally.    Describing the situation as "grim and uncertain" in Gorazde,  a "safe area" for Bosnian Muslims that was on the verge of  falling into Serb control, Clinton said chances for lifting the  embargo appeared greater for the time being.    The Europeans and Russia in the past have opposed ending the  embargo but now "their soldiers on the ground are in danger,"  Clinton said.    He disputed suggestions by some congressional leaders that  the U.S. unilaterally lift the embargo, which was seen as  denying the Muslims the chances of defending themselves while  failing to stop the arms flow to the Serbs and Croats.    "First of all, there are substantial questions about whether  under international law we can do it," he said.</p>

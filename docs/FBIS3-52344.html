However, falling snow has  curtailed the intensity of the battle. A report dispatched by  the Voice and Vision correspondent from Kabul indicates that  following the heavy battles of the past few days, groups of  people have left their homes to purchase basic essentials. At  the same time, a large number of people are trying to flee the  city, fearing that the clashes might intensify again.    Our colleague, Darestani, reports by telephone from Kabul on  the latest developments and the situation in Kabul today:    [Darestani] Thousands of family groups, whose houses have  been demolished during the clashes, began moving toward more  secure regions today. After three days of heavy battles, the  government is saying that its forces have succeeded in taking  control of the important centers of the capital. At the same  time, General Fahim, the head of Kabul's general security, who  is one of the top commanders in the Shura-ye Nozzar [Supervisory  Council], said today: The president's forces are in full  control of all the central districts in the city of Kabul,  except part of the heights in the southern and southeastern  districts and two joint headquarters of General 'Abd-al-Rashid  Dostam's forces, and the forces of Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e  Eslami [Islamic Party] along the slopes leading to these  heights. He added: General Dostam's forces were forced to  retreat from Kabul airport.    At the same time, reports have reached us indicating that  General Dostam's forces have taken positions in three areas of  Kabul airport.    General Fahim, referring to the efforts undertaken by some  jehad groups of Afghanistan including Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami,  Hezb-e Harakat-e Enqelab-e Eslami [Islamic Revolutionary  Movement] and Hezb-e Jam'iat-e Eslami [Islamic Society], as well  as Iran and Pakistan to establish a cease-fire in Kabul, further  added: We regard these efforts positively and if practical steps  were to be taken to esablish a cease-fire, Borhanoddin Rabbani  would welcome it.    Our colleague, in continuation of his report from Kabul,  added: The commander of General Dostam's forces has announced  that the forces under his command have made major advances in  the battlefields.    Speaking from his headquarters in the southeastern suburbs  of  Kabul, he described the losses inflicted on Ahmed Shah Mas'ud's  forces as being very heavy.</p>

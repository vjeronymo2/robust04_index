The proposal was based on port access route studies conducted in the early 1980's. Congress later placed a moratorium on oil and gas drilling off California, and in September, 1992, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dedicated the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS). The MBNMS encompasses the area where the Coast Guard had proposed the SSF to prohibit structures. The SSF is no longer needed because oil and gas drilling are prohibited in the Sanctuary. Additionally, the data that supported the proposed changes is now outdated. Therefore, the Coast Guard is terminating further rulemaking under docket number 83&hyph;032. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Margie G.

Study area 22 included the coast of southern California and study areas 23 to 25 included the central and northern California coast. Through public participation and government agency consultation, the studies evaluated potential traffic density patterns, waterways use of conflicts, and the need for safe access routes in offshore areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Study Results for the coast of southern California (area 22) were published on June 24, 1982 (47 FR 27430). An additional study of the Port Access Routes, Northern Approach to Santa Barbara Channel, was announced on July 26, 1984 (49 FR 30078), and results published on December 5, 1985 (50 FR 49861).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Study Results for the central and northern coast of California (areas 23&hyph;25) were published on October 14, 1982 (47 FR 46043). An additional study on Port Access Routes, Entrance to San Francisco Bay was announced on December 17, 1984 (49 FR 48946), and the study results were published on May 8, 1986 (51 FR 17071).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The port access route studies recommended amendments to the TSSs off the coast of California and the designation of new SSFs to establish a comprehensive safe routing system for vessels proceeding to, from, or between the ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles-Long Beach. The Coast Guard published a proposed rule on April 27, 1989 (54 FR 18258) to implement the study recommendations. However, after considering information from public hearings, extensive written comments opposing the proposal, the Congressional moratorium on oil and gas drilling, and the effect of the MBNMS, the Coast Guard has determined that the proposed SSF is not needed. Therefore, this rulemaking is no longer necessary, and the Coast Guard is terminating further rulemaking under docket number 83&hyph;032. On August 24, 1993 (58 FR 44634), the Coast Guard announced a new study of the area to evaluate the need for routing measures in the approaches to California ports and the need for measures to regulate vessel traffic in the offshore California national marine sanctuaries to protect sanctuary resources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> R.

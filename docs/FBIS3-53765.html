			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and 'Aqiva Eldar] </F>   [Excerpt] The Israeli Government will issue an official  reaction to the report on Irangate, compiled by the special U.S.  prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, when it is published in the United  States. The Walsh report is expected to be officially published  this week.    The report levels criticism at Shim'on Peres and Yitzhaq  Rabin, who were prime minister and defense minister during the  Irangate affair.    The Walsh report claims that Israel's Government was  involved  in law violations by U.S. Administration officials.    In its reaction, Israel will announce that when the affair  first started, in 1985, the Israeli Government acts followed the  assumption that the arms deals with Iran were carried out with  the knowledge and approval of the senior U.S. political echelons.    The Israeli reaction will say that all of the government  actions were taken in accordance with Israeli law, and that  according to it, the acts were legal because the Israeli  Government had assumed that the U.S. elements involved in the  affair had the authority and approval required.    The Israeli reaction, drafted by (reserves) Major General  Refa'el Vardi, special adviser to the prime minister and defense  minister, will also include a legal reference to the U.S.  prosecutor's claims and will address the claims which the Walsh  report details.    Apparently, the Americans will allow Israeli civilians  mentioned in the report -- such as Ya'aqov Nimrodi, Al  Schwimmer, and David Kimche -- to respond to claims against them  in the Walsh report.    Jerusalem sources said over the weekend that "Prosecutor  Walsh has totally failed in his attempt to turn Irangate, an  affair which caused a public and political storm in the United  States, into a criminal affair.    "They failed to press charges against most of the Americans  involved in the affair, and even Colonel Oliver North, who was  put on trial, was eventually acquitted." According to the  sources, "this is a distant and old story. The United States is  tired of it, and the report is an artificial attempt by Walsh to  revive it."    The prime minister's bureau said in response to the reports  about the Walsh report that it has not yet been published,  therefore the bureau will not refer to its content or  consequences at this stage.

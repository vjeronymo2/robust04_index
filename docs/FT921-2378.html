			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Portrait by Rembrandt expected to reach Pounds 3m: Saleroom LORD Rosebery is disposing of one of the most important paintings in his collection to raise money to repair his family's stately home in Scotland. The painting, a portrait of the religious reformer Johannes Uyttenbogaert, is regarded as one of the finest privately-owned Rembrandts in the UK. It is expected to fetch Pounds 3m when auctioned at Sotheby's on July 8. The painting came to the Rosebery family in the 19th century when the 5th Earl married into the Rothschilds, who had acquired the work a generation earlier. It originally hung in Mentmore Towers, the Victorian mansion which Lord Rosebery sold with its contents in 1977. The appearance on the market of this important Rembrandt, with the strong possibility that it will sell to a foreign buyer, will intensify fears that the national heritage is disappearing abroad with increasing frequency. The possibility of a Conservative government issuing a list of treasures that cannot be exported, or of a Labour government increasing the tax burden of the very rich, is believed to be behind the appearance on the market of several Old Masters in recent weeks. On April 15 Christie's hopes to sell another work by Rembrandt as well as paintings by Holbein and Canaletto. A cello made by Stradivari in about 1690 and owned by the British virtuoso Robert Cohen sold for Pounds 605,000 at Christie's yesterday to a musician who remained anonymous. The price was at the low end of the estimate. Known as the 'Bonjour', the instrument is considered to be one of the most important cellos to reach the market in recent years. A Stradivari violin known as the Schreiber and once loaned to Pinchas Zukerman, the violinist, sold at the top of its estimate for Pounds 352,000. It also went to a musician.</p>

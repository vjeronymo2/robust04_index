			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Tall tales grow in the forest The UK's forestry policy has left the country with a subsidised crop of mature trees whose value is often so low that they cost more to cut down than to sell, according to a report* published recently by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It suggests that new ways of valuing trees could lead to future generations being left with forests which they want and need, rather than serried ranks of densely planted, environmentally unfriendly conifers. WWF says that wildlife hates densely planted conifer forests, which allow little light to the forest floor, leaving no ground cover, no animals or insects, and consequently no birds. Conifers can also make the soil acidic and leave it unsuitable for growing anything but the same type of tree. The UK Forestry Commission has already started trying to put a value on the benefits of forestry apart from the value of the timber. It points out that it is far from easy to evaluate such things as landscape conservation, carbon fixing and job creation in rural areas. There are now signs, WWF believes, that economic analyses of forestry projects are attempting to describe what it calls 'the wider social returns,' such as environment costs and benefits. Policy changes include the replacement of tax incentives with targeted grants, as well as new planning procedures. Andrew Christie Miller, chairman of Timber Growers United Kingdom, the trade organisation for private woodland owners, thinks the WWF report brings together all the aspects of work being done to try to provide economic justification for subsidised forestry. While there are plenty of grants available in the UK, the level of planting in the UK has dropped to the lowest level since the Second World War. In the private sector in late 1980s, 25,000 hectares per annum were being planted, but this has now slipped below 10,000 hectares per annum. *Trees and the Treasury.

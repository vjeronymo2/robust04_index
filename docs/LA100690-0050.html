			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. STAND ON U.N. CONVENTION FOR CHILDREN  </P> <P> I am gratified that the L.A. City Council showed its vision and compassion for  the children of Los Angeles when it unanimously approved the bill of rights for  children (Metro, Oct. 4). From now on, when the City Council and agencies  consider creating and amending policies and laws, they are obligated to  consider the impact on shelter, education and other basic needs of children.  </P> <P> The City Council's vote was just three days after the U.N. World Summit for  Children. Notwithstanding the question of executing minors, children have no  political or legal power of their own. The convention helps protect children  from abuse and supports their rights to survival needs. President Bush should  sign the convention and work for its passage.  </P> <P> JOEL RUBINSTEIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

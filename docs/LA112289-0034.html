			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALTER IMAGES FORM HEART OF HIS WORK;  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: EXHIBIT AT CYPRESS COLLEGE SHOWS HOW JACK BUTLER MIXES THE REAL  WITH WHAT HE CALLS THE 'NON-REAL.'  </P> <P> Photographer Jack Butler deals with societal problems and family issues through  his photographic sculptures and various wall pieces.  </P> <P> But with Butler there is a contradiction. Photographs intrigue him, yet he  rarely shoots photographs. His images largely are collected: from books,  calendars, throw-away flyers, photographs, newspapers or any mass-produced  image. If he sees something intriguing or that is potentially intriguing, he  saves it.  </P> <P> Seven images from Butler's current series, "The Trial," are on display at the  Cypress College Photography Gallery until Dec. 1.  </P> <P> The large 38-by 49-inch photographs feature work from a 1960s murder trial in  which Butler has masked the characters' faces and hands so they become  ambiguous and strange.  </P> <P> "I like the play between the two-dimensionality of the figures and the  photographic reality of the clothing and the stuff around them," Butler said.  "I like the jarring conflict between the real and the non-real in the  photograph." The "Trial" started out in a small secondhand store where Butler  found a box with hundreds of old photographs. He spent an afternoon looking  them over to cull out 18 photos for his project.  </P> <P> He thought the photographs didn't look real, but staged, like something you  might see on television.  </P> <P> He rephotographed the original press photos and isolated the primary characters  of the courtroom setting. "Basically the treatment of the characters is  essentially to neutralize them so they aren't individuals," Butler said.  </P> <P> Then he cut out the figures from the rephotographed work and obliterated the  faces and hands with white paper. Next he raised the cut-out figures and the  titles off a dark background, lighting them so they cast a shadow for a  three-dimensional look. Then he rephotographed and enlarged them.  </P> <P> Butler first got interested in photography while studying art for advertising.  He was more intrigued in what the images meant rather than using them in an  advertising sense.  </P> <P> Butler, 43, was born in Oswego, N.Y., and reared in Arizona. In 1960, he moved  to Pasadena and later earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in art at Cal  State Los Angeles. He also received an master of fine arts from UCLA.  Currently, he teaches photography at Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I just teach photography as a medium," Butler said. "It's like a language, you  teach someone a language and they can do a grocery list or poetry or scientific  studies."  </P> <P> It is the context into which photographed images are placed that has come to  fascinate Butler most.  </P> <P> "I became interested in (photographs') societal context," Butler said. "Each  time it's placed in another context its meaning changes. Let's say you pick a  snapshot image. If you see it in someone's photo album in their house it has a  certain connotation about it.  </P> <P> "If you took that same image and put it on the wall in the Museum of Modern Art  it would have a different connotation. If you take the same photograph and use  it on an editorial page of a newspaper it has a different connotation.  </P> <P> "The meaning of a photograph is so dependent on its context. Its meaning  changes as its audience or viewer sees it based on their own experiences."  </P> <P>  "Trial," a series of black-and-white images by photographer Jack Butler, will  be on display until Dec. 1 at the Cypress College Photo Gallery, in Technical  Education Building 1, 9200 Valley View, Cypress. Hours: Monday through  Thursday, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m. to noon. Admission is free. For  more information call: (714) 826-4511.  </P> <P> </P></p>

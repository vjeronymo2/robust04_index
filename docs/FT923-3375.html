			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Bad news week for EZTs ENTERPRISE Zone Trusts were hit by unwelcome publicity this week. Imro, the investment managers' regulator, announced that it was clamping down on claims of 'guarantees' from the trusts. Most trusts are able to quote either a guarantee of rental income for a certain period from a bank, or in a few cases a guarantee that the building will be bought at the end of a fixed term for a fixed price. However, these guarantees are not limitless and depend on the strength of the guarantor. John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, has launched an investigation into the marketing claims that have been made. He said: 'We have issued a notice to members putting them on warning for extra care and due diligence in the literature they use to promote such schemes.' The depressed commercial property market means EZTs might be thinner on the ground this year in any case. However, Morgan explained that clamping down will be difficult because several different regulators are involved. Investors in one of the least successful EZTs launched to date, Greig Middleton's GMEZT2, have also found problems working with the regulatory framework. Now, in another embarrassing move for the EZT industry, they are organising in an attempt to obtain compensation. Rental income on the building owned by the flat was guaranteed by Seifert Ltd, the property development arm of the architectural practice, which went into receivership in July. Income after the end of this year is uncertain, while the trust will need to meet the costs of the building's upkeep. This is particularly awkward for many of the estimated 300 investors, as EZTs are most tax-efficient when funded by a loan. Income is needed to maintain repayments. Now David Pine, of Eversheds Alexander Tatham, the Manchester solicitors who previously represented investors in Barlow Clowes and Dunsdale Securities, and creditors of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is organising an investors' protection committee. He intends to set it up at the annual general meeting of the trust, on September 23. Pine wants investors who would support an action plan to contact him directly. The address is: David Pine, Eversheds Alexander Tatham, 30 St Anne's Street, Manchester M2 3DM. Tel: 061-236-4444.</p>

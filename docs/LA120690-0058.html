			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGRIBUSINESS HITS BACK  </P> <P> An agribusiness coalition has launched a costly promotional campaign to restore  confidence in the nation's food supply. The Washington-based Agriculture  Council of America is coordinating the effort -- FoodWatch -- and has collected  $750,000 in donations during the past 11 months from various commodity groups,  chemical manufacturers and individuals.  </P> <P> The program is the latest in a series of steps being taken by agriculture  interests to counter criticism over pesticide usage and other food safety  issues.  </P> <P> Last week, for instance, Washington State apple growers filed a $150 million  lawsuit against CBS-TV and the Natural Resources Defense Council because of  losses stemming from the 1989 Alar controversy. Another recent indicator of the  farm sector's public relations offensive was its well-financed campaign to  defeat California Ballot Proposition 128 or "Big Green."  </P> <P> "Absolutely, there is a new aggressiveness," said Ellen Haas, executive  director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy in Washington. "There have  been signs over the last six months that the food and agribusiness industries  are going to invest heavily in this kind of advertising."  </P> <P> Haas claims, however, that FoodWatch's goal is to "distort" food safety issues.  "This is an effort to pull the wool over consumers' eyes and to anesthetize the  public into thinking no problem exists in the food supply," she said.  </P> <P> FoodWatch's current centerpiece is a television commercial portraying  Pennsylvania Dutch town folk gathering for a meal in a church yard next to a  corn field. The background music is a rendition of "Amazing Grace."  </P> <P> The only words spoken during the spot are at its conclusion when a narrator  says, "America's bounty: Brought to you by the 20 million men and women who put  food on your table."  </P> <P> The commercial's debut was on Thanksgiving Day in as many as 120 television  markets. All the air time was purchased by supportive corporations or donated  by local stations as public service announcements, a device that yielded  significant savings for the FoodWatch campaign.  </P> <P> Future components of the program include media relations, newspaper/magazine  advertisements, public opinion polling and distribution of educational  materials.  </P> <P> "FoodWatch is designed to build public confidence in the food and agriculture  industries and in the institutions that guide them, both public and private,"  said Judy O'Hara, executive director of the Agriculture Council of America.  </P> <P> The FoodWatch solicitations are not as bucolic as the program's generic  television commercial. A recent advertisement in California Farmer magazine was  headlined, "What Would You Give to Tell Your Side of the Story?" The ad talks  about a "nationwide crisis of confidence," "confused consumers" and "making  sure we'll be able to control our future."  </P> <P> O'Hara said that major contributions and support from more than two dozen  chemical companies and affiliated trade groups have not hurt FoodWatch's  credibility.  </P> <P> "The (chemical interests') participation represents the fact that some segments  of industry feel that this problem is more important than the others do," she  said. "No segment of agriculture should be excluded (from FoodWatch) nor have  an undue amount of influence."  </P> <P> She also points out that 30% of the funds raised to date are contributions of  $500 or less from individuals or local organizations such as the Boone County,  Ind., Farm Bureau.  </P> <P> The major presence of chemical companies and trade groups does bother Public  Voice's Haas.  </P> <P> "It hurts their credibility and demonstrates the viewpoint that they are  taking: Defend the status quo and chemicals in agriculture," Haas said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the National Agriculture Chemical Assn. said that his group --  by supporting FoodWatch -- is just trying to explain farming to a vastly urban  American public.  </P> <P> "This is an excellent program that is supported by all of agriculture, and we  are a part of agriculture," said Christopher Klose, vice president of the  Washington-based chemical association. "It is our business to help farmers  produce safe, abundant and nutritious supplies of food, and Americans do that  better than anyone else in the world."  </P> <P> FoodWatch's O'Hara says she knows of no formal criticism of the program from  activist groups. In any event, both consumer advocates and environmentalists  will be added to the program's advisory committee, which will be announced next  month, she said.  </P> <P> "An important part of the advisory board will be from consumer and  environmental organizations. Otherwise (the program) is not valid," she said.  </P> <P> Rod Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute in  Washington, remains skeptical about the motives behind FoodWatch.  </P> <P> "I wish the industry would instead spend all this money to clean up the  problems with contaminated foods, promote safety in poultry processing and  reduce the use of chemicals in agriculture," he said.  </P></p>

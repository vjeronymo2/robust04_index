			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Manuel Diaz C.] </F>   [Text] Members of drug cartels are using the Pacific coast  area between the Azuero Peninsula and Punta Burica, in Chiriqui  Province, to drop packages containing drugs which are later  transported ashore, a source at the National Air Service (SAN)  has reported.    According to the source, authorities constantly receive  reports of fishermen and residents on drug shipments that are  brought ashore. The source added that this kind of activity has  also been reported in several provinces, such as Chiriqui,  Colon, and Veraguas. He said that in the Atlantic sector, boats  are using the island of Escudo de Veraguas for illegal  activities due to the lack of surveillance.    The source stated that the SAN is constantly conducting  operations in the most vulnerable points for this kind of  activity, but the lack of aircraft and resources prevents them  from maintaining constant surveillance.    However, the source said he did not know whether the town of  Viento Frio in Colon Province is being used for the trafficking  of drugs. He indicated that so far SAN authorities on the  Atlantic coast do not have reports on the use of this location  as a point for transshipping narcotics. Recently, residents of  this town reported the presence of boats that drop drug  packages, which are later picked up by persons who sell  narcotics.    During 1993, the authorities conducted several  counternarcotics operations in the Provinces of Chiriqui and  Bocas del Toro, which led to the arrest of several people  allegedly involved in drug contraband.</p>

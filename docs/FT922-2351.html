			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Botnar's business 'lacked rules' NISSAN UK, the former importer-distributor of Nissan vehicles controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, was run in 'an unconventional and extraordinary way', the High Court was told yesterday. Mr Anthony Boswood QC, counsel for Nissan UK, said 'there was a complete lack of 'proper' formalities, rules, procedures and lines of reporting such as one would expect to find in a business of such size and importance.' Mr Boswood was summing up for Nissan UK, which is being sued for more than Pounds 1m in damages by Mr Stan Cholaj, a former assistant managing director of the company who is claiming wrongful dismissal and breach of contract. Mr Boswood said that Mr Botnar controlled the company in an autocratic way. 'Mr Botnar treated this company as his own personal thing or fiefdom,' he said. The hearing continues today.</p>

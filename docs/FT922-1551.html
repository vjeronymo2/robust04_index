			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Monday Interview: A mission to give satisfaction - Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive of Allianz, the German insurer A deep scar runs down the left side of Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle's face, from below the earlobe to the corner of his mouth. It does not result from an accident. More romantically, it is the result of a duel fought during his university days. It proves, in the parlance of this ritual, that Mr Schulte-Noelle is satisfaktionsfahig - capable of giving satisfaction. Now, decades after his mettle was tested in this brutal manner, he is being put to the test again and the same question is being asked. Is he capable of giving satisfaction? Not, of course, at the point of a sword, but as the recently appointed chief executive of Allianz, the Munich-based insurance company which is one of Europe's most powerful financial institutions. The question is especially poignant, as Allianz has reached a tricky point in its history. In spite of its undoubted financial might - its assets are estimated at DM400bn (Pounds 137bn) and its premium income last year was DM48bn - it faces several potentially serious problems. First, Allianz is under attack from the Bundeskartellamt, the German federal cartel office, which is concerned about the group's domination of the domestic life assurance market and its relations with Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-largest bank, in which Allianz has a 22 per cent stake. Second, the German insurance market faces a wave of deregulation which will increase competition and threaten Allianz's main source of profits. A series of European Community directives, aimed at freeing the insurance markets in member states, must be implemented by the summer of 1994. In Germany, the impact will be felt most severely in the profitable market for personal insurance, in particular household and motor insurance. Third, there are doubts about the wisdom of Allianz's move into eastern Germany. It has bought Deutsche Versicherungs, the former state insurance monopoly, which is unlikely to yield profits until 1996. Before then, accumulated losses are expected to amount to about DM1.5bn, on top of the purchase price of DM711m. Fourth, and perhaps most important, doubts remain about the company's broad strategy, which was developed by Mr Wolfgang Schieren, Mr Schulte-Noelle's predecessor. During 20 years at the helm, Mr Schieren transformed what had been a regional player into the world's largest general insurance group. But critics say he spent too much money - about DM10bn in the 1980s - buying poor-quality businesses. They cite in particular the case of Fireman's Fund, the US insurer which was bought for Dollars 3.3bn in 1990 and made a paltry profit of Dollars 28m - before gains on disposals - on turnover of Dollars 2.6bn last year. Sitting in a small, modestly furnished office deep in the headquarters of the Allianz empire - a hushed, marble-floored office complex - Mr Schulte-Noelle seems unperturbed by the challenges. His calm manner belies long experience at the top of the German insurance industry. He has been with Allianz since 1975 and, in the decade prior to his succession last year, became one of Mr Schieren's closest aides. During that period he was part of the executive team which consolidated the company's position within Germany while pursuing aggressive expansion on the Continent and overseas. The internationalisation of the group has led to a shift in the company's source of revenues. 'At the beginning of the 1970s, when the strategy was conceived, overseas business amounted to 2 per cent of total turnover,' he explains. 'Now it is 48 per cent.' In pursuing this strategy, Allianz has placed little emphasis on short-term financial gains. 'It is important that we earn money and pay dividends, but this is not our only priority. We are now at the size where we have more strategic options worldwide than we had 20 years ago.' Some acquisitions have nevertheless yielded quick rewards. Mr Schulte-Noelle cites the Italian insurer, Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta (RAS), bought for DM1.1bn in 1984 and Cornhill, the UK insurer, bought for DM900m in 1986. But other areas require greater patience. 'There are some parts of the world where one can't reasonably make money in a few years. We are quite prepared to wait five, eight or even 10 years if the market is an interesting one for us in the long term.' The US is one of these markets, and Mr Schulte-Noelle is sure that Allianz was right to buy Fireman's Fund, in spite of its meagre return last year. 'We are still convinced that the Fireman's Fund will proUS that we have been seeking. Once there is an upturn in the weak US market we expect a rapid improvement in profitability', he says. He is equally adamant that the purchase of Deutsche Versicherungs is justifiable over the long term. 'If we had decided not to go into the new Bundeslander, arguing that in five years we would still not have made a return on our investment, I'm sure that our investors would have criticised us for ignoring the potential of these new markets. 'If you imagine that the east of England had been split off - representing 25 per cent of your market - and suddenly there came along an opportunity to get back in there, British companies wouldn't have to think very long about it, especially if the alternative was to build up from scratch.' While supporting the strategy of rapid international expansion, Mr Schulte-Noelle believes that phase in the company's development is over. The one exception is Asia: Mr Schulte-Noelle says he will make determined efforts to build up a presence in what he calls the 'growth markets of the future', in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam and even China. In Europe and the US, by contrast, the emphasis will be on consolidation. There will be acquisitions, but these will be designed to address specific weaknesses. In the UK, for example, he says Allianz will seek to expand its share of the life assurance market. At home in Germany, he accepts there is likely to be a short-term reduction in profitability in 1994 and beyond. He blames the process of deregulation which will increase competition and reduce margins in the German market. But he is not unduly worried; he says the company has taken steps to minimise the impact of deregulation through heavy investment in training and information technology in anticipation of the changed conditions and with the aim of making the company more flexible in introducing new products'. Throughout the interview, Mr Schulte-Noelle remains impassive. His cool demeanour is at odds with his reputation within the company as 'one of the boys' who, when head of sales, used to sit at the piano after conferences and accompany salesmen as they sang into the early hours. He breaks into a wry smile only when a direct allusion is made to Allianz's power within Germany. This power is at the root of the recent challenge from the cartel office, which claims that Allianz's dominance of the life insurance market is anti-competitive and which has ordered the insurance group to cut its stake in Dresdner and reduce the two companies' co-operation in the life assurance sector. Allianz vigorously denies the allegations and Mr Schulte-Noelle is not alone in Germany in seeing the move as a generalised attack on Allianz and its position in corporate Germany. 'It probably stems from fears about us networking all over Germany,' he says. 'But it's nonsense to think there is anything sinister about our investment strategy. 'Look at the facts. Allianz has to invest a lot of money - we receive about DM100m to invest every day. The German stock market is not a very large one. If you have this amount of money to invest and there are a limited number of companies, pretty soon you build up holdings in the companies you like.' He says that Dresdner's management - indeed the management of any company in which Allianz has a stake - is free to take steps which may go against Allianz's interests. But as the head of Germany's most powerful investor, Mr Schulte-Noelle is unlikely to meet opposition from many German businessmen. PERSONAL FILE 1942 Born in Essen.

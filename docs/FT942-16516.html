			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Blood brothers: a Zulu tragedy: Patti Waldmeir travels to rural Natal to meet a family divided by South Africa's deadly political geography There is a hill in South Africa's Natal province - a place of many, many hills - which is known as Patheni, or 'the place of goodness.' The poignant beauty of the name is a cruel joke played on those who live in the two rival villages separated by its blue-green ridge, including brothers Samuel and Joseph Njilo, childhood playmates turned mortal enemies by the deadly geography of Natal. For it is not so much politics which separates Samuel from Joseph in this remote area of the Natal midlands: few in either village know much about the rival parties which have turned Natal into a battleground for the Inkatha Freedom Party and the African National Congress. It is the hill which divides them. Geography determines many political choices in Natal. Those who live in Inkatha areas will not vote, because Inkatha says they must not; and those who live in ANC areas will vote because they do not dare to stay away. Patheni and Ndaleni, the two rival villages which sprawl across the valleys on either side of Patheni hill, are two such areas. Joseph, younger 'brother' to Samuel (Europeans would say they are cousins) does not seem to find this strange. How is it, I ask, that they have ended up, 40 years after their shared childhood, on opposite sides of the political divide? Why did one brother join the ANC and the other the IFP? 'Because one stays (lives) at Patheni and the other at Ndaleni,' says Joseph. For him, it is as simple as that. In 1990, he says, his own village of Ndaleni held a meeting and decided unanimously to join the ANC. The decision had to be unanimous, he says; Ndaleni could not accommodate opposing viewpoints. 'If I didn't join the ANC, I would have had to move to Patheni,' he says, without the slightest hint of resentment. 'Nobody would dare stay here who is not ANC,' adds his wife Catherine, while daughters Promise and Gloria contribute their explanation of how Ndaleni became an ANC village: 'At the beginning, people were forced to join the ANC. Now they love it.' Samuel does not pretend that things are much different in Patheni, a few arduous kilometres away by foot across the top of Patheni hill: 'Even here, people say they are IFP when really they are ANC because they've got houses here and they know it's too expensive to build another house'. Faced with that overwhelming economic imperative it will be a brave man who votes with his conscience and not with his neighbours (especially since Inkatha's poll boycott will mean that mere presence at the voting station will almost certainly mean a vote for the ANC). Fighting has left several hundred dead in the two communities in the past decade. Samuel, a minister of the Ethiopian church and Inkatha leader in Patheni, recalls that the violence began with non-political faction-fighting in the early 1980s - and escalated after Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, was released from prison of in 1990. Samuel gestures at Nkosi Dhlamini, the hereditary chief of the Patheni area, who sits silently at the side of a room in Patheni's tribal court building. It is one of the few modern structures in a village which lacks electricity and internal plumbing and which could have been transplanted straight from 19th century Zululand. Samuel says the troubles started when the youth of Patheni ridiculed the chief, ignored his authority and insisted he leave the KwaZulu homeland (which pays him a salary as chief) to join the ANC-aligned Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. Njilo points out the bracelet of goat's hair worn by Dhlamini as a mark of office: 'They looked at Dhlamini and laughed and said: 'look at this man]' They are not Zulus any more. They are rejecting their tradition,' he says angrily. The strict discipline of Zulu society decrees that youth must obey age and that the word of the chief and his headmen is law, in all but the most serious criminal cases. Samuel says tradition is the crux of the dispute between the ANC and IFP. 'All those Zulus (who support the ANC), they are not proper Zulus, they are imitation, imitation, they are too weak,' he says, jumping up to demonstrate the proper walk for a Zulu man wearing the traditional 'beshu', or skin skirt worn on feast days: 'Raise yourself. Everyone must see: this is a man. Look at his culture,' he roars, with that combination of machismo and pride which makes it so easy to offend IFP members, and so hard to placate them. 'Chief Albert Luthuli (a former ANC president, a Nobel peace prize winner and a Zulu), if he was still living, I don't think there would be IFP in this country. He was a man,' says Samuel, adding that Mandela, a member of the Xhosa tribe which he despises for being insufficiently warlike, is being 'used' by the ANC. After Mandela's release the youth of both villages confronted their chiefs, putting a burning tyre (the famous 'necklace') around the neck of the Ndaleni chief, who fled. Many died in the ensuing fighting. Marauding parties from both villages came over the hill at night to murder opponents. In the end the young people from Patheni who supported the United Democratic Front (forerunner to the ANC) fled to Ndaleni, leaving one quarter of Patheni's houses empty; IFP sympathisers from Ndaleni took refuge in Patheni. The politically committed in both villages were a minority; but the apolitical majority threw in their lot with the activists; they could hardly do otherwise. Since that time, Samuel and Joseph - who grew up as brothers in the same household, and experienced the same rites of passage to Zulu manhood - have not seen one another. When we offered to set up a meeting at a neutral spot, outside the area, both were suspicious; perhaps they thought that we, or our Zulu guide, planned to arrange an assassination. 'I am crying to see him. It's my family,' says Samuel of Joseph. 'It's only our organisation makes us fight each other, for nothing. When my brothers die other side, I can't even attend the funeral.' Samuel is far more of a politician than Joseph, who only recently joined the ANC, and then - he says - only because 'all the residents of this area are ANC members.' Samuel joined the ANC in 1958, but when the organisation was banned in 1960, he opted not to join the movement in exile. 'We couldn't just go all of us into exile,' he says. When Inkatha was launched in 1975 - it was intended to operate as a kind of internal wing for the banned ANC - he joined. The two movements parted ways when the Inkatha leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, fell out with the ANC leadership. After some soul-searching, Samuel stuck with Buthelezi. As a result, Samuel's house at Folweni, a township near Durban, was burned and his furniture destroyed by ANC supporters. He explains this as he apologises for the primitive condition of his house at Patheni, part-ruin and part traditional thatched hut, with a stand of blood-red dahlias in the dirt yard outside. As areas near Durban have fallen to the ANC, many IFP supporters have had to do as Samuel has done, and return to the deep rural areas which are IFP strongholds. Now these areas are preparing to boycott April's all-race elections. 'They (the ANC) must accept what we want. We can't just vote for nothing. We are not so stupid,' says Samuel, displaying the wounded pride which is perhaps the greatest hallmarks of Inkatha. He says he does not know what Patheni will do, but he will not vote; it seems a fair bet that his neighbours will not dare to defy his lead. Across the hill at Ndaleni, Catherine Njilo, Joseph's wife, sits at her kitchen table, peering at us by the light of a flickering candle, as gusts of wind blow in from the rainy night. She asks: 'Can grannies vote?' We assure her that they can. Still, she says, it is not wise for all the members of a family to vote. Her daughters help with an explanation: 'If there are 10 members of the family then you mustn't all vote because you may vote for different parties, and then you will quarrel.' Her teenage son argues that a vote for Mandela is a vote for a new house; since eight adults and two grandchildren live in this tiny space, without any salary, his argument may prove persuasive. Will Joseph vote? Like many Zulus, he will not answer such questions from whites. If he does, he says, he is not worried that the ANC will fail to protect Zulu tradition. 'Zululand is for Zulus, and Transkei is for Xhosas. Even after the elections, Zululand will be for Zulus]' he says, demonstrating how little he has understood the ANC's policy of non-racialism, which denies such tribal divisions. His face in the candlelight, marked by deep tribal scarring, is the face of a man who is every bit as traditional as his brother Samuel. But fate and geography have divided them, perhaps forever. The elections may only make matters worse.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Brussels correspondent Nikolaos Belos--recorded] </F>   [Text] European Union [EU] Commision member Hans van den  Broek has taken the initiative to visit Skopje and Athens to  seek a solution to the political problem. The visit to Skopje  will take place on Wednesday [23 February] and to Athens on  Thursday. At the same time, the European Commission today  undertook a commitement to examine from the legal point of view  the Greek Government's measures against Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] in order to establish  whether there are reasons for referring the case against our  country to the European Court. These are the two decisions made  at noon today during the meeting of the EU foreign ministers.    According to the statement by Alternate Foreign Minister  Theodhoros Pangalos, who is presiding over the council, the  question of Greece's measures against Skopje was raised at the  meeting by EU Commission President Jacques Delors. According to  Mr. Pangalos, most of the countries criticized Greece both for  the nature of the measures and the way in which they were  adopted. Responding to questions from correspondents, the  alternate foreign minister described the Government's decision  as an exceptional measure of a political nature. We regret  having to make this decision, he said. We would like to have  good relations with this republic but tolerance -- as Mr.  Pangalos put it -- has its limits. Mr. Pangalos further stressed  that in the next few hours the Government will present to the EU  Commission all the legal arguments that, in the Government's  opinion, justify its decision.    Asked whether Greece had informed the member states in time,  Mr. Pangalos said that the 11 members were briefed  simultaneously with the announcement of the measures. Referring  to the measures, the alternate foreign minister stressed that  the embargo against FYROM does not include medicines,  foodstuffs, or oil used by humanitarian institutions.    It is worth noting that, at his regular briefing of the  correspondents this morning, the EU Commission spokesman said  that the Commission understands very well that the FYROM issue  is sensitive for the Greek Government and the sentimental  reaction of Greek public opinion. However, as he said, the  Commission in its capacity as guardian of the [Maastricht]  Treaty has to examine the legal dimensions of the measures that  the Government has taken in the light of the EU's lawful order.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: South African gold mines steer round the rocks - The strategies of survival South African gold mining output in 1993 is estimated at 622 tonnes, an increase of more than 1 per cent from 1992 and its highest level since 1986. That ranks as something of an achievement in an industry for which a sharp decline was forecast by some pundits when many mines struggled to survive rising costs and flat rand gold prices from 1988 to 1992. The loss of tens of thousands of jobs, productivity improvements, the rand's fall against the dollar and increasingly complex use of derivatives to assure gold revenue have enabled all but two large producers to stay in business. Industry results for the final quarter of 1993 showed, however, that survival could come at a cost. Some mines missed out on the full benefit of bullion's rally in 1993 as they locked in prices for part of their output at levels well below the spot level, while others began belatedly to catch up on capital spending neglected when the gold price was at its lowest. Although the industry has survived one of the worst periods in its history largely intact the mines have entered a new era of caution. The shift has been slow but Mr Dennis Tucker, gold mining analyst at stockbrokers Martin &amp; Co, believes it is distinct. 'The mining houses crossed a threshold with the decisions in the past 18 months to develop new mines like Moab, South Deep and Target as add-on rather than stand-alone projects,' he says. Moab, providing replacement tonnage for Anglo American's Vaal Reefs at a current cost of R1.7bn (USDollars 500m), is the farthest advanced of the projects. Anglovaal is developing the Target prospect from its marginal, short-life Loraine mine, from which it will in turn be able to develop its Sun prospect. The group decided in 1992 not to go ahead with the R2.5bn Sun project on its own, citing the uncertainty surrounding domestic politics and the gold market. Johannesburg Consolidated Investment has been developing South Deep from the neighbouring Western Areas mine slowly, carefully exploring the gold-bearing reef from underground, rather than sinking a new shaft, which would cost at least R2bn. 'South Africa has little chance of seeing a repeat of past gold mining booms because of the geological maturity of the gold fields and unpredictability of gold prices,' says Mr Lionel Hewitt, managing director of Anglo's gold and uranium division. There is little prospect of discovering a new geologically well-defined field such as the ageing Evander region east of Johannesburg. What areas are left have difficult orebodies, likely to be exploited only with gold's price above R50,000 a kilogram (Dollars 450 a troy ounce) and significant technological improvements, Mr Hewitt adds. He notes that expensive delays suffered by two now cash-strapped developing mines, Gencor's Oryx and JCI's Joel, have had a sobering effect on the industry, underscoring the high risks that come with deep-level mining. Much of the country's gold output is being extracted from more than 3,000 metres underground. With little chance of fiscal incentives to reduce the risk of investment in new projects - local mining tax, at an effective 40 per cent, is higher than in Australia, Canada or the US - given the demands of reconstruction and development, Mr Bernard van Rooyen, recently retired as Gold Fields executive director responsible for new business, sees South African gold production declining by about 20 per cent in the years ahead to 450 to 500 tonnes a year. However, there are extensive ore reserves at depth on the periphery of many of the high-grade gold prices that will prove lucrative with productivity improvements, a better labour relations climate and more consistent use of appropriate technology. 'No other country has a gold mining industry which while more than a century old can boast that it has at least 30 years of mineable ore reserves left,' says Mr van Rooyen.</p>

The  Yanji Industrial and Communication Material Trading Company of  Jilin Province and its Korean counterpart has recently reached  an initial agreement, where the said company will invest 370  million yuan to jointly develop Chongjin Port in the DPRK. This  is one of the starting moves to develop a big golden triangle in  Northeast Asia.    Chongjin Port is a free port of the DPRK opened to the  outside world. It is located in DPRK at the edge of the big  golden triangle of the Tumen Jiang in northeast Asia, the  development of which has been decided by the UNDP [United  Nations Development Program]. It is also the starting point for  a Eurasian railroad, which holds a vital position in the  development of a big golden triangle of the Tumen Jiang in  northeast Asia.    As disclosed by a relevant source, the Yanji Industrial and  Communication Material Trading Company began to contact relevant  parties of the DPRK in many ways last year, and reached an  initial agreement to jointly develop and use Chongjin Port.  According to the agreement, the Chinese company will be  responsible for the transformation and extension of the East  Chongjin Port, and the period for cooperation and use will be 50  years; both sides will be collectively responsible for the  construction of the Hoeryong-Chongjin Highway with a total  length of 95 km and a hotel with an area of 30,000 square  meters. The total investment amount from the Chinese side for  the extension of the port and the construction of a highway and  the hotel will be 370 million yuan. After Chongjin Port comes  into use, ships from countries and regions including the ROK,  Japan, the United States, Taiwan, and Hong Kong will be allowed  to enter and exit the port, and the DPRK will provide  preferential terms and other measures of guarantee.    The handling capacity of the port after expansion will  increase from over 1 million metric tons now to over 20 million  metric tons. Certainly, this will substantially promote economic  cooperation and trade exchanges in Northeast Asia and the world.  In the meantime, it will also alleviate a shortage of ocean  transport among the countries of the Northeast Asia region,  activate the economy in the big golden triangle, and expedite  the development of the lower reaches of the Tumen Jiang.</p>

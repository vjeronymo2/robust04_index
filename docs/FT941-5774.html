			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest cuts Renishaw to Pounds 2.81m In spite of a 30 per cent fall in sales to Germany and Japan, Renishaw, the specialist measuring equipment group, reported only a slight decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 2.81m for the six months to end-December. The shares were marked down 20p to 275p. After an exceptional charge of Pounds 183,000 for restructuring costs, profits were ahead 11 per cent from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 2.24m. Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 573,000, reflecting lower interest rates. Total sales edged ahead from Pounds 22m to Pounds 23.3m; but ignoring currency distortions, sales were flat. Mr Alan Roberts, finance director, said the sales declines in Germany and Japan had been offset by an increase of 15 per cent in sales to the US, the single biggest market accounting for up to 40 per cent of group sales. Sales in the UK were ahead 20 per cent, and sales in east Asia were improving. Sales of the group's new scanning devices and Raman imaging microscopes were doing well. Mr David McMurtry, chairman, said the group was continuing to keep the pressure on costs while increasing investment in new products and longer-term marketing. The group has invested almost Pounds 1.5m in a new manufacturing facility, which should be fully on stream at the end of the month. It will both increase capacity and improve efficiency. New sales offices are being opened in Singapore and Beijing. Mr McMurtry said the start of this year had seen increased sales and orders, which would 'contribute significantly' to the second half. Earnings per share fell from 4.4p to 4p. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p.</p>

To this end, the effect of the delta  sleep inducing peptide on the focal and generalized seizure  activity and a model of chronically elevated seizure activity,  i.e., the pharmacological kindling, are investigated. The  particular problem of examining the effect of the delta sleep  inducing peptide on the seizure activity when it is injected  intravenously and determining the delta sleep inducing peptide  concentration in the central mesencephalon segment which  includes the reticular section of the substantia  nigra under the condition of chronic seizure syndrome in  rats which is formed by pharmacological kindling and is  characterized by disintegration of endogenous control of brain  stimulation and spastic readiness is addressed. The experiment  is carried out on 20 2.2-3.5 kg cats, 280-320 g male Vistar rats  (with at least ten animals in each group) and 18-24 g  F-1/CBAXC57B1/6 mice (at least ten). The experimental procedure  is outlined. The experiment shows that the delta sleep inducing  peptide is capable of inhibiting the seizure activity in the  foci created in the cortex of cats by strychnine application,  developing a delayed seizure kindling syndrome in rats, and  preventing the development of seizures in mice induced by  bicucullin, pycrotoxin, and corazol but has no such effect on  thiosemicarbazide and strychnine. The study reveals that the  delta sleep inducing peptide's anticonvulsant activity is due to  its effect on the reticular section of substantia  nigra whereby the peptide level terminates is that section  at the late stages of pharmacological kindling. It is speculated  that this peptide may be one of the factors of endogenous  control of the brain excitability. The findings demonstrate that  the peptide and the preparations on its basis may be useful in  developing new methods of cupping off and preventing the  convulsion syndrome.

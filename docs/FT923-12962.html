			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Anglia Homes losses exceed Pounds 5m - Net borrowings remain at three times shareholders' funds BAD NEWS continues to surface from Britain's highly depressed housing sector. Yesterday, Anglia Secure Homes, the retirement homes specialist, revealed that pre-tax losses had risen to Pounds 5.08m during the six months to end-March. That compared with a loss of Pounds 4.22m last time. Turnover in the first half dropped from Pounds 11m to Pounds 6.57m. That meant the group lost 77p for every Pounds 1 of sales. Losses per share rose from 12.8p to 15.4p. Mr Peter Edmondson, chairman, said that in the light of continuing losses the group would not be paying an interim dividend. Anglia last paid a dividend in respect of the 12 months to September 1989. It has been hit hard by the collapse in demand for housing and particularly for retirement homes. Mr Edmondson said yesterday that the market remained appallingly weak. Commercial Union, the insurance group, rescued Anglia in April 1990 when it took a 12 per cent stake as part of a financial restructuring. It also owns a 49 per cent stake in Haven Services - Anglia has the other 51 per cent - which provides management services for retirement homes for Anglia and other companies. Anglia, which had seen its share price tumble from a peak of 458p in March 1989 to 6 1/2 p at yesterday's close - down 5 1/2 p on the day - had been selling its stock of completed homes in a bid to reduce debts. These fell from Pounds 74.8m in early 1989 to Pounds 30.1m at the end of March. Net borrowings, however, remained almost three times shareholders funds of Pounds 10.8m. The stock of unsold homes was reduced from more than 700 to 360 at the end of March. The group had reached the point where it needed to start building again  - on just three sites - for the first time since the beginning of 1990. Half year losses were struck after interest of Pounds 2m (Pounds 1.3m) including Pounds 700,000 from write-off capitalised interest. There was also an exceptional write-down against stock of Pounds 1m.</p>

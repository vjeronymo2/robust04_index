			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine considers the Kashmir issue as purely an  internal problem of India. This was stated by the visiting  Ukraine foreign minister, Mr. Anatoliy Zlenko, in New Delhi  yesterday. Talking to newspersons, he said his country is  opposed to internationalization of the issue. Mr. Zlenko said  Ukraine is prepared to work with India in converting the  military industrial complexes in the former Soviet state into  nonmilitary units. Over 45 percent of the military units of the  former Soviet Union are located in Ukraine.</p>

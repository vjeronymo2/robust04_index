According to the paper, a national unified foreign exchange  control market among banks will begin formal operations Friday  [1 April].    Designated foreign exchange banks are expected to replace  enterprises in undertaking transactional activities in the  market, which will be linked with 10 big cities.    An official of the State Administration of Exchange Control  said that the establishment of the national unified market  requires improvement.    At present, China has 18 banks undertaking foreign exchange  business, and about 100 foreign-funded banks. These banks may  apply to become members of the China foreign exchange market.    The official noted that China has succeeded in the  transition  from the old system of foreign exchange control to the new one  over the past three months.    It has smoothly merged the double-track exchange rates into  one; abolished enterprises' proportional retention of foreign  exchange system; and carried out a bank settlement system.    It has also opened inter-bank foreign exchange business and  stopped the issuing of foreign exchange certificates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Considerable progress has been made in two days of  Latvian-Russian interstate talks on the issue of the definition  of the status of the Skrunda radar station. This was reported  today by the head of the Russian delegation, Sergey Zotov.    Zotov explained that disagreements in the opinions of the  two  delegations on draft agreements on the status of the Skrunda  radar, and the period for which it will remain in Latvia, as  well as on social security for the Russian military personnel  are the only obstacles that hamper the signing of the joint  agreement on the withdrawal of the Russian Army.</p>

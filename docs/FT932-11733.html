			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Labour urges freedom for post offices to diversify LABOUR yesterday called for post offices to be free to diversify into new lines of business such as ticket sales and financial services as part of a blueprint for Post Office reform. Under its proposals - which envisage a unified national postal service remaining in the public sector - the party would set up an independent regulator to set and monitor new service and performance targets. It would examine ways of giving the Post Office access to the financial markets to raise private capital for development projects. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, said when launching the proposals yesterday that the party would review the body's corporate governance, possibly setting up a supervisory board whose members would be 'more widely drawn' than present Post Office directors. Yesterday's announcement came two weeks after it emerged that the government had decided to delay the possible privatisation of the Post Office until the 1994-95 parliamentary session at the earliest. Ministers are expected to make a parliamentary statement on the outcome of the government's Post Office review before the end of the present session in July or August. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has still to decide whether to sell the organisation as one unit or split it into two or three parts based on its constituent sections - the Royal Mail, Post Office Counters and Parcelforce. Labour's statement suggests there is some common ground between the two main parties as ministers are also keen for Post Office Counters to branch out into new businesses. This is seen as a way of improving the financial performance of the thousands of post offices which do not cover their costs and must be subsidised from the Post Office's other activities. Ministerial discussions on the issue have been given fresh impetus by Department of Social Security moves to encourage pensioners and recipients of other benefits to receive payments through automated credit transfers instead of via the Post Office.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "Here she comes . . . Miss U.S.S.R.": Global American Television Inc., an  independent producer based in Colrain, Mass., has obtained broadcast rights to  the "Miss U.S.S.R." beauty pageant taking place May 19-21 in Moscow. Global  spokesman David Nussbaum says the pageant will showcase "extraordinarily  beautiful and fashionable women," adding: "I think we're ready to discard the  old images of Russian women as dowdy, industrial, manual-laboring peasants in  shapeless gray dresses." Terms of the deal with the Soviets were not released,  and no broadcast dates have been set in this country.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

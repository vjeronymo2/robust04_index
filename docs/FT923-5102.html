			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Former Polish PM found murdered FORMER Polish Communist Prime Minister Piotr Jaroszewicz was found tortured and hanged beside his wife's dead body in their Warsaw home yesterday in a macabre double murder, Reuter reports from Warsaw. An Interior Ministry spokesman told local radio that Mr Jaroszewicz, 82, was tortured and hanged, and his wife Alicja Solska shot dead with a hunting rifle in their isolated villa in the wealthy suburb of Anin. No motive was known. Mr Jaroszewicz, a deeply unpopular prime minister who was ousted in 1980 after 10 years in office, led a solitary life and refused the offer of a bodyguard. 'It was quite macabre. The perpetrator acted with premeditation - meaning he wanted to kill them,' said a police spokesman. The couple's concrete-clad two-storey villa, in woods on the edge of Warsaw, was sealed off by police and a special commission had begun an investigation. The police were seen using a stretcher to carry away at least one corpse in a black plastic bag. A large rifle was also brought out, wrapped in a white sheet. Neighbours said Mr Jaroszewicz and his wife, a former journalist for the Communist party mouthpiece Trybuna Ludu, rarely received visitors and were wary of strangers. Mr Jaroszewicz was last seen walking their dog on Monday. Mr Jaroszewicz, a former army general and deputy prime minister from 1952 to 1970, was deeply disliked by the public as Poland fell deep into economic decline under Communist leader Edward Gierek in the 1970s. He was made a scapegoat for the government's economic failures - the main cause of Poland's present-day foreign debt problems - and forced to resign in February 1980. He was expelled from the Communist party in 1981 and interned along with several dozen former Communist officials, when Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed martial law to crush the opposition Solidarity trade union led by Mr Lech Walesa. When Solidarity ousted the Communists in 1989, there were no reprisals. Most of the old leaders retired quietly from public life and none has been brought to trial. 'I know richer people around here, with better houses, so I don't think it could have been a robbery,' said a neighbour.</p>

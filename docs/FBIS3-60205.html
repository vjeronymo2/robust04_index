The full Bench of the Supreme Court accepted the accused's  bail plea. The Bench was composed of acting Chief Justice  Shafiul Rehman, Justice Abdulqadir Chowdhery, and Justice Ghani  Mohammed. The suspect Asima was accused of trying to smuggle two  kilograms of heroin in London and was arrested at Heathrow  airport. She was returned to Pakistan and the Pakistan Narcotics  Control Board had taken her into custody. The accused was sent  to jail where she later spent 10 months and 18 days. Her appeal  for bail was refused by various courts before it. However, the  Supreme Court because of her gender has released her on a bail  of 100,000 rupees. Two other persons, Matlub Hussein and Ziaul  Din, were also arrested when Asima had fingered them. They have  been jailed. Ilias Siddiqi represented Asima in the bail  proceedings and Attorney General Mumtaz Ali argued on behalf of  the government.</p>

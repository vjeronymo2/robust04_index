			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Yavlyanskiy report: "The Russian Premier Is a Little </F> Tired but Right on Form"]    [Text] Bonn -- Viktor Chernomyrdin, a patient at the  university clinic in Mainz, southern Germany, held a news  conference Tuesday. The Russian head of government was wearing  not a hospital gown but a severe suit. He looked somewhat  tired, but he was right on form.    The prime minister said that he had come to Germany on an  unofficial, private visit in order to consult local medics on a  kidney stone [kamenno-pochechnyy] disorder. "The diagnosis has  already been made in Russia, but I would like to have a second  opinion."    Professor Rudolf Khoyenfellner, under whose direction  medical  tests were conducted, refused to go into medical details: "We  are obliged to observe medical confidentiality. There are no  grounds now for breaking this rule. We regard illness as a  personal problem."    [Yavlyanskiy] Is this an ordinary case of kidney stone  disease?    [Khoyenfellner] Stones are, in general, something abnormal.  Although we do frequently encounter this ailment. It is just  that in this case we are dealing with a somewhat unusual form of  the disorder.    Questions to Chernomyrdin:    [Unidentified journalist] What is of most concern to you  now, taking a global view of the world?    [Chernomyrdin] Affairs in Russia. Our country is going  through a difficult period. Much depends on the government for  which I am responsible. We are now proposing a number of  additional measures to accelerate the reforms. I am in no doubt  that a turning point will come. I am taking the opportunity to  work here as well. One of the chief issues is to attract  foreign investments.    [Unidentified journalist] Are you planning to pay an  official visit to Germany this year?    [Chernomyrdin] To be honest, both countries need such  contacts. There are plans for such a trip. But it has not yet  been decided exactly when.    [Unidentified journalist] It is said that you are writing  your memoirs and intend to publish them in Germany....    [Chernomyrdin] I have already answered this question in  Krasnodar recently. I am not writing anything. I am not in the  mood for these things now. I am no writer. I do not regard  myself as one. That is not even in my thoughts. It is  incredible! Does this mean that people are saying I traveled  south to write my memoirs? In fact I spent three days sitting  in a helicopter, dashing about the region.    [Unidentified journalist] What if you are offered an  operation?    [Chernomyrdin] It is not very complex, the way I understand  it. We will get it done here and complete the treatment in  Russia.</p>

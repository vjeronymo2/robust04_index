			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: US officials talk tough - off the record US OFFICIALS, like their counterparts everywhere, speak differently depending on whether they are on or off the record. This has been more than usually so in briefings on US hopes for the Group of Seven industrial nations' summit in Tokyo this week. Speaking for publication, and identifiable by name, President Bill Clinton and senior administration members are bullish about both the economic and political debate in Tokyo. The president, in his interview with foreign correspondents last Friday, had little doubt that the G7 could still serve a valuable problem-solving purpose under US example and leadership. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, was more colloquial. Economic summits, he said, 'usually don't bring surprises and if they do something's wrong'. But he followed deflation with inflation. At Tokyo, he said, 'there is something of a surprise and it is a pleasant one because economics is actually at the top of the agenda again - and it's pocketbook economics - jobs, growth and trade.' Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, trots off the economic agenda, including aid to Russia, before waxing eloquent about the symbolic and practical significance of the fact that Mr Clinton's first foreign trip outside North America is to Asia. For the record, US officials emphasise how much of a leadership role the US has played since Mr Clinton took office - in finally meeting the long-standing demands of its G7 partners that it do something about its budget deficit and in putting together the assistance package for Russia. All subscribe to the importance of reaching a Uruguay Round trade agreement by the end of the year, without raising hopes for Tokyo. All are equally circumspect about the bilateral negotiations with Japan. Mr Bentsen talks about 'an outside chance' of a breakthrough in Tokyo, while Mr Christopher, a shade tougher but also further removed from the talks, points out that Mr Miyazawa 'is acting for the Japanese government' and thus technically not yet without authority. However, off the record, the language is less diplomatic. US officials see the attack by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, on US anti-dumping levies on steel as egregious and ignorant and French policies generally as a serious threat to any hopes for the Uruguay Round. Mr Balladur, who is absenting himself from Tokyo, was described by one senior official as an outright protectionist and obstructionist, out of the ordinary even by French standards. Nor is there any sympathy for the EC's latest stand on trade in textiles, a simmering issue but not one the US had thought could block the round. However, there remain hopes of sufficient accord between US and EC positions to make some form of market access agreement feasible. Mr Clinton declines to criticise the monetary policies of the Bundesbank, because it is an independent central bank. But other officials will go to Tokyo with charts pointing out how much growth can be generated in the US economy by each basis point reduction in interest rates, presumably with a view to suggesting that Germany is not so different from the US that the same results cannot be achieved. Officials can be caustic in private about Japan, too, reflecting the constant see-saw battle inside the administration between the Japan-bashers and those seeking more creative engagement. Last week, out of deference to Japan's political uncertainty, the US postponed retaliatory sanctions against Japanese discrimination against foreign construction contractors. But there was no evidence of any weakening of the US view that its proposed new framework for negotiations, which includes voluntary numerical targets for import penetration and reduction of the Japanese current account surplus, was reasonable. Perhaps the bleakest Tokyo prospect of all - and about the only one which ever causes the name of Britain to pass the lips of US officials - concerns Bosnia. All Mr Christopher would say, on the record, was 'I don't have any idea what the political communique will say with respect to that.' Mr Clinton's advice is not to pay too much attention to whatever is in the summit communiques, mostly drafted in advance. He professes no interest in summit formalities - communiques and dinners. He wants a proper talking shop, on or off the record.</p>

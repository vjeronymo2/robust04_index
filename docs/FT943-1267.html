			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Italy's most distinguished stationery products now available in the UK IN ITALY, a country renowned for its paper and stationery, Pineider is the most distinguished name of all. No young person de buona famiglia is launched upon the world without a set of beautifully engraved visiting cards, each one interleaved with tissue paper, from Pineider. In good bourgeois and aristocratic homes a leather-bound visitors' book from Pineider sits upon a console table. The Pope has bought all the Papal stationery from Pineider almost since the very beginning (1774). Pineider was started in Florence, an essential stopping-off point in the Grand Tour. In those pre-telephonic days fine writing paper, inks and pens, mattered. People of distinction bought them at Pineider. Most of the range can be seen and bought at The Mirabilia Italiae at 16 Royal Arcade, Old Bond Street, London W1 - look for the beautiful visitors' books, the photographic albums, the stationery, the cards. The famous engraving service will start in about a fortnight.</p>

Virgin Classics VCD7 59305-2 (two CDs) THIS year's new wave of Britten opera recordings amounts to a gramophone event of considerable magnitude. In the last few months four have been released; two of these offer works previously unrecorded - that is to say, works excluded from the great 'Britten conducts Britten' series undertaken by Decca during the composer's lifetime. Seventeen years after Britten's death, Gloriana and the Beggar's Opera arrangement arrive on disc for the first time, and the third recorded Peter Grimes and second Midusmmer Night's Dream demand shelf-space alongside his own unforgettable versions. Comparisons can be essayed with the 'second generation' of Britten opera productions recently nurtured on our and other stages. New dramatic insights stir listeners' and viewers' responses freshly; the stature of the operas themselves is thereby confirmed. Argo's Gloriana is the big deal here. This was the 1953 Coronation opera, whose gala opening night now secures itself a place on every list of Legendary Operatic Disasters: the gathering of royals, diplomats and toffs proved unappreciative, to put it mildly, of the work's serious aspects, above all its warts-and-all presentation of the aged Elizabeth I. Thereafter Gloriana was neglected for a decade; in 1966 a celebrated Sadler's Wells production nobly commenced the business of reclamation. (A Virgin Classics video preserves its 1984 ENO revival.) The new recording, brilliantly dramatic, passionately committed, will surely take the process a good deal nearer completion. Doubts about Britten's achievement may remain. One may question his overall success in meshing 'public' worlds (ceremonial grand-operatic scenes a la Meyerbeer, national-opera focal emphases learned from Boris Godunov) and 'private' (the intense, uncomfortable, deeply characterised relationship of Elizabeth and Essex). Imaginatively as the pastiche touches are applied, certain local-colour elements continue to suggest not altogether flattering parallels with British and Hollywood historical-epic films of the same period. But on records, at least in so invigoratingly muscular reading as Welsh National Opera's under Charles Mackerras, the music displays a compensating breadth of canvas and distinctness of sound-world that seal up all possible cracks in the dramatic edifice. Re-discovery of the Gloriana sound-world brings with it revelation. The brassy fanfares - harmonically teasing, razzle-dazzle yet worlds away from the externalised swagger of William Walton's coronation music of the same period - lend extraordinary psychological resonance to Britten's celebration of Elizabethan royalty past and (as it was in 1953) present. The subtle, disturbing commentary of wind and percussion regularly deepens passages of genteel verbiage in William Plomer's libretto. Britten's Elizabeth, a superb creation, calls forth a superb response from Josephine Barstow. He wrote it for Joan Cross, a great singer at the end of her career; had he done so for this latest incumbent, a soprano in full possession of a thrillingly secure top register, he would no doubt have exercised less caution in the placing of high notes. When Barstow takes the part for the first time in the theatre (as she is shortly to do for Opera North) the point of those difficult final speech-passages will surely be made clearer. Everything else in the role - grandeur, dry wit, flirtatiousness, brutal malice, generosity, tremors of uncertainty, largeness of vision - is already brilliantly in place. Around her Argo has arrayed a superb cast, hardly to be faulted, with the luxury of several big names of British opera (Bryn Terfel, Willard White, John Mark Ainsley, Janice Watson) in tiny parts. Philip Langridge, less mellifluous than Rolfe Johnson in the ENO/Virgin video performance, catches all the energy and attractiveness of Essex, impetuous, immature, delicate by turns. Alan Opie's immaculately finished cameo of the courtier Cecil demands special mention. The WNO Chorus covers itself in glory. In sum I declare this one of the 'must-buy' opera sets of 1993. I would not place Argo's Beggar's Opera in the same category. With some disappointment I wrote of the 1948 Britten version - no mere orchestral enlargement but a thorough-going re-invention - when reviewing in these columns the 1992 Aldeburgh Festival performance forming the basis of this recording. In the Snape Maltings its artful underpinnings and other echt-Britten felicities took one a long way from the scabrous vitality of Gay's original conception. On records, however, many incidental pleasures come to enrich the impression. With the exception of John Rawnsley's Lockit, the distinguished Aldeburgh cast still seems to me too mild-mannered - and that includes Langridge's expertly delivered Macheath. I can deal with both the EMI Grimes and Virgin Dream more summarily. Both preserve individual performances of the highest stature - Felicity Lott's gentle, beautifully sung Ellen in the first, James Bowman's glittering Oberon and Donald Maxwell's uproarious Bottom in the second. Both give vivid, theatre-oriented accounts of the operas in question. Neither achieves the thorough-going impact of its predecessors on disc. The fact that Rolfe Johnson (Grimes) and Thomas Allen (Balstrode) tried their roles out first in the studio, not on stage, comes through with surprising regularity: one expects a good deal more 'personal' shading from both. In the theatre Haitink can be a Grimes conductor of rare solidity and long-lined viewpoint, but here his strengths do not quite add up to a cogent whole.</p>

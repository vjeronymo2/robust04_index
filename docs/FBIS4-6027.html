			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said Monday that North Korea would not defy world opinion as  expressed in a recent statement by the U.N. Security Council  president, nor would it dare any military provocations in the  face of joint South Korean- U.S. security arrangements.    Addressing the opening session of the 43rd annual conference  of the Pacific-Asia Travel Association [PATA] at the Korea  exhibition center, Kim predicted South Korea would join the  family of developed nations "as a new member before the 20th  century is out," stressing the country's march "into a better  tomorrow will never falter."    "The Korean people are full of confidence and energy despite  North Korea's nuclear arms development and its capacity for all  other kinds of irrational behavior," he added.    Welcoming delegates from 40 countries, Kim noted the  Asia-Pacific is taking center stage: "Nations in this region are  now pulling together to forge an era of concord and cooperation,  putting to rest their past enmity and confrontation. In  response, the Republic of Korea has also been striving to  promote the shared prosperity of this part of the world, working  especially through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  forum.    "The Republic of Korea has realized almost miraculous  development and has overcome numerous adversities stemming in  particular from the tragic partitioning of its land. In a  single generation, it has managed to turn itself into an Asian  model of democracy and a market economy. Especially since I  took office, our country has wiped out the vestiges of our dark  past while... promoting internationalization... and creating a  society free of misconduct and corruption, a healthy society in  which freedom and justice flourish. Our economy is regaining  vitality, and a new dynamism is pervading all sectors of  society."    Kim, saying tourism is helping to narrow the economic gap  between developed and developing nations by promoting  cooperation, expressed hope that the Seoul PATA conference would  provide "a major impetus to international cooperation to  underpin this new era of openness, as well as open up new  horizons for the travel industry in the 21st century."</p>

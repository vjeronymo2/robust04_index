			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar continues to advance THE DOLLAR stayed firm in quiet foreign exchange trading yesterday. Many European centres were closed for Ascension Day and there were no important economic factors. Immediate reaction was muted to news that US President George Bush is to undergo medical treatment for his heart condition. New applications for US unemployment benefit gave some encouragement that the economy is moving out of recession, with the number of claims falling to a seasonally adjusted 455,000 in the week to April 27, down 45,000 from the previous week's 500,000. The next important news is likely to be today's US producer price index, but this is not expected to show much change, with the year-on-year wholesale inflation rate possibly rising to 3.2 from 3.1 per cent. Excluding food and energy the annual rise is expected to be unchanged at 3.7 per cent. At the London close the dollar had climbed to DM1.7430 from DM1.7330; to Y139.25 from Y138.30; to SFr1.4725 from SFr1.4655; and to FFr5.8925 from FFr5.8650. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index was up 0.5 at 66.7. Sterling was weaker as the market waited for next week's UK retail price index. Wholesale interest rates in London continued to discount a cut of  1/2 point in bank base rates, although the Bank of England tried to dampen any enthusiasm about lower rates by keeping conditions tight on the domestic money market. Large losses by the ruling UK Conservative party in last week's local government elections may have reduced some of the pound's political risk. It had been assumed that the local elections all but ended any chance of a general election before the autumn, although Mr John Cope, Tory deputy chairman, speaking in south Wales, said the government has not ruled out the possibility of going to the country in June. The result of next Thursday's by-election in Monmouth is likely to be a factor deciding the timing of an election, according to Mr Cope. Sterling fell 1.40 cents to Dollars 1.7040. It also declined to DM2.9700 from DM2.9775; to FFr10.0400 from FFr10.0750; to SFr2.5100 from SFr2.5175; and to Y237.25 from Y237.50. The pound's index lost 0.3 to 91.5. Sterling rebounded 1.50 cents in New York to end at Dollars 1.7190. In the European exchange rate mechanism, trading was very quiet because of the Ascension Day holiday. Sterling remained the third strongest member of the system, below the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira. Milan was open for trading, with the Bank of Italy buying DM90m as the lira rose against the D-Mark at the fixing. The German unit eased to L739.75 from L740.23, prompting the first intervention to buy D-Marks by the Bank of Italy at any fixing since April 19. The D-Mark remained among the weaker members of the ERM, but firmed slightly to Y79.90 from Y79.80.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Old formula returns to Donington's circuit LEICESTERSHIRE entrepreneur Mr Bernard 'Tom' Wheatcroft, 70, is listening this weekend to music which, at times, he feared he would never hear. It is the sound of an entire Formula One motor racing pack baying around Donington Park, the motor racing circuit near Leicester which he bought 22 years ago. Since then he has battled - until this year unsuccessfully - to stage a round of the grand prix world championship there. Mr Wheatcroft, a tough, no-nonsense businessman whose fortune was founded on property development, is first to acknowledge that there is a strong commercial incentive to stage a grand prix. There are expected to be 130,000 spectators at the track, each paying Pounds 55-Pounds 120 for the grand prix itself tomorrow. Several thousand more have been camped out for the past two days of practice. There are millions to be made from corporate hospitality and other catering, clothing and other trappings of motor racing. But, for Mr Wheatcroft, the money really does rank a distant second. He has difficulty expressing his satisfaction that grand prix cars are again racing at Donington, nearly 60 years after the echoes of its last grand prix  -fought out between Mercedes and Auto-Union in 1938 - were drowned out by the onset of war. Mr Wheatcroft, a motor racing devotee since childhood, had cycled to the track to watch them. He has fought against the entrenched interests of the rival circuit, Silverstone, and grand prix racing's organisers to achieve his goal. Five times in the past he has been promised a grand prix but it has slipped through his fingers. In the mid-1980s his campaign appeared to have failed for good. The world governing body of motor sport decreed than that there should be only one grand prix per country. The idea of a 'European' grand prix, which had allowed Brands Hatch to stage a race as well, was scrapped. His sophistic attempt to stage an 'Irish' grand prix in England also failed. Now, Donington's grand prix, again entitled 'European', results from the cancellation of the Asian grand prix scheduled for Japan. But with more than Pounds 500,000 spent on improvements at the circuit and more than Pounds 4m spent altogether Mr Wheatcroft will not willingly see Donington dropped from the calendar. Rather, he wants to wrest the British grand prix from Silverstone when the latter's contractual title to it ends in 1996. It is not only opponents within motor sport whom Mr Wheatcroft has fought. He had a series of battles with local authorities to rebuild the circuit. And, in recent weeks, he had to fight again. This time the battle was to get the Leicestershire County Council's planning and recreation committee to reverse its refusal to let him stage this weekend's race, because it opposed, on proclaimed environmental grounds, the holding of two grands prix in a year. The circuit already stages the British motorcycle grand prix. The resistance mystified Mr Wheatcroft, because both district councils surrounding the circuit backed the grand prix, and neither police nor adjoining Derbyshire County Council raised objections. In a region of the Midlands with high unemployment calculations that the grand prix will pump nearly Pounds 5m into the local economy appear to have helped win the day. This weekend the circuit's permanent staff of 11 will be swelled to a temporary one of more than 700.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOUTON STILL HAVING A BALL  </P> <P> Jim Bouton, perennial pariah of Major League Baseball, arrives at semipro  Bassanio Field wearing a bemused grin above his orange tank top, baseball  pants, socks and spikes. In his right hand is a plastic box containing a newly  passed kidney stone -- his career 20th. His teammates on the Little Ferry  Giants crowd around him to mock and gawk.  </P> <P> "It's a macho thing to them," says Bouton, 51, who will pitch tonight. "They  think I'm real tough."  </P> <P> In the cinder-block dugout, Bouton files his fingernails to get a better grip  when he tosses his trademark knuckle ball, a hard-to-control pitch that  flutters, dives and wiggles its way to home plate.  </P> <P> Yes, sports literature devotees, this is the former New York Yankee and Seattle  Pilot, who gave the baseball establishment the heebie-jeebies 20 years ago with  his book, "Ball Four," a diary that dared to say players drank, took pep pills  and philandered.  </P> <P> Newly reissued in a 20th anniversary edition, "Ball Four" is about as old as  Bouton's semipro teammates, most of whom haven't even read it. "It's an  American classic that we're introducing to a new generation," Macmillan senior  editor Rick Wolff, says of the book, which sold almost five million copies in  hardcover and paperback.  </P> <P> Bouton, blond hair flecked with gray and leaner than in his major-league  playing days, pitches in the New Jersey Metropolitan League for fun and no  money, enjoying the pitcher-batter confrontation and the camaraderie of  teammates 25 to 30 years his junior. Several say they hope to play as well when  they approach the state of Bouton's codgerhood.  </P> <P> "This is the closest I've ever been to being one of the boys, even though I'm  older than all of them and we go our separate ways when we leave the field,"  says Bouton, a lifelong outsider who rarely felt he fit in with his childhood  friends and Major League Baseball teammates.  </P> <P> "Ball Four" -- for which he scribbled notes by day and tape recorded by night  -- forever stamped him an outcast and secured his two-sided reputation. To some  he was an irreverent pitcher-turned-rabble-rousing author. But to baseball's  reigning powers, Bouton's sharp-eyed diary of his 1969 season with the Houston  Astros and a short-lived and dreadful expansion team called the Seattle Pilots  -- established him as a flake-turned-traitor.  </P> <P> "Everybody thought I was writing a regular sports book," says Bouton. "They  didn't realize I was writing about things like an argument between catcher  Merritt Ranew and pitcher Fred Talbot in the bullpen about which part of the  South was dumber." The memory still tickles Bouton into compulsive laughter.  "Nobody had better material to write than I did."  </P> <P> The scandalous bits -- about night forays to hotel roofs to spy on women as  they undressed, Mickey Mantle hitting a home run while hung over, and absurdist  contract talks with miserly team officials over tiny sums -- seem tame now and  are only small parts of the book. But in 1970, they gave the conservative  baseball establishment severe agita.  </P> <P> After the first excerpt from "Ball Four" appeared in Look magazine in June,  1970, then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn reprimanded Bouton, demanded that he  renounce his book and asked him to sign a pledge that he would never write  about baseball as long as he remained a player. Bouton refused.  </P> <P> "What a dweeb," Bouton says, recounting the meeting with Kuhn.  </P> <P> Former Yankee pitcher Whitey Ford, Bouton's teammate for six seasons, angers at  the mention of "Ball Four," which said Ford made baseballs dance eccentrically  by nicking them with his wedding ring or having his catcher rub them with mud.  The catcher, Elston Howard, later said angrily that he performed the same  service for Bouton.  </P> <P> "Is 'Ball Four' what you want to talk about?" Ford asks. "Well, I didn't read  the book. I don't like the man who wrote it. That's all I have to say."  </P> <P> The years after "Ball Four" saw an explosion of tell-all star memoirs, many of  them revealing far more about players' off-the-field exploits than anything  Bouton revealed. But none of the descendants, including best-selling  eyebrow-raisers like ex-Yankee Sparky Lyle's "The Bronx Zoo," quarterback Jim  McMahon's "McMahon!" and former Seattle Seahawk linebacker Brian Bosworth's  "The Boz" -- have had "Ball Four's" bemused vantage point.  </P> <P> David Halberstam, an early fan of "Ball Four" and the author of the  best-selling baseball book "The Summer of '49," says it was a "breakthrough in  iconoclasm. Here was an unconventional guy who had the chutzpah to point out  that the gods had the gall to do ungodlike things."  </P> <P> Bouton left baseball soon after the book's publication. The Astros had sent him  to their minor league team in Oklahoma City, effectively ending his career.  </P> <P> Within weeks, Bouton left the minors and became a broadcaster in New York City  with the local ABC and CBS affiliates, but the pariah found his true niche in  oddball baseball-related businesses.  </P> <P> Big League Chew, strips of gum packaged like chewing tobacco, has been his  biggest hit. It was devised by Rob Nelson, his free-spirited teammate on the  minor-league Portland, Ore., Mavericks in 1978, when Bouton launched a comeback  that landed him briefly on the Atlanta Braves. Bouton and Nelson licensed Big  League Chew to William Wrigley Co. in a deal that nets the two an annual  six-figure royalty income.  </P> <P> Bouton extended Big League into ice cream in April when Good Humor created Big  League Ice Cream -- a chocolate-covered vanilla pop on sticks shaped like  baseball bats with 26 different players' autographs.  </P> <P> Bouton also gives motivational talks, urging businessmen to enjoy their jobs.  "Forget the money, the bottom line, the sales figures," he preaches. "When you  concentrate on the fun, you reach the goals more often."  </P> <P> But this is not a night of rapturous fun on the mound for Bouton. Another  kidney stone is apparently coursing through his system, and muscle spasms are  making his knuckle ball do things even a knuckler shouldn't do. Manager Joe  Stauffer Jr. yanks him in the fifth inning. "Sorry, Joe, I just didn't have it  tonight," Bouton says.  </P> <P> Most nights he still does have it, almost as much of it as he had in two glory  years as a Yankee. Despite a total of 39 wins in 1963 and 1964 and two World  Series victories, he has never been invited to the annual Old Timers Day  celebrations at Yankee Stadium, or, for that matter, any official baseball  event.  </P> <P> Even Bouton's attempt to gain favor with Kuhn's successor, Peter Ueberroth,  went unanswered.  </P> <P> "When Ueberroth became commissioner," he says, "I sent him an autographed copy  of 'Ball Four' with a note saying, 'Here's a book the previous commissioner  didn't enjoy, but you might get a kick out of it.' He never sent me a thank-you  note. No secretary called. Nothing.  </P> <P> "I tried." the outsider laughs. "I really tried."  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Burundi's president concedes defeat PRESIDENT Pierre Buyoya, unexpectedly defeated in Burundi's first democratic election, congratulated his victorious opponent, Mr Melchior Ndadaye, yesterday and urged the country to accept the result, Reuter reports from Bujumbura. 'You have just chosen your president, who will lead Burundi for the next five years,' Mr Buyoya said in a statement read on state radio. 'As I said before embarking on the race, I undertook to bow before the verdict of the people. That is the rule of democracy.' Official provisional results gave Mr Ndadaye, a 40-year-old banker, 60 per cent of the vote, confounding forecasts that Mr Buyoya would win by a similar margin to extend the presidency he seized in a bloodless coup in 1987. Mr Ndadaye is from the majority Hutu tribe, which has been governed for decades by the Tutsi minority, of which Mr Buyoya is a member. It was the first democratic election in the central African state since independence from Belgium in 1962. The history of the state since independence has been marred by the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people, mostly Hutu killed for challenging their Tutsi masters.</p>

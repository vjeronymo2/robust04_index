Choe Pong-su, vice chairman of the Korean External Economic  Committee; Yi Sun-myon, Korean vice minister of mining industry;  Qiao Zonghuai, Chinese ambassador to Korea; and commercial  attaches of foreign embassies in Pyongyang attended the  inaugural reception today.    In his speech, Chang Gaiming, vice president of the China  Mining Group, said: In recent years, along with the development  and changes in the international trade situation, the China  Mining Group has forged closer economic and trade ties with  Korea. As a result, the previous unitary transaction for  accounts has been gradually replaced by more flexible and  diversified trade forms such as spot exchange trade, counter  trade, entrepot trade, and barter trade between the two sides.  He expressed the belief that there are bright prospects for  cooperation in trade between the Mining Group and Korea.    Speaking at the reception, Kong Kang-su, vice president of  Korea's Nonferrous Metal Export and Import Corporation, said:  The inauguration of the China Mining Group's Pyongyang office  symbolizes a crystallization of the blood-sealed friendship and  trust, as well as the inalienable friendship between the Korean  and Chinese peoples. He pledged to broaden and develop trade  relations between the two firms.</p>

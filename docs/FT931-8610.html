			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities talks continue CONTROL Securities, the property, brewing and hotels group which is currently negotiating a refinancing deal with its banks, will today announce interim results up to the end of last September. It will also call an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to ask authority for the board to continue negotiations with banks and credit-ors. The group had hoped to be able to agree terms of the refinancing by the end of this month and put them to shareholders. However, negotiations appear to be taking longer than expected, although people involv-ed stressed this was not necessarily a bad sign. The shares have been suspended since October 1991, when the group's offices were raided by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with the investigation into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Control was not under investigation, but Mr Nazmu Virani, its former chairman and chief executive, was arrested in March last year in connection with BCCI. Control also said yesterday that the liquidators of BCCI now controlled, and would be able to vote, 14.9 per cent of Control shares. BCCI had had a 5.2 per cent stake in Control and other holdings totalling 9.7 per cent had been pledged to the bank. Some of these other shares are understood to have been owned by the Virani family.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Mortgage loans down 19% to Pounds 26bn last year MORTGAGE LENDING fell sharply last year, the Council for Mortgage Lenders, the industry's trade association, reported yesterday. Total net mortgage lending dropped to Pounds 26.12bn, down by 19 per cent on the Pounds 32.12bn total for the industry in 1990. The mortgage market is now only about two thirds of the size it reached at the height of the mortgage boom in 1988, when net lending was Pounds 40bn. One group of lenders, the insurance companies, has practically withdrawn from the market since 1988. For the past three years, there has been a net drop in their lending each year. Last year their lending fell by Pounds 860m, compared with a fall of Pounds 307m in 1990. Centralised lenders - the specialist mortgage companies that entered the market in the late 1980s - are still in the market, but their lending last year of Pounds 1.5bn was far below the peak of Pounds 5bn reached in 1988. There was a fall of more than 20 per cent from 1990. The decline in the mortgage market since 1988 has helped building societies to regain the market dominance they came close to losing in late 1987. Last year their total net lending was Pounds 20.56bn, 78 per cent of the market. Building society lending, which defied the market trend in 1989 and 1990 by growing steadily, last year declined for the first time because of the recession and bad debts. Building society net lending of Pounds 20.56bn last year was 15 per cent down on 1990, when it reached a peak of Pounds 24.2bn. The societies approved 661,000 loan applications last year, a decline of 8 per cent from 1990 and far below the 1.2m applications approved in 1988. In spite of the general gloom in the market, the total volume of mortgage lending has continued to increase. Mortgage loans outstanding at the end of last year were Pounds 320.1bn, 9 per cent up from Pounds 293.4bn a year earlier. Outstanding mortgage balances in the UK grew by 1.8 per cent during the fourth quarter of the year.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO NEWS;  </P> <P> NEW RELEASES;  </P> <P> MOVIES  </P> <P> Fans of old movie serials are going to consider it Confucian wisdom and campy  fun. Asian-Americans concerned with stereotyped images may say it's pretty  dumb. In any case, Key Video is releasing seven Charlie Chan movies from  1935-1942 this week. "Charlie Chan in Paris," "Charlie Chan at the Opera" and  "Charlie Chan's Secret" star Warner Oland as the sly sleuth; "Charlie Chan at  the Wax Museum," "Murder Over New York," "Charlie Chan in Rio" and "Castle in  the Desert" have Sidney Toler in the lead role. Each $19.98 tape comes with a  dossier listing the crime, suspects, motives and clues.  </P> <P> Turning to much more recent film works, "The Good Mother" (Touchstone, $89.95,  R) stars Diane Keaton as a woman whose suitability to raise her six-year-old is  challenged by her ex-husband when she begins a relationship with a  free-spirited artist. Based on Sue Miller's novel, the 106-minute drama was  directed by Leonard Nimoy.  </P> <P> And then there's "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" (New World, $89.95, PG-13), who  may be unsuitable both as a mother and as a movie star -- if you believe some  of the reviews TV's horror-film hostess got for her own first excursion into  cinema. However, fans of the character (played with bouncy wit by Cassandra  Peterson) may enjoy this campy comedy.  </P> <P> No one seemed to enjoy "Caddy shack II" (Warner, $89.95, PG) when this  country-club-spoof sequel drove into theaters last year. While the alternately  kooky and charming original was widely underrated, "II" deserved the  shellacking it received. Among the missing this time around: Bill Murray,  Rodney Dangerfield, laughs.  </P> <P> Also high on some worst-of-the-year lists was "Tiger Warsaw" (Sony, $89.95, R),  a Patrick Swayze-starring action film about a troubled Vietnam vet. "Tiger"  literally did less than 1/100 the box-office business of Swayze's "Dirty  Dancing."  </P> <P> Art-house film of the week: "Pascali's Island" (IVE, $89.95, PG-13), a mystery  about a romantic triangle and deception on an Aegean island; the notable cast  includes Ben Kingsley ("Gandhi"), Helen Mirren ("The Mosquito Coast") and  Charles Dance ("White Mischief").  </P> <P> Other Videos  </P> <P> Those "sports fans" who subscribe to a certain magazine mainly for its annual  swimsuit issue will be delighted to learn that the first video version of same  will be in stores this weekend. "Sports Illustrated's 25th Anniversary Swimsuit  Video" (HBO, $19.99) flaunts 55 minutes of models being selected, prepared and  shot -- including former subjects like Christie Brinkley and Cheryl Tiegs.  </P> <P> Sports fans who prefer sports may opt for Media's two tapes about this year's  Super Bowl contestants, the champion San Francisco 49ers ("Team of the Decade,"  $19.95) and the Cincinnati Bengals ("Stars in Stripes," $19.95).  </P> <P> "Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies" (J2, $59.95) struts out 34 of the late  bandleader's numbers, played by his orchestra (Mercer Ellington conducts). And  for the kids Children's Circle has "Happy Birthday, Moon and Other Stories for  Young Children" (four brief stories for ages two through six) and "The  Mysterious Tadpole and Other Stories" (four stories for ages three through  eight), 35 minutes and $22.50 each.

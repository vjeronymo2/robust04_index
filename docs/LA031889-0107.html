			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICANS SPOKE THEIR MINDS IN 4-DAY 'SUMMIT' AT THE VATICAN;  </P> <P> LACK OF CLOUT IN VATICAN PUTS U.S. CHURCH AT A DISADVANTAGE  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II excused himself briefly from a meeting last week with  American archbishops to accept the credentials of the new Ethiopian ambassador  to the Holy See, and to deliver a 3,000-word speech of encouragement to six  visiting Chilean bishops.  </P> <P> During John Paul's four days with the Americans, the gigantic institution he  heads announced a major economic reform package and proclaimed a breakthrough  for religious freedom in Lithuania. As the American bishops headed home, the  Pope met with 7,000 relatives of Italian missionaries and visited a Roman  parish. While the returning American prelates prepared for a press conference  in Washington, he was receiving bishops from Burkina Faso and Brazil.  </P> <P> As the papal focus shifts away from the extraordinary meeting with American  church leaders, it is left to the Vatican bureaucracy to follow up on the  issues. Veteran Vatican observers say that over the next few months the  church's Curia, or administrative arm, will seek to accentuate trends already  under way to assert greater central authority over the maverick Americans.  </P> <P> Some Curia moves will be apparent and others unseen, the observers believe, but  all will come in the context of the way the Vatican views the  independent-minded American church.  </P> <P> As seen by the European-dominated Curia, the church in the United States is  both wealthy and important -- often lamentably so -- as an international trend  setter. It is, to be sure, large, with 53 million members. But it is also  small: It amounts to only 6% of the world's Catholics.  </P> <P> In asserting its positions against Vatican traditions of patient jockeying and  unwavering respect for hierarchical authority, the observers say, the American  church will be at a disadvantage because of its disproportionately weak clout  at the Vatican.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Power  </P> <P> One ailing American cardinal heads the Vatican equivalent of a ministry. Three  American bishops direct lesser dependencies, but the most powerful among them,  the head of the Vatican banks, is being ousted.  </P> <P> The scarcity of Americans within the Curia to translate the peculiarities of  their outspoken countrymen to the glacial Vatican bureaucracy contributes to  the mutual cultural incomprehension that was the hallmark of the summit, the  observers believe.  </P> <P> "America is a 'marketplace society' where ideas have to sell themselves on an  intrinsic merit. That this would conflict at times with the hierarchical nature  of the church is not surprising," noted St. Louis Archbishop John L. May,  president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.  </P> <P> In the aftermath, issues that triggered brotherly differences of opinion at the  meeting will likely be the focus of Vatican housekeeping initiatives, the  observers believe. The sources, who requested anonymity, expect the Vatican to  seek:  </P> <P> * A more rigorous selection of American bishops to assure support for basic  doctrines such as the Vatican ban on contraception. The Vatican believes that  some of the current bishops may be better administrators than pastors. It is  also concerned about what it considers the theological inadequacy of some of  them. Although cardinals and bishops are expected to have advanced degrees in  some theological sciences, many American prelates lack them. Theological  expertise will weigh more heavily in a selection of future bishops and  cardinals, the Vatican observers believe.  </P> <P> * A tighter rein on theologians to ensure orthodoxy. Vatican critics blame  iconoclastic Catholic theologians unchecked by their bishops for divisive  crosscurrents within the American church. The Vatican has made clear that it  will not tolerate theological dissent on central issues and expects the bishops  to correct theological aberrations. In recent years, the Vatican believes, some  American bishops have virtually ceded teaching authority to their theologians.  The Vatican wants that stopped. The bishop, above all, says the Pope, must  himself be a teacher and must know what he is talking about.  </P> <P> * Better theological and philosophical preparation in American seminaries.  There is no controversy on this point: Americans and Curia cardinals agree with  professors at church universities here and in the United States that American  seminarians are generally far behind their European peers in philosophical  preparation.  </P> <P> * A slowdown in the granting of marriage annulments. American marriage  tribunals grant about 75% of the annulments worldwide, a figure that sticks in  the craw of a Curia foursquare behind the indissolubility of marriage. The  American bishops vigorously defended their tribunals at the summit but in the  process invited greater Vatican inspection of their operations.  </P> <P> If he is distressed by some of what he finds in the American church, and by the  materialistic society in which it preaches, there is also a lot that John Paul  admires about the dynamism of American Catholicism.  </P> <P> Still, it is but one church among many churches in a global constituency of 850  million Catholics. And, as Vatican loyalists are quick to note, John Paul has  equal responsibility for all of the churches, and all of the people. Indeed,  one of the most challenging parts of the Pope's job is that he must teach  different things to different peoples with equal authority.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unyielding Preacher  </P> <P> For some Americans and Europeans, John Paul may seem principally a stern  disciplinarian, a moralist supreme and an unyielding preacher of unpopular  doctrines. Simultaneously, though, he is an outspoken crusader, the poor man's  friend who demands decent living standards for African peasants, social justice  for Brazilian slum dwellers, with freedom of worship for Lithuanian  shipbuilders, and an end to racism everywhere.  </P> <P> That this Polish Pope of all the Catholics has reservations about some  practices of the American church, so rich, so free, is more predictable than  exceptional; so, too, that the bishop of Rome and the heir of St. Peter will  strive relentlessly to put his house in the order he prescribes.  </P></p>

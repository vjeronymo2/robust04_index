			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ANDREW YOUNG BIG ON YULE CARDS  </P> <P> Christmas is a special time, a time when one politician can spend tax money  sending special holiday greetings, and another politician can complain about  it.  </P> <P> Mayor Andrew Young sent jumbo Christmas cards this year to 1,500 area  reporters, ministers, supporters and public officials, including Lt. Gov. Zell  Miller -- who just happens to be a candidate for governor next year, just like  the mayor.  </P> <P> The 9 by 14 cards, featuring a montage of Atlanta accomplishments, Young's  smiling face and the legend "Municipal Leader of The Year 1989," cost the city  a little more than a dollar each to print, and 65 cents to mail.  </P> <P> "I think it is inappropriate to spend $1 apiece to send a Christmas card out at  the city's expense," Miller said. "If the man is elected governor, what will he  send out in 1991 -- a billboard?"  </P> <P> The response from the Young camp? "What a Scrooge," said press secretary Lee  Echols.  </P></p>

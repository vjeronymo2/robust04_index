			<p>BFN     [Text] In the near future a Northern border district will  be set up in Murmansk. It will include the territories from the  Murmansk region to Chukotka, Governor of the Murmansk region  Yevgeniy Komarov said at a conference in Murmansk dedicated to  protection of Russia's northern borders.    He said that the border service in the Arctic region is  being  restructured, taking into account the development of large-scale  ties between the Russian Federation, Norway and Finland, and the  opening of the Northern sea route for passage of foreign vessels  with stops in Russian ports. Besides, the need for the Northern  border district is dictated by the increased interest of NATO in  Russia's northern borders.</p>

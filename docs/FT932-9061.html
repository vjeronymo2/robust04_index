			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff cash offer recommended THE BOARD of Aberdeen Petroleum yesterday recommended the hostile Pounds 8.7m cash offer from Pittencrieff. It is believed the board decided to capitulate when it became apparent that almost all the institutions had deserted the USM company following Pittencrieff's decision to provide a cash alternative of 17p per share. Pittencrieff's original 2-for-49 share offer valued the shares at about 15p. And yesterday afternoon Pittencrieff announced it had picked up a further 9 per cent of Aberdeen's shares in the market, taking its holding to 48.5 per cent. Aberdeen is still rejecting the all-paper offer. Pittencrieff's shares fell sharply last week following a warning that annual profits would not meet expectations. Aberdeen also announced yesterday that it had sold its 1.75m shares in Aminex, the oil explorer, to Titan Assets for a price understood to be about Pounds 100,000. Earlier this year, Titan had backed Aberdeen's unsuccessful attempt to take over Brabant Resources. The failure of the Brabant bid freed Pittencrieff to make its offer.</p>

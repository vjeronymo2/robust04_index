			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Crown Eyeglass shares see 18p rise Shares of Crown Eyeglass, the USM-quoted maker and retailer of spectacles, yesterday rose 18p to 163p on news of an 80 per cent rise, to Pounds 451,000, in annual pre-tax profits. Turnover for the 12 months to March 29 rose from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 3.99m. The profits took account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 56,000 and interest income of Pounds 2,000 (charge Pounds 62,000). Directors said the latter reflected the elimination of group borrowings. Earnings emerged at 19.4p (11.2p) and a final dividend of 4p makes a 6p (3.5p) total.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL PASSES SECRECY ORDINANCE  </P> <P> After a testy debate, the City Council passed a controversial ordinance Monday  night that would subject council members to $1,000 fines or six-month jail  terms if they disclose any matter discussed in closed sessions.  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 3 to approve Councilman Daniel E. Griset's proposal that  prohibits council members from disclosing any issue discussed in closed session  without authority from the rest of the council.  </P> <P> The ordinance also targets city employees "or any other person present" during  closed council sessions, which are permitted by the state's open-meetings law  only for discussions about personnel or pending litigation. The state law  contains no prohibition against revealing the content of closed meetings.  </P> <P> Councilman Ron May, who voted against the ordinance, said he did not think it  was necessary.  </P> <P> "I feel the public has long been leery and suspicious whenever elected bodies  break for executive session," May said. "I think the feeling is that's where  the real decisions are made. Any ordinance with such stipulations, to me,  increases the mystique of public government. I can't support this."  </P> <P> Griset, however, said the ordinance was "a good proposal" that will help save  taxpayer money by preventing "costly leaks."  </P> <P> Last week, City Atty. Edward J. Cooper presented a memo to council members that  outlined what they could not discuss outside of closed sessions. These items  included pending litigation, labor and personnel matters, applications for city  licenses, purchases and sales of properties and threats to public safety.  </P> <P> The council has been studying Griset's proposal since its June 18 meeting.  </P> <P> Griset said "leaks of information" could cost the city millions of dollars in  contract negotiations or litigation.  </P> <P> During the council's debate Monday night, Councilman Richards L. Norton argued  that Griset's proposal jeopardizes the public's right to know what the council  does in closed sessions.  </P> <P> The council has at least two closed sessions each month -- either before or  after the public portion of the meeting. In the proposed law, those who attend  closed sessions could disclose only the content of discussions with permission  from the majority of the council.  </P> <P> The new ordinance mirrors one in Costa Mesa, the only city in the county that  has such a prohibition. Costa Mesa's ordinance was passed in 1962 and updated  in 1985. LILY ENG and GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

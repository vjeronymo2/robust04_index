			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> McCartney Helps the Homeless: Paul McCartney's concert to help the Bay Area  homeless is doing that already for at least one homeless man -- weeks before  the March 31 performance at UC Berkeley's Memorial Stadium. Janise Jordan,  assistant manager of a local Wherehouse store, said about 20 people were lined  up Saturday hoping to buy tickets, which went on sale Sunday.  </P> <P> One of those in line, she said, was a homeless man who was paid $40 to save a  space in line for someone else wanting to snare tickets, priced at $30 each.  The city of Berkeley has been promised at least $100,000 of the proceeds to  help the local homeless. The university is expected to receive a like amount.  CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

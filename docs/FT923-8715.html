			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television We are promised the sight of dog eating dog in the last of the present series of Antenna (8.00 BBC2). Magazine editor Richard Smith has a go at other journalists for the way in which they present stories about science. He argues that we are becoming increasingly distrustful of science because we are misled by newspapers which make claims such as 'British breakthrough likely to end asthma suffering'. It doesn't help the cause of science too much, of course, when scientists go around claiming to have achieved cold fusion at room temperature, but it is always easier to kick the messenger in the teeth. Smith is editor of the doctors' magazine, the British Medical Journal. Doctors emerge rather badly by all accounts from the C4 programme Secret History (9.00) which describes an experiment in which 400 men died. They thought they were being treated for syphilis but actually the doctors were merely observing the development of the disease. ITV screens the first of three documentaries, China Rising (10.40), about the development of Chinese cities, beginning with Shanghai, once a cosmopolitan highspot.</p>

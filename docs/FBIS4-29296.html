			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Deregulation Package for Investments] </F>   [Text] A new deregulation package was issued by the  government which permits foreign investors to monopolize public  interests. Due to the inability of domestic investors to operate  the foreign investments, some 95 percent of the shares were  permitted to be owned by foreign investors. As such, foreign  investors are permitted to purchase a large portion of shares of  the infrastructure in the public interest in sectors such as  ports, the production and supply of electricity to the public,  railway services, nuclear-powered electricity generating plants  and the mass media.    The deregulation package which was issued is named  Government  Regulation No:20/1994. It was endorsed by President Suharto on  19 May 1994. It was laid down in the regulation that foreign  investments can be made through two methods -- through direct  investments and through joint ventures. Foreign investors are  permitted to own a 95-percent stake if investments are carried  out through joint ventures. As for direct investments, foreign  investors are permitted to own a 100-percent stake and their  investments should be exclusively situated within industrialized  zones.    In short, we fully understand the statement made by Sanyoto  Sastrowardoyo, Minister of State for Investment and Chairman of  the Investment Coordinating Board, who said: "This is a  courageous and big breakthrough [preceding two words in  English]." According to Sanyoto, the foreign investors had been  waiting for such a deregulation package to commence their  operations in Indonesia. The government regulation was in  accordance with Regulation No: 1/1967. But what went wrong? A  group of industrialists, parliamentarians and people doubted  that the new deregulation package would be successful.    For example, Benny Sutrisno observed that the government  could be fully liberal because it could totally absorb the  market economy by making attractive investment offers to foreign  investors, including the public sector. Benny Sutrisno said he  would agree only if such an action was undertaken for the sake  of strengthening the country's economy. Apart from this,  questions were also raised on whether approximations were taken  into consideration on the negative aspect of the deregulation  package. But it was different with Kwik Kian Gie, a  philanthrophist and economist. He was surprised at the  government's decision to make an almost full offer of the public  sectoral activities to foreign investors. He was confused over  the definition of "the people's aspiration for a livelihood."    In fact, segments of the community are still in the dark  over  the government's strategy of offering the industrial sector to  foreign investors. Therefore, it was probable that numerous  persons have a similar opinion to that of Benny Sutrisno. The  opinion was that it was clear that the government was  independent in making the decision, which could prove to be  critical. Those from the elite [preceding word in English]  economic strata would definitely fall victim to this  deregulation package. The public will definitely have to  support the losses. This is considered to be an unfair practise.    Besides, there are those who considered that the  deregulation  package could spark off public anxiety because certain groups  have varying convictions regarding the provisions of the 1945  Constitution -- particularly the conflict which prevails between  the ministers who favored the Government Regulation No: 20/1994  and certain parliamentarians who were ill-informed of the  deregulation package. In fact, the government should have held  consultations with the members of the House of Representatives  prior to the announcement of the new deregulation package, which  could provoke a multitude of queries.    We had pledged to further strengthen our climate of openness  and democracy. On 11 March 1966, we conscientiously pledged to  implement and uphold Pancasila [State ideology] and the 1945  Constitution. Then, why issue the new deregulation package,  which is not in compliance with the provision of Chapter 14 of  Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution which states: All branches  of production which are of significant national importance and  which are in the public interest are state property. If we are  still unconvinced by this, then let us again look again at the  contents of Guide Book 1 on Pancasila. Let us look again at  Chapter II [Roman two] on the Basic National Development, the  Development Objectives under item A and the Bases for National  Development under item B. Regarding the first four out of seven  bases laid down for our national development, there is clearly a  stress laid on the bases being for benefit, joint ventures,  democracy and equal justice. These are wanting in the new  deregulation package.</p>

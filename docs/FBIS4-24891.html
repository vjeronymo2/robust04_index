He pointed out: China is now further  deepening reform and opening up wider. Under such  circumstances, it is impossible to stop issuing visas to  individual tourists. It is a common occurrence that because of  the host organizations on the Chinese side or for other reasons,  visas may not be issued to tourists on time. Shen Guofang also  said: Touring groups and individual tourists are very welcome  to visit China.</p>

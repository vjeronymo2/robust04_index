			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Surge shown in holidays abroad Travel agents' sales of overseas summer holidays rose 24 per cent this year to 9.8m, far exceeding the previous record of 8m set in 1987. The increase was greater than predicted by the travel industry, which had been expecting sales of summer 1994 holidays to be between 10 per cent and 15 per cent higher than last year. Lunn Poly, the biggest travel retailer, said the rise was stimulated by agents' discounts and increasing consumer confidence. The sales growth was achieved in spite of tax increases earlier in the year and a warm UK summer. Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, Lunn Poly's marketing director, said that by the end of last month summer 1995 sales had increased 15 per cent compared with the same period last year. Lunn Poly dismissed the view of some of its competitors that sales for summer 1995 had been disappointing. The average price of a 1994 summer holiday through Lunn Poly was Pounds 345.28, a Pounds 2 fall from 1993. The top-spending region was north London, with an average Pounds 384.84, followed by north Scotland, with an average Pounds 370.54. Spain was the top-selling summer 1994 destination, accounting for 43 per cent of sales, compared with 38 per cent last year. Greece was the second most popular destination with a 17 per cent share. Cyprus, the US, Portugal and Turkey accounted for 5 per cent each. Sales to Turkey suffered before the end of June as a result of terrorist activity there, but recovered later. Florida was the most popular long-haul destination, with 35 per cent of long-haul holidays sold. This was down from 46 per cent, largely because of attacks on tourists.</p>

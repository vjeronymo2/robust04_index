			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (24): A way through the payments barrier - Countertrade case study / A UK company's innovative wool trading deal in Kazakhstan Exporting to countries suffering a shortage of hard currency for imports is a perennial problem for both buyers and sellers. However, one company, Bradford-based Clendon (UK), has found a way through the payments barrier by assembling an innovative countertrade transaction to facilitate the sale of wool processing equipment to Kazakhstan. Countertrade is the umbrella term for barter, counterpurchase and other forms of reciprocal trading. It often requires patience and persistence in equal doses to make deals workable - and profitable. Clendon has profited from working in a niche market that it knows well - wool processing equipment and wool trading. Some countertrade deals can take years to negotiate and implement. However, in Clendon's case its deal to supply a USDollars 3m wool-washing plant to Kazakhstan in exchange for wool, evolved relatively smoothly and swiftly. Clendon recognised the requirement for wool-processing equipment in the southern republics of the former Soviet Union, and was equally aware of the availability of the required mix of new and re-furbished plant for export in the region. The problem, though, was how to get paid. Banks in the UK and New Zealand, where much of the plant was to be sourced, were unwilling to provide appropriate trade finance, says Clendon's managing director Malcolm Ebbage. 'The normal UK banks wouldn't even look at the deal. In addition, the banks wouldn't even consider our wool stocks as collateral,' he says. The only alternative was to go it alone - with a countertrade payment mechanism involving Kazakh wool. The deal, for the export of plant totalling Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.90m), was signed in May last year with Kazakhstan's Tulpar Company. The plant, now delivered and constructed at Dzhambul, 350km west of Almaty, is expected to be fully operational by late October this year. The deal had the full approval of the Kazakh authorities who are keen to upgrade their industries and add value to raw materials. In addition, purchasing reconditioned equipment, allowed the Kazakhs to save on overall costs. Clendon has been paid and all parties are satisfied with the way the operation has been structured. The success of this deal, in what is generally deemed a difficult market, has encouraged Clendon to develop similar transactions. The washing plant equipment was predominantly second-hand and of New Zealand origin. It was brought to the UK for reconditioning and then exported to Kazakhstan. The new plant component of the contract comprised specialist effluent treatment equipment manufactured in New Zealand by a subsidiary of Sweden's Tetra-Laval Group. On the key issue of funding, Mr Ebbage comments: 'We had to do it off our own bat.' The company drew on its own limited financial resources, but, says Mr Ebbage, 'crucially, we had a substantial volume of wool shipped out of Kazakhstan before we exported the equipment. After that, the deal was more or less self-financing.' The initial wool deliveries accounted for around 25 per cent of the contracted amount and facilitated the first equipment deliveries. Subsequently, Clendon made sure it received shipments of wool before making further equipment deliveries to Kazakhstan. The other essential component of the deal was selling the wool - into a market very familiar to Clendon, thus avoiding the cost of employing outside traders. The principal destination for the Kazakh wool was China. However, there were further profitable twists to the deal, says Mr Ebbage, including adding value to the wool in the UK before re-exporting. The wool was graded and put through combing machines in the UK to add value to the product before it was shipped to China. Moreover, the Kazakh company's insistence that Clendon should also take a proportion of the barter payments in local karakul wool in addition to prime merino wool, also provided Clendon with another commercial opportunity. A dark grey product with very limited use, karakul is used mainly in carpets and blankets. Clendon sold karakul in the west and in India. But, again, this added value to much of this product, generating a healthy return, according to Mr Ebbage. The product came west through Poland, where Clendon began working with a Polish blanket manufacturer - 'we've just sold 25,000 karakul blankets to the Polish state,' says Mr Ebbage. 'Many are also being purchased by the humanitarian aid agencies; Oxfam bought 30,000.' 'The deal with Tulpar worked well because we always tried to keep ahead of the game.' he adds. 'We hope that now our banks have seen this success, they will be more positive in the future.' Meanwhile, the company is setting up similar deals: in Kazakhstan, it has begun bringing out further supplies of wool against the supply of around Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.5m) worth of wool combing and spinning equipment of UK origin. As the deal progresses, Clendon will also take Kazakh cattle hides and sheep skins as payment. In addition, it is planning an agreement to supply another Dollars 3m wool-washing plant to an enterprise in southern Russia.</p>

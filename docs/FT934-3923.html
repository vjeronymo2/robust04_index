			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / People: Departures In a rare example of a company boss falling on his sword, PORTER CHADBURN's chief executive, Raymond Dinkin, has taken responsibility for recent poor results and announced he is resigning to make way for someone who might be able to make a better stab at things. Pat Barrett, Porter Chadburn's non-executive chairman, said yesterday that 'Ray feels that it is in the best interests of the company that this should happen. His situation is that of football team managers. When the team gets relegated, the manager tends to find another team.' Barrett said that the company's poor results over the past 18 months were the root cause of Dinkin's going. For the half-year to October 1, operating losses of Pounds 62,000 were recorded, against operating profits of Pounds 2.2m, pre-exceptional items, last time round. From a 1987 high of more than 300p, Porter Chadburn's shares have fallen to an all-time low of 15p by last week. Among the decisions which retrospectively now seem not to have played into Dinkin's hands was the 1989 acquisition of Gola footwear, the sports shoe manufacturer. The acquisition did not meet expectations; Gola was sold in 1992. There is no immediate successor to Dinkin; Barrett says he hopes a new chief executive will be appointed early in 1994.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Unions join in power protest ELECTRICITY and coal unions have linked with large electricity consumers in a lobbying group that is threatening to take Professor Stephen Littlechild, head of electricity regulator Offer, to court. The Coalition for Fair Electricity Regulation (Coffer) says Prof Littlechild is standing aside while new gas-fired power stations secure contracts that will push old coal-fired stations off the market, raising electricity prices and threatening hundreds of thousands of power station jobs. Coffer has written to him giving him three weeks to convince the users and unions that there is no reason for them to go to the High Court to seek judicial review of his decisions. Coffer is led by representatives of the Major Energy Users Council, a lobby group for lower electricity prices, and the Electrical Power Engineers Association, The group says electricity prices to large consumers have risen by up to 30 per cent since privatisation, and accuses Prof Littlechild of failing to stop the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales from signing long-term contracts to buy power from independent gas-fired power stations. Coffer says the contracts, which were also criticised by the Commons Energy Select Committee report on electricity privatisation in February, lock the regional companies into buying power that will be more expensive than power from existing coal-fired stations. It says that forces the price up because coal stations lose market share and raise prices and shed labour to cover their costs. Coffer says Offer should have intervened to stop the contracts. It can do so because a condition of the regional companies' licence is that they must buy the cheapest electricity available to them. Offer, which has begun a review of this 'economic purchasing' licence condition, said it was convinced it had a '100 per cent robust' case for not having intervened. Miss Penny Boys, Offer's deputy director-general, said: 'There is no apparent link between the contracts and the contracting procedure, and the existing market prices. 'There is only one gas-fired station up and running, which must have a fractional effect on prices.' She said other factors were more relevant to high prices. For instance the possibility that the two large electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, were influencing market prices. That is at present being investigated by Offer.</p>

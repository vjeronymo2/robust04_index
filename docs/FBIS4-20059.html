			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Senator Livio Caputo, Forza </F> Italia foreign affairs spokesman; place and date not given:  "This Is Their Passport to Europe"]    [Text] Rome -- The Osimo treaties must not be annulled but,  rather, reviewed. "They have been overtaken by events," Livio  Caputo, Forza Italia senator responsible for foreign affairs,  explained. "The federative Republic of Yugoslavia no longer  exists: Slovenia and Croatia's claim to inherit the Osimo treaty  without any amendments is countered by the fact that they  already breached the treaty themselves by splitting the Italian  community in Istria and setting up a border along the Dragonja  river."    [IL GIORNALE] Is this the only violation?    [Caputo] Another violation is the failure to pay  eleven-thirteenths of the compensation for property seized from  the exiles, which, in our view, must be returned.    [IL GIORNALE] The Italian Government has begun  negotiations...    [Caputo] Yes, but by tolerating that this [blank space in  original] bounce back and would next day take back the --  actually very small -- concessions made the previous day. These  delaying tactics aimed at burying the problem must be stopped.  The new government will look at [Slovenian President] Kucan and  [Croatian President] Tudjman's maps.    [IL GIORNALE] Today Italian exiles cannot even buy back  their  homes...    [Caputo] We must review those laws on real estate which  prevent the victims of that early ethnic cleansing from  recovering their property, even if this involves paying. It is  perfectly legitimate for Italy to make use of its chance to  block Slovenia's and Croatia's application for membership in the  European Union until they decide to behave like good Europeans  instead of maintaining the practices of a Communist regime that  no longer exists and that they have disowned [blank space in  original].    [IL GIORNALE] Are the borders untouchable or not?    [Caputo] The border issue is a real one. One part of the  territories which we had to give up at the end of the war is  historically Italian, just as Alsace-Lorraine remained French  even when it belonged to Germany, or eastern Prussia is  historically German even though it now belongs to Russia. There  are no immutable borders in history, especially in frontier  areas like Istria and Dalmatia. Even international law allows  for borders to be reviewed through diplomatic channels with the  agreement of the parties involved.    [IL GIORNALE] But there is no such agreement.  Alsace-Lorraine and eastern Prussia's borders were changed by  the war...    [Caputo] The future majority [blank space in original]  problem, clearly it will only be solved in the context of peace,  possibly though the creation of cross-border regional  structures, or perhaps through self-determination procedures.    [IL GIORNALE] Self-determination by Serbian Krajina, in  Croatia, led to war.    [Caputo] Italy is simply doing the same as Japan, which is  refusing to fully reestablish normal relations with Russia until  a satisfactory solution can be found to the Kuril islands  problem.    [IL GIORNALE] Should Osimo be annulled?    [Caputo] I believe we missed the train. The request for  annulment should have been made when Slovenia and Croatia were  recognized. We must take one step at a time.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trading in Reuters REUTERS bowed under the weight of sell orders ahead of today's annual meeting and in reaction to a downgrading from US securities house Merrill Lynch. For the current year Merrill has cut its profits forecast by Pounds 45m to Pounds 320m, increasing, among other things, its provision for redundancy payments. Bulls of the stock among the analysts rushed to its defence. They pointed out that several brokers had already written in the Merrill forecasts. They said that nerves ahead of the annual meeting were to be expected, given the stop-start prospects for the company's new trading products since last summer. They conceded, however, that with much of the trading in the stock being conducted in New York, a downgrading from a US broker would have significant influence. Reuters dropped 50 at one point before ending at 823p, a net decline of 42. Trading was heavy for the stock, with 3.3m shares changing hands. ECC weakens Two apparently ill-conceived market stories took the spice out of the shares of ECC, the industrial materials group, yesterday. After outperforming the rest of the sector for the past month, the shares reacted nervously on hints both of a rights issue and that a large line of stock was on offer. The shares fell to 407p before closing 15 down on balance at 410p. The rights issue speculation probably stemmed from the group's announced intention to replace some short-term debt. ECC said last year, when acquiring Georgia Kaolin, that part of the three-year multi-currency credit facility of up to Dollars 600m necessary to fin-ance the deal would in due course be put on a longer term basis in international capital markets. ECC said it did not intend that such funding would be the subject of a rights issue and, according to finance director Mr Robert Carlton-Porter yesterday, that position has not changed. Investigation into the stock-on-offer report revealed the presence of an eager seller but not in the million-plus quantities suggested by the talk. Cadbury Schweppes fell 10 to 370p as speculation continued that it was about to issue a Pounds 400m convertible bond to fund a takeover of Dr Pepper/7-up, the US soft drinks company. The shares refused to recover in spite of the company once again ruling out any rights or bond issue. Asda was a penny lower at 121p on turnover of 4.6m as the market waited for the company's meetings with brokers which begin today. There has been widespread speculation that brokers will lower their forecasts after the meetings. Argyll dipped 3 to 300p after reports that analysts at some leading investment institutions had visited the company, while Unilever shed 3 to 758p ahead of its quarterly figures expected on May 17. SG Warburg added its voice to the chorus of analysts saying that Glaxo should be bought. Warburg, the company's broker, published a comprehensive review of Glaxo's products. It was particularly positive on asthma treatments, where it said that within five years revenues should exceed those from Glaxo's best selling Zantac drug. SmithKline Beecham continued to suffer from recent 'take profits' advice. The shares briefly dipped below Pounds 8 before ending at 807p, a net 10 easier. ICI weakened again in nervous trading ahead of today's first-quarter results. Sentiment was not helped by vague talk that the company would announce a rights issue and maybe a deal to buy a stake in Wellcome - not an idea new to the market. Level headed traders disbelieved this theory, and pointed to Wellcome's relatively steady performance yesterday in quiet trading. ICI, 18 off at one stage, ended 13 down on balance at 1070p. Wellcome eased 3 to 527p. Legal &amp; General retreated 13 to 438p on 1.7m, upset by downgradings from a number of broking firms. London and Manchester was slightly easier at 337p after new business figures described as disappointing by one trader. A number of downgrades kept the composite insurances under persistent pressure. Analysts are now expecting all the big five composites to show losses for the current year. General Accident and Guardian Royal are expected to record losses of around Pounds 100m, Royals some Pounds 90m, Sun Alliance Pounds 70m to Pounds 80m and Commercial Union around Pounds 30m. The biggest turnover, 3.5m, was in Guardian Royal, 4 off at 204p, while Royals dipped 7 to 449p, General Accident 5 to 532p and Sun Alliance 3 to 363p. Some keen two-way interest was shown in Amstrad, which settled unchanged on the day at 76p, having eased earlier in the session. The early uncertainty came as Kleinwort Benson downgraded its profits estimates for the group. For this year Kleinwort has cut its forecast from Pounds 44m to Pounds 36m and for next year it has moved from Pounds 60m to Pounds 55m. Ms Judy Stewart at Kleinwort said the lower forecast followed on from a number of bearish signs in the computer industry. It was also pointed out that Amstrad had been selling significant amounts of stock in Micron, the computer chip manufacturer, where some 3.5m shares were acquired in October 1988. Amstrad said it had sold 2.2m of these shares. James Capel, Amstrad's broker, is believed to have downgraded the stock. Wardle Storeys began to reap the rewards of a series of presentations hosted by Smith New Court to Scottish investment institutions. Smith believes there is a more realistic air about the company these days and, in spite of the downturn, a more robust feel about the potential. The shares bounced 11 to 309p. Negative comment on the refinancing exercise caused investors to have second thoughts about Cannon Street Investments and the shares consequently gave back part of Tuesday's sharp rise to close 12 down at 112p. Morgan Crucible regained some of the ground lost since last week's rights issue announcement, ending 8 better at 241p. Fears that Vickers may tell today's annual meeting of falling sales for Rolls-Royce cars and warn about profits from the luxury car division put the shares down 6 more to 211p. Aerospace Engineering moved ahead 5 to 54p after favourable comment. Ibex Holdings, the recruitment consultancy and employment agency, plunged 7 to 11p on news that a bid may be made at a level 'materially lower' than the current market price. Motor distributor Jessups dropped 9 to 46p after revealing losses and a dividend cut at the half-way stage. Investors continued to favour Betterware Consumer Products and, in thin trading, the price advanced 15 further to the highest level this year of 227p. The annual results are expected in June. The recent rise in oil shares, stimulated by higher crude prices and the strength of the dollar, was reversed yesterday. The appearance of a number of big institutional sellers accompanied a decline in oil prices and a hefty profits downgrade in BP by Strauss Turnbull, one of the market's big bears of the oil sector. Mr John Toalster, oil sector guru at Strauss, cut his current year net income forecast for BP from Pounds 960m to Pounds 700m and said the group may well struggle to achieve this figure. He estimated that BP's first-quarter income, due to be announced on May 9, would show a loss of Pounds 125m. Mr Toalster said BP would be hard pressed to pay a forecast increase of 4.8 per cent in its final dividend this year. Some big selling, much of it by Strauss clients, left BP 4 1/2 off at 349 1/2 p on turnover of 7.6m shares. Shell, where turnover was a more sedate 4.1m, settled 3 easier at 521p. In a quiet property sector, Brixton Estates climbed 13 to 174p after publishing results at the top end of analysts' expectations. Full year profits were more than 15 per cent better at Pounds 23.6m and traders were impressed by the published net asset value and the dividend increase. Traders said a cross of 450,000 Percy Bilton shares took place at 404p. It left the stock 14 down at 394p. The current series of presentations by Rank Organisation to brokers generated yet another change of forecast. Hoare Govett trimmed its profits prediction for 1991 from Pounds 318m to Pounds 305m. The stock lost 19 to 727p in good volume. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (135). BRITISH FUNDS (1) Treas. 2pc I-L '92, AMERICANS (13) Abbott Labs., Am. Cyanamid, Am.

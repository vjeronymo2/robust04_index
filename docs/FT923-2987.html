			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Business Law: One-stop shopping in Czech privatisation In the former Czechoslovakia, the 'velvet divorce' of the Czech lands and Slovakia has preoccupied the outside world in recent months. Behind the scenes, however, the Czech Republic is quietly forging ahead with a programme of economic reform and privatisation that is already serving as a model for the region. One of the most important developments in the reform programme is the creation of an overnight capital market for thousands of companies participating in the voucher privatisation scheme. The initial wave of privatisation involves five 'rounds' of bidding. In the first three, more than 120 companies have identified their new shareholders, and by the end of the year, nearly 1,500 companies will be trading. The majority of these will be controlled by a handful of closed-end mutual funds. Fund managers have induced individual holders of voucher books to invest with them by promising guaranteed returns. The funds will soon be under pressure to sell to satisfy these put obligations. They will also want to maximise their investments, restructuring the old state enterprises by raising capital and negotiating for foreign management, technology and marketing commitments. All of this should spell opportunity for many strategic and financial investors who have been waiting on the sidelines to see how the reform programme developed. A new Securities Act will come into force on January 1. It will feature standard disclosure and trading rules and set the stage for efficient capital markets which will be open to foreign investors without the complexities inherent in the previous 'deal path' of buying from the government. Direct foreign investment in the Czech privatisation programme has so far been limited to just 41 deals, with total investment falling significantly shy of the anticipated level of several billion US dollars. While not discouraging foreign investment, government policy has generally favoured letting the new shareholders sort things out with willing buyers after voucher privatisation. As a result, investors pursuing deals with the government have complained about the ad hoc character of the process, especially the lack of co-ordination among reviewing ministries and the absence of review criteria. The government has tried to address these problems and generally accelerate the process by creating a new inter-ministerial privatisation commission as the deciding authority to replace the cabinet-level economic counsel. All key ministries will be represented on the commission, opening the door for the first time to the possibility of one-stop shopping as an welcome alternative to renegotiating with different ministries along the way. The privatisation commission is even talking about publishing criteria for foreign deals; these have long been applied quietly by investment bankers to the Czech Ministry of Privatisation. The move would improve the transparency of the process by giving foreign investors (and reviewing bureaucrats) a set of benchmarks around which to structure their proposals. The government has also published a resolution dealing with environmental liabilities. Foreign investors are understandably nervous about such liabilities in light of the poor environmental record of previous state enterprises, and the stated intention of the Czech government to enforce European Community standards during the next few years. The new resolution will apply to companies due to be privatised in the second wave. The resolution indemnifies foreign buyers completely against off-site environmental liabilities associated with the assets being privatised. Foreign investors will have to assume liability for on-site environmental conditions. However, the resolution establishes a procedure under which up to 50 per cent of the purchase price paid for the privatised assets will be held in escrow and made available by the government for necessary environmental investments. Escrow fund payouts will be based on an audit of environmental conditions at the date the deal is completed, and on performance of a remediation programme which is to be agreed between the purchaser and local and federal environmental officials. The audit and remediation programme do not need to be finalised before completion of the transaction, although it is clearly in the best interests of the foreign investor to see that they are. The Czech government has also clarified the role of the Czech Office for Economic Competition (COEC), which was created by anti-trust legislation early in 1991. This body will now review all privatisation transactions involving foreign investment. The COEC will initially analyse the target company to determine whether it has a 'dominant' market position, defined as holding more than 30 per cent of the market for the relevant product. If the company was judged to be dominant, COEC would analyse the potential for abuse of its position. The COEC will seek to determine if 'any detriment which may arise from limited competition will be outweighed by the economic benefits produced by the merger'. The factors that will be considered in this balancing test are still emerging. Initial rulings do indicate, however, that the COEC will consider access to foreign technology and markets that will prolong the life of the Czech target company as a public benefit that may compensate for the detriment caused by a dominant market position. The COEC is currently promising to grant preliminary opinions on transactions already in the pipeline within a few days. However, after the completion of a transaction the COEC reserves the right to re-evaluate the project and revoke its preliminary approval if it finds evidence that the foreign buyer intends to engage in predatory practices. Foreign investors would be well advised to plan against this contingency with appropriate contractual escape clauses. A final warning for the foreign investor is the caveat emptor principle. The National Property Fund, which is the selling entity in direct foreign investment privatisations, is taking a very tough stand on representations and warranties that will be made to foreign buyers. The fund's standard form contract provides only for limited representations as to the organisation and standing of the target company; due authorisation and execution of the purchase contract; valid ownership title to, and absence of litigation affecting, the assets being privatised; and all necessary consents having been obtained. Standard balance sheet and other representations should not be expected, although these have been granted in selected cases where they are contemplated in the privatisation project submitted for government approval.

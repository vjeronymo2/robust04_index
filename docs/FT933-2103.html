			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Aids drug study results delayed THE MEDICAL Research Council has had to delay publication of the full results of its controversial Concorde study about the effectiveness of AZT, the most widely used treatment for Aids and HIV-positive patients. In April the council revealed preliminary data suggesting that the drug was not effective in slowing down progress towards Aids in HIV-positive patients. At the same time the medical journal The Lancet published a letter, which had not been submitted for scientific assessment, from the council about the Anglo-French study - the largest and longest trial on patients with HIV who had not developed Aids. Wellcome, AZT's manufacturer, disputed the findings. Although additional information has been provided, clinicians and patients have not had full access to scientifically-assessed data. Dr Janet Darbyshire, head of the council's HIV clinical trials centre, said there had been some trouble in putting together the data. 'I had hoped it would be done before, but we have been chasing some data that we did not have before on dose levels and things like that,' she said. She said the full data would not change the main findings but would be supplementary. Full details would be published in The Lancet before the end of the year, she added. The council's letter in April shocked the Aids community, since it left HIV-positive patients, who had not developed Aids, without any proven therapy.</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BEETLES HAVE TASTE FOR BOOKS  </P> <P> Voracious beetles with a taste for religious works have brought havoc to a  collection of some of the rarest books in Britain, London newspapers said  today.  </P> <P> The tiny munchers, a species of Australian spider beetle and biscuit beetle,  happily burrowed and ate their way through a quarter of 5,000 priceless volumes  at a library in Cornwall in southwest England before they were detected.  </P> <P> Staff members of the library at Lanhydrock House believe the beetles were  carried in on cut flowers. The tiny creatures then gleefully transferred  themselves to the 16th and 17th Century book collection of 17th Century  theologian, the Rev. Hannibal Gammon. Not until the staff began spring-cleaning  the library did they discover bindings and pages networked with holes.  </P></p>

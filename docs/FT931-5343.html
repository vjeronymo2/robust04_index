Mr Mark Wyeth, prosecuting, said Mr Philip Englefield, 49, of Knightsbridge, west London, had joined the 142-year-old west London firm of Boyce, Evans and Sheppard 32 years ago, eventually becoming a senior partner. Mr Englefield had stolen or misappropriated money from clients, lending to fund speculative property ventures. 'He lied to his clients and misled his fellow partners.' Mr Englefield admitted 10 charges involving theft, false accounting and procuring the execution of valuable securities. His activities were uncovered when the firm computerised its clients' accounts.</p>

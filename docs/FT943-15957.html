			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Mannesmann chief forgoes new post Mannesmann, one of Germany's largest industrial companies, yesterday acknowledged growing suggestions of impropriety by Mr Werner Dieter, the outgoing chief executive, and decided not to elect him chairman of the company's supervisory board. The company said Mr Dieter, who will step down as chief executive at the annual meeting tomorrow, will become an ordinary member of the supervisory board and not chairman as originally planned. The decision comes days after the Dusseldorf state prosecutor began investigating alleged fraud by Mr Dieter, who is said to have forced Rexroth, a Mannesmann subsidiary, to buy hydraulic accessories at inflated prices from Hydac, a company largely owned by Mr Dieter's family. The engineering conglomerate has already ordered an internal enquiry but this found no evidence against Mr Dieter, 64, who has been chief executive since 1985. 'The examination of the Mannesmann audit reports to date has not substantiated any of the charges against Mr Dieter,' the company said. 'For the sake of a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter the supervisory board has decided to commission an external audit by the C&amp;L Treuarbeit AG.' The company said Mr Dieter would not seek to become chairman of the Mannesmann supervisory board, a non-executive board which oversees the company's management, until the external audit had been completed. Mr Friedrich Christians, a former chief executive of Deutsche Bank, will stay on as chairman. The board also recommended that approval of Mr Dieter's activities as chief executive - in effect a vote of confidence by shareholders - be postponed until next year's annual meeting, the earliest date at which he could take over as chairman. Mr Dieter recently told the Financial Times the relationship between Rexroth and Hydac had existed for 31 years and had been openly discussed when he took over as chief executive in 1985. He said the companies were 'entirely competitive' and internal company documents had been leaked in an attempt to wreck his chances of becoming supervisory board chairman. Spiegel, the weekly news magazine, first published the allegations against Mr Dieter a month ago when the company's shares stood at DM446 (Pounds 180). The shares fell to DM397 last week on news of the state prosecutor's investigation but picked up DM2 yesterday to DM414.</p>

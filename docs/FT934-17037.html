			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Sport: How Bath play the power game - Rugby Union JACK ROWELL is the managing dictator of Bath rugby club. The charismatic coach from Hartlepool in north east England has created a centre of rugby excellence that is the envy of the world. His record since becoming coach at Bath in 1977 is extraordinary, having already achieved success at the helm at Gosforth (Cup wins in 1976 and 1977), he has won 11 trophies since 1984 (four league titles in six years; seven cup victories out of 10) at Bath. After Bob Dwyer, the Australian coach, took his club Randwick to five Sydney premiership titles he became national coach. Rowell has not had such luck. He has only just been re-admitted to the inner sanctum at Twickenham. Last year Rowell took the England B side to New Zealand. This year he was shunned and did not accompany the England A side to Canada in the close season (where England lost a test to Canada for the first time). This was a disgrace. Three weeks ago, Rowell was given back the England A side and will prepare it for the battle against the All Blacks at Gateshead on November 7. Rowell should have his sights set on succeeding Geoff Cooke, the England manager, after the 1995 World Cup and Bath know they must find a successor. The favourite is Stuart Barnes, the England fly half, but he said: 'It's not for me. It's natural that people should speculate that as I have been associated with most of Bath's successes of the last decade that when I retire I would want to take on Jack's role. But, I see it very differently.' The balance of power in the club is changing. Many of those who have run the club for the past four decades have found recent changes hard to accept. Several were forced to resign at an extraordinary general meeting this summer. Roger Berry, a former chairman and player, said: 'The way rugby is going it is inevitable that there are two heads to a club, the administration which makes it possible for the game to be played at all levels right down to minis, and the coaching and playing staff who create our success on the field. 'It's clear that most senior clubs will have a chief executive officer before the decade is out. The game is simply so big. No individual can run the club. It's a 24-hour, seven days a week business and it has to be professionally managed.' 'The problem,' said John Roberts, a former chairman and ckub captain, 'is that a paid officer cannot vote under the existing rules of most clubs and so might feel hemmed in. The ideal scenario would be two paid officials - one who is head of administration and the other who is head of coaching but they would be answerable to the executive committee of the club.' Such a development would mean clubs having to pay Pounds 80,000 in salaries which in turn means they would have to be turning over Pounds 800,000 (assuming a 10 per cent profit). Bath is not in that position. Colin Gale, the recently retired honorary treasurer, said: 'Bath made a profit of Pounds 35,000 after depreciation in 1989, less in 1990, a loss of just under Pounds 5,000 in 1991 and a Pounds 55,000 profit in 1992. I doubt if it will be more in 1993 because we were knocked out of the Pilkington Cup.' The turnover of the club in 1992, net of VAT, was Pounds 450,000. Bath is a small city with a population of 80,000. The ground could hold many more than the 8,000 who regularly cram into its tight borders. Bath's success has meant they have not had to enter the 'transfer' market. Most of its players are local and in a previous decade would have gone more naturally to near neighbours Bristol or farther up the road to Gloucester or Newport. Those who have come from afar include Tony Swift from Swansea, Ben Clarke from Bishop's Stortford, via Saracens, Victor Ubogu from Richmond (he lives in London and travels down to Bath three times a week) and Stuart Barnes and Jon Webb who both came from Bristol. The rest - Guscott, Hall, Reed, Chilcott, Sole, Halliday and so on - were drawn from the club's hinterland. Rumours abound that somehow the players are either given incentives or paid. This was denied by Gale: 'We have to send our audited accounts to Somerset RFU and they have raised the occasional comment with respect to players expenses mainly in the region of medical expenses (Pounds 25,000 in 1992) and travel expenses (Pounds 35,000 in 1992). But they have always confirmed to the RFU that our accounts are in order.' 'The point is,' said Barnes 'that we do spend money on our preparation. 'Every one wants to beat us and most weeks our games are like an FA Cup final for our opponents. This year with home and away in the Courage league this will be heightened farther. For away games we leave Bath on Friday afternoon and stay overnight in a quality hotel so that we are ready mentally and physically the next day. (Away expenses, for all the club's four senior and many youth teams, were Pounds 33,000 in 1992) There simply isn't any other way to stay on top. We must be as professional prepared as any first class athlete.'</p>

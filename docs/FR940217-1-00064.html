			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered or threatened. The Service's listing regulations at 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 424.12(a)(1) specify that designation of critical habitat is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prudent when such designation would not be beneficial to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. The Service finds that designation of the springs occupied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Barton Springs salamander as critical habitat would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prudent because it would not provide a conservation benefit to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species, and would actually be detrimental to the species by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggesting a misleadingly restricted view of its true conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designation of Barton Springs as critical habitat would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a conservation benefit to the Barton Springs salamander  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond benefits provided by listing and the subsequent evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities under section 7 of the Act for possible jeopardy to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. In the Service's section 7 regulations at 50 CFR 402, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``jeopardize the continuing existence'' includes ``to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the listed species,'' and ``adverse modification'' is defined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed species.'' Because the species is endemic to such a highly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> localized area, actions that appreciably diminish water quality and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity at Barton Springs would be fully evaluated for their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects on the salamander through analysis of whether the actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be likely to jeopardize the continuing existence of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. Any action that would appreciably diminish the value, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality or quantity, of flows from Barton Springs would also reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appreciably the likelihood of survival and recovery of the Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs salamander. The analysis for possible jeopardy applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Barton Springs salamander would therefore be identical to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 7 analysis for determining adverse modification or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction of critical habitat; no distinction between jeopardy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse modification for activities impacting the waters of Barton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs can be made at this time. Application of section 7 relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to critical habitat would therefore not add measurable protection to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the species beyond what is achievable through review for jeopardy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designation of the springs and their immediate environment as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat would actually be detrimental to conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts for the Barton Springs salamander, because it would promote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the misconception that the Barton Springs are the only areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important to the conservation of the species. Conservation efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the species must address a wide variety of federally funded or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized activities (summarized in the ``Available Conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Measures'' section of this proposed rule) that affect the quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and quantity of water available to the species through their effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the recharge sources and aquifer that supply water to the habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the salamander. Nearly all of these activities will occur beyond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the immediate vicinity of Barton Springs, and some will occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several miles away. Designation of Barton Springs as critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat would be misleading in implying to federal agencies whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities may affect the Barton Springs salamander that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service's concern for the species is limited only to activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking place at the springs occupied by the species. Designation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs as critical habitat would therefore not be prudent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conservation and management of the Barton Springs salamander  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is likely to involve removing threats to the survival of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salamander, including (1) protecting the quality of springflow from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barton Springs by implementing comprehensive programs to control and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce point sources and non-point sources of pollution throughout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer, (2) minimizing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood of pollution events that would affect groundwater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality, (3) continuing to protect groundwater and springflow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity by implementing water conservation and drought contingency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans throughout the Barton Springs segment, and (4) continuing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examine and implement pool cleaning practices and other park  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations that protect and perpetuate the salamander's surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat and population. It is also anticipated that listing will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage research on the Barton Springs salamander's distribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the aquifer and critical aspects of its biology (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longevity, natality, sources of mortality, feeding ecology, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity to contaminants and other water quality constituents).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardize the continued existence of a species proposed for listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

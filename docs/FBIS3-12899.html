			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a report by our correspondent, a  resolution signed by more than 140 deputies was read during the  Majles open session this afternoon condemning the horrific  crimes of the Zionists in Hebron and the mysterious and  treacherous silence of international forums and false supporters  of human rights.    The resolution--expressing support for His Eminence Imam  Khomeyni's justified stand on the need for the elimination of  the Zionist regime from the world map and following the esteemed  leader's stand--has emphasized: The solution to the problem of  Zionism and uprooting of this cancerous tumor will not be  possible except through continuation of the armed conflict.    The resolution, in part, says: What is tragic in the wake of  this painful development is the fact that global arrogance--led  by America and criminal Zionism--has declared the occurrence of  this tragedy as solid preparation for continuation of the  compromising talks and has expressed the need for speeding up  the sell-out plan.    In the conclusion of the resolution, the deputies of the  Islamic Majles have called upon our country's noble and  revolutionary people and all freedom loving people and Muslims  of the world to pour out the fire of their revolutionary wrath  and anger against the usurping Zionism, through enthusiastic  participation in rallies of the international Jerusalem Day, and  to repay their debt to the unjustly shed blood of the innocent  Palestinians by chanting slogans of death to Israel and death to  America.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Executives held on charges of rigging contract bids SIX executives from five of Japan's leading printing companies were yesterday arrested on suspicion of sharing profits of more than Y100m (Pounds 485,000) after rigging their bids for Y670m contract to print security seals for a central government agency. The arrests by the Tokyo district prosecutor's office follow an investigation into the way the five companies fixed their bids for the contract to supply the social insurance agency. The case is likely to fuel foreign criticism that Japan's system of public sector procurement is prone to collusion among suppliers. The high profile arrests, made during raids on the companies' premises, are a signal of the significance which the authorities attach to the case. The executives arrested include two officials from Dai Nippon Printing, Japan's largest printing group and a manager from each of Toppan Moore, Kobayashi Kirokushi, Hitachi Information Systems, a software house and BF, a Hitachi affiliate. The companies are alleged to have met three days before lodging apparently competing bids for a contract to print a specially designed security seal which the social insurance agency introduced for documents sent to pensioners. The executives are accused of agreeing that Toppan Moore should be allowed to win the competitive bidding with a bid of Y670m. Toppan Moore then paid each of the other companies between Y30m and Y60m from its inflated profits on the contract. It is thought that Toppan Moore added about Y2 to the price for printing each of the special labels which cost about Y10 to print, inflating its profits by more than Y120m. The social insurance agency introduced the seals in 1989. It buys about 175m a year through six-monthly competitive bids among a small number of specialist printers.</p>

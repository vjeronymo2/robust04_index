			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK's strong bonds with Germany must be re-emphasised Sir, Showing he does not have his predecessor's hang-ups about the Germans, John Major went out of his way in a speech in Bonn three years ago to congratulate Chancellor Kohl on the 'enormous skill and quiet authority' with which he steered German unity. I noted Mr Major's key message that the Conservatives and Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats 'can achieve great things together in Europe and for Europe'. When Mr Kohl comes to London on Wednesday, I am afraid that the German chancellor will not think the prime minister has delivered on that promise. From a German perspective the British, under Mr Major's leadership, have been almost as awkward and as unreliable as they were under Mrs Thatcher. It is true that, in the negotiations leading to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreement, the British and German positions were almost identical. Also, the British supported the Germans on siting the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt. However, by consistently putting short-term party concerns before the national interest, Mr Major has failed to create partnership with Germany. At Maastricht, he used up much of his credit with Mr Kohl by insisting on the double 'opt out' over monetary union and social policy. The recent fiasco over qualified majority voting was mainly caused by Mr Major's insistence on fighting a European battle to keep favour with Tory Eurosceptics. If Mr Major is wise, he will return to the strategy of emphasising Britain's strong bonds with Germany in the economic, strategic and political fields. Britain and Germany should jointly endorse the goal of allowing Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic and Slovakia to join the European Union as soon as possible. The emphasis of next year's VE Day celebrations should be on the success of our post-war reconciliation with Germany. To back this up, Britain needs to expand massively its youth and school exchanges with Germany, along the lines set out in your editorial, 'Anglo-German understanding' (April 11). It would be disastrous if, by default, we allowed a revival of the Anglo-German antagonism that was so harmful to Europe in the early part of the 20th century.

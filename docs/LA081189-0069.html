			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE ROUT 47 IN 'COMMOTION' AT COURTHOUSE;  </P> <P> BLACKS FIGHT CHARGES OVER SINGING ON A TRAIN  </P> <P> When 47 blacks gathered outside the courthouse here Thursday to fight citations  for singing on a commuter train, police ordered them and dozens of their  supporters to disperse and chased them as they fled, beating them with whips.  </P> <P> That "commotion," attorney Azhar Cachalia explained to the judge an hour later,  was why his clients were not present to face the charge -- the misdemeanor of  "objectionable behavior" for singing freedom songs on the 6:05 a.m. train from  Tembisa township to Johannesburg.  </P> <P> Just to be sure, though, bailiffs leaned outside the courtroom to shout each  defendant's name three times in the empty corridor. There was no reply.  </P> <P> The arrest of 460 singing commuters in the last two months reflects a renewed  crackdown on even the most fundamental levels of black protest as the  government prepares for Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, in which blacks have  no vote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A New 'Defiance Campaign'  </P> <P> But the willingness of blacks to fight the minor charges -- and risk  confrontation with the police -- is an outgrowth of a new "defiance campaign"  of civil disobedience mounted by leading anti-apartheid organizations.  </P> <P> Unrest and clashes with the police have increased sharply in recent days, and  law-and-order officials have vowed to move swiftly against activists who "act  defiantly and openly ignore police warnings."  </P> <P> Thursday's trouble in the white Johannesburg suburb of Kempton Park had its  roots in an incident that occurred last month, when police arrested 47 people  on the train. The authorities have frequently arrested large groups of  commuters since early June, although blacks have been singing liberation songs  on the trains for more than three years.  </P> <P> "We were just singing our songs, like church people sing," said Yoliswa Pokela,  a 45-year-old secretary. "It was a peaceful act."  </P> <P> Each of the defendants could have avoided a court appearance by paying fines of  less than $20 that would have been an admission of guilt. But they decided to  force the government to prove its case.  </P> <P> "I can't just pay a fine," said Phineas Rambidi, 37, a factory mechanic. "I  didn't disturb anyone on that train."  </P> <P> Most of the arrested singers belong to unions affiliated with the Congress of  South African Trade Unions (COSATU), the giant, predominantly black labor  federation and anti-apartheid leader.  </P> <P> An anti-apartheid coalition led by COSATU and other organizations launched the  nationwide defiance campaign last week, and COSATU has exchanged heated words  in recent days with Adriaan Vlok, law-and-order chief in the white minority-led  government.  </P> <P> "It's just harassment," Khalik Mayet, one of the defendants' attorneys, said of  the charges. "Songs are a very effective way of spreading ideas and culture,  and the government thinks if it can stop the singing, it can stop the spread of  ideas."  </P> <P> Of the 460 blacks arrested on the trains, some have paid their fines while 362  are fighting formal charges, which range from committing acts that "endanger  other passengers" to using obscene language. Thursday's case was postponed  until November.  </P> <P> Pokela was headed for work from her home in Tembisa on July 6 when police  arrested her and several dozen others and issued them summonses, the equivalent  of a traffic ticket.  </P> <P> While the defendants and about 200 singing supporters were waiting outside the  doors of the courthouse here Thursday, the police declared it an illegal  gathering and, in the melee that followed, at least 18 people were injured.  </P> <P> A black woman with her son, accused of theft in another court case, had a large  bloodstain on her dress and tears in her eyes. She said she had been whipped  twice by police officers and then trampled by fleeing protesters.  </P> <P> Policemen chased activists across four lanes of traffic into nearby  neighborhoods. About two blocks away, they ordered about 60 blacks to disperse  and, as the group turned to leave, charged them with sjamboks -- whips. About  20 activists were arrested, a police spokesman said.  </P> <P> "What breaks my heart is that the people who are being harassed don't even know  what's going on," said Pokela, who huddled against a fence to avoid the  charging police. "We tell the people, 'You will not be beaten because of  politics, but because of the color of your skin.' "  </P> <P> Black commuters use railway coaches to discuss anti-apartheid politics because  under the state of emergency, outdoor political meetings are prohibited. Labor  researchers say the trains have become one of the main ways that black  political organizations and political culture have been kept alive in the face  of the government's restrictions.  </P> <P> The train meetings continue, despite the recent arrests, "but I must admit the  system is beginning to break our spirit," Pokela said.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, the government has filed more serious charges of public  violence against the train singers, and several dozen have had to post bond of  about $150 while they await trial.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys say they doubt that the state can prove that singing  constitutes public violence.  </P> <P> "It's not what they're singing that's at issue," attorney Mayet said. "It's  who's doing the singing. But they can't prosecute people for singing on trains.  It happens all over the world."  </P></p>

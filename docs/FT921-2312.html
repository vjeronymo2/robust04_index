			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Steel Burrill Jones advance 11.7% STEEL BURRILL Jones, the insurance broker, yesterday reported an 11.7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.44m to Pounds 10.55m for the year ending December 31 1991, writes Richard Lapper. However, part of the growth reflected the impact of acquisitions made during 1990 and 1991. Earnings per share increased by just 4 per cent to 19.94p (19.17p). The dividend was increased by 8 per cent to 13.25p (12.25p) with a recommended final of 9p (8.25p), but the market reacted unenthusiastically with the shares unchanged at 237p. Turnover rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 41m (Pounds 33.5m) while expenses increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 31m). Investment and other income amounted to Pounds 6.83m (Pounds 6.44m). The figures included full-year results for WS Moody, the UK retail broker acquired in 1990, as well as full-year con-tributions from Martin Perry Associates and SBJ Spec-iality in which controlling interests were acquired during 1991. Mr Tony Keys, finance director, said income was up 10 per cent, while expenses rose by 5 per cent in underlying currency terms and after adjusting the figures to take account of the increased contribution from Moody. Reduced capacity in the marine reinsurance market, as well as a weaker dollar and significantly lower interest rates had made for much tougher trading conditions and the group had focused its attention on efforts to reduce operating expenses. Mr Keys expected those factors to constrain profitability in 1992 and accepted that the current problems of the Lloyd's insurance market  - into which SBJ places between 20 and 30 per cent of its business  - cast a shadow over prospects.</p>

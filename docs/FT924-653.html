			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Arts: Glitz threatens the News at Ten - Television Anyone who wants to know what might be expected from the new ITV network coming into operation on January 1 should have a look at News At Ten. For decades ITV's flagship news programme was regarded, almost universally, as being on a par with the BBC's Nine O'Clock News. Many people both inside and outside television argued that it was superior. Now, under the Government's new Darwinian rules for commercial television, with fierce competition for peak time slots and the weakest going to the wall, the programme has been transformed. What was once slick but dignified, and serious without being solemn, has been turned into a mixture of sensationalism, glitz and pomposity. Perhaps it will win for the new ITV an even bigger audience among those who read tabloid newspapers, but in the process it will surely lose many of its more serious viewers. Over the years it has been argued in this column that, far from differing significantly, the main television news programmes have seemed, to the non professional onlooker, to be virtually indistinguishable. The BBC used to employ as news readers people who were members of Equity, the actors' union. ITN smiled superciliously and boasted that its presenters were not mere 'readers' but 'newscasters', members of the National Union of Journalists with all the experience necessary to gather the news as well as read it out. But to the average viewer the distinction was irrelevant. Whether or not Richard Baker and Jan Leeming were members of Equity, many people preferred their personalities and their diction to those of some ITN newscasters. Anyway, whatever the qualifications of the presenters, the two news programmes were remarkably similar: in the items they covered, the approach they took, the significance they apportioned, and the general appearance on screen, there was less difference than between, say, the Daily Mail and the Daily Express. This always seemed rather odd. After all, television is a mass medium with much of its output - soap operas, game shows, comedies - directed straight at the tabloid market. Why, then, were all its news programmes pitched somewhere just below the level of the Daily Telegraph? More recent developments brought us more broadsheet style coverage in Newsnight and Channel 4 News but still nothing like the BBC's old Nationwide to appeal to the mass market. Having argued in that manner it would be perverse now to start complaining that News At Ten has gone down market (though it has). That is not the complaint. The trouble is that its overhaul has resulted in so much that is pretentious, superficial and downright silly. The effects of the change were most vividly exemplified one evening during the recent blitz of royal family stories when ITN's court correspondent made the bizarre assertion 'Trevor the Queen is now behind me . . .' It took several moments to deconstruct this. It seems that News At Ten now specialises in the 'sandwich', a conventional film report served up to the consumer between a studio intro and a live two-way interview involving anchorman and reporter. Labelling a report with the caption 'Live' is just one of many habits imported from the US. While broadcasters are impressed with their own capacity to 'go live' it seems unlikely that viewers care very much, but on News At Ten it has become something of an obsession. To have the reporter 'live' in the studio is considered pretty dull, so they are obliged to go out with a camera and stand in front of some symbol of their expertise, even if it is pitch dark (economics specialists favour a brass wall-plate saying 'The Treasury'), and then conduct a technologically complicated conversation which they might just as well be having in the warm back at base. Apparently on this occasion the court correspondent was standing in front of Buckingham Palace and was announcing that the sovereign had returned home. The snag was that having begun her two-way with the mandatory 'Trevor' - a useage which is supposed to establish anchorman Trevor McDonald in the public mind as a tremendously amiable godhead, master of all he surveys but still one heck of a feller chatting on first name terms with all those people - she then omitted any indication of a comma and thus invented someone called Trevor the Queen. Thus can pretentiousness trip you up. It seems such a shame that all this razzmatazz should be tacked onto News At Ten, of all programmes. Whatever your feelings about NUJ or Equity presenters, News At Ten was for many years a pretty level headed sort of affair which conveyed a sense of being there simply to give you the news straight from the shoulder, no messing. Now it opens with airship shots over London, a romantic overhead view of the ITN building in Gray's Inn Road, and then a swooping Hollywood zoom through the high-tech newsroom, bathed in a blue haze of light, to find the American-modelled lone anchorman heroically holding the floor. You begin to wonder whether they have all watched Broadcast News too often and started to believe in their own star quality. Worse is to come. News at Ten has taken techniques from yoof series and graphics from America and created the most mind-bogglingly over elaborate image to be seen anywhere on British television. On top of a blue background is laid a white grille. Over the white grille an oddly inaccurate map of Europe (have a look at France). In front of the map a whole stack of monitor screens. On the screens very often a mug-shot of somebody shown almost as big as McDonald, frequently with some sort of symbol or logo, and usually a word or two in capital letters pulled at random from the script: 'RELIEF OPERATION' for instance, or 'NEW ROUTES' or 'GAS SPLIT'. These add not one iota to viewer understanding but make the screen look busy and significant. In front of all this lot sits McDonald himself. The irony is that often, when a graphic is really needed - to show how the light might have caused the fire in Windsor Castle for instance - ITN's is much better than the BBC's. But then the same goes for the most basic and important part of the content: the reports. When direct comparisons can be made, ITN's reports are often better. For example Geoffrey Archer's recent pieces from a dangerous bit of road in Bosnia were consistently clearer and more comprehensive than the BBC's. (Though to be fair the best reporter in Somalia has quite definitely been the BBC's excellent George Alagaiah.) But the new News At Ten spoils all this by absurd catchphrases and silly bits of linking script. McDonald keeps on saying 'Coming next, more of the day's news' as though we might have been expecting some conjuring tricks. At least they seem, in the past few days, to have decided it is a bad idea to include a big 'Focus' item in every edition. Some of these mini current affairs programmes were good, some - such as last week's on 'her-rassment' (heavy handed heterosexuality at work) - were merely tired re-runs of features which have already been done to death by national newspapers. None seemed to have much justification in a flagship news programme, so it is good to see the idea being re-thought. However, this move seems to have coincided with greater determination than ever to find sensational stories for the top of the programme. During last Thursday's opening item on what was said repeatedly to be 'systematic and organised rape' in Croatia (a horror tale told about French victims in the First World War and Belgians in World War 2) it turned out that ITN could produce not one single woman who would substantiate the story. Perhaps this will turn out not to be the paradigm for the re-designed ITV. Maybe we shall all be pleasantly surprised at the civilised and sophisticated nature of the new network. Perhaps in 1993 there'll be pink pigs over the white cliffs of Dover.</p>

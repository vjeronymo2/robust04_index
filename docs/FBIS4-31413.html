			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Janusz Grela, head of the National </F> Employment Office, by correspondent Teresa Kwasniewska; place  and date not given]    [Text] [Kwasniewska] How much do we spend on unemployment  in Poland?    [Grela] The estimated figure for this year is 42 trillion  zlotys [Z]--that is, $2 billion.    [Kwasniewska] And how much does it cost for an employment  office to attend to one unemployed person?    [Grela] In 1993 it cost approximately Z400,000--that is,  just over Z30,000 per month. On average, last year in Poland  the Employment Fund spent Z11.7 million on each unemployed  person. To add these costs up, one unemployed person costs  Poland Z12.1 million a year. It is estimated that this year the  amount could rise to Z14.5 million.    [Kwasniewska] Is this much or little?    [Grela] Compared with other countries, these costs are low.  Among other things, this is related to the national income  level. On the other hand, we record very low expenditure on  active forms of combating unemployment. This year 13 percent of  the total sum allocated to unemployment expenditure will be  spent on it--and we know that there are countries in which 50  percent of the available funds are used in this way.    [Kwasniewska] We have not yet discussed the other,  associated costs of unemployment, which are, perhaps, less easy  to measure and more difficult to evaluate or illustrate in  statistical terms. Nevertheless, they are extremely  burdensome....    [Grela] Indeed. They involve the losses and disadvantages  suffered by society in general as a result of the fact that 3  million Poles are unemployed. These costs are probably five or  six times as high as the total value of the financial resources  at the disposal of the Employment Fund. Professor Kabaj  estimates that, in 1993, they amounted to Z150-180 trillion.  These costs affect society at many levels and are the result of  social pathology, family breakdown, lack of motivation to work,  restriction of future prospects, and so on.    [Kwasniewska] The employment office is the first "contact  point" for the unemployed. How can its work be made more  efficient and effective?    [Grela] When the funds are insufficient, we must make  choices and establish a hierarchy of priorities. Consequently,  we decided to invest in regional rather than voivodship  employment offices and to allocate the sum of Z17.5 billion for  their needs. Of course, that sum is far too low when set  against the existing needs. However, we cannot afford more at  the present moment.    It will also be necessary to reform the very structure of  the  employment offices and to get rid of the excessively developed  system of departments, sections, and so on. I believe that I  have the moral right to make such decisions. I began with  myself. When I first assumed this post, I carried out a  reorganization of the Employment Office's central structures.  There were more departments here than at the Ministry of Labor  itself, so we had an unimaginable degree of "managementization"  (25 percent) and a truly excessive proportion of consultants.  So I reduced the number of executive management positions  because they constituted mere organizational decoration and had  absolutely no justification from the viewpoint of the nature of  our work here. However, the range and definition of our tasks  and duties have, of course, remained unchanged. I believe that  similar changes should be introduced in regional and voivodship  employment offices.    [Kwasniewska] On average, how many unemployed are there  per employment center officer?    [Grela] About 300. However, there is great differentiation  in the figures here--which is entirely unjustified. This is  another thing that is causing me much concern. In some  employment centers, there are on average 170 unemployed per  officer, and in others more than 400. This means that people  work harder there for the same salary. Obviously, this requires  some adjustment.    [Kwasniewska] In effect, the employment office has two roles  to play: economic and social. Which of them is it better  equipped to play?    [Grela] It fulfills its role in the social sphere reasonably  well. We pay unemployment benefits to those without work, we  refer them to public works, and so on. However, we must now  move on to a higher level of activity. That is, we should stop  talking about the labor market policy and start talking about an  employment policy. In other words, we must protect existing  jobs and create new ones. Our first line of action should be to  guarantee job security. To this end, we should place more  emphasis on developing our employment agency operations, career  advisory service, and vocational retraining schemes for the  unemployed. We should also develop loan schemes for new  individual business ventures. All these projects do not require  huge sums of money at all, and they can be easily made more  effective using the employment office restructuring funds  available from the budget now.    Another line of action we should pursue is that of placing  greater stress on the organization of public works, emergency  works, and a whole range of seasonal and temporary jobs. This  could also provide steady work for a considerable number of  unemployed. We have another project connected with this line of  action, but the problem is that there is no legislative basis  for allocating money from our budget for it. Some countries  that have had many years of experience in dealing with the  problem of unemployment operate job-seeking skills programs,  which consist of bringing groups of unemployed people together  and training them in how to apply for new jobs and present  themselves to potential employers. They also brief them on  existing employment legislation and regulations, changes in the  labor code (for example, new regulations affecting women  returning to work after maternity leave), and so on.    [Kwasniewska] The Polish Psychological Society runs similar  "training groups...."    [Grela] Indeed. And if they show that something like 40  percent of the young unemployed do indeed find jobs after  attending their courses, it may well provide the necessary  stimulus for the creation of further special schemes of this  kind by, say, employment clubs.    [Kwasniewska] Have any particularly intensive schemes been  introduced in areas where unemployment is more rife than  elsewhere? For example, in Western Pomerania?    [Grela] So far, we have not had any spectacular successes in  these areas. The basic assistance we are able to extend to  those regions is that we are able to direct more resources there  from the Employment Fund. On the other hand, investors are  still rather reluctant to locate their capital there, despite  considerable tax concessions and other advantageous schemes open  to them. As a result, this year we plan to concentrate mainly  on extending our assistance in the financing of infrastructural  investment projects in regions where unemployment is a  particular threat. In addition, a special government-trade  union task group appointed by the Office of the Council of  Ministers' Sociopolitical Committee will soon begin to identify  the regions requiring special help.    [Kwasniewska] How many unemployed do we have today?    [Grela] The latest figure stands at 2,889,000. April was  the third successive month in which the number of unemployed  fell (by 64,000). It is still possible that this is a seasonal  phenomenon, which usually occurs with the approach of summer.  But, at the same time, it is certainly the consequence of  making better use of the funds allocated to public and emergency  works schemes and other similar employment projects. For  example, in February of this year, we financed only 25 percent  of job offers from the Employment Fund resources, whereas in  both March and April the relevant figures were 40 percent.    [Kwasniewska] What about school leavers? The summer  vacation is approaching, and so a new generation of college and  university graduates will be leaving their educational  establishments soon....    [Grela] This problem truly gives us nightmares. As soon  as they get their entitlement to benefits in the fall, we want  to provide jobs for them. It would be a shame to waste all of  that intellectual and career potential.... Apart from that  argument, it is terribly demoralizing for young people who,  having graduated from their schools, have nothing better to do  than sit at home aimlessly....    [Kwasniewska] Local initiatives could work wonders here.    [Grela] I keep saying: Unemployment is a problem for all of  us. Also for parish authorities. Without cooperation with  local milieus and self-government structures, employment offices  will be unable to discharge their obligations properly. At the  moment, they are still too isolated in their fight against  unemployment and have to bear the lion's share of that burden  alone. One solution here would be to galvanize various  nongovernmental organizations and associations into action.  Examples of various initiatives among the "grass roots" prove  that we ourselves can do much for "our own" unemployed.</p>

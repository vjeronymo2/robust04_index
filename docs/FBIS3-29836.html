Garten, the  undersecretary of commerce for international trade, has been  invited by the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren)  to make a speech at a forum March 4.    The official at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) said Tokyo wants the United States to understand  its efforts in light of the impasse in bilateral talks on a new  trade framework.    Japan is considering ways to speed up the opening of its  markets and will hold a meeting of cabinet ministers Friday to  discuss additional deregulation programs. The new plans will be  explained to Garten as Japan's initiative to solve the impasse,  the official said.    Garten is a chief negotiator in the area of automobile and  auto parts under the framework talks. He will be visiting Tokyo  on his way home from a trip to several Asian countries.</p>

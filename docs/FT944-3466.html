			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / No chance for quiet evolution amid revolution: John Gapper explains why changes at the top of Schroders are causing a stir Under other circumstances, the news that Mr Win Bischoff is to succeed Mr George Mallinckrodt as chairman of Schroders, the UK investment bank, might not attract much attention. 'I would be very surprised if it came as a surprise to anyone here. It is totally evolutionary,' said Mr Mallinckrodt yesterday. But in the week after SG Warburg's announcement that it intends to merge with Morgan Stanley, the move is likely to renew speculation about Schroders' future. In particular, it begs the question of whether Schroders will become a fully integrated investment bank by acquiring a UK broker. Schroders already distributes equity in the US through its now wholly-owned subsidiary Wertheim Schroder, but has not yet followed Warburg and others in acquiring UK distribution. Its conservative policy during the Big Bang deregulation of the City in 1986 has served it well, but could change. 'We were asked at the time of Big Bang, 'Where does that leave Schroders?' This is another Big Bang, a global one, and hopefully we will answer the question correctly,' says Mr Bischoff, who has helped Mr Mallinckrodt to set Schroders' strategy since their dual appointment in 1984. The danger is that by following Warburg's strategy of UK integration combined with ambitious global expansion, it would simply over-burden itself with costs. But if it does not buy a broker, such as Cazenove &amp; Co or Smith New Court, it could eventually lose access to distribution. 'Our vested interest must be in Cazenove and Smith New Court remaining independent. That does not cost us any money,' says Mr Mallinckrodt. Yet Schroders' senior executives accept that they could be forced to make a different decision if other banks start to buy the brokers it uses. 'If the marketplace requires something else, that is what we will do. We won't do it just because other people are doing it,' says Mr Bischoff, who will not comment on suggestions that Schroders has expressed interest in buying NM Rothschild's 25 per cent stake in Smith New Court. These questions are partly prompted by its rapid growth between 1984 and 1993. Net asset value more than quadrupled and staff grew from 2,630 to 3,911. It has also gained plaudits from analysts for its relatively low exposure to volatile trading income. Yet it remains collegial, with all but one vote in 10 years on the group executive committee being unanimous. 'We are not a bunch of yes men. Debate is vigorous, but when we make a decision we stick to it,' says Mr Peter Sedgwick, head of its asset management arm, who is to become vice-chairman. One reason for what Mr Mallinckrodt calls 'a partnership feeling' is that it remains largely controlled by the Schroder family, which holds more than 40 per cent of its equity. One token of this is Mr Mallinckrodt, who is married to the sister of Mr Bruno Schroder, the leading family shareholder. Mr Mallinckrodt says having the backing of shareholders who 'have been through some substantial vagaries in the past 190 years' helps to give the bank stability, although Mr Bischoff emphasises that stability has been combined with sufficient financial strength to finance growth out of earnings. Its investment management arm has expanded funds under management to Pounds 60bn. Mr Sedgwick argues that it has already achieved some of the inroads into the US pension fund market which has been cited as a benefit of merger for Mercury Asset Management, which is 75 per cent owned by Warburg. Yet management stability will now be tested. As the bank has grown, the management task has become more complex. It includes overseeing Wertheim Schroder, which employs 1,200 people, as well as expanding operations in the Asia Pacific and other emerging markets where Schroders is strong. Mr Bischoff argues that Schroders cannot simply sit back with its current mix of business. 'Once you say to yourself that you can stop a strategy of growth, you're on a slippery slope.' But he says it would be 'mathematically impossible' to sustain recent growth rates. Schroders' record of ignoring siren voices may give it more chance than others of avoiding pitfalls in the second Big Bang. Yet it will have to pick its way carefully to maintain growth without committing errors and incurring the cost burdens that weighed down Warburg.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SCHRODERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               1984    1985   1986   1987   1988   1989  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Profit after tax (Pounds m)   15.1    29.2   72.2   27.1   30.1   46.6 Net asset value (Pounds m)     164   171.6  221.1  227.4  254.7   31.6 Earnings per share            12.1p   13.0p  16.7p  21.6p  23.9p  37.0p  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               1990    1991   1992   1993    % increase                                                              1984-1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Profit after tax (Pounds m)   31.6    54.4   69.6  104.3           829 Net asset value (Pounds m)   310.2   360.6  545.6  674.5           311 Earnings per share            25.0p   41.1p  54.6p 109.2p          802  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Schroders  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

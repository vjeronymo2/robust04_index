			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Zaporizhzhya Atomic Electric </F> Power Plant [AES] Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow"]    [Text] Last year, Zaporizhzhya atomic engineers alone  produced 27,567,000 million kilowatt-hours of electric energy.  Over the last year, the share of the AES's in Ukraine's power  engineering rose from 29 to 33 percent.    However, unfortunately, alongside this, there also are other  kinds of increase. Over 1993, at the Zaporizhzhya AES, for  example, there were 79 cases of faulty operation of power units.    Among other problems, there is the shortage of funds for  purchasing nuclear fuel in Russia. As a consequence, the fuel  could only be purchased for three out of five units, at which  fuel must be reloaded this year.    Specialists of the Zaporizhzhya AES themselves decided to  tackle the problem of storing the used fuel directly in the  plant's industrial area. A contract has been concluded between  the "Zaporizhzhya AES" Production Association and the U.S.  company "Duke Power" on constructing temporary dry-storage  depots. Today, this is the safest and the most reliable design.</p>

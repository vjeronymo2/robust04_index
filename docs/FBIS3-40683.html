			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thomas Abraham: "Scrambling for Markets"] </F>   [Text] Seven years after its acrimonious beginning in the  Uruguayan seaside resort of Punta del Esta, the Uruguay Round of  world trade negotiations finally came to a conclusion in Geneva  with a ceremonial tap of the gavel by General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Director-General Peter Sutherland.    The 400-page document that has emerged is the most  comprehensive, and easily the most controversial, that has ever  been negotiated under the aegis of GATT. On the surface, the  negotiations were about the seemingly simple issue of reducing  barriers to international trade and stimulating global economic  growth through greater trade. But in practice, they were about a  frantic scramble for new markets by the world's leading  economies. The United States, Europe and lately Japan, mired in  their worst recession for a decade, needed a new round of tariff  cuts and opening up of export markets to stimulate their  economies. The Uruguay Round was the instrument through which  this was to be achieved.    Throughout the session, the virtues of free trade and the  all-round stimulus to growth that would result from trade  liberalisation were stressed repeatedly. The rich and the poor,  the developed and the developing, would all benefit from the  liberalisation of world trade, everyone from the GATT  Director-General down repeatedly insisted. Studies by  organisations such as the World Bank and the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that showed a  $217-230 billion increase in global income as a result of the  Uruguay Round were widely publicised.    But there was a big gap between the negotiating strategies  of  the big powers and their devotion to free trade. Both the United  States and the European Community (E.C.) fought like alley cats  for most of the seven-year period to preserve their own markets  while opening up the other's. While the theory of comparative  advantage was meant to provide the economic rationale for the  benefits that would flow from trade liberalisation, in practice  the behaviour of the United States and the E.C. was based more  on mercantilist principles. Both sides did their best to keep  their own markets closed in areas where they felt they were  weak, while trying hard to open up the other's markets in areas  were they felt they were strong. In other words, they were  extremely keen on exporting more, but reluctant to import more.    The question of trade in agriculture, which bedevilled the  negotiations until the very end, proved a case in point. The  United States, which is a comparatively more efficient  agricultural producer than the E.C., was determined to open up  the protected European market for agricultural products, and  also ensure reductions in the E.C.'s subsidised farm exports.  This would ensure U.S. farmers a greater market share in both  the E.C. and in third countries where a cut in E.C. export  subsidies would give U.S. products an advantage. The E.C.,  fearing that thousands of its farmers would be forced to leave  the land, fought back. Eventually, the Europeans were forced to  yield despite significant opposition from France.    However, the U.S. behaviour in the area of textiles was  quite  different. Here, under pressure from its powerful textile lobby,  the United States did whatever it could to keep its market as  protected as possible. India was one of the prominent victims of  the tough U.S. line. The U.S. and the E.C. members had  campaigned to preserve the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) which  sets quotas on developing country textile exports to these  countries. The Uruguay Round agreement sets a 10-year transition  period at the end of which the MFA is to be wound up and the  trade in textiles freed from quota restrictions. The United  States had threatened to try and extend the MFA phase-out period  to 15 years, while India was trying to get the speed at which  quota restrictions would be lifted quickened. Textiles form a  quarter of India's manufactured exports, and perhaps the only  tangible benefit from the round will be an eventual unfettered  access to developed country markets for Indian textiles.    The showdown between India and the United States occurred on  December 14, the day before the Uruguay Round was completed. The  U.S. Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, met the Indian  Ambassador to GATT, B.K. Zutshi, and demanded that India open up  its textile market to U.S. imports, failing which the United  States would put in an amendment to the Uruguay Round draft  slowing the speed at which Indian textiles would be able to  enter the U.S. market.    This was a blatantly unfair demand which went against a  basic  GATT principle of not bargaining for concessions within the same  sector. Thus, in return for opening up its markets to Indian  textiles, the United States was justified in asking India to  open up its markets in some other area, such as machine tools or  electronics. But asking for concessions within the same sector  is not done, since among other things it goes against the basic  principle of trade based on comparative advantage.    To its credit, the Government of India stood firm. Pakistan  was the only other country targeted by the United States, and  both countries presented a united front to the United States and  the E.C. in a night-long bargaining session that ended at 3 a.m.  Both India and Pakistan refused to accept any slowing down of  the speed at which MFA restrictions are lifted. The United  States finally backed down, perhaps one of the few occasions in  these negotiations when it did so.    As the negotiations came to a close, the developed countries  made it clear they had got a worse deal than the developing  countries. In return for vast concessions in areas such as  services and intellectual property, they felt they had not got  enough in terms of access for their products into Western  markets. But it was also clear that the U.S. juggernaut had been  unstoppable, and that once the United States and the E.C.  patched up their differences and acted together, there was  little the rest of the world could do. The long-term impact of  the Uruguay Round will take a long time to be felt and judged.  Many of its provisions will only come into effect in five to 10  years' time and it is only then that one would really be able to  tell what its effect on the global economy will be.    However, it is useful to have an understanding of the main  provisions:    Reduction of industrial tariffs: Participants have  agreed on an average cut of between 30 and 40 per cent in  tariffs or the import duties they levy on goods. The world's  main trading countries have also agreed to scrap import duties  in a number of areas such as pharmaceuticals, construction  equipment, furniture, beer, wood, paper and toys. Indian  exporters of these products to the E.C. and the United States  should benefit. India has offered a trade-weighted average cut  of around 50 per cent on its tariffs on raw materials,  intermediates and capital goods, but no changes in the area of  consumer goods imports.    Services: The Uruguay Round has included services  for the first time in GATT trade negotiations. It provides for  the basic GATT principles of most-favoured-nation (MFN)  treatment, though it also allows exceptions to this rule. Though  the basic rules of trade in services have been set out, concrete  market-opening negotiations have met with little success. Thus,  in areas such as financial services, telecommunications,  maritime services and the movement of personnel, negotiations  will continue to determine the level of access to foreign  markets. In other areas such as construction and tourism there  has been a fair deal of progress. India is primarily interested  in getting a good agreement on the movement of personnel, which  will allow Indian professionals to travel freely to the  developed world to provide services on a short-term basis. India  has made offers in the area of construction and value-added  telecommunications. An offer on financial services was withdrawn  after the United States decided it was going to adopt a  "two-tier approach" on financial services. The West was  interested in getting access to the Indian insurance market, but  this has not been granted.    Agriculture: This is a major area of controversy  between the United States, the E.C. and several  agriculture-exporting countries such as Australia and Argentina.  The agreement is intended to reduce the level of subsidies the  United States and the E.C. pay to their farmers and also cut  back on subsidised food exports. The aim is to benefit more  efficient agriculture producers, including several in the  developing countries. Under the agreement, certain types of farm  subsidies are to be reduced by 20 per cent over six years, while  export subsidies are to be cut by 36 per cent over the same  period. It also calls for the opening up of a minimum of 3 per  cent of the domestic market to imports. As for India, its level  of subsidies is below the 10 per cent cut-off level. As far as  the import commitment is concerned, the Government plans to take  recourse to GATT provisions that allow countries with balance of  payments problems to impose import restrictions. There were also  potential problems in the text relating to Indian stockpiles of  food for the public distribution system which have apparently  been resolved.    Intellectual property: For India, this has been  the most controversial aspect of the Uruguay Round. Intellectual  property was bulldozed into it by the United States where there  has been a large outcry about the "piracy of intellectual  property." Until 1989, India refused to discuss the issue and  then abruptly changed its stance. Under the current agreement,  the Indian Patent Act of 1970 will have to be amended to  introduce product patents for food, chemicals and  pharmaceuticals. This will involve changes in the way certain  sections of the Indian pharmaceutical industry operate. Under  the current patent regime, Indian manufacturers have been free  to produce drugs patented abroad by using a different process.  This will change now, and a rise in the prices of certain drugs  are predicted. It is, however, also useful to note that with  this change, the Indian patent system reverts to its pre-1970  status, where products and processes were patented. The Uruguay  Round agreement will also oblige India to provide intellectual  property protection to new plant varieties and will make  microorganisms patentable, two areas which have justifiably  aroused a great deal of passion. However, the rights of farmers  and breeders to use and re-use patented seed material is not  threatened, since governments too have the power the build in  adequate safeguards.[sentence as printed]    Creation of a new trade organisation: A World  Trade Organisation (WTO) has been created to replace the  existing GATT Secretariat in Geneva and administer the Uruguay  Round agreements. In many ways, this is more than 40 years  overdue. When GATT was signed in 1947, it was intended that an  International Trade Organisation (ITO) would be created. A  charter was drawn up, but due to U.S. opposition it never got  off the ground. The United States finally gave assent to the  creation of a new organisation.    Stronger multilateral trade rules and better dispute  settlement: One of the gains to countries like India from a  stronger multilateral organisation could be that unilateral  trade action by the United States and other giants of world  trade will be curbed. While Section 301 will remain in the  United States statute books, it cannot be used in areas which  come under the Uruguay Round. Any dispute under the Uruguay  Round agreements will have to go through the multilateral  dispute settlement procedures.    Textiles: Textile and clothing exports into the  developed countries are restricted by quotas set under the MFA.  Textile exporters such as India have struggled to get the MFA  restrictions removed as quickly as possible, but have run into  stiff opposition from the United States and European textile  lobbies. The MFA will be wound up in 10 years' time from 1995.  Its quotas will gradually be lifted over this period, but the  lifting will be so gradual that its impact will only be felt at  the end of the 10-year period.</p>

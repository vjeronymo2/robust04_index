			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kredietbank ahead at mid-year KREDIETBANK, one of Belgium's biggest private banks, increased net consolidated profit to BFr4.96bn (Dollars 145m) in the first half of 1993. The group said profits had risen by 17 per cent from the BFr4.2bn of net profits calculated for the equivalent period. Direct comparison was not possible because of the change in Kredietbank's year-end in 1992. The group forecast full-year profit 'in line with the trend of the past years', during which it has recorded average annual increases of 13 per cent. In 1992, group profits rose by 14.3 per cent to BFr8.47bn, restated for a full year. The group is to pay an additional non-recurring net interim dividend of BFr90 per share next month, linked to the change in the year end. Kredietbank said the strong increase in profit in the first half was due to a 'sharp expansion in activity', improved control over costs, and better risk management. The group's balance sheet total, for example, has risen by 7.8 per cent since the end of December 1992, from BFr2,279bn to BFr2,458bn. At the same time, current operating costs have risen only 3.2 per cent, while the ratio of costs to gross income has come down from 58.4 per cent at the end of 1992 to 55.1 per cent. Profit before tax rose by 32 per cent to BFr7.98bn in the first half, but the elimination of a number of tax-deductible losses, particularly on bad debts to 'problem countries', led to a strong rise in taxation.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / People: Allen, Tenneco's liaison in Europe Tenneco has put Ken Allen, a 14-year company veteran whose strengths lie in law and finance, in charge of managing its operations in Europe, writes Laurie Morse. Tenneco has not had a co-ordinating executive in Europe for many years, and Allen's appointment, the company says, is evidence of its commitment to achieving a truly global presence in all its businesses. Allen will serve as liaison officer between Tenneco's five companies - Albright and Wilson Chemicals; Case farm and construction equipment; Monroe and Walker auto parts; Packaging Corporation of America, and Tenneco Gas - and serve on Tenneco's European Advisory Council. Just as important, he will serve as the eyes and ears in the Europe for Dana Mead, Tenneco's chairman. Tenneco, with Dollars 13bn in sales in 1993, has spent the past two years stabilising and revitalising its US operations. Now it is seeking overseas investments. Allen's job, in part, is to pinpoint business opportunities and takeover targets for the company. 'Ken Allen is a good man for this job,' says Mead. 'He's a lawyer fellow who has run companies himself, and has headed environmental and risk management departments, which when considering operations in Eastern Bloc countries these days, is very important. He has experience with acquisition financing, and will be a catalyst for our businesses over there.' The 55-year-old Allen, who is based in London, reports directly to Mead. Allen spent much of his early career in the insurance industry, coming to Tenneco from Southwestern Life in 1980 when it was acquired by Tenneco. By the time Tenneco sold Southwestern Life in 1986, Allen had risen to become its chief executive. He served as Tenneco's deputy general counsel from 1987 until being named managing director for Tenneco Europe on August 1.</p>

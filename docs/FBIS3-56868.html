Speaking at a news conference for Russian and foreign  journalists, Chernomyrdin stressed that "the course of  continuing and deepening reforms that was adopted in 1993  remains unchanged, and the government will not retreat from it".    The head of the government said: "Crisis phenomena are  subsiding much more slowly than was expected. January of this  year is being marked by an exacerbation of financial problems  and a serious acceleration of inflation". At present, the  average weekly increase in prices is over 4 percent, and the  volume of output is only 85 percent of the December level.    The prime minister said that there would be an enlarged  session of the government sometime during the first 10 days of  February, at which there would be detailed discussion of "what  has been successful, what has been unsuccessful, and why and  what needs to be done as a priority task in 1994".</p>

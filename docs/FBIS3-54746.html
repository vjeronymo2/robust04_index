In his view, because only 50 percent of the Russian MPs were  elected on party lists while the others, in electoral districts,  these talks infringe on the rights of deputies who are not  members of the four parties.    He thinks that reduction of the government headquarters  might  "weaken" the government in which he is a vice premier and step  up the confrontation between the executive and legislative  branches.    He did not rule out the possibility that he, Aleksandr  Shokhin and some others would not be included in the new  government.</p>

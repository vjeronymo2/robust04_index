			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (7): Steel revival beset by doubts - Kunal Bose asks if the state can reverse a sharp fall in exports The 35-year Durgapur Steel Plant, part of the government-owned Steel Authority of India Limited, is preparing to give a lead in the revival of West Bengal's steel industries. According to Mr YP Sharma, managing director, when the modernisation of the steel plant is completed at a cost of more than Rs40bn by the end of 1994, 'it will not only be making better quality steel at lower cost, but its production will increase to 1.88m tonnes from 600,000 tonnes.' Since nearly half that production will be in the form of billets - DSP now makes only finished steel products - Mr Sharma expects a large number of new units to be built in the state to convert the billets to rods and bars. It is hoped that the investment in modernisation along with the improvement in work practices will enable DSP, with an accumulated loss of Rs10bn, to start earning profits. In the meantime, DSP's nextdoor neighbour, Alloy Steels Plant has been modernised in two phases and its capacity increased to 180,000 tonnes of saleable special steel. However, less than 50km away at Burnpur, the trade unions continue to put up strong resistance to the federal government's move to privatise the Indian Iron &amp; Steel Company which owns a 75-year-old steel plant. Even though the government has decided to hand over IISCO to Mukand, a steel group with headquarters in Bombay, which plans to invest Rs32bn no one knows exactly when the privatisation will occur. Earlier Mr Jyoti Basu, chief minister of West Bengal, wanted Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of the UK based Caparo Group, to modernise IISCO. But he declined after learning that he would not 'have a free hand in the management and the government will have a role in choosing the new technology for IISCO'. Whatever happens, the IISCO modernisation cannot be postponed any longer if the plant is to be saved. The important thing for the government is to make the unions understand this. The secondary steel units in the state which produce the metal by using electric arc furnaces are having a tough time. Of 16 such units, with a combined capacity of about 300,000 tonnes, only four are working. 'I don't see any chance of the steel making sector's revival in the foreseeable future. The recession has made the secondary producers highly uncompetitive. To make matters worse for the West Bengal based units, they have to pay nearly Rs750 a tonne extra for the imported scrap as they are far from the sea-based ports,' says Mr JP Chowdhury, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce. However, fresh investment in steelmaking using the blast furnace route makes sense. And there are quite a few such investment proposals in the pipeline in West Bengal. Birla Technical Services has teamed up with a state government undertaking to invest Rs3.5bn in setting up a 550,000 tonne capacity pig iron plant. Century Industries, another Birla company, is to build a pig iron factory in the state. The 90,000 tonne capacity pig iron project of the Tatas at Kharagpur is to be commissioned shortly. According to Mr Bidyut Ganguly, industries minister, the state government is aware of a Rs6.5bn investment proposal for a steel plant with Lurgi technology. The improvement in infrastructure, particularly in the supply of power, has made West Bengal an ideal location for setting up steel units. The state's engineering industry, indeed, provides an interesting case study in contradictions. On the one hand, there is IFB Industries, which exports the major portion of its production of high precision fine blanked components to European vehicle manufacturers; on the other hand, there are any number of foundries which are either closed or sick. In the same group as IFB is Modern Malleables, manufacturer of equipment and accessories for power transmission and distribution systems, which earns nearly 90 per cent of its revenue from exports. In spite of the globalisation of business by a few engineering units, West Bengal's share of the country's engineering exports declined to 16 per cent in 1992 from about 67 per cent in 1966. According to Mr GD Shah, of the Engineering Export Promotion Council, the reason for the sharp decline in West Bengal's export share is that 'the state largely exports items like sanitary castings.' Nevertheless, the volume of engineering exports has improved of late. 'Rationalisation of cargo handling operation by Calcutta Port has helped,' points out Mr Shah, himself a big exporter. Now that there has been a big improvement in the supply of power, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation expects that entrepreneurs from within and outside the state will set up new engineering units to avail themselves of locally available skills. Electrosteel recently commissioned the country's first ductile iron pipe manufacturing unit in West Bengal. Hindustan Motors, the country's second largest car manufacturer, is to produce a new range of automotive components at its Uttarpara factory, mainly for the export market. But the state government does not know what to do with its many sick engineering units. It does not have the resources to nurse them back to health, but the federal government will not have anything to do with them. However hard the state government tries, it will not find many takers for the sick units. Most of them should be allowed to die a natural death.</p>

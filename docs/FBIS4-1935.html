			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The Basic Law of the  Macao Special Administrative Region reflects the "one country,  two systems" principle and complies with Macao's features and  reality, a senior official said here today.    Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress, made the remark at a meeting to mark  the first anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law.    He said, "as there are only five years or so for the  transition period, we will follow the stipulations of the Basic  Law and make preparations for transfer of power and smooth  transition. It is necessary to give the whole nation, including  Macao compatriots, an understanding of basic state principles  and policies towards Macao through publicity on the Basic Law."    At present, the Chinese and Portuguese Governments have  cooperated well and made smooth progress on the Macao issue,  which will promote the smooth transition of power and the  economic development and prosperity of Macao, he said.    Ma Man-kei, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political consultative Conference, said that  since the promulgation of the Basic Law, both the Chinese and  Portuguese sides and the local legislators have reached  consensus on convergence with the Basic Law.    He urged the Macao Government to cooperate more actively in  accelerating various activities, including the solution of  various specific issues, to ensure smooth convergence with the  Basic Law.</p>

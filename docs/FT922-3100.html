			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rain threatens US wheat crop ALTHOUGH SHOWERS in the Midwest are easing fears of another US drought, too much rain in Texas and Oklahoma has contributed to concern about the winter wheat harvest at a time when US wheat stocks are already at their lowest level for years. Even without the weather considerations, the US Department of Agriculture yesterday projected tightened wheat supplies for 1992-93 as a result of reductions in expected yields and planted acreage. Stocks at the end of 1992-93 were projected at 427m bushels, down 22m from last month's estimates. Harvesting in two of the three largest winter wheat-producing states has been delayed by the excessive rain, and the cotton crop in Texas may also be damaged. The US Farm Bureau is estimating the total wheat crop at between 2.15bn and 2.2bn bushels, up from last year's unimpressive 1.98bn bushels. There is no fear at all of tight wheat stocks worldwide. Smaller crops predicted for the US, Morocco and South Africa are more than offset by a larger projected output in the European Community and China. Canada's surplus stocks from last year have turned out to be higher than had been calculated. Dr Norton Strommen, the USDA meteorologist, yesterday said recent rains in Kansas have been sufficient for the maturing wheat. In Illinois, development of maize and soyabeans has been slowed by dry weather. This week's showers have been insufficient, but more rain was expected in the next 36 hours. Worldwide, cotton production is expected to exceed use by 5m bales, resulting in a further gain in stocks. With several countries aiming to maintain production despite lower world prices, output is forecast at 94m bales, only 1 per cent below last year's record. The global oilseed crop is running about 3 per cent higher than last year. Paraguay's soyabeans have been hurt by dry weather and US soyabean production is projected at 52.1m tonnes, down from an estimated 54.4m last year.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Tax credit on dividends defended Abolition of the tax credit on dividends would 'blow a Pounds 50bn hole in pension funds', says a research note published today by Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank. City concern about government taxation policy has risen in the wake of speeches from Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, linking high dividend payouts to a lack of UK investment. Investors fear that the tax credit on dividends, which was cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent in the March 1993 Budget, might be reduced further or even abolished. 'Abolition of the tax credit on dividends would slash 20 per cent off the gross yield on the UK equity market,' says Kleinwort Benson. The average pension fund holds 56 per cent of its assets in UK equities, so such a change would knock about 11 per cent off the actuarial value of the fund. This would create a shortfall of about Pounds 50bn because the current market value of UK pension funds is about Pounds 500bn. Kleinwort Benson says UK companies would have to increase their pension-fund contributions to fill this hole, and this would reduce their ability to invest. Furthermore, the fall in equity markets that would follow would make equity funding for companies more expensive. Mr Dorrell has said tax changes would not be made until the government could 'identify the improvement we seek' and 'establish that tax changes are the best means of achieving it'.</p>

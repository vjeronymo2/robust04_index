			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trading in Tarmac THE building area of the market was again rife with speculation that a heavy cash call is in the offing from Tarmac, still regarded as one of the UK's biggest housebuilders. Talk of a Pounds 200m rights issue from Tarmac has been in the market for some time, but building sector specialists are now looking for the group to call on its shareholders to boost its balance sheet and take advantage of the expected recovery in the UK housing market. Tarmac shares have performed well in recent sessions, in spite of the persistent talk of a big cash call. Last week saw the shares feature prominently in the list of the most heavily traded stocks. Yesterday the shares were the London market's most active with more than 16m changing hands after a weekend during which the Sunday press highlighted the probability of a large fund-raising operation. Yesterday's turnover was the highest in a single session since December 1992 and included a single trade of 6m shares dealt at 145 1/2 p. The share price rose to 150p yesterday, fractionally below the year's peak, before slipping back and closing a net 1 1/2 up at 148 1/2 p. Tarmac shares have staged a strong recovery over the past year, picking up from an all-time low of 53p, reached in September 1992. Tarmac's interim results are scheduled for September 28. Building specialists said, however, that those figures could well be brought forward to accommodate a sizeable rights issue call. One leading analyst said a Pounds 200m issue 'would come as no great surprise', adding that Tarmac is seen as one of the sector's bellwethers, with substantial exposure at both the light and heavy end of the market. 'The market has been well and truly softened up for a cash call,' he added.</p>

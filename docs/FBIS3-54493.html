We will  resume the negotiations tomorrow, he said.    After a seven-hour meeting with the Israeli delegation, he  added: We hope to achieve results and we will continue the  negotiations on withdrawal.    Sha'th left the hotel at the end of the third round of  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations today to meet Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat at his residence in the al-Andalus  Palace.    In his statement, Sha'th said that throughout the day, the  two delegations exchanged working papers and are still doing so.    It was noted during the seven-hour meeting that a  Palestinian  delegation member was in constant touch with 'Arafat. MENA has  learned that if agreement is reached on the paper of  understanding on the crossings and Jericho, the Security  Committee will draft the agreement in its meetings in Taba next  week.    Responsible Palestinian sources told MENA that the Israeli  delegation still refuses to grant the Palestinian side  administrative supervision over the religious sites in Jabal  al-Qarantal and al-Maghtis. The sources added that some  progress was made on the crossings issue.    The Israeli delegation is made up of Uri Savir, director  general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry; Yo'el Singer, legal  adviser at the Israeli Foreign Ministry; and Uzi Dayan,  political planning director at the ministry.    The Palestinian delegation consists of Nabil Sha'th,  Palestine's Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id Kamal, and the head of the  PLO Economic Department, Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala'.    Two Egyptian Foreign Ministry officials and two Norwegian  Foreign Ministry officials are taking part in the meetings as  observers outside the conference hall.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / 'Money is not everything, but having no money is worse': The ideological dilemmas of the China that Zhu Rongji must tame WHEN IT was reported in China recently that someone had paid Yn400,000 (Pounds 47,000) for a goldfish, People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, was aghast. Launching a tirade rarely witnessed these days in its grey columns, the paper railed against 'shockingly uncivilised' behaviour of the nouveaux riches whom it accused of wanting nothing more than to flaunt their wealth. By way of example it related the episode of two entrepreneurs, or get ti hu, China's new class, who had set out to prove who was the wealthier by lighting an endless string of fire crackers, and when this contest ended inconclusively, they proceeded to set fire to handfuls of banknotes. 'People cannot see a trace of civilisation in these scenes,' People's Daily thundered. 'Instead we see ugliness, vulgarity, ignorance and stupidity . . .' Behind this outburst, and other similar imprecations against 'money worship' that are crowding China's official press, lies deepening concern over a get-rich-quick mood that appears to have overtaken the country, exemplified by several recent cases of massive fraud. One involved a pyramid scheme in which an entrepeneur built a shell company by issuing some Yn1bn of virtually worthless junk bonds to 100,000 investors. Another scam involved an attempt to skim the equivalent of Pounds 6.6bn from the Agriculture Bank of China using false letters of credit. With Chinese enterprises having engaged in the past year or so in a barely regulated bond-issuing binge it would be surprising if there were not vast wads of worthless paper floating around the country. China's embrace of capitalism, or to use its own phrase, 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', is proving painful for the authorities who must sense that old control mechanisms are crumbling, and mere words or even political directives are insufficient to hold back the entrepreneurial tide. In China, these days, nothing it seems, succeeds like excess. Greed, accompanied by pervasive corruption, is already causing political problems. Beijing has been obliged to rein in corrupt local officials who have stirred peasant militancy by extorting fees from hard-pressed farmers. The police have also been accused of falling victim to what Mr Jiang Xianjin, the vice minister for public security, described recently as 'money-oriented ideology'. The minister ordered 'public security organs at all levels' to clamp down on police extortion. The Communist party, unsure how to ride the new capitalist tiger, has intensified its campaign against corruption and money worship, the officially sanctioned term for what is clearly perceived as society's chief ill. But it is not clear that sterile demands to combat this modern disease are having much effect. Thus People's Daily's call for the broad masses to be educated in 'patriotism, collectivism, socialist thought and the spirit of working arduously for the great cause' is unlikely to have cut much ice with those it reported flaunting their wealth. But at another level the emphasis in China on getting rich is stirring a painful debate about the ethics of wealth and how to achieve material well-being. The agony columns of Chinese newspapers are full of plaintive letters from individuals who worry they are being left behind in the scramble for money, and yet had not been prepared for such traumas in a society where issues such as 'keeping up with the Wangs' stayed more or less in the background. Typical of these letters was one that appeared in the Tianjin Evening News from a factory technician who lamented that attending a party with former classmates recently he discovered that those whose 'pockets were bulging with money' were the ones who were naughtiest when they were in the lowest grades at school. Of himself, he said: 'It was people like me who finished university who looked shabby and poor.' Signing himself a 'useless man', the letter writer related his experience with his daughter whom he was using his meagre savings to educate at a fee-paying school, only to endure 'shame' when he discovered how much better off other children were who were being delivered to the school in cars and on motorcycles. The letter writer could perhaps be forgiven for being confused, buffeted by propaganda which on one hand has been urging Chinese to 'liberate their thoughts', 'change their brains', 'get rich', and 'seize the opportunity'; and on the other being told to adhere to old-fashioned notions of 'socialist morality' and 'selflessness'. Little wonder that people are perplexed if China's rulers themselves seem to be not quite sure whether they wish to advance to a glorious new entrepreneurial dawn or to fall back on to old methods and slogans. While most correspondence in China's party-controlled press reflects the official line that money-worship is bad, there have been exceptions such as a letter recently in the Workers' Daily. 'Some people say we should work arduously and live frugally, which is not a wrong slogan theoretically. But after all times are different now,' a writer said. 'For the past decades we became accustomed to living with a tightened belt. Now, reform and opening have brought a better life to people, why should we oppose money worship? 'We should pay some attention to moral issues,' the writer added. 'But I think the time to do it is not yet ripe, for I'm afraid. . . it would slow down the pace of people changing their brains and renewing their ideas. Therefore, the building of morality should come slowly.' While the writer did not say it outright, he appeared to be suggesting that the accumulation of wealth should be the primary goal after the austerity of the past 40 years. 'Money is not everything,' he wrote, 'but having no money is worse.' China's rulers would seem to have their work cut out to counter the latter sentiment.</p>

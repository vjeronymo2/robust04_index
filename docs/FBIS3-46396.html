Chief Secretary Anson Chan told a Hong Kong General Chamber  of Commerce luncheon that the kind of fair, impartial government  that executives now take for granted in this bastion of free  enterprise could vanish if reforms are not made soon. "If we  were to abandon our efforts to achieve such arrangements, we  would be retreating from honest administration and responsible  government -- and the costs would be considerable," Chan said.  "The business community could no longer be certain of a level  playing field in which political patronage played no part," she  added.    Patten's campaign to extend democracy ahead of 1997 has been  cooly received by Hong Kong business leaders, who fear that  China's angry response to the initiative will harm their  corporations' bottom lines. Patten has put some of his reform  proposals before the Legislative Council for passage into law  next month, prompting Beijing to warn that British companies  will bear the consequences of his actions. The governor was due  back from an official visit to London on Tuesday.</p>

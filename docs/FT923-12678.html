			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Battened down for a long haul - Disappointed in UK equities, the four approach the next quarter with caution / The Professionals BONDS HAVE swung into favour among our Professionals as they become increasingly nervous about the US equity market, and batten down for a long, slow haul in the UK. Performances over the past quarter have continued to be dogged by the dreadful state of Japan's equity market - now 60 per cent below its 1989 peaks. US performances have also been hurt in sterling terms by the striking weakness of the dollar, which has tumbled by 10 per cent during the quarter. All were disappointed that the UK equity market's honeymoon, following John Major's general election victory, was so short-lived. Since all have significant UK equity holdings, they hoped a post-election rally would give a much-needed fillip to their portfolios. In the event, the 4.6 per cent index gain over the quarter was not great enough to eliminate the damage inflicted by falls in almost every other market. The result was that every portfolio marked time - gaining or losing no more than a percentage point. Looking into the third quarter, there is a majority view that the dollar will rally - Paul Myners, at Gartmore, predicts a rise of between 15 and 20 per cent - but no one translates this sentiment into a recommendation to buy US equities. By consensus, these are overvalued and set to fall hard. There is also extreme caution over the UK markets: 'It is easy to become gloomy and pessimistic about prospects over the next few months,' says Howard Beaufort, at Newton Investment Management, cautiously pointing to an improvement later in the year. In similar vein, Tim Howe, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, warns that large cash calls, low levels of institutional liquidity, rising unemployment and continuing corporate 'shocks' will make the market dull short term. All are shell-shocked by the free-fall of the Nikkei in Japan. While there is agreement that Japanese equities now offer good value on fundamental terms, after a 19 per cent fall on the quarter, no one is willing to predict where the fall will end. A cut in interest rates, or a boost to public spending, could reverse the trend, but none of our professionals is willing yet to make fresh purchases in the market. By contrast, Hong Kong is expected to continue roaring ahead, while unsettled markets like Korea and Thailand are expected to recover ground, making the Pacific region attractive for the coming quarter. There is also a consensus that, after an awful first quarter, bonds now offer attractive returns while inflation remains low, and equity markets remain so uncertain. Douglas McDougall (Baillie &amp; Gifford) plans to cut his UK equity holdings by 4 per cent to 40 per cent, forecasting 'below trend growth for a couple of years' in the UK market. In turn, he is boosting his European and south-east Asian equity stakes by 2 per cent apiece. He expects 'outstanding growth prospects' in Hong Kong and south-east Asia, and is encouraged by signs of recovery in eastern Germany: 'European stock markets in general should benefit when eventually German interest rates decline.' Paul Myners (Gartmore) is alone in planning to capitalise on an expected rally in the dollar. By selling his 7.5 per cent stake in French bonds, and adding it to the 5 per cent holding of USDollars cash, which is earning insignificant interest at present, he is buying a large block of USDollars bonds. His other holdings remain unchanged, though in the UK he is shifting emphasis to growth stocks, arguing that cyclical shares 'look very exposed'. In Europe, where he agrees that interest rate cuts are much needed, the 15 per cent holding is also weighted heavily towards growth stocks, and to Holland, Switzerland and France. He expects the short-term picture in Japan to be 'dreadful', but plans to do nothing about the warrants that have cost the portfolio so dear. Howard Beaufort (Newton Investment Management) plans no changes to his portfolio, in spite of his short-term gloom over the UK market. While Denmark's assault on the Maastricht treaty has 'cast a shadow' over Europe's stockmarkets, with a difficult summer in prospect, he thinks there is good value to be found, particularly in France, and in 'established growth areas' like foods and pharmaceuticals. In the US, greatest danger comes from the risk of 'political miscalculation' that might enable the erratic Ross Perot to 'upset the political apple cart'. Only the Pacific rim markets - excluding Japan - remain attractive. 'Spring optimism in world financial markets has turned to summer malaise and lethargy,' he concludes, arguing nevertheless that current uncertainties present opportunities to invest 'in anticipation of a better close to the year'. Tim Howe (Singer &amp; Friedlander) has trimmed his tiny US equity stake from 5 per cent to 3 per cent, because of political and economic worries, and used the proceeds to buy sterling cash, which now accounts for 7 per cent of the portfolio. He is optimistic about European markets, particularly France and Switzerland, and forecasts a strong rebound in Japan - when the market eventually hits the floor. Philosophical about the slump in his tiny Latin American holdings, he agrees that these markets have 'lived up to their promise of volatility', but remains resolute that they promise exceptional growth over the next few years. On the Pacific region, 'the only worrying sign about Hong Kong seems to be a complete lack of any bad news.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How they allocate their assets  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BG                          %            Gartmore                    %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  UK Equities             40            1  UK Equities             50 2  Europe Equities         25            2  European Equities       15 3  SE Asia Equities        15            3  Pacific Rim Equities  12.5 4  Japanese Equities        5            4  US Equities              5 5  Long French Bonds       15            5  Jap.

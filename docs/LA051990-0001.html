			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALTON OBVIOUSLY HAS A LOT TO LEARN  </P> <P> Jerome Walton's comments about teachers were those of an ignorant and foolish  man. The fact that The Times chose to print them reflects not only a certain  insensitivity on the part of your editors, but also the perception that  teachers are underpaid because their jobs are easy and unimportant.  </P> <P> The lopsided values of society can never be changed while so-called leading  publications give any sort of credence to the comments of those whose only  virtues lie in their physical skills.  </P> <P> WILLIAM WAXMAN, Ocean View High School, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

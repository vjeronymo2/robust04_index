			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Investors fear O&amp;Y property knock-on PROPERTY investors and analysts are concerned that the financial difficulties of Olympia &amp; York Developments may exacerbate the slump in the North American property market. The prospect of O&amp;Y buildings being put up for sale as part of its financial restructuring has led Canadian institutions to delay decisions on property investments, according to one Toronto property consultant. The company's financial problems are expected to encourage existing and new tenants to bargain more aggressively for inducements in O&amp;Y buildings. O&amp;Y is the largest office landlord in Manhattan and central Toronto. It is also a big landlord in Calgary and Ottawa. Property experts say O&amp;Y's problems are likely to most affect Canada, where there are relatively few institutional investors willing or able to buy large chunks of real estate. Also, European and Japanese investors have retreated from the North American market over the past year. Mr Ross Cowan, analyst at Levesque Beaubien in Toronto, said he expected that O&amp;Y's bank lenders may end up holding buildings for several years to avoid flooding the market. The skittishness of investors was illustrated on Wednesday, when almost CDollars 2m (USDollars 1.60m) of bonds in First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's Toronto flagship building, changed hands at a discount of 22 per cent to face value.</p>

There was some resistance to the sale from those who wanted to increase the employee stake and give the workforce an equal voice on the board. One of the two worker directors, Mr Mohammed Taj, publicly opposed the sale, but the other worker director, Mr Adrian Arthur, supported it. One union official said: 'It really did make a difference. A lot of people had started to feel that they really did own the company. We were starting to do away with all the us-and- them feelings, now we've thrown it all away.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Siddheshwar Prasad: "1893-1993 And India] </F>   [Text] The end of 1893-1993 centennial is the beginning of  the worship of the great goddess Durga. In 1893 the three great  sons of Mother India--Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi, and  Yogi Arvind--started this pious beginning. Swami Vivekananda  dazzled the world by exposing it to the real glory of Sanatana  Dharam at the Chicago World Religions Conference. Mahatma Gandhi  sounded the conch shell to announce agitation against Western  conceit by starting satyagraha [non-violent movement] against  racial discrimination in South Africa. Swami Arvind received the  first inspiration from Goddess Shakti when he touched land in  Bombay and published a series of articles in INDUPRAKASH. He  gave a new definition to nationalism and politics. Swami  Vivekananda and Gandhi rejuvenated the feeling for duty of the  sleeping kshatariyas [warrior caste]. Yogi Arvind helped raise  new awareness of the ancient Indian wisdom and presented the  original Vedas, the Upanishdas, and Bhagavad Gita to the world  in a modern form.    The world is ready to change for the new era as desired by  the Goddess Durga. We have to think and theorize as to which  powers will be defeated and trodden under feet, and which powers  will become great powers. The three great sons of India will be  the trail blazers of this new era, and will be Brahma, Vishnu,  and Mahesh of this age.    It is surprising and sad to see that nothing has been done  according to the requirements of this historic century in India.  At times, it looks like the century of the giants has passed and  we are living in the century of dwarfs who cannot think big, who  think that independence means just staying in power, whose blood  stream cannot bear the heat of glory of freedom, and who have  made it a habit to accept  intellectual-cutlural-economic-political slavery. The dwarfs can  gain power using muscle, betrayal, and deception; can hold on to  power; but cannot change the society. Thus, the flow of time and  duty throws them out on the banks.    India is burning in the fires of communalism and prejudice.  Is just sending its representatives to South Africa and Chicago  at the time of the beginning of this new era enough for India?  Cannot we use this historic century to start a national or  international campaign to stop religious and communal malice?  Cannot we unite the people belonging to all political parties,  religions, and castes for participation in this national  campaign and start the powerful flow of national devotion? But  who will do it? Can a blind person lead another blind person?    How can those who cannot even see the nation be able to  perceive the whole world? There is a great fear that the clutch  of economic and cultural slavery will become tighter in the name  of economic liberalization and modernization, and India will be  forced to see with the eyes of others instead of using its own  eyes. It appears that India will have to ignore its own  intelligence and will have to walk the way others tell her to.  However, can we call it walking? That would be just crawling!    The government must be helpless and incapable of doing  anything. The Congress (I) at the Center has its own  incapability. Who interferes in the states run by other parties?  Why are they supporting an organization that spreads communal  prejudice while patting their backs for being modern? Do they  think that Gandhi is not worth being honored by spreading his  message in every village at this time when the policy of  apartheid has ended in South Africa? It appears that this is not  the Congress Party that Gandhi had raised with his blood and  sweat and enabled it to beget independence for India. Perhaps,  the Congress is not in the hands of his successors; it is being  controlled by slavery-loving opportunists. Powers that are  dreaming of controlling the whole world naturally will take  advantage of India's timely weakness.    What have the independent organizations associated with the  Gandhian philosophy been doing? Why are organizations like the  Sarvaseva Sangh, the Gandhi Samarak Nidhi, and the Gandhi Shakti  Parishthan silent now? Why are not they following Gandhi's  legacy? In South Africa, 100 years after the satyagraha was  started, they did finally succeed in ending apartheid. Do not  these organizations see the victory of Gandhi's policies in it?    Why has the Shri Ramakrishna Mission, the organization  associated with Swami Vivekananda, also limited itself to a  ceremonial participation? Why is this mighty organization  hesitating in presenting the form of Sanatana Dharam or Hindu  Dharama that Swami Vivekananda had presented at the Chicago  World Religions Conference to the people in the world now?    Shri Arvind Ashram is an organization in itself, and an able  disciple of Arvind is its head. Is it not amazing that during  the centenary year, a selection of Arvind's writing and thinking  under the title of India's Reincarnation was published not by  Arvind Ashram but by an organization in Paris! The title of this  book published in Paris expresses the future truth that Arvind  has dedicated his life to.    Now this image of "India's reincarnation" is viewed by the  world as formed by the West. But no proper government can be  formed, be successful or be stable in India until the  triumvirate of these three great men stops being neglected. How  long can a country depend on a borrowed crutch?    This centennial has also acknowledged another great truth:  All political parties and organizations are petty, they have no  interest in actual resolution of India's problems, their  disagreement is not based on basic issues but on establishing  monopoly of specific persons, and they do not look within  themselves for answers but depend on others. The Western slavery  in the form of modernization has encompassed their mind and body  so much that they cannot even think of walking with their head  high on the stage of world. The warrior-like glory of Swami  Vivekananda and Gandhi and intellectual glory of Arvind are  being neglected now. Who can stop India from being weak and  narrow-minded now? If everyone is busy trying to fill up their  own coffers, who will fill Mother India's bowl? Who will create  the new awakening of the man in the world?    The West's established supremacy over the whole world has  reached its apex, and the time for its downward slide has  arrived. The 'churning of the ocean' of the West has begun, and  the West is suffering pain, defeat, and laziness because of the  heat generated by it. It does not understand why this is  happening because this is beyond the sphere of physical science.  The West, drowned in the ocean of worldly luxuries can deceive  itself for a while by calling the two civil wars in Europe two  major World Wars. It should not forget that these civil wars  ended the monopoly of Europe on the whole world. Now the United  States may laugh in the United Nations while standing on the  ashes of former Soviet Union, but this will not help it create  the new world order.    The bad results of this cultural policy are emerging  gradually. The communist powers fell right in front of our eyes  because of the "centralized public policy" of the Marxists, and  those communist nations also appear to be effected by this fall.  However, communism is not the weakness of the Marxists; it was  their strong desire for despotism. How can despotism under the  guise of democracy have a different outcome?    Swami Vivekanand, Mahatma Gandhi, and Yogi Arvind are the  saviors of the world suffering from the desire of total control,  and have been the best representatives of world culture. The  prosperous and powerful nations should not be under the illusion  that no hub of power can flourish outside the sphere of their  influence nor should the poor nations have the delusion that no  strong leadership, except for the blind worshipper of the West,  can emerge there. Who knows who Fate will pick and from where  and give him which responsibility? How can the Western culture  based on physical science can understand the secret of the  longevity, repeated rise, and preservation of the ancient  spiritual cultures? What can we say about the rest of the world  when even India itself is neglecting the triumvirate of the new  age who knew the secret of this wisdom?    These three great men fearlessly took revolutionary projects  while living under the slavery of the world's most powerful  imperialist. They also awakened the nation and challenged the  West. India's soul was free even in slavery at that time, and  India was fearless. Today, we cannot hear this free and fearless  voice even in independent India.    The 'reincarnation of India in the ashes of the West' that  Yogi Arvind had mentioned has two aspects. The fall of the West  and India's reemergence. The fall of the West and India's  reemergence are yogic prophecies and are two interdependent  facets. If there is destruction in one place; there will be  building in another, if there is building in one place; there  will be destruction in another. At one time, the Western empires  were built on the destruction of Eastern nations. Now the time  is coming when the East will be rebuilt on the rubble of the  West.    Not only the government and the political parties, but most  of India's intellectuals, writers, and journalists are apathetic  about the rebuilding of India in the new world for which Swami  Vivekananda, Gandhi, and Yogi Arvind had done their historic  work. it appears that most of them are interested only in  copying and enjoying doing what the West has done. Perhaps, they  do not know that the western intellectuals are destined to look  at the world through the eyes of the triumvirate that India had  produced.    The reemergence of India will be the greatest event of the  21st Century. This will herald the new era of universal man,  universal culture, universal policy, and a universal economic  system that was founded by the Indian triumvirate during this  century.</p>

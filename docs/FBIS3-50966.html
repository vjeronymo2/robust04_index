			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Pereyra and Marisa Lopez from the </F> "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast]    [Excerpts] [Pereyra] Mexico's 32 departments register  different poverty levels. Experts feel that poverty is  ancestral since its origins date back 500 years. Oaxaca State  has a poverty level of 11 percent and is the poorest state in  the country. Mexico City, with a poverty level of 0.1 percent,  is the least impoverished. Chiapas State's 111 municipalities  are poor. It is the second most impoverished state in the  country. The poverty there, as anywhere else, generates  ignorance. There is poverty, not misery, in Chiapas. Poverty  and the ignorance of those suffering from its consequences have  become a breeding ground for professional terrorists who have  pit the people of Chiapas -- luckily a minority of them --  against their institutions. Rural areas have the highest poverty  levels in this state. Monoculture is the chief occupation of  the people here. [passage omitted] It is in these areas where  the level of production and service infrastructure is very low.  About 60 percent of Chiapas residents live in rural areas.  Moreover, 99 percent of the state's 16,400 towns are rural.  Poverty in Chiapas has many indicators. For instance, 60  percent of the economically active population earns minimum  wages. Indians make up one-fifth of the population. Also, 19  percent of the people have no income. The illiteracy rate is 30  percent. There are no roads. [passage omitted]    [Lopez] Chiapas has a population of approximately 3.6  million. The current strife zone is located in six of its 111  municipalities. Four of these municipalities have a population  of a little more than 360,000 persons, or 11.8 percent of the  population. The majority of the people in Ocosingo, San  Cristobal de las Casas, Las Margaritas, and Comitan de  Dominguez, the site of last week's clashes, work the land. That  is where one cause of the conflict lies. With almost  nonexistent land reform following the victory of the revolution  and inadequate land distribution during the Cardenas eras,  pressure on the land has displaced a large number of people,  mostly Indians.

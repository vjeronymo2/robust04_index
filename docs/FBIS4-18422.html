			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of </F> the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, by Arto Nieminen; place  and date not specified -- recorded, Zhirinovskiy's remarks are  translated into Finnish by unidentified translator]    [Excerpts] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Russian  Liberal Democrats, arrived in Helsinki this afternoon as a  member of a Russian parliamentary delegation. Already at the  airport, Zhirinovskiy rejected an image of himself as a  nationalist extremist who is moving borders. However,  Zhirinovskiy again warned Finland against joining NATO, saying  that Russia would safeguard the inviolability of an independent  Finland. Arto Nieminen reports:    [Nieminen] So he is here now today: Zhirinovskiy, who has  been accused of being a nationalist extremist, arrived for a  seminar that will discuss Russia's possibilities of getting into  the Council of Europe. The seminar may, however, be only a  secondary matter as the two-day Russian internal political drama  opens tomorrow after a transfer to Finland. Zhirinovskiy was  immediately pressed to explain his statements of yesterday that  clearly warned Finland against allying itself more closely than  now to the West. Now Zhirinovskiy says that Finland can join  whatever it wants, but NATO would be an alliance against  Russia's interests. Here is Zhirinovskiy with his interpreter.    [Zhirinovskiy] The question is, of course, that Finland may  join whatever it likes, that is Finland's affair. Russia would  like Finland to be an independent, neutral state. Russia is  prepared to guarantee Finland's independence and inviolability,  but of course, if Finland joins NATO, then that is against  Russia's interests and in a possible war situation, military  operations will be taking place on Finnish territory too and  naturally that is not in Finland's interests, but Finland itself  has to decide on these matters.    [Nieminen] NATO's Partnership for Peace is also, in  Zhirinovskiy's view, only an initial stage of NATO membership.    [Zhirinovskiy] It is all a bluff intended for small states.  It is like the porch into NATO.    [Nieminen] Zhirinovskiy said that he loves Finland, and the  Finnish language is sheer music to him, but the Baltic countries  were more severely condemned. According to Zhirinovskiy, the  Baltic countries are little towns comparable to Monaco and they  belong to Russia's territory.    Zhirinovskiy also rejected the latest reports on his Jewish  background. According to the news agencies, until his 18th  year, Zhirinovskiy is supposed to have been called Eidelstein.  Zhirinovskiy said that he himself knows best what his name was.  However, his memory for names was poor -- Zhirinovskiy called  the Finnish president Koivisto until an assistant corrected him.    Zhirinovskiy slipped into the Russian delegation as if by  accident. The invitation to the seminar was extended before it  was known that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would be nominated to the  Russian parliament's group of visitors to the Council of Europe.  [passage omitted]    The seminar opens tomorrow, and it seems that Zhirinovskiy  has the clear intention of getting everything out of this  seminar that supports the aims of the Liberal Democrats in  Russia. This became evident at once; the other members of the  delegation already had their work cut out in denying  Zhirinovskiy's remarks at the airport.</p>

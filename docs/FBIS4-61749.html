			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with State Duma agrarian faction member A. Popov </F> by Yuriy Strukov; place and date of interview not given:  "Andrey Popov: `Will Bankers Begin Sowing?'"]    [Text] Accusations against commercial banks have already  become traditional. Inflation, the crisis of nonpayments,  delays in the issue of wages, merging with the criminal world --  that is a far from full list of the sins ascribed to nonstate  banks. Moreover, many specialists in macroeconomics believe that  commercial banks, controlling up to 70 percent of the country's  financial resources, are releasing them mainly for "short-term"  trade and middleman credits while industry and the agricultural  sector are expiring without long-term investments. The most  unpleasant thing is perhaps that in many cases these  descriptions of the banks are justified. What state laws and  actions can be used today to direct the banks' activity into the  channel of social harmony, to ensure that their revenue goes not  only toward improving the prosperity of commercial bankers but  also toward benefiting society? This is considered by A. Popov,  a member of the State Duma agrarian faction, in a talk with our  correspondent.    [Popov] First of all let us describe the current situation  in the banking world. Over the five years since the first bank  was registered over 2,000 of these financial institutions have  appeared in Russia. Each bank has occupied its own market  niche. One group finances "short-term" trade and middleman  operations, obtaining superprofits. As a rule these are small  "fly-by-night" banks whose characteristic feature is the payment  of quite high dividends. These banks' money is constantly in  circulation so no effective investment return should be counted  on here.    Another group is far smaller numerically but it is  represented by well known banks with a substantial incorporation  capital. Here the interest rate on deposits is incomparably  lower, which is understandable: The money has been invested in  major projects and will not produce a rapid return. It is on  these banks that we should count in planning investments.    [Strukov] There is just one thing I cannot understand: Why  do your "respectable" banks give themselves an unnecessary  headache over long-term expenses when it is possible to effect  an excellent money "turnover" through trade....    [Popov] The point is that a number of nonstate banks has  reached such a level of stability and concentration of financial  resources that it is simply not to their advantage to run risks  by investing money in rather unpredictable trade operations: If  they do not collapse they may still substantially damage their  reputation. And reliability is strengthened only by joint  ownership, through investments, of industrial, agricultural, and  civilian real estate into which bankers will naturally put  progressive technologies.    [Strukov] But somehow the banks' desire to invest in plants  and state farms is so far going unnoticed....    [Popov] I disagree. This process is developing. Whereas  last year of 13.5 trillion rubles surplus in bank accounts just  0.5 trillion went in investments, this year the latter indicator  increased to 3-3.5 trillion. But in one thing you are right:  So far the state and its legislative organs are giving only  feeble encouragement to this trend.    For instance, everyone knows of the very grave situation in  the agrarian sector. God grant that we can pay off the state's  "Gaydar" debts not to mention long-term expenses. Some large  banks have proposed to the top organs of executive power that  they invest in the countryside. For instance, the following  scheme has been proposed: We invest half the resources for a  specific program under a Ministry of Finances guarantee, the  state pays for the other half. A sensible approach, in my view.  On the one hand the commercial banks are not yet so wealthy  that they can take on all concerns for the countryside. On the  other, it is possible to halve the "agricultural" burden of the  state budget with its deficit and to lend impetus to the  countryside's development.    There is a similar situation in industry. But the government  and the Ministry of Agriculture seem not to notice this  initiative on the banks' part. I stress, they are not rejecting  it but nor are they supporting it. It remains for us to pin our  hopes on the federal assembly....    [Strukov] Perhaps this position on the part of the executive  power can be explained by the information on the allegedly  planned introduction of a state of emergency in the economy.  Many experts are inclined to believe that this is borne out by  the recent Central Bank decision to raise the minimum  incorporation capital for commercial banks to 2 billion  rubles....    [Popov] This measure on the Central Bank's part is in my  opinion fully justified. There should be some kind of  limitation on the dissipation of financial resources. A bank is  a solid institution. The previous minimum incorporation capital  -- 100 million rubles -- considering inflation can no longer  ensure the reliability of a particular bank. Furthermore, as I  have already said, small banks are most vulnerable to criminal  structures.    As for the state of emergency, I think our economy has long  been working in this state. If someone has only noted this now,  then I do not think there are grounds for global conclusions.</p>

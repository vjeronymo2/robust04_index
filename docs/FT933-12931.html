			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / German money supply threatens franc THE uncomfortably high German money supply figure added to concerns over the prospects for the French franc yesterday, writes Peter John in London. Economists feared that if Germany does not ease monetary policy soon France will have to raise rates to support its currency, a possibility that had been dismissed until yesterday. 'Tensions within the ERM mean that Germany is obliged to pursue a monetary policy which is easier than is fully appropriate under domestic inflationary conditions,' said Mr Thomas Mayer at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt yesterday. He pointed out that France is obliged to keep interest rates higher than the fundamentals require. The franc was marginally firmer at Ffr3.41.50 against the D-Mark, just over 1.5 centimes above its ERM floor. However, French government bond futures went through a key support level to close more than half a percentage point lower.</p>

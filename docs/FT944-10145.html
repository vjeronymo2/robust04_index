			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms buzz Telecoms shares had another hyperactive day, with Cable and Wireless losing further ground and BT dragged lower as slight disappointment with the interim dividend triggered profit-taking. The two stocks' combined trading volume was almost 20m shares. BT finished 4 1/2 easier at 388 1/2 p, with most analysts pinpointing the interim payout - up 6 per cent, after a 6.3 per cent increase for last year's final dividend - as the reason for the sell-off in the face of generally strong trading trends. According to Hoare Govett, second-quarter underlying profits rose 5 per cent after 3.7 per cent in the first three months. C&amp;W fell 6 to 386p as analysts got to grips with the management shake-up and fierce margins squeeze under way at the group's Mercury arm. Mobile phones group Vodafone managed to ride above the bearish mood, gaining 1 1/2 at 212 1/2 p following news of the 40 per cent sales advance at BT's Cellnet unit. Shell Transport dropped 8 to 711p after revealing a slight fall in third-quarter current cost net income, the figure that ignores the effect of shifts in the underlying oil price. The profit of Pounds 853m was down from Pounds 861m last time but well within a broad range of forecasts. SGST, a keen supporter of the stock, argued: 'The two problem areas (Shell Oil and Chemicals) . . . are improving their performance at a faster rate than can be expected, and an earnings upturn in 1995 should underpin share price outperformance.' Dollar influenced pharmaceuticals stocks moved into positive territory with the opening of Wall Street. US buying was still in evidence, with the heavy dealing of the past couple of days revealed to have been carried out through the Instinet system, Reuters' US-based equity brokerage service. Glaxo added 5 at 622p and Wellcome rose 9 to 673p. Meanwhile, Fisons improved 4 to 125p with 4.8m shares traded as bid speculation continued. Among the companies cited as possible bidders are Zeneca, off a penny at 870p, Amersham International, still reeling from disappointing figures on Wednesday and down 19 at 909p, and Medeva, a penny up at 173p. Shares in Northumbrian Water jumped 16 to 712p after the company posted favourable interim figures which included a surprise 16 per cent dividend increase, well above the 5 per cent guideline adopted by water companies in recent years. Profits more than doubled to Pounds 46.1m. However, one analyst said: 'Shareholders will welcome the increase in the dividend, although it will raise the political pressure.' Among food retailers, Iceland hardened a penny to 161p following a recommendation from Panmure Gordon, and Morrison Supermarkets moved 5 1/2 ahead to 140p after Hoare Govett changed its recommendation on the stock from 'underperform ' to 'buy'. Anglo-Dutch group Unilever continued to be a nervous trade ahead of today's third-quarter figures and the shares lost another 5 at 1129p. Textiles group Coats Viyella rose 8 1/2 to 202 1/2 p after the company said it was looking to sell its yarns and fabric arm and its carpet divisions, and had received a number of approaches. Drinks group Taunton Cider was particularly busy. Volume jumped to 7.7m, as the equivalent of around 3.4 per cent of the company's shares changed hands, with one dealer pointing to a tax related trade. The shares closed a penny lower at 151p. Reed International benefited from a presentation to analysts on its professional publishing, particularly its electronic information side. Several analysts, including the team from Hoare Govett, came away feeling reassured and the shares closed 4 higher at 765p. First day trading in TLG, the former Thorn Lighting, ended in a comfortable premium with the shares standing at 124p, against a flotation price of 115p. Computer software group Tadpole Technology dipped 8 to 432p. Eurotunnel remained a lively market ahead of Monday's start to direct train running between London and the Continent, rising 12 to 251p for a four-day advance of 9 per cent. The driving force remained the Paris market, where 2.1m shares changed hands yesterday - against under 0.6m in London - to become the most actively traded French stock.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Hussein's poll law seeks curb on Islamists: Brotherhood may contest law's legality KING HUSSEIN'S announcement of a new electoral law this week is a clear demonstration of the extent of his alarm at the rise in popularity of Islamic politics in Jordan. The new law, despite almost unanimous opposition from the country's fledgling political parties and members of parliament, is likely to be a serious blow to the Islamists' aspirations. Under the previous system, the number of votes cast by a voter was determined by the number of seats in a constituency: a system which was widely held to favour large groups, such as the Islamists, able to field many candidates in each constituency. But the change will mean that the elections due on November 8 will be conducted on a one-person, one-vote basis. It is thought the government's prime motive is to cut the seats held by Moslem fundamentalists in the new parliament. At the last elections in 1989, fundamentalists won 30 out of 80 seats. Inevitably, fundamentalist reaction to the change has been condemnation. The Islamic Action Front (IAF), political wing of the powerful Moslem Brotherhood, is threatening to contest the legality of the new law, perhaps boycotting the elections altogether. It says parliament was dissolved by the king before the new law was issued to avoid debate and the risk of non-ratification. Such threats are probably more a matter of form than an effort to bring about a head-on confrontation with the government. The Islamists have until now been successful under Jordan's political system. Historically, the Moslem Brotherhood was favoured by the king as a counterbalance to the Arab nationalist and socialist parties, such as the Nasserites and Baathists, which were banned in 1957 following a coup attempt. The fact that they were allowed to develop while other parties were banned was part of the reason for their success at the last elections. The Brotherhood's organisation and social influence were well established, while other political parties were legalised only last year. However, in the last parliament, the fundamentalists rigorously pursued their aim of Islamicising the state. Draft laws, calling for the segregation of sexes at public swimming baths, health clubs, schools and universities, and an alcohol ban were never actually passed, but, together with calls to abandon peace talks with Israel, they caused great anxiety for the government. In announcing the new election law, the king urged fundamentalists to live up to their responsibilities and not 'undermine or distort Islam'. But unlike Algeria and Egypt, there is little evidence of Islamic militancy in Jordan - despite a trial due this month of 10 fundamentalists charged with plotting to assassinate the king in June. Generally the fundamentalists work within the mainstream of politics. As elsewhere, their support is based on easing economic deprivation and providing social welfare to the poor and needy. Outside mosques in Amman on a Friday, the Moslem Brotherhood can be seen distributing subsidised food and clothes. It also runs hospitals and schools. The Brotherhood is believed to have substantially more financial resources than other parties. But the source of funding is something of a mystery. Collections are made at mosques, and money from abroad, particularly Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran, is said to boost its finances considerably. Whether the latest announcement will subdue the Islamists remains to be seen. But their presence will not go away. The king will have to maintain tight control if he is to preserve the kingdom's democracy on his terms.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (11): Hopes pinned on new canal - The Port THE COLLAPSE of the iron curtain has already brought about a huge increase in the traffic in people and services between eastern and western Europe through Vienna. It is widely expected that the volume of goods moving through the city will also rise rapidly. According to some estimates, the volume of cargo moving in central Europe could triple by the end of the century. So far, however, the break-up of eastern Europe has had mainly a negative effect on the port of Vienna. For example, much of the drilling pipe for the Russian oil industry used to pass through Vienna, but this trade has collapsed because Russia does not have currency with which to buy oil pipe. Also, the war in Yugoslavia last year dampened trade through the lower Danube. But over the longer term, there is considerable optimism. Mr Ronald Schrems, marketing director of the port of Vienna corporation (Wiener Hafen), predicted that transshipment tonnage - that is, freight moving from road to water or water to rail - handled in the port would double from a depressed 2m tonnes in 1990 over the next five years. Perhaps a more important factor in the anticipated rise in business will be the long-awaited opening in September of the Rhine-Main-Danube canal. This canal, which rises over high ground between Regensburg and Bamberg in Germany, was first conceived by Charlemagne. When it opens in September, it will make possible uninterrupted transport of goods by water between Rotterdam and the Black Sea. Wiener Hafen estimates that between 4m and 7m tonnes per year of goods will be carried on the waterway, although much depends on the freight rates established. Much uncertainty surrounds this issue. For one thing, there is, at the moment, much more traffic moving from west to east than from east to west. This tends to push rates up. However, the Danube shipping fleet is dominated by eastern European companies, which do not yet run on normal economic criteria. Freight volumes are unlikely to be large enough to permit specialised container ships, and the Main-Danube canal has height limits that prevent stacking containers high enough to be profitable. 'The main traffic will be bulk commodities and cars,' Mr Schrems says. Vienna already plays a significant role as a transshipment port, shifting all manner of goods, including 20,000 cars per year, between the water and land transport modes. The port, which is owned by the city of Vienna, handled a total 10m tonnes of goods last year, of which 8m were solely handled by truck and rail. With its seven associated companies, it had a turnover of Sch320m and a cash flow of Sch50m. The port has a customs-free area of about 150,000 square metres and 50,000 square metres of roofed space. The container terminal handled more 100,000 units last year. There is also a 90,000-tonne grain terminal, which has handled large shipments bound for the former Soviet Union. A crude oil terminal connects to a pipeline to Trieste. More than 1m tonnes of crude oil and oil products were transshipped on the Danube from Vienna last year. The port also is a large stocking point for cars, especially those imported from Japan. In anticipation of sharply increased demand and the new dynamics on the Danube, the port has set up new subsidiary c o n t a i n e r t e r m i n a l s at Bratislava and Krems in the past two years, is opening one at Budapest this year and intends to build one soon at Belgrade. It is also in negotiation to purchase in partnership with German interests the cargo division of the venerable but failing Donaudampfschiffahrts (DDSG) shipping group. It hopes that returns on shipping, especially between Vienna and the Rhine ports, will be more satisfactory than those on the Danube alone. Mr Schrems says the Austrian part of this project alone would cost Sch7bn, even though no locks would need to be built. In Moravia, the waterway was prepared in the 1930s, so the politically difficult part of land acquisition is complete. But locks have still to be built. As part of a four-year, Sch250m capital spending programme, the port is seeking to buy more land and to enlarge roofed storage space to about 75,000 square metres. Even though the Rhine-Main-Danube canal has not opened yet, Vienna port officials are already thinking about another canal. It would link Vienna to Moravia to join up with an existing - but undeveloped - waterway to the Oder and the Elbe. He admits that the project could not be justified by traffic forecasts alone. However, both the Austrian and Czech authorities are pointing out that it offers an opportunity to bring black coal from Rotterdam for Moravian power stations. This would reduce substantially the carbon dioxide emissions from the stations. They are trying to convince the European Commission and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that this is a good project for their environmental protection funds. 'We hope for a decision within the next two years,' Mr Schrems says.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japan's trading houses hit by portfolio losses JAPAN'S leading trading houses yesterday reported sharply lower profits after booking losses on securities investments made during the late 1980s. Mitsubishi Corporation, the core company of the Mitsubishi group, reported a 62 per cent fall in net profits, to Y15.3bn (Dollars 137.83m), for the year to March, after making provisions of Y66bn for stock losses and the restructuring of MC Finance, a subsidiary which became a symbol of its investment excesses during the late 1980s. The profits of several other trading houses, including Sumitomo Corporation, Marubeni, and Itochu were also dragged down by losses on their securities funds, which had been regarded as an important profit centre to supplement core profits during the late 1980s, when stock prices rose sharply. Mr Tetsuo Kamimura, Mitsubishi's managing director, said the company covered some losses by realising Y30bn from the sale of equities. He said the company still had Y918bn in unrealised gains on stocks, but it included Mitsubishi group cross-holdings that were unlikely to be sold. Transactions by Mitsubishi for the year totalled Y14,996bn, down 4.5 per cent, while pre-tax profit was 12 per cent lower at Y75.6bn and was forecast to slip to Y75bn this year. Sumitomo Corporation reported a 12 per cent fall in turnover to Y16,530bn, and pre-tax profit fell 35 per cent to Y41bn as the company reported a Y18.7bn appraisal loss on securities holdings and made a Y12.9bn special profit on a property sale. Mitsui and Co reported a 4 per cent decline in total turnover to Y15,496bn, but a 5.9 per cent increase in net profit to Y23.9bn, mainly because its exposure to securities investment funds was less than that of other trading houses. Itochu reported a 7.4 per cent decline in transactions to Y18,529bn but a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y49.8bn, attributed to a decrease in interest payments following a reduction of interest rates over the year. Marubeni said turnover fell 7.5 per cent to Y16,863bn, while pre-tax profit was 2.6 per cent lower at Y37.4bn, and net profit slipped 37.4 per cent to Y10.9bn.</p>

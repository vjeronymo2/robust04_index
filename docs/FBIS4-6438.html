			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, April 20 KYODO -- Economic activity in the  north Sumatra provincial capital of Medan returned to normal  Wednesday [20 April] after nearly a week of anti-Chinese and  labor-related riots, a police source told KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    The spokesman for North Sumatra's Police Headquarters, Lt.  Col. Leo Sukardi, said in Medan, 1400 kilometers northwest of  Jakarta, that shops and supermarkets closed during the riots  have reopened, and no further protests have occurred.    The situation is calm and residents are not afraid to go out  any more, Leo said.    Students have already gone back to school, although many  rumors have been spread by parties that there will be other  protest rallies.    Meanwhile in Jakarta, rumors have spread that there were  demonstrations, following those in Medan, in some areas of  Jakarta such as Glodok, Tanjung Priok, Pasar Baru and Tomang,  where many Chinese descendants live.    But Jakarta's military commander, Maj. Gen. Hendro Priyono,  called on Jakarta's residents to remain calm and not react to  mere rumors.    "Jakarta is safe," Hendro told reporters.</p>

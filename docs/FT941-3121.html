			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lambert Howarth hit by reorganisation After providing for the cost of a reorganisation, Lambert Howarth Group, the footwear supplier, reported pre-tax profits halved from Pounds 2.99m to Pounds 1.42m in the year to end-December. The outcome was achieved on turnover up by 10 per cent from Pounds 56.6m to Pounds 62.6m, of which Pounds 4.3m related to Tecnic Shoes, acquired at the end of last year. The pre-tax outcome was struck after providing Pounds 706,000 for reorganisation, while last year's results benefited from a Pounds 363,000 one-off profit on realisation of fixed assets. A fall in net investment and interest income from Pounds 377,000 to Pounds 25,000 this time also impacted on the result. After a tax credit of Pounds 72,000 (Pounds 713,000 charge) earnings per share came out at 24.9p (39.2p). Despite the downturn an improved final dividend of 9.25p (8.75p) is proposed, making 13.75p (13p) for the year. The benefits of the restructuring were not expected to come through quickly, the company said, but by the second half there should be some firm evidence of improvement.</p>

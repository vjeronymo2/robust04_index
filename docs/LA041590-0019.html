			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: RECIPE OF THE WEEK:  </P> <P> Just when you thought everyone who ever worked for Elvis had weighed in with a  deeply personal account of their (check one) years . . . months . . . hours  with The King, here comes a new tribute volume: "Memories Beyond Graceland,"  penned by Mary Jenkins, Elvis' personal cook. Due out from West Coast  Publishers this spring, her book includes many of Elvis' best-loved recipes,  including (are you really hungry?) his favorite snack -- the peanut butter and  banana sandwich.  </P> <P> To prepare (if you're counting cholesterol, stop reading here) you'll need two  large bananas, six slices of white bread, one stick of butter and one cup of  peanut butter. Peel and mash the bananas. Mix the peanut butter with the  bananas. Toast the bread lightly and spread the mix on the bread. Then melt the  butter in the skillet and cook the sandwich on each side until golden brown.  </P></p>

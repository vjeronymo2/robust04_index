			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Support for small businesses urged THE government is urging the banks to think hard about the longer-term viability of small-business customers before deciding to withdraw support from them. With the government under mounting pressure to stimulate the economy, Baroness Denton, small-business minister, is holding meetings with the leading clearing banks to discuss the problems facing small businesses. In an effort to stem mounting bankruptcies she is asking banks to 'spend more time working out whether there is a future' before pulling the plug on small-business customers. Insolvencies totalled 40,000 in the first half of this year compared with 30,000 in the first six months of last year. She has also extracted a commitment from all leading clearers to investigate specific cases referred to them by her office. In keeping with a suggestion made last year by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, she is working towards a voluntary code of best practice for banks in their dealings with small-business customers. Such a code might include recommendations such as a minimum warning period to businesses before support is withdrawn, although the minister said she was 'still listening at the moment'. She said: 'I don't think the banks are unaware of their responsibilities.' She emphasised that the banks would inevitably be the principal source of funding for small businesses. The initiative comes 10 months after the banks were criticised by the Office of Fair Trading for their 'insensitive, high-handed' treatment of small-business customers. Nevertheless it was decided to take no action against them on competition grounds. The watchdog's investigation followed a Treasury and Bank of England report, commissioned by the government, which cleared the banks of colluding on interest rates so as not to pass on to customers the benefit of lower interest charges. The banks yesterday insisted that withdrawal of their support was always a last resort. Lloyds said it had made it clear to Baroness Denton that it was 'not in our interest to close down any viable business'. Barclays said: 'If it is a viable business, we are never going to pull the plug.'</p>

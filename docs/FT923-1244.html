			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Arts: LPO Gala - Concert Tuesday's concert by the London Philharmonic was a Gala Evening, sponsored by Mrs Jackie Rosenfeld, to inaugurate their South Bank residency. The thinking behind the programme was transparent: one popular blockbuster - Orff's Carmina Burana - enhanced by a strong trio of solo voices; one safe Romantic piece for an admired virtuoso - Max Bruch's G minor violin concerto with Pinchas Zukerman; one 'advanced' exhibit, not too time-consuming - Webern's op. 6, his Six Pieces for Orchestra (1909) - to show loyalty to the current South Bank ideals. It came off pretty well. We have heard more sharply etched performances of the astonishing Webern set, but Mehta synthesised some hallucinatory colours for individual pieces. It was rewarding to learn from Anthony Burton's programme-note that the second piece represents a train journey: suddenly one heard the music in a new, down-to-earth frame. While Zukerman delivered the Bruch concerto with sovereign professionalism and a nice, unabashed indulgence in period portamenti, Mehta chose to provide self-effacing support. Agreeable enough; but less than a month ago, a Prom performance with more creative give-and-take between orchestra and soloist searched harder into the music, and gave it a more cogent shape. Having successfully evaded the Carmina Burana for several years now, I could enjoy it this time. Yes, Orff's deliberately bald writing and his instrumental trouvailles make bracing effects; no, the net impression is never more than the sum of its glinting parts. Mehta paced it with a masterly hand, and the LPO's Choir gave the work everything it deserves  - except properly gutsy consonants, for which nothing less than a echt-German chorus will do. The Southend Boys' Choir were first-rate: melting in the choirboy-range, unexpectedly forward and lusty when they dropped down to a grown-up tessitura. Sumi Jo sang the brief soprano solos ravishingly, and Jochen Kowalski had been flown in just to lend his artful alto to the Roasting Swan's plaint. The plum baritone role went to Jeffrey Black, the Royal Opera's current house-Australian. If his vocal wattage began to fade before the end, he had already distinguished himself with a calculated air of macho wildness, and musical imagination far beyond the macho norm.</p>

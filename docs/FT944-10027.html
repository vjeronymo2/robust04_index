			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures had a slow day, dipping lower on weak volume and moving within a very narrow trading range, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,078 at the close of pit trading, down 29 points. The premium to the cash market was 5 points and fair value around 6 points. There were 8.073 contracts traded against 11,592 on Thursday with some dealers blaming the Armistice Day closure of the French futures market. In contrast, traded option volume improved, rising to 31,129 from 24,636 in the previous session.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another question that might arise is whether the operator of a previously undisturbed site would be subject to permit blocking for an unabated violation on his site which originated from an unanticipated event on a nearby or adjacent remining operation. Whether or not an event or condition on an adjacent site is a violation is a fact specific inquiry and depends on whether the surface coal mining operation on the adjacent site caused or contributed to the event or condition. Therefore, if the operator of the previously undisturbed site contributed to the event or condition which originated on the remining site and that operator does not abate the violation, the operator of the previously undisturbed site would be permit blocked. The proposed paragraph (f) exemption for permit blocking only relates to violations occurring on lands eligible for remining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM is seeking comments on any other examples of the interplay between remining operations and adjacent surface coal mining operations that may need to be explained in the final rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. 30 CFR Part 785_Requirements for Permits for Special Categories of Mining <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM proposes to add new &sect;785.25, Lands eligible for remining. (Sections 785.23 and 785.24 are being reserved for a separate rulemaking.) The permit requirements in proposed section 785.25 for operations on lands eligible for remining are intended to supplement information requirements in existing rules as they would apply to operations on lands eligible for remining. The types of new permit information being proposed would be required only to the extent that they are not provided under existing regulations. For example, provisions related to the determination of probably hydrologic consequences at &sect;&sect;780.21 and 784.14 of the permanent program regulations require baseline information on flow and quality of ground water and surface water and an estimate of the impacts of the proposed operation on these baseline conditions such as findings on: Whether adverse impacts may occur to the hydrologic balance; whether acid-forming or toxic-forming materials are present that could contaminate surface or ground water supplies; and whether surface or ground water used for any legitimate purpose in the permit or adjacent area will be contaminated, diminished or interrupted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The permit requirements of &sect;&sect;780.21 and 784.14 were intended to identify and control probable impacts to hydrology from coal removal associated with the first time disturbance of the land. Hence, they do not in most cases address the unique environmental or safety problems and impacts that can arise from the redisturbance of abandoned mine lands. The proposal would fill in this gap by focusing on the identification of: Potential environmental and safety problems specific to lands eligible for remining; maximum impacts that could result and the probability for the type of problem to occur; and mitigation measures to meet applicable performance standards. The purpose of these requirements is to provide the regulatory authority with a sound basis for setting a threshold beyond which conditions or events arising subsequent to permit issuance may be presumed to be unanticipated at the site. Furthermore, these requirements will help to ensure that potential environmental and safety problems commonly linked to abandoned mine land sites are not overlooked at the permitting stage and, thus, inadvertently contribute to the occurrence of unanticipated events or conditions which might result in more severe environmental or safety problems from the remining operation than may currently exist at the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, OSM believes it is essential that all reasonable evaluations be conducted in order to identify the probability for serious environmental or safety problems to occur. While there are potential economic and environmental benefits to be gained through remining, there also exists the potential for significant environmental degradation and safety problems. For example, if a remining operation unintentionally caused a sudden discharge of water or blowout from an adjacent water-filled abandoned mine, significant quantities of acid mine discharge could be released and create severe ecological harm in the receiving streams. It is important, therefore, in granting remining permits that the applicant identify the potential environmental and safety problems associated with the site, maximum impacts associated with these problems, and the probability for each type of problem to occur. These categories of information will assist the regulatory authority in setting a threshold beyond which conditions or events arising subsequent to permit issuance may be presumed to constitute unanticipated events or conditions. In order to provide a permit applicant for a remining operation some certainty regarding the potential scope of the 510(c) permit-blocking provision, the applicant shall be expected to provide all required information related to the potential environmental and safety problems of the remining site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM recognizes the difficulty of accurately predicting certain impacts such as acid mine drainage even on the basis of extensive baseline information. OSM is therefore soliciting comments on other specific information needed to be provided by the applicant that will be useful in developing a threshold for unanticipated events. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM is also requesting estimates on the number of hours to develop the information required by &sect;785.25 and is seeking suggestions on efficient and effective ways to develop this information and present it in the permit application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. 30 CFR Part 816_Permanent Program Performance Standards_Surface Mining Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

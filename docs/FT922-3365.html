			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Australian underwriting losses cut CE Heath profits by Pounds 6.5m CE HEATH, the insurance group, reported pre-tax profits sharply lower at Pounds 19.1m compared with Pounds 25.6m, for the year ended March 31 1992, hit by underwriting losses run up by an Australian subsidiary. However, before exceptional items the profit rose to Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 28.8m), largely as a result of strong growth in insurance broking with turnover rising to Pounds 101.6m (Pounds 77.5m) - topping the Pounds 100m mark for the first time in the group's history. A final dividend of 18.375p is declared, giving an unchanged total of 25.875p. The losses, which emerged in the form of an exceptional item of Pounds 12.4m, resulted from a discontinued line of aviation reinsurance business formerly underwritten by the group's Australian underwriting operation, CE Heath International Holdings, whose flotation was announced in March. Insurance broking profits were up to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 16.1m), underwriting profits down to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 14.8m) and computer services higher at Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.8m). Investment income was lower at Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 14.3m). Income at the group's computer services division is up to Pounds 39.2m (Pounds 34.1m). On an underlying basis brokerage income increased by 13 per cent while expenses were up 9 per cent. Brokerage expenses increased to Pounds 97.7m (Pounds 76.8m). Heath has now virtually completed its withdrawal from the higher risk and more volatile world of insurance underwriting, marking an end to a process of corporate restructuring started in 1986. After the flotation of CE Heath International Holdings in Australia, Heath reduced its own shareholding from 90 per cent to 46 per cent. A separate underwriting subsidiary, the Bermuda-based Pinnacle was disposed of last year. COMMENT Yesterday's exceptional item shows that Heath has not completely left behind its difficulties of the mid-1980s, which is one of the reasons why the market reacted unenthusiastically to the results, marking the shares down 5p to 397p. Another is that dividend cover, even on the assumption that profits over the next 12 months climb to Pounds 28m, will remain tight for the foreseeable future. Profits of that level would produce earnings per share of about 23p, leaving the group on a prospective p/e of more than 17. At first glance it might seem demanding, but the results also show the group is now a long way from the crisis-ridden days, when its senior broking staff were rushing for the exits. Heath is now much more focused on its core broking activities, with a balanced spread of business stretching from more stable but low-margin UK retail, to more exciting and bigger margin wholesale business, such as the group's Latin American operations which showed impressive growth last year.</p>

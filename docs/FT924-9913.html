			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: BIS highlights shift in nature of risks run by banks BANKS' dealings with each other through wholesale financial markets used to be relatively straightforward. They deposited money with each other or undertook foreign exchange transactions in a way that was easy for banks and their regulators to measure and control - even if sometimes those controls went awry. Not any more. The extent of the transformation in wholesale financial markets, and the difficulties thrown up for the control of risks, is highlighted in a report* published this week by the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' club which has its headquarters in Basle, Switzerland. The scale of the transformation is illustrated by the chart. The traditional interbank deposit market, which grew at a compound average rate of more than 13 per cent through the mid and late-1980s, went into reverse in 1991. Concerns about the credit quality of other banks was one reason, the need to use capital more efficiently following the Basle capital adequacy accord another. Equally significant, however, has been the development of financial instruments that offer a more efficient way for banks to hedge their risks or take positions in markets. As the chart shows, banks' exposure to each other through interest rate swap contracts has continued to climb. According to the BIS paper, written after interviews with 63 of the most active participants in wholesale financial markets, the nature of the risks run by banks has shifted markedly. Market risk has shrunk as ever more sophisticated ways have been developed for limiting exposure to general market movements. But three other types of risk have become more acute: Liquidity risk - the danger of not being able to deal without moving market prices significantly - has grown due to a number of factors, the BIS says. There is less capital devoted to market-making relative to the total capital at risk in wholesale financial markets, for instance, meaning market-makers can be swamped by one-way market movements. This has been accentuated by the concentration of market share, which has seen a small number of institutions with high credit ratings become the biggest participants in each of the markets. Problems with any one of them could spread across a number of markets simultaneously. Growth in trading volumes has increased settlement risk. Some banks have responded by spreading their dealings across a number of exchanges to reduce their exposure to failure by a single clearing house, but the BIS concludes: 'There are limits to what individual participants can do to limit settlement risk.' Credit risks have become more difficult to assess thanks to 'deficiencies in information regarding counterparties' off-balance sheet exposures and the inseparability in many OTC derivative instruments of the size of potential credit exposure and price developments.' The report calls for better international netting systems and greater financial disclosure to help reduce the risks, as well as greater attention among banks and regulators to the exposures being created. *Recent Developments in International Interbank Relations, Bank for International Settlements, Basle.</p>

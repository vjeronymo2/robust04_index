			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Observer: In the swim Metal Bulletin's chairman Trevor Tarring is clearly chuffed with the way his company is bucking industry trends and reporting higher profits. Nevertheless, he is concerned that Emap, which has picked up a 20 per cent stake, might launch a full takeover bid. Emap paid a substantial premium over market prices for its shares and Tarring observes 'it is unfortunate that it required transactions of this nature to persuade the stock market that the valuation placed on our shares a year ago was so far out of line with their intrinsic worth. Even the 200p a share Emap paid was not a serious reflection of the value of MB.' In that case, why did Tarring sell some of his MB shares last year? 'My wife wanted a swimming pool,' he says with a resigned shrug of the shoulders.</p>

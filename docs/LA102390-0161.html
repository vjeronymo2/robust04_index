Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> GERMAN TEACHERS FACE EXAMS  </P> <P> Former East German schoolteachers who escaped to the West must repeat teachers'  exams, while those who stayed and served under communism will be allowed to  continue working in the new, unified Germany, a Berlin newspaper said today.  </P> <P> About 300 teachers from what was East Germany will have to take exams to teach  in the western part of the unified country, the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper  said.  </P> <P> "Those who turned their backs on the Communist regime at great personal cost  are now being punished for their courage and logic," said Manfred Meyer, 45, a  physical education teacher who emigrated from East to West Germany.  </P> <P> Government officials said the policy was designed to keep teachers from moving  west, a problem that would strongly affect Berlin.  </P></p>

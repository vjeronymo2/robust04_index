The department had suspended Bell Atlantic  and C&amp;P on April 3 from contracting with the executive branch on the  grounds the companies had "made a material misrepresentation in competing for  the contract" in January to provide a new digital telephone system for Treasury  offices in the Washington area.  </P></p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (6): Profitable vision - Profile / Asea Brown Boveri It would be hard to find an international company with a clearer strategic vision of its role in the development of post-communist Europe than Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish power engineering group. It would be even harder to find a company which formed that vision so early and applied it so thoroughly and profitably. Poland has been central to that strategy. ABB has invested well over Dollars 100m over the past six years, and concentrated heavily on educating and training what has grown by acquisition and expansion into a more than 8,000-strong workforce. They are employed in a dozen power generation, pollution control, switchgear, railway rolling stock and signalling and engineering enterprises throughout Poland. They produce the products which will be most needed when the country's expected infrastructure development takes off. Until recently, ABB's growth in Poland was centred on the acquisition of majority stakes or at least management control of former state enterprises, through a variety of ways which reflected the rich menu of privatisation choices. Most enterprises were run down, obsolescent and relatively cheap, especially the early purchases when ABB was virtually alone in the field. Serious investment in new plant was held back until the human capital and skills of the newly-acquired companies were honed by the transfer of know-how, managerial methods and re-training. Increasingly, however, the quality of output from Polish plants has been raised to ABB group levels, as proved by the recent granting of the European standard ISO 1091 certification for the gas and steam turbines produced by the ABB Zamech plant, one of the earliest acquisitions. Having picked up many of the best of the former state companies ABB is shifting ground on the acquisition front. 'Our emphasis is now on green field investments. The last three investments were of this type. They have modest start-up capital but the great advantage of being able to structure according to a business plan fom the start,' says David Brown, president of ABB's Polish operations. One of the unexpected benefits of having come in early and strongly to the Polish market stems from its minority, 10 per cent shareholding in Elektrim, the former foreign trade company. Elektrim is fast developing as Poland's biggest private enterprise with sales approaching Dollars 1bn and rising profits. Thanks to the booming stock exchange ABB is now sitting on paper profits on its Elektrim shares which come close to the value of its investment in Poland to date. ABB companies are also well placed to gain big contracts to supply compressors and other Polish-made equipment for the 700km-long Polish section of the projected Dollars 7bn new gas pipeline from the Yamal peninsula in northern Russia to western Europe.</p>

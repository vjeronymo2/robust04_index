			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S UP IN TUOLUMNE MEADOWS?  </P> <P> Next to Yosemite Valley, the subalpine Tuolumne Meadows is the most crowded and  heavily used part of Yosemite National Park. Everyone entering the park from  the east must drive from Lee Vining over Tioga Pass and down through the  meadows. It is a popular camping area, is bisected by the John Muir Trail and  is the center of rock-climbing activity in the Sierra Nevada during the  summertime. The meadows is the site of one of the Yosemite Park and Curry Co.  's High Sierra camps and is the departure point for others. And the meadows are  attracting increasing crowds of touring skiers during the winter.  </P> <P> During the next six weeks, Yosemite administrators and the National Park  Service will be taking an intensive look at development in the Tuolumne Meadows  area, in part to meet requirements of the 1980 Yosemite master plan, but also  to comply with the 1984 California Wilderness Act that incorporated portions of  the Tuolumne River into the national wild- and scenic-river system.  </P> <P> Among the options the park service should consider carefully are relocation of  tourist facilities and the meadows campground away from both Tioga Road and the  river, in part to relieve traffic congestion but also to restore some of the  wilderness feeling to the river banks. Meadow restoration is a must, although  it may mean that some areas will have to be put off-limits to hikers for a  time. One concept that should not be considered is the widening of Route 120 to  carry more traffic, as has been proposed at times in the past. Parking,  however, has become a major problem that must be dealt with.  </P> <P> For many park visitors, including those from foreign lands, a trip to or  through Tuolumne Meadows and over 9,941-foot Tioga Pass is as close as they  will get to a high-mountain wilderness. That experience will be lost without  reasonable restraint on the sort of development and congestion that blights the  natural wonders of this fine mountain region.  </P></p>

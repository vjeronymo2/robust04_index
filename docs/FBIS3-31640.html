			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 21 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry  expressed resolute disagreement with the course of action of  Defence Minister Antonin Baudys who proposed his initiative for  solving the situation in Bosnia to foreign representatives at  the end of last week.    In a statement issued today, the ministry said that Baudys'  activity "has created an absolutely unacceptable situation from  the point of view of the Czech Republic's foreign political  interests and harmed its good name." With such a line of  action, Baudys has definitely gone beyond the powers of a  cabinet member, the ministry said.    The statement, given to CTK by Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Vit  Kurfurst, says that Baudys did not consult either the Foreign  Ministry or the government about his proposal. The Foreign  Ministry first knew about its content from its foreign partners  which, especially in view of the current visit of Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, has created an absolutely  unacceptable situation from the point of view of the Czech  Republic's foreign political interests.    The proposal was handed to representatives of foreign states  and international organisations by Czech military and Air Force  attaches at Czech representative offices abroad. Such an action  harms the Czech Republic's good name abroad and the efforts of  its diplomatic activity aimed at creating a picture of the Czech  Republic as a reliable and predictable international partner,  the statement says.    The ministry points to the fact that, regardless of the  content of Baudys' proposal, his course of action represents a  definite transgression of the powers of individual cabinet  members as set down in the Czech Constitution and in the law on  power sharing. The method Baudys chose for submitting his  proposal rules out the possibility of this act being understood  as the move of a private person if it were theoretically allowed  for cabinet members to come into contact with foreign partners  as private persons, the statement says.    Baudys informed journalists about his proposal for ending  the  Bosnian conflict on Saturday [19 February]. At the same time,  he admitted that he had not consulted with either the government  or parliament on it. According to Baudys' proposal a "committee  of good will" to be entrusted by the united nations with  overseeing the situation in the crisis regions should play a  major role in Bosnia. According to Baudys, this committee should  be made up of representatives of seven states religiously  connected with the warring sides in Bosnia.</p>

The Japanese reactionaries and other U.S.-toeing forces,  too,  are joining them by clamoring for "international cooperation  system". The South Korean puppet clique broke down talks with  the North and are leaving no stone unturned, as a shock-force,  to stifle the fellow countrymen with the backing of outside  forces.    At a time like this, the United States, Japan and South  Korea  are trying to stage a large-scale joint war gamble. It is only  too clear what they seek through the gamble.    It proves that the U.S., Japan and South Korean  reactionaries  are intending to contain the DPRK militarily through their  conspiracy and tieup under the cloak of "international  cooperation system" and, to this end, they are substantiating  their criminal triangular military alliance.    The United States and its followers are trying to destroy  the  DPRK, the bulwark of socialism, by driving the situation on the  Korean peninsula into extremes militarily, but it is a foolish  idea.    Should the United States and its followers persist in  straining the situation on the Korean peninsula by staging  "Rimpac" joint war exercises, they would be held wholly  responsible for grave consequences arising therefrom.</p>

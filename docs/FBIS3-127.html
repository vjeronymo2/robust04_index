			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lorraine Braid] </F>   [Text] Cape Town Feb 28 SAPA -- A tough programme to ensure  law and order would be implemented by the National Party [NP]  after the election, Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said on  Monday [28 February].    Speaking at a press conference, he said when the NP could no  longer be accused of a lack of legitimacy, more severe  punishments would be put on the statute books and more prisons  built to jail criminals. "We will improve South African Police  [SAP]-community relations because we believe therein lies the  answer to bring down the crime rate. We will also recruit more  force members and improve their training as well as provide even  better technical equipment."    An unfortunate culture of violence had been created in South  Africa through intolerance, intimidation and uncontrolled  supporters. In this, he said, the ANC [African National  Congress] had to be singled out as the main threat to the  democratic process. But the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and far  right-wing also seemed to be vying for this unenviable position.  "Together, their political intolerance and violence threatens  to destabilise the transition to democracy and can, if allowed  to continue unchecked, create a bloodstained election."    The ten major threats to democracy -- in which Mr Kriel said  the ANC, IFP and far right played leading or prominent roles --  were political intolerance, uncontrollable supporters,  intimidation, no-go areas, illegal weapons, war talk,  demonisation of the SAP, murder of policemen, extremism and mass  action. "If these organisations use violence to either win an  election or reach political objectives, how will they act after  gaining victory against their political opponents and when in  control of the state's security organisations?"</p>

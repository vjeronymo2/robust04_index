			<p>BFN     [Text] Following conflicting reports in the local and  foreign media about Chief Moshood Abiola's whereabouts, Mohamed  Okoija sought clarification from Alhaji Nuhu Aliyu, deputy  inspector general of police in charge of operations, who is  leading the search for him.    [Begin recording] [Aliyu] Well, if you can remember clearly,  in one of the interviews we have had either with you or with  somebody else, I have always maintained that Abiola is in Lagos,  and Chief Abiola, you know, is somebody who has a lot of places  where he can take refuge, and a lot of people know it but they  are not forthcoming to let us know. It is, in fact, very  difficult for us to locate him without the cooperation of the  general public, and this cooperation we are not receiving.    [Okoija] Well, perhaps that can be expected because of the  type of clout that he has. But, one wonders why all this is  able to beat police network which we know nowadays is very  sophisticated.    [Aliyu] It is not very unusual that a person like Abiola in  Lagos cannot be located. It is not unusual at all. What is  very surprising is that in spite of all the efforts we have  made....[pauses] We have struck a quite a number places, hoping  that we were going to find him, and up to this moment we have  not been able to do so. I just want to appeal to the members of  the general public that as soon as they know or suspect where he  is they should let us know. After all, he is not the only  person that was declared wanted by the police, and those who  were declared wanted by the police earlier than him showed up,  and they are now in the court of law. If he shows up, he will  eventually go to the court of law where he can be able to defend  himself. I am surprised and disappointed why he has not shown  up.    [Okoija] Now, well, maybe the public is not cooperating  because the price you put on him is not attractive enough.    [Aliyu] In fact, to be honest with you, we shouldn't have  put  any price on him. The public should -- not only the public --  himself, he should have shown up. As soon as it was declared  that he was wanted, he should have come out and said: Look, I  am here. What are you looking for me for? And, (?that is how)  we should now come, take him, take his statement, ask questions,  and then we shall be in a position to know exactly what is going  on.    As at now, he is leaving everybody in doubt, because a  person  of his standing should not leave people in doubt. He should  come forward and say exactly what it is all about. The  utterances of the wife and the utterances of the Nadeco  [National Democratic Coalition], these are just their  utterances. In fact, they are just compounding issues for Chief  Abiola, because as far as we are concerned, we of the police --  because the Nadeco secretary or the spokesman of the Nadeco, one  (Ayo), (Bob Ayo) who has been saying that Abiola, they are  making preparations to receive him in a big way -- well, if they  are making preparations to receive him in a big way, then we of  the police, on our own part, we are more than prepared to  receive him, and I can assure you that as soon as Chief Abiola  shows up, wherever, whenever, we shall be there to pick him up.  [sentence as heard]    [Okoija] Well, his camp is calling on him to form his  government. That is a serious development. If he does form a  government, what do we expect?    [Aliyu] Government? I suppose you do understand that it is  government of the day, and I suppose you know it yourself that  even Abiola himself has recognized that government. If you  (?have been) watching the television advert, it has always been  showing that when Abacha became the president and commander in  chief of this country, Abiola went to receive him, and  congratulated him for becoming the commander in chief and head  of state of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If he sets up a  parallel government, or as it is being claimed that he has  proclaimed himself the president -- because if you read the  interview or listened to the interview granted by Kudirat  Abiola, it appears as if she was talking as the wife of a  president -- that is treason, treason, a felony, a treasonable  felony. Declaration of a parallel government, or a parallel  government when in fact there is [a] government of the day, the  offense is treason.    [Okoija] Have you people been able to ascertain whether  Chief  Abiola is doing all this because he has encouragement from  international quarters?    [Aliyu] Well, if international bodies are encouraging him to  commit treason -- a felony in Nigeria, a serious felony in  Nigeria -- well, that is their own business. As far as we are  concerned, in Nigeria, a person committing a treasonable felony  -- if you remember there was a similar incident where a group of  politicians in Nigeria were tried and convicted of a treasonable  felony.

[passage  omitted]    At the request of journalists Leonid Kravchuk commented on  the standing down of 17 SS-24 missile complexes. "This does not  violate the law," he said. "The law stipulates removal from  Ukrainian territory; this way the missiles are in the silos but  the warheads have been dismantled. Why should they be on  standby when the nuclear button is actually in Russia? It is  better to stand them down: This way they will not be used by  anyone."    Compensation and security guarantees will be stipulated in a  trilateral agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and the United  States.</p>

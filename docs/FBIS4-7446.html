			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister </F> Haris Silajdzic by Branko Tudjen; place and date not given: "The  Agreement Must Not Fail!"]    [Text] It has been very difficult to reach any leading  Bosniak-Muslim official in Washington and entice him into giving  an interview. However, sometimes coincidence is a much more  important factor than the planned goal. We first stumbled  across Mr. Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, in a Washington restaurant, the proprietor  of which is a Croat. It was the night before signing the  agreement. Mr. Silajdzic and his company sat next to our table  where there were five or six Croatian journalists. He promised  he would say something, but suddenly got up (it seems that the  reason was a child that fell asleep) and went toward the door.  We also got up, but too late. We only managed to ask him how  to include the Serbs in all that, so, imitating the Zagreb  dialect, he said: "We will see."    Then there was another coincidence on the Lufthansa flight  from Washington to Frankfurt on Saturday night. We spotted  Silajdzic again. This time he was with Alija Izetbegovic, in  the first class compartment of Lufthansa's Airbus. Silajdzic  did not refuse to talk to me. Our conversation was a kind of an  unauthorized interview over the Atlantic at three o'clock in the  morning, CET.    I first asked him what he thought about the agreement.    He answered, "I think it is a victory of the natural over  the  unnatural. The conflict was unnecessary, planned, and imposed.  The agreement is a victory of the civilized over the  uncivilized. I also think it is a victory of each and every one  of us over ourselves. Wounds are too deep and too fresh. It  took a lot of energy to do this and it will take much energy to  heal the wound."  <H5>  Europe and Reward for Genocide </H5>   I asked Mr. Silajdzic, "Some think the agreement came about  overnight; on the other hand, some say it was initiated a long  time ago."    He replied "Mr. Granic and myself, of course with the  permission of both presidents, have been working on this for  months. The agreement is a result of much effort. We must not  let the agreement fail because of the interest of individuals  who promote radical ideas (there are such people on both sides).  First of all, we must not allow more conflicts, for we would  then be accused by not only the civilized public, but also by  our children and history. The conflict between the Croats and  the Muslims has no other foundation but human stupidity, love of  power, and greed."    Mr. Silajdzic then wanted to state the following:    "The United States is both on your side and our side, but I  must reproach it for still tolerating the aggression and  rewarding the genocide as a means of establishing peace."    I thought it logical to ask about his views on the problem  of  the UNPA [UN Protected Area] zones in Croatia.    He said, "Everything must be founded on the UN Charter and  on  the principles of the London conference, which say that  territory cannot be taken by force. President Clinton confirmed  that the United States would protect the integrity of all  countries in this region, especially that of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina. One cannot allow changing borders in the  20th century under the pretext that all members of one nation  must live in one country. Serbian aggression is a prism through  which we can see all sides of Europe. Europe has hitherto shown  one of its darker sides. Fortunately, relations change. Both  sides, Croatian and ours, must persist on the Washington  agreement for it will significantly improve both our positions."    "But what will happen to the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina?  The West and Russia have opposite intentions," I asked.    Silajdzic answered, "The Serbs will be offered the chance to  join the agreement that is supported by the entire civilized  world. I would not like to discuss details. I believe a great  number of the Serbs want peace, but cannot say it. The problem  lies in the fact that the West gives legitimacy to those who  destroyed all principles of our civilization, and takes the  legitimacy away from those whose rights were violated -- the  very rights that are so often mentioned by the West. I am  curious to know how many observers Western countries will send  to Sarajevo for the Serbian assembly that will take place on 27  March. Continuing the process, we will consider the problem of  the union with the Serb entity existing on predominantly Serb  areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina."   <H5>    Satanization of Fundamentalism </H5>   I asked Mr. Silajdzic if he was a Bosniak or a Muslim.    He replied "I am a Bosniak who was not allowed to be called  that, although we have existed for a thousand years.  Unfortunately, due to various circumstances, it so happened  that the bond between the name of the country and the nation  broke, and we were named after our religion."    During our conversation, we broached the question of Islamic  fundamentalism. Interestingly enough -- this was not an  interview in the usual sense, so I can tell you my impressions  -- Mr. Silajdzic took a great interest in the subject.    He answered, "Every belief and religion is fundamental by  definition. This is a term which is supposed to degrade all  aspects of cultural, religious, and social dynamism in Islamic  countries in the past couple of decades. The term  fundamentalism is used as an ideological alternative that, after  the fall of socialism, is taken as a serious competition and  opponent. And this is why it has negative connotations."    I then asked, "But even if you were right, fundamentalism is  very much talked and written about. You cannot disregard that."    He said, "The satanization of fundamentalism, which is a  result of a long process, definitely does not lead anywhere.  This benefits those who do not have much to do with religion,  but want to have power. That is the problem."    Parting with Mr. Silajdzic, who was then, incidentally,  "taken over" by a journalist of STERN who happened to be there,  I remembered something I had heard when we were leaving  Washington: That the radical change of U.S. views has not been  made because of Islamic countries, nor because of Russian  penetration onto the territory of former Yugoslavia, but because  of domestic politics. If that is the case, then things are not  as we thought they were. However, Croatia would not be a loser  in that case either.</p>

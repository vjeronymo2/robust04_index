			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "National Bank Sharply Changes </F> Foreign Currency Exchange Rates"]    [Text] The National Bank of Azerbaijan has sharply changed  the exchange rates of foreign currency with respect to the  manat. Now $1 is valued at 1,100 manat. As Abdulla  Melik-Aslanov, deputy chairman of the board of the National  Bank, informed a correspondent of the ANS-PRESS agency, the new  exchange rate is more realistic and acceptable under today's  critical economic conditions. A. Melik-Aslanov believes the  increased bank exchange rate will not be accompanied by  significant changes on the currency black market. He emphasized  that "more surprises lie in store" with respect to official  currency exchange rates.</p>

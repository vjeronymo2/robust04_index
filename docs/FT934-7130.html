			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: A mixed bag of Nutcrackers - Clement Crisp finds this ballet the Yuletide favourite again IF YOUR first balletic concern at Yuletide is a treat for the tots, then this probably means The Nutcracker, though there are alternatives, as I shall reveal hereafter. Without thought for your purse, the best Nutcracker available is Sir Peter Wright's version for the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, on view intermittently from December 17 until January 5 (please check Opera House schedules). The choreography is authentic and good; Julia Trevelyan Oman's first act designs are especially attractive and magical. You can judge the success of a Nutcracker by the Ahs and Oohs (yours as well as your infant charge's) which greet the moment when the Christmas Tree grows to vast size. In this staging the magic is triumphant, and the battle with the mice the best you can see anywhere. Unhesitatingly recommended. (En passant, let me note that if you are in New York, Balanchine's Nutcracker is on view at the State Theater on Lincoln Center at the year's end, and is superb). The other London Nutcracker is shown by English National Ballet in a marathon at the Royal Festival Hall, in constant performance for five - dear Heaven, have pity on the dancers] - weeks from December 22 until January 22. Lots of matinees. (Check schedules for times). Ben Stevenson's staging is a suspect combination of slapstick and winsomeness, but that is what the young enjoy, albeit the violence so necessary to the infant imagination is chiefly committed by Stevenson's dreary choreography against the ravishing score. Interesting new casts. The Royal Ballet is not guiltless this year: its other seasonal offering is the rampant infantilism of Tales of Beatrix Potter. Since I thought this the most foolish thing the company had done in years - Ashton made the choreography expressly for the cinema - I can only record that there are all those cute animals teetering about the stage in a frenzy of charm. The young may rejoice - though 70 minutes is quite a span of sitting still for the teenies, for whom there are special early matinees (December 21, 22, 29, January 8: check starting times) which offer this piece on its own at somewhat reduced prices. Ballet-lovers may find it as repellant as I did: regular performances pair it with Balanchine's glorious Ballet Imperial - which is more like shock therapy than programme building. Birmingham Royal Ballet also offers Nutcracker, in Peter Wright's other version, with happy narrative, wonderful design (by John Macfarlane) and Drosselmeyer as a conjuror. It is great fun, and on show at the Birmingham Hippodrome from December 3 until December 18. For anyone in Paris, the Opera Ballet at the Palais Garnier will reveal its new acquisition - John Neumeier's Nutcracker from December 17 until December 31 (no performances on December 19 or 25). I thought it an odd staging when I saw it with Makarova in Hamburg nearly 20 years ago, but it is full of dancing, and the Opera's artists are superlatively good. Meanwhile, at Sadler's Wells Theatre the Christmas treats are varied. Adventures in Motion Pictures, a jolly modern-dance troupe, plays Matthew Bourne's up-dating of the Nutcracker between December 8 and 18. It starts in an orphanage terrorised by dear old Dr. Dross, and moves from there to all sorts of jokes and modish fun. I enjoyed it at its Edinburgh Festival debut last year. Then, from December 21 until January 8, the Black Light Theatre of Prague proposes a version of Peter Pan. I know nothing of the staging, but the company specialises in magical illusions, and promises 'a musical adaptation'. Check with Sadler's Wells for timing details of both these performances. Peter Pan is also on offer with Scottish Ballet, which is presenting Graham Lustig's balletic version at Glasgow's Theatre Royal between December 9 and December 24. The bairns will probably be less concerned than I was, at the ballet's premiere, about the merits of the staging. Northern Ballet Theatre, on tour, proposes its engaging Christmas Carol for the week of December 7 in Hull: good Dickensian fun. Thereafter Blackpool (for the week of December 14) and Halifax (for the week of December 28) can see the company's recent Cinderella, for which I have no time. And, if a theatre visit is not possible for the young, there are good dance videos which will delight the dance-mad. But seek out the great names: some recent issues immortalise the modish and the frankly inept. The old Royal Ballet Swan Lake with Makarova and Dowell; Semenyaka and Mukhamedov in Raymonda; Kolpakova and the Kirov in Sleeping Beauty, the Kirov Corsaire, are all delights. And, perish the thought, there is even Tales of Beatrix Potter as Ashton intended. Details and availability can be found in the back pages of The Dancing Times. (Tel 071 - 250 - 3006)</p>

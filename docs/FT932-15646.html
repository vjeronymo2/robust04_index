			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Fashion: Fancy dress goes with the job - Dressing for the Professions / Advertising TOGETHER WITH a finely-tuned nose for the most discreet table in a restaurant, a smooth way round the wine list and a liking for bruschetta, what the successful advertising man needs is a chameleon-like ability to adapt to changing moods and style. For nowhere does how you dress matter more than in the world of advertising, where image is everything and the medium IS the message. Walk into almost any agency and you are made instantly aware that a vital part of the potent cocktail on offer is style - and an essential part of that style is the dress of the people who work there. Not that anything so crude as an edict is issued - 'most people in the industry,' says Jim Allman, director in charge of Unilever at J. Walter Thompson, 'sense by osmosis what will and will not do' - for one of the paradoxes of Adland is that in a world where dress really matters immense freedom is allowed. Paul Woolmington, managing director of 20/20 Media and a director and shareholder in Delaney, Fletcher, Slaymaker, Delaney and Bozell (you have to get used to these names in Adland) echoes the sentiment. 'One of the great beauties of this business is that we can express ourselves more freely than, say, the banking community. We can buy things for work that we are happy to wear in our private lives. We are ultimately businessmen in that we have to sell our services successfuly to survive and yet what we are selling is our creativity. There is a dichotomy, a tension, if you like, that is always there. We have to look as if million-pound budgets are safe in our hands and at the same time as if we are brilliant enough to come up with an award-winning campaign. 'A certain chameleon-like quality is a great asset. My company looks after financial houses such as Merrill Lynch, the Ministry of Defence as well as food companies, Chrysler cars and Nikon cameras. It makes sense not to mix oil with water. If I were going to see Merrill Lynch I would dress rather differently from if I were going to see my clients at Sago, where everybody is young and casually dressed.' The great divide in Ad-land is between those who are known as the 'suits' (all those in account management) and the 'creatives' (the copy-writers and art directors) although every account director has also to look a little creative, and every creative director has to look responsible and businesslike. The days when you could tell the creatives by their jeans and T-shirts, their pony-tails and Doc Martens have gone. At J. Walter Thompson, for instance, Jim Allman says: 'Creative people dress more conservatively than you would think and in senior positions often dress much more like business people.' Jim Allman himself is a 'suit', one of the new breed of international agency men, in charge of global account (Unilever) worth millions. An American married to an Italian and now working in London, his dress reflects his peripatetic way of life. 'I am probably not typical of a London agency man,' he says. 'I have lived half of my adult life in Italy and you cannot live there without it affecting your aesthetic sense profoundly. My suits come from a tailor in Rome called Ulderico Basili to whom I was introduced by my father-in-law - this is much more for convenience and because I like him than for any snob value. He made the clothes I got married in and his made-to-measure suits cost less than most off-the-peg ones. My shirts are made by Il Portone in Rome - another of my father-in-law's introductions. 'Basically I hate to shop and once I find somewhere that suits me I tend to stick with it. Because I have to travel a lot for my job I can shop all over the world. All my neckties, come from Ralph Lauren - I like the look, the way they knot. All my sportswear also comes from Ralph Lauren. 'I buy traditional English shoes but I also have a favourite Italian brand - Diego Della Valle. I like Paul Smith, particularly his casual things. Winter coats are my great passion - I buy them from Bardelli in Milan and I have them in grey, navy and camel as well as a green loden one from Austria. My father never let me leave home without a white linen handkerchief in my pocket and to this day I always have one, though now they usually come from Jesurum just off the Piazza San Marco in Venice.' Paul Woolmington is also a 'suit'. 'Typically, I would wear a suit but I wouldn't wear a totally conventional Savile Row one. For instance I might wear a slightly alternative pin-stripe by Armani which is looser and slightly less formal than the conventional Savile Row version, but it would still pass muster and is also very comfortable for all the charging around I have to do all day. 'The creatives here are very smart. They would shop in the same shops that I do but as their angle is being creative they will probably make it just a little more interesting. They might wear a tweedy-looking suit by Margaret Howell and team it with a tweedy waistcoat. The grunge look is most likely to come via the creatives.' Billy Mawhinney - an Irish George Best lookalike - as joint executive creative director of J. Walter Thompson is very much a 'creative' but his personal style is what he calls 'smart but casual'. Today, for instance, he is in Hugo Boss ('though personally I prefer Jasper Conran to anybody') and whenever he has clients coming to see him he would always wear a suit. 'Creatives, though, tend to wear them slightly differently - they may button up the shirt and wear it without a tie and put on a brighter pair of socks. I might wear a casual polo shirt under a smart suit. A few years ago a creative would signal his separateness from the suits by wearing a sober shirt and a bright tie. There is a feeling that you have to give your dress some kind of presence - even if you just add a huge badge. There ought to be something irreverent.' When it comes to the women 'creatives' there tends to be a bit of role-playing, a bit of fancy-dress - one day it could be rock-star style, all leather and boots, another day Regency dandy. 'There has to be a bit of theatre in what they do. For instance, a girl would not wear a power suit unless she made a joke of it, sent it up a bit. The poorer they are the more they play games with accessories.' Charity Charity, an associate director and copy-writer at J. Walter Thompson and thus definitely a 'creative', says: 'Put it this way, there is never any call for sobriety in our dress. It's almost not playing the game to wear anything too city or too sober. You don't want to look like somebody with no passion or who has borrowed other people's ideas. 'As creatives we are supposed to be original thinkers so our uniform is one of dissent. Clients seem rather to like it - they can readily identify us at meetings, they know who we are meant to be. Personally, I would never wear something like jeans - too conformist. Today, for instance, I'm wearing a pair of antique Victorian lace-up boots, an Australian Bushman's hat, an extremely short tight blue skirt, a matching riding-style jacket and a Voghi scarf which is the longest thing I've got on. 'I often try to wear something seasonal - around Christmas I will wear the family tartan, on cold days I sometimes wear ten petticoats, around Chinese New Year it might be a cheong-sam and jade necklaces. I would never wear a power suit, unless I diffused it in some way. 'Female suits go to places like Harvey Nichols where they probably use the wardrobe advice service and turn up to look at a whole range of options lined up for them, or they would shop at Nicole Farhi or buy Italian labels. The colours would be brighter than you would find in the City of London, they would not think twice about wearing floaty numbers - and they NEVER carry huge hold-all handbags. 'They have to look neat and above all they must not look as if they are shambolic thinkers. The clothes have to say they are dependable and reliable but that they also have flair.' In a world full of legendary snappy dressers - Charles Saatchi, renowned for his Comme des Garcons suits, John Hegarty, the archetypal 80s Paul Smith man, Robin Wight with his bright bow-ties and his silk waistcoats, Frank Lowe and his Armani suits - the new name that is most mentioned when chat turns to clothes is Graham Fink of Gold Greenless Trott. Given to Gaultier suits worn without a shirt and to attending black-tie dinners in an unconventional eclectic mix of his own, he is generally conceded to have the looks and the personal style to get away with his idiosyncratic way of dressing. Mostly, advertising people's sartorial escapades are looked on with affectionate amusement. Graham Fink may still be remembered for his eclectic dinner suit but Charity Charity had the chutzpah to wear a Pounds 9.99 eau-de-nil satin slip from Marks and Spencer and 'some rather nice jewellery from Granny' to an industry dinner - and nobody batted an eye-lid.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] The country's main political forces have reached an  agreement for giving autonomy to the electoral bodies. It is an  important reform that gives the people control in the decisions  of the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE]. These are the  proposals that will be voted during the special congressional  sessions.    The PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], PAN [National  Action Party], and the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution]  reached an agreement last night to reform the IFE and granted a  majority to the people's participation. According to the  proposal, which will be discussed next week during the special  congressional sessions, the following will be the composition of  the body as agreed upon by the country's three main political  forces .    The political parties have 10 votes: four from the PRI, two  from PAN, and one each from the PRD, PPS [Popular Socialist  Party], PARM [Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution], and  the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party; this  represents 47.6 percent of the total.    With the reform, there will be one representative from each  party, with a right of verbal participation but not to vote.  The people's participation includes six magistrate-advisers,  who must be lawyers, with a total of six votes, representing  28.6 percent of the total.    The reform proposed the participation of six  citizen-advisers, without any professional requirements, who  must be elected by a congressional two-thirds majority and with  six votes, representing 54.5 percent of the total.    The legislative branch participates with four votes, two  deputies and two senators who represent 19 percent of the total.  With the reform, they would have the same four votes, two  deputies and two senators, who would now represent 36.4 percent  of the total.    The president of IFE--that is, the government secretary--has  one vote, with a right to break a tie and representation for 4.8  percent of the total. With the reform, that official will  continue to have one vote but without a right to break a tie and  with a participation of 9.1 percent of the total.    Presently the IFE composition represents 21 votes; with the  reform it would represent 11 votes. In this manner, the major  weight of the decisions would be delegated to the  representatives of society.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mauritius plans to overhaul flagging sugar industry - Julian Ozanne on the challenges faced by Africa's third largest producer in a changing market A CRITICAL strategic review of the Mauritian sugar industry is being undertaken by the government and producers as the sector, the backbone of the economy, confronts the prospect of declining revenues for its annual production of 600,000 to 650,000 tonnes. Production last year dropped to 611,340 tonnes from 624,302 tonnes in 1990 as a result of drought and continued contraction in the area planted. Concerns are mounting in Mauritius that this trend will continue as revenues are forecast to stagnate or decline as the European Community considers reducing the guaranteed support price paid to African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) producers under the Lome convention. A major overhaul of the industry is now critical if Mauritius, Africa's third largest sugar producer after South Africa and Egypt, is to remain competitive and productive in a changing world market. A report drawn up by the Mauritius Chamber of Agriculture lays down the guidelines for a reappraisal of the sector. It warns that the industry has come to a crossroads and that if major hard policy decisions are not confronted now the industry's decline is inevitable. At the heart of the concerns voiced by the 19 big estate producers, who account for 62 per cent of cane production, is the need for a fundamental reassessment of the role of state intervention in the industry. However, there appear to be growing differences between the powerful sugar lobby and the government over what role the state should play. The Chamber of Agriculture says that the sugar industry is heavily regulated and that significant liberalisation is vital to restore the sector's profitability and preserve its international competitiveness. 'If reform does not take place,' the chamber warns, 'there is a very real risk that resources will gradually be siphoned off from the sugar industry to other sectors.' The chamber has put forward a number of policy recommendations to a joint government-private sector working committee, which include: Price liberalisation - The industry argues that price controls on domestic sales make Mauritian sugar the cheapest in the world and force the industry to subsidise the consumer by up to 50 per cent of the cost of production. Reform and Reduction in taxation, export duty and government cesses. Abolition of restrictions which prevent a miller from closing an economically unviable factory at will. Improved incentives for investment in the milling sector. Already this year the government has responded to some demands made by producers. The June budget provided for the issue of tax free debentures by sugar companies for the modernisation of their equipment and removed customs duty on mechanical harvesters. In August the government also substantially increased the domestic price of sugar injecting MR60m (Pounds 2m) into the industry. Mr Madan Dulloo, agriculture minister, says other measures will be considered to amend the Sugar Industry Efficiency Act before the end of the year. But he warns that the government is not going to give in to the 'propaganda' of sugar barons and that, given the pivotal importance of the sector to the economy, any policy changes will have to be balanced within a political, economic and social context and will have to ensure the protection of the 33,000 small planters. The debate on the proper role of government in the Mauritian sugar industry is likely to continue for several years and any changes will probably be minor. In the meantime both government and producers are working on the areas on which they do agree, which include: The need significantly to boost sugar yields from the present rate for the estate sector of 8.5 tonnes a hectare (3,4 tonnes an acre) to 10 tonnes or more by better irrigation techniques. Encouraging small holder farmers to regroup in Land Unit Management Areas to enable them to take advantage of better mechanisation for land preparation and harvesting. Continuing the development of an international marketing policy which increases annual sales of 75,000 tonnes of premium sugars like demerara and molasses sugar. Finding new ways to add value to by-products of the sugar industry and intensify agricultural diversification. If the government and producers can find creative ways to implement many of these measures the industry hopes to restore its competitiveness and profitability and to restore production to the 1973 peak level of more than 700,000 tonnes to reduce costs further and be able to capitalise on new opportunities on the international market.</p>

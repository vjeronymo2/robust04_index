The SNA senior  spokesman said that in their attacks on districts in Galguduud  region, the elements massacred innocent and defenseless people  while destroying much property. The spokesman said the attack  had been organized by UNOSOM in an effort to stir up  confrontations between the communities in the various regions of  Somalia. It was also a violation of the cease-fire agreed by  the Somali people in the Addis Ababa Accord and the agreement of  the central regions of Somalia by the supporters of SNA, Somali  Salvation Democratic Front, and Somali National Democratic Union  signed following the 28 May to 4 June 1993 peace conference in  Mogadishu. In conclusion, the SNA senior spokesman called on  the Somali people in Galguduud region to avoid becoming victims  of UNOSOM's treacherous maneuvers aimed at creating renewed  friction among the Somali people, who were in dire need of peace  and justice.</p>

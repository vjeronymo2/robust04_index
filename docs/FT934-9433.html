			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (11): Cable bypasses the monopoly - The media A COUNTRY like Austria, which lives in the shadow of a much larger country that shares the same language, is bound to have trouble maintaining its national media. Technological advances and economic liberalisation have made it almost impossible to protect a national media, but the government goes on trying. Austria is one of the last countries in Europe with a state broadcasting monopoly. Neither private television nor radio stations are allowed, and the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) has a government mandate to air quality documentaries as well as important cultural events. This has made two-channel ORF perhaps the most respected German language television group, but not the most profitable. In the newspaper sector, most of the papers that were backed by political parties have recently folded, but the government is still spending more than Sch200m a year to subsidise a handful of dailies with smaller circulations. Even so, the days of a distinctively national media appear numbered, whether Austria joins the European Community or not. Through the growth of cable television, more than half of Austrian households can watch German TV channels, including the popular commercial stations like SAT 1 and RTL. And in recent years, German newspaper concerns, looking for an opportunity to invest excess cash, have bought large stakes in some of the largest Austrian publishing groups. It all started in the mid-1980s with a quarrel between the co-owners of the largest tabloid daily, the Kronenzeitung. Hans Dichand was looking for someone to buy out his long-time partner Kurt Falk for Sch2bn, and finally found Westdeutsche Algemeine Zeitung (WAZ), a large German newspaper chain. WAZ then went on to invest in Kurier, the second-largest daily, which also owns several important magazines. This created the media group with the highest market share anywhere in Europe. Other German media groups jumped in. Axel Springer Verlag, in 1988, helped launch the Standard, which soon became the country's largest quality daily, and took stakes in other newsprint products. As many papers are currently losing money, they depend financially on their German sugar daddies. Even bigger changes are happening in the electronic media. Standing on the verge of EC membership, Austria knows that it cannot maintain the ORF monopoly for long. But the legalisation of private broadcasting has been stymied by a battle over influence and ideology between the two main political parties, the Social Democrats (SPO) and the conservative People's Party (OVP). The Social Democrats, who dislike commercial television, want to permit a private channel to co-exist next to the two ORF channels. Conservatives argue that the advertising pie is much too small to support three Austrian channels. So they want ORF to spin off its second channel to private investors, a move strongly opposed by the ORF leadership. Meanwhile, a power struggle has begun at ORF following the retirement of veteran chairman Gerd Bacher. Strong-willed and politically aware, Mr Bacher had improved ORF's financial fortunes by cutting costs and boosting the state-regulated advertising revenues. His successor, however, will have to do more to guarantee the group's survival amid growing competition. He will have to cut down on the vast bureaucracy and curtail political interference in personnel decisions and content. A law permitting private radio stations will finally come into effect next year, but its terms are controversial. Foreign participation will be limited to 25 per cent, and most of the new stations are likely to be controlled by the large newspaper groups and quasi-governmental institutions, thus increasing the already high concentration of media power. The small independent radio stations that set up across the border in neighbouring countries and broadcast into Austria are likely to fold.</p>

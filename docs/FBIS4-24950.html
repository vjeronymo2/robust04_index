			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Order has been restored  to a renowned Great Wall tourist spot near Beijing through  measures taken by the municipal government in the past two  months.    Police said that no extortion or racketeering cases had been  reported at the Badaling section of the Great Wall, a drive of  about 90 minutes from the city centre, since the end of April.  Forced sales had evidently decreased.    Since the beginning of the year, the famous tourist site had  been plagued by cases of forced sales, extortion and  racketeering. The victims were Chinese and overseas tourists,  and sometimes even foreign diplomatic personnel could not  escape, according to police sources.    As a result, normal tourist order disappeared, and the  number  of visitors to that site declined.    Concentrated efforts were made from late April. A team of  300 people, from police departments, industrial and commercial  administration departments and city order departments, regularly  and persistently inspected the area, achieving remarkable  success.    Seven illegal vendors were detained. The stock of four  stalls near the wall was confiscated and they were banned from  trading for two months. Confiscated goods and fines totalled  31,000 yuan.    In addition, education courses were given to vendors at the  site and farmers around the area.    Police said they have improved telecommunications and  transport equipment for the site. Police and industrial and  commercial departments extended their own daily duty times by an  hour.    The Badaling section of the Great Wall, which in 1991 was  listed as a world top heritage site by the United Nations,  stretches along 3.7 km. More than five million tourists visited  the site last year.</p>

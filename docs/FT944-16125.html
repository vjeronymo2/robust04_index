			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cimpor buys 51% of Mozambican producer Cimpor, Portugal's partially-privatised cement group, has acquired 51 per cent of state-owned Cimentos de Mocambique, the southern African's country's only cement producer, for Dollars 20m, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. Cimpor was chosen from several candidates, including South African groups, who put forward proposals for the privatisation. Cimpor will back a Dollars 96m investment in the recovery of CM's three production plants over the next 10 years. Cement production has been severely curtailed in Mozambique by 15 years of civil war. The country, a former Portuguese colony, is to hold multi-party elections on October 27. Cimpor aims to raise CM's production capacity to 1.1bn tonnes a year and produce about 870,000 tonnes a year by 2004. Cimpor is to nominate three members of CM's five-member board. Twenty per cent of Cimpor's capital was privatised in July. A further 20 to 25 per cent is to be sold on foreign stock exchanges followed by the sale of another 20 to 30 per cent in Portugal. Cimpor began a process of internationalisation in 1992 when it acquired 97.7 per cent of Spanish cement company Corporacion Noroeste.</p>

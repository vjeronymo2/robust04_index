The governor said in his report that Jiangsu recorded a GNP  [gross national product] value of 255 billion yuan in 1993, an  increase of 18.5 percent over 1992.    Its per capita GNP reached 3,675 yuan in the same year,  which  is almost 1,000 yuan more than the national average, according  to the report.    Jiangsu has been one of the Chinese regions of fast  development ever since the country adopted the policy of reform  and opening to the outside world.    Statistics by the provincial statistics bureau show that  from  1979 to 1993, the province's GNP value increased at 11.6 percent  a year. The rate of increase shot up to an average of 18.6  percent from 1991 to 1993.    Such a fast, sustained and healthy development of the  economy, as described by the report, was only made possible by a  consistent effort in restructuring its industrial structure and  improving the economic performances of enterprises, the governor  said.    In 1993, the province saw increases varying from 20 percent  to 90 percent in its production of washing machines, motor  vehicles, glass, cement, steel, sodium carbonate, beans and  fruit, all of which sold well in the market.    The province also witnessed a big boost in its raw materials  industry over the past few years. While it took the province 28  years to bring its annual steel production up to one million  tons and five years to two million tons, the jump to three  million tons, its original goal for the year 2000, was only a  matter of two years.    Meanwhile, the province's consumption of raw materials and  energy per unit industrial output has dropped, resulting in its  comprehensive index for industrial economic efficiency rising by  10 percent to reach 99.3 percent.    Economic experts hold that Jiangsu's powerful development is  the result of an economy that is getting more and more  market-oriented and internationalized, with market demand the  ultimate determinant behind the increase.    In the past year, the province started 450 markets for labor  and raw materials and wholesale markets for industrial and  agricultural products. Six of them reported an annual business  volume of one billion yuan apiece.    Its consumer products retail value and sales of means of  production both exceeded 100 billion yuan in 1993, increasing by  33.9 percent and 43.7 percent over those of 1992, respectively.    The province has been seeking to expand its overseas market.  It exported 5.96 billion U.S. dollars worth of products in  1993, ranking it fourth among Chinese regions.    The province now owns 368 non-trade enterprises overseas,  among which 210 were started last year. It is now the Chinese  region with the biggest number of such ventures.    Various development zones have become an important  locomotive  for the province's economic growth. By the end of 1993, there  were more than 6,000 enterprises in operation or under  construction in the province's 10 economic development zones,  high-tech development zones, free-trade zones and tourist  resorts at the national level and a larger number of such zones  at the provincial level.    The service industry has been one of the economic sectors  enjoying the greatest boom. In 1993, the output value of the  service industry accounted for 24.4 percent of the province's  total GNP value, while in rural areas, 84.6 percent of the GNP  value was produced by the processing and service industries.</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / OECD Employment Outlook: Collective bargaining remains prevalent Collective bargaining is not evolving along the lines of one single model, but, with some exceptions, the number of workers covered by collective agreements has remained consistently high over the past decade, according to a special chapter of the OECD outlook, writes David Goodhart. In 12 out of 17 countries for which data are available at least two-thirds of employees are covered by collective agreements. But the chapter also examines the wide disparity between the number of workers in unions and the much higher number who are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. The OECD says that the most extreme disparity can be found in France and Spain where, respectively, 10 and 11 per cent of the workforce are in unions, but 92 per cent and 68 per cent are covered by collective bargaining. In Austria 98 per cent are covered by collective bargaining with 46 per cent in unions. Some 32 per cent are unionised in Germany but 90 per cent are covered by collective bargaining. In the US 18 per cent are covered by collective bargaining and 16 per cent are in unions. The unionisation rate in the UK is 39 per cent, with collective bargaining coverage of 47 per cent.</p>

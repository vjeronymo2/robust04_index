Paul recommended "a commitment acceptable for President  (Jean- Bertrand) Aristide, as well as for the other sectors  involved in the crisis." In an interview for EFE, Paul blamed  the international community and domestic sectors that have  promoted the current deadlock, for the Haitian crisis.    "It is necessary to modify the proposal, which cannot be  viewed as a plan yet. In order for it to become a plan,  President Aristide and the other sectors must accept it," Paul  said. "The international community has not adopted a firm  position on the measures contained in the Governor's Island  Accord and the ultimatum given to the military leaders by four  countries (France, Canada, the United States, and Venezuela)  which expired on 15 January," Paul stressed.    The FNCD leader said that some sectors support the dilatory  tactics that have prolonged the Haitian crisis since 30  September 1991, when a group of military leaders overthrew  Constitutional President Aristide. Paul also mentioned the lack  of cohesion in the democratic sector, which has favored a "fatal  confusion and a rotten situation," adding that the same  situation prevails in the parliament.    The political leader said that different groups are acting  in  the Haitian political scene against democracy. "While some  people are reacting emotionally and others are trying to  maintain the situation of crisis, we must admit that there are  others who are acting in good faith," Paul added.    With regard to differences expressed within the FNCD and the  support for the parliamentarian resolution from the Party of the  National Congress of Democratic Movements (CONACOM), Paul said  those are normal situations in the various fronts and political  coalitions. As an example, he mentioned the Nicaraguan  Sandinist National Liberation Front and the Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front in El Salvador.    Paul, who said he is confident some legislators will change  their position, said that "the FNCD's position has not changed  and is based on strengthening democracy and respecting the  democratic rules of the game."</p>

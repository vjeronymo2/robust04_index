			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Green Party of Ukraine and the Ukrainian  ecological association "Green World" held a news conference on  18 March dedicated to the issue of the ecologically dangerous  enterprises in Kiev. These, in particular, are plants "Radykal"  [Radical], "Khimvolokno" [Chemical Fiber], TE-6, as well as  automobile transport and the radioactive contamination of the  capital as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear  power station.    The news conference was attended by Green Party Chairman  Vitaliy Kononov, Yuriy Samoylenko, first deputy chairman of the  Ukrainian ecological association "Green World", Serhiy  Konyukhov, the chairman of the Ecological Commission of the  Ukrainian Republican Party, Mykhaylo Mykhalko, the chairman of  the "Save Holosiyevo" Union [woodland on outskirts of Kiev], and  others. Anatoliy Panov, the executive director of the newspaper  ZELENYY SVIT [GREEN WORLD], expressed his conviction that the  "hushing up of the fact that Kiev did suffer as a result of the  accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station is not just a  detrimental but a criminal phenomenon. If our state has no  money to provide medical treatment to Kievites and improve their  health, this money could be provided by the world public."    At the news conference, Greenpeace-Ukraine made public its  press release disclosing a secret decree No. 64/94 by Ukraine's  president of 23 February 1994 "On urgent measures to develop  nuclear power engineering and create a nuclear-fuel cycle in  Ukraine." The decree, in particular, envisages the  commissioning of four new reactors at the Zaporozhye,  Khmelnitskiy, and Rovno nuclear power stations and also the  repair and putting into operation of the second power unit at  the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which was ruined by fire in  October 1991.</p>

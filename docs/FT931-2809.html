			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Firefighters threaten pay strike A NATIONAL strike by Britain's 49,000 firefighters was threatened yesterday if the government refuses to fund a pay award calculated under a formula which has been in force since 1979. The warning came from Fire Brigades Union leaders after a meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. Mr Clarke insisted that no exceptions could be made to the 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit introduced by the government last November. Mr Ken Cameron, general secretary of the FBU, said that if the government did not honour the pay formula a strike 'looks inevitable'. The firefighters' pay formula - introduced to settle a damaging nine-week national strike - works retrospectively each November, linking earnings to the upper quartile of full-time male manual workers' pay in the government's annual New Earnings Survey. This year's survey is expected to be published by early summer. Mr Clarke told FBU officials that no decision had been taken to do away with the pay formula. He emphasised, however, that the government was not a party to it, as firefighters are employed by local authorities, and the government was not involved in pay negotiat-ions. But he said he could not accept that firefighters should be treated as an exception to the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit for public-sector workers in the current wage round. Shortly before the introduction of the pay limit the firefighters received a 4.9 per cent wage increase under the pay formula. Mr Clarke said any rise for firefighters was a question for the local authorities, whose funding in the 1993-94 financial year had been calculated on the assumption that wage increases would not exceed 1.5 per cent. He said that the employers' side of the national joint council for the fire service had said it was too early to decide what pay level the formula might produce in November 1993 and they did not intend to negotiate in advance. 'Funding for local authorities for 1994-95 will clearly need to be determined in the light of economic circumstances later in the year,' Mr Clarke said. 'The firefighters will not know whether or not they have a dispute until November 1994, when the pay settlement for that year is decided. We cannot have a dispute now about what might or might not happen then.' Mr Cameron said 28 resolutions on pay had been sent in for debate at the FBU's annual conference, which is to be held in May. He said he believed that a resolution threatening strike action over pay would be carried unless the government intervened.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Patten lists tight curbs for student unions MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, announced yesterday that student unions are to be made voluntary organisations. They will be barred from using public funds for political campaigning. Proposals he intends to include in an education bill in the next session of parliament would limit public funding to a small group of core activities. Fees to affiliate to political organisations, including the National Union of Students, would not be paid by the state. Unions would have to ask students to opt into them by paying individual fees. Mr Patten said: 'Student unions should be more accountable and fully representative. We shall therefore provide for institutions to develop and implement codes of practice governing the conduct and behaviour of their campus unions. 'Our intention is not to impede students' activities. It is to limit the purposes for which stud-ent unions can spend public money.' Dr David Harrison of Exeter University, who chairs the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, said the proposals were 'a steam hammer to crack a nut'. He attacked the decision to limit students' unions to a specific list of activities. He said: 'The CVCP has told ministers that it is extremely difficult to define core activities in this way. It is very curious that the government's list does not include academic, artistic and cultural activities, but does include sports and catering.' Dr Harrison also criticised the three-month consultation period, which starts just as university terms are ending, and will end when students start to return in October. Ms Lorna Fitzsimons, president of the National Union of Students, agreed with Dr Harrison. She said: 'It's a very expensive bone for Mr Patten to toss to the right wing and save his popularity.' The students' union at the London School of Economics also attacked the proposals. An official said it might prevent unions from taking part in 'such vital areas as rag charity fund-raising'. It would also put an end to the LSE union's policy of paying for scholarships for those in need.</p>

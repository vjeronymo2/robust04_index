Risk Characterization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To assess the public health risk associated with the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMT in gasoline in the United States, the available qualitative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and quantitative health effects information on Mn must be related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the available exposure information. From the standpoint of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualitative hazard identification, the available evidence amply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates that inhaled Mn is toxic to the nervous system, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respiratory system, and the male reproductive system. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity of Mn by different routes of exposure has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated by numerous medical reports and epidemiological and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimental studies. However, available data do not allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantitative estimation of the relative toxicological potency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different Mn compounds or permit quantitative route-to-route  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extrapolations for predicting the effects of Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The focus of the above health assessment discussion has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the RfC and the types of risks associated with chronic Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures because, for the most part, acute effect levels appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be considerably higher than the highest projected exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels. However, the issue of less-than-chronic exposures does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arise with respect to the potential for developmental toxicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is widely recognized that the human CNS develops over a period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of several years, prenatally and postnatally, and can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vulnerable to long-term or irreversible effects if damage occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during certain ``critical stages'' of development. Recent evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from ongoing longitudinal studies of children indicates that lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Pb) exposure (measured as blood Pb level) around 2 years of age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in particular is associated with reduced cognitive performance at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 to 10 years of age. Such evidence raises the concern that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to another neurotoxic metal such as Mn during part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> early development might also be capable of inducing permanent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irreversible damage to the developing CNS. Moreover, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ramifications of such damage might extend to other important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions, such as reproduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Children may also be at higher risk in terms of exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of biomedical and metabolic differences at a young age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (greater uptake and retention) and/or because of the longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration of their exposure over a lifetime. Over time, small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairments in neurobehavioral function may accumulate. For this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason, the elderly, whose neurobehavioral function may already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be compromised by normal aging processes and possibly by other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease states (e.g., parkinsonism or preclinical parkinsonism),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also represent a special population of concern. The ability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the elderly or other subpopulations to compensate for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declines in neurobehavioral function may be overwhelmed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eventually by additional, albeit possibly quite small, insults  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to Mn. If so, the effect could be manifested as a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severe or earlier onset of declining function in senescence, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequent implications for increased societal health-care costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special subpopulations at increased risk may be defined not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only in terms of their biological susceptibility, as exemplified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above by the young and the elderly, but also by their increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of exposure. In this respect, inner city residents and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others who live near high traffic areas such as expressways  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., low-income and minority communities) would possibly have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate likelihood of higher Mn exposure levels due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their closer proximity to vehicular emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nature of the neurobehavioral effects observed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational studies such as Roels et al. (1992) should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understood as effects that probably would not be treated by, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even be readily evident to, a clinical physician. Nonetheless,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are significant from a public health standpoint when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in terms of population effects. This concept is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illustrated by the well documented findings on low-level Pb  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity in children, where changes of as little as 1 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 points in IQ have been repeatedly demonstrated in several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent, prospective, epidemiological studies in recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. Such changes could not be reliably demonstrated either in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a clinical setting or in earlier cross-sectional epidemiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies; yet they are now well established to be ``real'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant from a public health standpoint. With regard to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in neurobehavioral function observed in various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> epidemiological studies of Mn-exposed workers, these studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independently converge on findings of impaired motor function  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., reductions in eye-hand coordination, slower hand or finger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> movements, and less control of fine movement). As recently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed in a document prepared by the Subcommittee for Risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engineering and Technology ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1993), an adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect can include ``both unwanted effects and any alteration from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline that diminishes the ability to survive, reproduce or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adapt to the environment.'' Thus, it can be argued that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects in themselves warrant consideration as adverse health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects. They may also have ramifications for health and safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an even more serious nature, if a person's ability to react  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quickly and accurately to a situation (e.g., traffic conditions)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was impaired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another aspect of the findings from available occupational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies concerns the temporal relationship between exposure and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect. As noted above, the geometric mean average period of Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure of the workers in the Roels et al. (1992) study was only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 years, with the longest period of Mn exposure for any one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual being less than 18 years. Also, the oldest worker in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Roels et al. (1992) study was less than 50 years old. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively limited period of exposure along with the absence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> older subjects in the Roels study raises the question of whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient time had elapsed for the full expression of the toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of Mn. Some reports in the literature indicate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mn toxicity may not be clinically evident until some years after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure occurred or terminated (e.g., Cotzias et al., 1968;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rodier, 1955), and other reports point to a greater sensitivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of elderly persons, compared to middle-aged or young adults, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acute as well as chronic Mn toxicity (e.g., Kawamura et al.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1941). An uncertainty factor for extrapolation from a subchronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to chronic exposure was included in deriving the RfC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates shown in Figure 1. However, a ``half-factor'' of 3 was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for this area of uncertainty. If the average period of Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure (geometric mean: 4 years) in the Roels et al. (1992)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study is compared to an assumed lifetime of 70 years, one could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argue that a factor of 70/4=17.5, or at least 10, would be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more appropriate adjustment for subchronic to chronic exposures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the limited available data, this area of uncertainty is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to express in a quantitative manner, but in general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice, EPA has used an uncertainty factor of 3 for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals with comparable databases. Nevertheless, this area of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern suggests that the Mn RfC estimates derived here with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty factor of 3 for subchronic to chronic exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably do not tend to err in the direction of being too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another qualitative concern that should be recognized in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering the potential health effects of Mn is the possibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of certain types of effects that are suggested by clinical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other evidence but are difficult to measure quantitatively or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate with currently available methods. Specifically, much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the clinical literature on manganism refers to a psychiatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of the illness, which often involves striking emotional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or mood changes that tend to appear before changes in motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function are evident. Such effects are inherently difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure in a quantitative manner. However, the possibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such effects at lower levels of exposure than those at which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor control is affected should not be discounted out of hand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some reports in the literature (e.g., Gottschalk et al., 1991)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggest that aggressive behavior may be associated with Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure (as reflected in the concentration of Mn in hair of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prison inmates). Such reports require substantiation by further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies, and the validity and relevance of hair Mn levels to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental Mn exposure remains to be established, but the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion that an association might exist between hair Mn and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behavior cannot be totally dismissed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

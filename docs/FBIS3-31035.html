			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the Parliamentary  National Security Commission, today sent a letter to President  Zhelev in which he states that during the past few days  increasingly militarist statements are being made and decisions  adopted in connection with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Bulgaria advocates seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis  and has repeatedly declared its firm resolve not to intervene in  any form in the events taking place in former Yugoslavia. At  this critical juncture, any change in the Bulgarian position is  absolutely impossible, Slatinski emphasizes in his letter.    Nikolay Slatinski appeals to the president to employ his  constitutional powers more resolutely with a view to achieving  greater coordination and integration of the efforts of the  political elite in the legislative and executive powers to  defend the national position on the crisis in former Yugoslavia.</p>

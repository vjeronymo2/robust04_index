			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Union for Democracy and Solidarity [UDS]  confirms its nonparticipation in upcoming elections. In a  communique published today and signed by its delegate general,  Mr. Antoine Folly, the UDS said that in line with the decisions  made on 23 November 1993 not to take part in the 23 January 1994  legislative election in the current conditions, the party has  not put forth a candidate to stand in that election and  therefore no candidate can claim to have been mandated by the  UDS. The UDS states, and I quote, it had set up conditions for  its participation in a free and fair election and regrets that  these conditions are not met.</p>

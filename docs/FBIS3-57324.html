			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Blagoveshchensk January 26 TASS -- A regional  conference of senior officials of the administration of the Far  Eastern region was held here today. Its agenda included  prospects of Russian-Chinese cooperation and border relations.  The conference, the first of this kind, was attended by Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who arrived here on Tuesday  night en route from Bishkek to China.    The relations of partnership and cooperation with China, our  great neighbour, should be worthy of the two great powers and  should measure up to the current situation in Asia and the world  in general, Kozyrev said at the conference.    Speaking about the present state of Russian-Chinese  relations, the minister touched upon the problem of the  settlement of border disputes between the two countries. Some  people mention the "seizure of Russian territories in favour of  China," but this does not correspond to reality. Talks are  under way between the two countries on this problem, which has  become of late one of the main irritants in bilateral relations,  Kozyrev continued.    So far as border trade is concerned, its volume exceeded 2.5  billion dollars in 1993, Kozyrev said. However, we should now  move to an entirely new stage of the development of border  cooperation and ties and pass over to production cooperation,  for which we have all the needed conditions.    According to Kozyrev, the problem of opening check points on  the Russian-Chinese border is also being discussed at the talks.  During the visit to Beijing an agreement on it is planned to be  signed, he said. Now there are 21 check points, of which 19 are  functioning. It is necessary to make their work more orderly and  to open new ones. The existing check points cannot cope with  with the enormous flow of people wishing to cross the  Russian-Chinese border. Last year their total number was 2.5  million.    The Russian foreign minister devoted special attention to  the  creation of free economic zones. The study of the experience of  creating such zones in China will be one of the objectives of  his visit.    Immediately after the end of the conference Kozyrev left for  the city of Heihe, where he met senior officials of the province  of Heilongjiang and Heihe. They discussed the development of  border trade. The Russian foreign minister saw the Heihe free  economic zone and a passenger check point on the Russian-Chinese  border. After returning to Blagoveshchensk Kozyrev visited a  frontier guard post in the western suburb of Blagoveshchensk and  had a meeting with frontier guards.    Kozyrev flies to Beijing today for an official visit.</p>

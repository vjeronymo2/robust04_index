			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AQUINO BARS REELECTION BID WHEN TERM ENDS IN 1992;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: THE SUCCESSOR TO MARCOS SAYS SHE WILL LEAVE PRESIDENCY TO WRITE  HER MEMOIRS AND HELP THE POOR.  </P> <P> On the eve of her second state visit to the United States, President Corazon  Aquino of the Philippines ruled out running for reelection when her term  expires in 1992, saying she has done her duty as a citizen and now wants to  write a book.  </P> <P> Aquino said Thursday in an interview that she could not foresee conditions  under which she would seek a second term.  </P> <P> "I really don't see myself as having to run again," Aquino said. "I am not a  traditional politician, and I really felt in 1986 that I had to do my part if  we were to have a chance at restoring democracy here. I feel I have already  done my duty insofar as being a citizen of this republic is concerned."  </P> <P> Although her family and some supporters have urged her to run again, Aquino  said she will leave Malacanang Palace to write her memoirs and join a  non-government group to help the poor.  </P> <P> Aquino took office in February, 1986, as a self-described housewife who had  helped lead a "people power" revolt that toppled Ferdinand E. Marcos. Her  comments Thursday hardened previous statements in which she had indicated that  she saw herself in a transitional political role. This seemed likely to  increase the scramble of politicians and military officers eager to replace  her.  </P> <P> She has come under increasing criticism since the early glory days. Although  her integrity is not questioned, polls show that her popularity has fallen amid  charges that government policy has drifted, land reform plans are largely  unfulfilled and political corruption, cronyism and ineptitude are endemic.  </P> <P> Aquino brushes aside most complaints as the healthy workings of a vibrant, if  fragile, democracy in which "almost nothing is left secret." Indeed, two dozen  newspapers compete to provide the most lurid accounts of the most recent  scandals.  </P> <P> "I am realistic enough to know I can't possibly please everybody all the time,"  she said. "So long as I do what I think is right, then I think that is all that  is asked of me. I have been called weak and indecisive (and) at the same time,  I've been called vindictive and heartless. So take your pick."  </P> <P> Aquino defended her administration's much-criticized record on human rights,  and she acknowledged that no member of the military or police has been  convicted of human rights abuse despite more than 500 cases being filed. Most  of these cases, she said, were brought in connection with the 20-year battle  against Communist rebels.  </P> <P> "You must remember that where alleged violations of human rights are concerned,  in almost all cases, these are insurgency-related," she said. "It is not as if  these are just being done with no provocation from rebel groups."  </P> <P> Whatever the provocation, two international organizations, Asia Watch and  Amnesty International, charge that the Philippine government has not done  enough to stop vigilante or military violence against human rights lawyers,  priests and other activists.  </P> <P> The U.S. State Department has reported "signs of deterioration" in the human  rights situation in 1988, although officials at the U.S. Embassy here have  taken exception to that assessment.  </P> <P> Aquino will visit the United States and Canada mostly to promote her country's  economic recovery. Citing an economic growth rate of 6.7% last year, economic  planners hope to lure enough investment to fuel the kind of development that  has transformed virtually every other non-Communist country in Asia.  </P> <P> The trip comes at a sensitive time. Although Aquino wants to convince foreign  investors that her government is stable, she cited potential destabilization  from both right and left as the reason for refusing to allow Marcos' burial  here after his death last month in Hawaii. Her aides say they do not fear coup  attempts in her absence.  </P> <P> The trip also brings up a sensitive issue: family planning. With half the  population of 58 million in poverty, the birth rate of 2.8% has undercut  economic progress. The rate is up from 2.4% in 1980.  </P> <P> "We leave it to the couple to decide for themselves what is the best option,"  Aquino said, noting that most Filipinos are Roman Catholic.  </P> <P> But critics say Aquino has decided to ignore the issue. Government inaction and  bickering led the U.S. Agency for International Development, the largest  foreign aid donor, to cut off family planning support early this year.  </P> <P> "Our position was, once you get a program, you'll get new funds," a U.S.  official said.  </P> <P> Western diplomats here give Aquino high marks for restoring democracy,  improving the economy and halting the growth of the Communist insurgency. But  most say that beyond that, the record has been spotty.  </P> <P> After three days in Canada, Aquino will arrive in New York on Nov. 7 to start a  Philippine stock fund on Wall Street. She will meet President Bush in  Washington, discuss debt relief with international bankers, dine on barbecue  with oilmen in Dallas and stop in Los Angeles for five hours to meet local  Filipinos before returning home Nov. 11.  </P> <P> Aquino was accorded a hero's welcome when she last visited the United States in  1986. "This time, she wants a no-frills state visit," said Deedee M. Siytangco,  a palace spokeswoman. "It's a working trip."  </P></p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Japanese unions demand 6% rises Japan's trade unions yesterday demanded pay rises of 5-6 per cent, saying they would stimulate growth and pull Japan out of its recession. The call by Rengo, the Japanese trade union confederation, contrasts with a proposed pay freeze by Nikkeiren, the employers' federation. Last year wage increases averaged 3.89 per cent. Mr Akira Yamagishi, Rengo chairman, criticised the employers' proposal at an executive committee meeting in Tokyo yesterday. He said it would further depress consumption. Mr Yamagishi blamed management for bringing about the asset inflation which artificially boosted the Japanese economy. The Nikkeiren's proposal showed a lack of responsibility on the part of employers and reflected an extremely anti-social attitude that was difficult to accept, he said. Nikkeiren yesterday published a report calling for a cap on wages in order to preserve jobs which, it said, should be the top priority. Japanese wage levels were among the highest in the world and if wages rose even further, Japan's international competitiveness would decline, leading to an acceleration of the 'hollowing out' of Japanese industry, the report said. Mr Yamagishi, however, said Japanese companies had sufficient internal revenues to meet wage increases of 5-6 per cent. According to Rengo, Japan's top 50 corporations have internal revenues of Y12,000bn (Pounds 71.5bn). Rengo also called for an emergency declaration by management and labour to tackle the deteriorating employment environment. It said more confrontation could be expected between labour and management.</p>

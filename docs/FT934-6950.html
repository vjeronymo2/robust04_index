			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / German heavyweights enter the ring for telecom networks Three of Germany's largest companies have forged an alliance to exploit the liberalising European telecommunications market. Mannesmann, the engineering group, RWE, the energy-based conglomerate, and Deutsche Bank, the country's largest bank, said yesterday they had formed a consortium to offer telecoms networks to corporate clients in Germany, from next January. The services on offer will include voice telephony, data transmission and valued added services such as electronic mail. The services are not yet available beyond individual corporate clients, because the public network is still run as a monopoly by state-owned Deutsche Telekom. But the move represents an important challenge to Deutsche Telekom which controls the public voice network in Germany. Its monopoly is due to be removed in 1998 when telecommunications are liberalised in the European Union. The consortium, which requires approval by Brussels, is led by Mannesmann, which already operates a mobile telephone network in Germany and which will have 50 per cent of the new company. Deutsche Bank and RWE Energie will each own 25 per cent. It will establish a client base which should be able to develop its own voice network to compete with Deutsche Telekom once telecoms are fully liberalised. 'This is showing that competition for basic voice services is already starting ahead of liberalisation' a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom said. RWE, Mannesmann and Deutsche Bank also announced they would set up a second consortium to bid for a licence to operate a mobile network for data transmission. This consortium is led by RWE, which has long expressed its intention to diversify into the growing telecoms market. It will also include Telia International, the Swedish group offering data services and Cofira, which operates a mobile telephone network in France. The consortium will offer private clients the possibility to transmit data via a mobile network. At the moment, only Modacom, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, operates such a network, in place since the beginning of the year. But the German post and telecoms ministry is due to issue a second licence by the end of May, thus adding fresh competition in the area of mobile telecoms, which is already liberalised in Europe.</p>

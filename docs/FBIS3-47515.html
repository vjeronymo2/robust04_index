			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Order of Power As Means  of Systemic Perpetuation    Naturally, the changes in order of political power in North  Korea do not make up the forecast chart of probability with  absolute certainty. There are instances in which someone once  dropped from the order yet was not completely eliminated from  the system. Because some of those once dropped had been  reinstated after a certain period, although there had been  others who were totally eliminated once and for all.    An example of this is the case in which Im Chun-chu and  others had been purged at the (Pyorori Meeting) in December  1950, in the midst of the Korean War; the party Central  Committee accused him, by name, of being a traitor charging that  he `retreated abandoning the party leadership, the party members  and the people all together.' However, Im Chun-chu was saved  and reinstated as he promoted idolization of Kim Il-song as the  `The Sunshine of Human Race,' and `The Matchless Great Man.'    Not only that, he was the main architect of Kim Il-song  dynasty as the foremost political ideologue and theorist with  regard to the system of political succession and secured himself  a position as a sort of chief of staff for Kim Chong-il faction.    Another example is O Chin-u, firmly in the third position of  the political order following Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il.    He worked for Kim Il-song since the partisan days and was  quite a bit junior to Kim Il and Choe Hyon as a party cadre and  was merely a reginmental commander during the Korean War, but  since then he solidified his political power base in the  military, having sided with the group in power at a given point  in time during every change of the North Korean political power  structure with the reputation as an outstanding strategist and  purger of adversaries. And he keeps his position today by the  same method, once again as the chieftain for sustenance/security  of the Kim Chong-il order. [passage omitted]    There has been little change even after the 6th Party  Congress (October 1980) which was the turning point for Kim  Chong-il's ascension as the official successor and the only  change that came out of the Congress in the characteristics and  the order of political structure was the shift in its direction  toward solidification of the Kim Chong-il order.  <H5>  Mass Promotion of Kim Chong-il Faction </H5>   This was clearly observed in the substantial changes in the  list of candidates for delegate to the Congress where anti-Kim  Chong-il personnel were demoted or dropped all together and the  noticeable promotion of Kim Chong-il supporters took place.    Colonel General Kim Chol-man, in charge of special military  operations on South Korea, was dropped as a Political Bureau  candidate member and Kye Ung-tae dropped to candidate- from full  member which in turn dropped his ranking dramatically to 27th  from 16th. Vice Premier Kang Hui-won, whose ranking rapidly rose  to 32nd from 75th, was newly added to the Political Burau as a  candidate member, increasing the number of candidate members to  16.    Some other examples: Pak Su-tong, the secretary in charge of  labor organizations and the director of the party organizational  guidance department, and Hong Si-hak, the secretary in charge of  economy, were discharged from their positions, while Hyon  Mu-kwang, a Political Bureau candidate member, rose to 20th from  31st. Hyon Mu-kwang, a deputy premier and the chairman of the  Agriculture Committee, rose to 37th from 38th. Ho Chong-suk, the  chief of the Secretriat Bureau of the Democratic Front for the  Reunification of the Fatherland, rose to 36th from 54th while  being newly appointed as a party secretary. This increased the  number of party secretaries to 11.    The WPK eighth session of the 5th plenum held February 11 to  13, 1974 secretly selected Kim Chong-il as a member of the WPK  Political Committee and, during the period (1974-78), some  figures such as Kim Tong-kyu (deputy director), Yu Chang-sik  (party Political Committee candidate member and secretary), Kim  Chung-nim (party secretary), Yi Yong-mu (Chief of the General  Military Political Bureau), Kim Chol-man (First Deputy Chief of  the General Staff), Kim Ik-hyon (Minister of the People's Armed  Forces), Pak Su-tong (Director of party Organizational  Department), and Han Ik-su (Political Committee member and  secretary) had either disappeared or been ignored for a time.    Although some of them had been back in the party high  ranking  positions, others such as Kim Tong-kyu, Yu Chang-sik, and Chang  Chong-hang (Deputy Minister of People's Armed Forces) had  completely disappeared from the stage of political power.    These occurrences were the series of events the party  political establishment carried out to sustain Kim Chong-il  succession order and indicate that the nucleus of the party  political power now consists of the partisan veterans, major  general level personnel of the partisan origin, and the second  generation of partisans.  <H5>  Kim Chong-il Leads Political Power Pack </H5>   During the period, the core of North Korea's power structure  consisted of partisan veterans such as Kim Il (Premier,  deceased), Choe Yong-kon (Deputy President, deceased) O  Paek-yong (Commander of Red Worker-Peasant Militia, deceased),  Kim Tong-kyu (Political Committee member, fate unknown), So Chol  (party Inspection Committee Chairman, deceased), Im Chun-chu  (Political Committee member, deceased) and O Chin-u (People's  Army Chief of the General Staff, Political Bureau Standing  Committee member and Minister of People's Armed Forces), and the  major general level personnel of partisan origin such as Chon  Mun-sop (commander of Security Guards and National Inspection  Committee Chairman), Paek Hang-nim (Deputy Minister of Public  Security, Minister of Public Security and a vice marshal), Yi  Tu-ik (commanding general of First Army, party Military  Committee member and a vice marshal), Chu To-il (commander of  Army Group, commander of Pyongyang Defense Forces and a vice  marshal), and Cho Myong-nok (Commander of Air Force and a  general) and others such as So Yun-sok, Kim kuk-tae, Yi  Chang-son, Choe Tae-pok, Chon Kum-son, Chon Pyong-ho, Choe  Yong-nim and Han Song-nyong.    The order of North Korea's political structure is revealed  primarily in the official reports listing the names, in the  order of importance, seated at the speakers' platform during an  entire party congress or major national celebrations such as  anniversaries of the regime and the party and also the names of  attendants such as anniveraries of the regime and the party and  also the names of attendants to the funeral of a high ranking  cadre.    As of last year's 44th anniversary of the North Korean  regime, the party Political Bureau had 13 full members, reduced  from 14 due to the death of So Chol and 8 candidate members and,  thus, a total of 24 members, who make up the nucleus of  political power.    Among them, three Political Bureau Standing Committee  members, Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il and O Chin-u, make up the  core within the nucleus of political power.    There has been no change in the positions of those three  which were fixed at the 6th Party Congress in 1980.    Excepting those three and, thus, the fourth position on  down,  there have been some up's and down's; the current order being  Deputy President Yi Chong-ok 4th, Deputy President Pak Song-chol  5th, Yon Hyong-muk (Premier of the Administration Council) 6th,  Kim Yong-nam (Minister of Foreign Affairs) 7th, Choe Kwang  (armed forces Chief of the General Staff) 8th, Kye Ung-tae  (party secretary) 9th, Chon Pyong-ho (party secretary) 10th, Han  Song-yong (party secretary) 11th, So Yun-sok 12th and Kang  Song-san 13th positions.    Among them, Yon Hyong-muk once rose to the 4th position  during the 43rd anniversary ceremony in September of 1991 but  fell back to his original 6th position in 1992. Except for Yon  Hyong-muk's moves, there has been no change in the order through  the 7th position held by Kim Yong-nam.    Choe Kwang, purged in 1969 and resurrected in 1977 and  became  the Armed Forces Chief of the General Staff in 1988, together  with some others such as Kye Ung-tae, Han Song-yong and Chon  Pyong-ho has experienced changes now and then, though not  extensive, in his ranking within the order.  <H3>  No Changes in Political Power Structure Expected Unitl 7th  Party Congress </H3>   So Yun-sok and Kang Song-san alternately held the last  position among the Political Bureau full members but, then, So  Yun-sok rose one notch up to the 12th position. Yet, there has  been no change in the May 1990 roster except the omissions of Ho  Tam who died in May of 1991 and So Chol who died in September  [of the same year].    In view of the fact, particularly, that Kye Ung-tae, Chon  Pyong-ho and Han Song-yong, all of whom are considered the core  personnel of Kim Chong-il order are dual-hatted as party  secretaries in addition to being Political Bureau members, it  seems the political power structure is being firmed up for the  Kim Chong-il succession order.    This observation is further supported by the fact that, as  the Political Bureau Standing Committee decides on the ranking  and the changes of political power structure order, Kim  Chong-il, the Secretary in Charge of Organization, rather than  Kim Il-song is currently taking the leading role, and that there  has been no purge and have only been minor changes which were  due not to any compelling reasons but to accommodate various  factions such as partisans, party officials and government  bureaucrats, which was strongly indicated as characteristic of  the changes, and that there has been little change in the  Political Bureau candidate membership from the political power  structure of May 1990, except the omissions of Hyon Mu-Kwang who  died in February of this year and Cho Se-ung who disappeared  from the roster having been discharged from the position of  Responsible Secretary of the party for North Pyongan Province.    Of course, the 20th session of the 6th plenum of the party  Central Committee held in December 1992 saw the discharge of Yon  Hyong-muk from the position of Premier of the Administration  Council and the promotion of Kang Song-san, who was the  responsible Secretary of the party and the Chairman of People's  Committee for North Hamgyong Province, as his successor, having  elected Kim Tal-hyon (Deputy Premier and Chairman of External  Economic Affairs Committee), and Kim Yong-sun, a party  secretary, to Political Bureau candidate members, and having  selected Kim Kuk-tae (Superintendent of Kim Il-song Advanced  Academy of the party) and Kim Ki-nam (Director of Propaganda and  Agitation Department) as party secretaries.    Also nine candidate members such as Choe Pong-man (party  Central Committee candidate member) and Chang Song-taek  (Director of Youth Work Department) have been elevated to  Central Committee membership and nine such as Pak Myong-chol  (Chairman of National Athletic Committee) have been elected to  candidate membership.    Kang Song-san, who grew up within the party system since the  late 60s and is a Russian expert and an economics specialist and  for North-South relations, is considered more conservative than  Yon Hyong-muk. His promotion indicates that Kim Chong-il is  concerned about economic reforms and North-South relations.    This year's speakers' platform for the (Central Report  Congress) for the 45th anniversary of the North Korean regime  consisted of, in addition to Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il and O  Chin-u, Kang Song-san (Premier of the Administration Council) as  the 4th ranking, and, in the order, Pak Song-chol (Deputy  President), Kim Yong-nam (Deputy Premier and Minister of Foreign  Affairs), Choe Tae-pok (party secretary), Kim Yong-sun (party  secretary), Choe Yong-nim (Deputy Premier), Hong Song-nam, Kang  Hui-won, Kim Tal-hyon (all Deputy Premier), Kim Chung-nim (party  secretary, Yun Ki-pok, So Kwan-hui, Hwang Chang-hwa, Pak Nam-ki  (all party secretaries), Yong Hyong-sop (Chairman of the Supreme  People's Assembly), and Chon Mun-sop (Chairman of National  Inspection Committee).    There appears to be little change in the fundamental  composition of the political power structure, even though minor  cosmetic changes were observed, and most of them are younger  generation of the revolution who are close to Kim Chong-il and  foreign educated pragmatists or technocrats who have strong  minds of their own.    According to our analysis, it appears that there would be  fundamentally few effectuating and epochal changes on the  current North Korean political power structure up until the 7th  Party Congress even though there might be some cosmetic ones  such as the case of Yon Hyong-muk for an immediate problem at  hand, in view of the fact that the change surrounding Yon  Hyong-muk in December of last year, changing his status from a  member of Political Bureau to a candidate member and  transferring him from premiership to the (Responsible Secretary  of the party and the Chairman of People's Committee for Chakang  Province), was due to the determinant fact that he was a Kim  Il-song's man.</p>

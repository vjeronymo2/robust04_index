			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fishermen seek judicial review THE National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations yesterday sought leave to apply for a judicial review of the government's controversial measures to conserve fish stocks by limiting time at sea. The move came in spite of a meeting yesterday between fishermen's representatives and ministers which was described as 'productive'. The federation said it had lodged documents at the High Court to support an application to suspend the legislation, due to come into force next January. Under an EC agreement Britain must cut fishing by 19 per cent by 1996.</p>

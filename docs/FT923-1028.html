			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Seoul to boost infrastructure THE South Korean government yesterday proposed a 26 per cent increase in spending on economic development, including support for small and medium businesses, writes John Burton in Seoul. At the same time, the Bank of Korea predicted that economic growth this year would be the slowest since 1981. The government's 1993 budget cuts defence spending growth to fund expanded infrastructure projects that will relieve congested transport networks. The 9.8 per cent rise in defence spending, which accounts for a quarter of the national budget, is the lowest rise since 1985.</p>

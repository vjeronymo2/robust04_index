			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> NO MORE WARNINGS ON ILLEGAL FIREWORKS  </P> <P> In the past, the Buena Park Fire Department concentrated on educating the  public not to shoot off bottle rockets, firecrackers and other illegal  fireworks on the Fourth of July.  </P> <P> When firefighters and police officers spotted someone lighting illegal  fireworks, offenders typically got a warning and had their fireworks  confiscated.  </P> <P> "This year, we're going to issue no warnings and write all citations," Fire  Marshal Donald Tully said. The policy is the culmination of an education  campaign against illegal fireworks that began three years ago.  </P> <P> "The first year, we gave (most) people the benefit of the doubt: 'OK, you  didn't know it was illegal,' " Tully said. "This year, the direction will be,  'If you don't know, too bad. You should've known.' "  </P> <P> Citations will require an appearance before a judge, who has the authority to  levy fines on people found guilty of using illegal fireworks. Although the  judge has wide discretion in setting fines, Tully said, amounts typically run  about $100.  </P> <P> Six two-man teams of firefighters and police officers will patrol the streets  of Buena Park beginning at 6 p.m. on July 4, focusing on finding illegal  fireworks, he said.  </P> <P> Two years ago, patrol teams issued about six citations for illegal fireworks  use, Tully said. Last year, joint police-fire teams wrote 22 citations and gave  five warnings. This year, probably no one found with illegal fireworks will  escape without a ticket, he said.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, people have gotten the word and we won't have that problem," Tully  said. "But we'll see how it goes." TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

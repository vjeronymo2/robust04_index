			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 26 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik, in a televised debate of leaders of the government and  opposition parties today, said that upon taking power in March  his cabinet inherited an 8-billion Slovak crown (some $260  million) hole in the budget to which it had to react with  economizing and raising taxes.    Moravcik accused Meciar of slowing down economic  transformation. He said his government would speed up  privatization while using equally the coupon method and other  methods. He added that the envisaged 4 billion Slovak crown  profit from privatization would be invested in the construction  industry to revive the economy. Moravcik pointed to a "historic  chance" to settle relations with Hungary which requires the  solution of the problems of ethnic minorities in Slovakia.    Meciar said that Moravcik's government came to power not  through democratic elections but through a parliamentary putsch.  He said Moravcik's cabinet returned to a restrictive economic  policy because of the previous non-qualified management although  the basis for economic growth had been already prepared by his  cabinet.    "It will take at least one year to correct these mistakes,"  Meciar said. He said he considered it "catastrophic" that  social reforms had been stopped, adding that the prepared tax  raise would limit a market space, lead to a fall in production  and a decrease in consumption with a consequent social impact.    Chairman of the opposition Slovak National Party (SNS) Jan  Slota, Meciar's close co-worker, rejected the accusations of  extremism, arguing that the SNS "was only defending the  interests of a nation state," while "extremist Hungarian parties  have embedded a split of the state in their programs."    "Three Hungarian -- chauvinistic and irredentist -- parties  are too much of a luxury for Slovakia," he said. He warned  against the plans of Moravcik's government to launch the second  wave of coupon privatization, saying that three-quarters of  state property privatized during the first wave ended in the  hands of funds and the impoverished population was currently  selling their coupon booklets below price to those "who do not  have honest plans with this republic."    Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL),  said that Meciar was responsible for the current state of the  Slovak economy and society.</p>

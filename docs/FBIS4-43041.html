			<p>BFN     [Text] Montreal, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Canadian  Government will suspend commercial flights to Haiti beginning on  25 June, Andre Ouellet, the Canadian minister of foreign  affairs, has announced.    He added that the decision to suspend commercial flights to  Haiti was made to comply with a resolution that the OAS adopted  last week calling for increased pressure on the coupist Haitian  Government. Ouellet said that he plans to discuss with the  cabinet the adoption of "additional measures," which according  to official sources, "will affect the financial transactions"  between the two countries.    The United States today announced the suspension of flights  to Haiti, beginning on 25 June.    The Canadian Foreign Affairs Ministry also recommended to  its  citizens in that country to "leave the island while possible  through regular flights."</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities wilt under further pressure A TRADING session that threatened to record one of the lowest daily turnovers of the year so far on the London Stock Exchange was rescued by a chunky programme trade in mid-afternoon. However, even some big trades triggered by the programme failed to prevent the equity market from slipping back below the Footsie 2,300 level. Fund managers remained preoccupied with trends in international currencies, which prompted worries about the possibility of a rise in UK interest rates and also the Maastricht referendum in France, scheduled for September 20, which is seen as threatening the fabric of the ERM. And sentiment in a market desperately searching for any sort of good news was given another dent by more bad news from a building sector expected to produce some dire results in the next few weeks. The return to work after the bank holiday extended weekend saw the market open marginally firmer, helped by a weekend press indicating that the immediate pressure for a rise in UK rates had largely passed. However, a build-up of selling in the Footsie future and signs of more pressure on the dollar led to a slide in the cash market. The FT-SE Index saw a small opening rise turned into a loss of some seven points by mid-morning. With sterling said to have been caught in the crossfire between the dollar and the D-Mark, the equity market suffered a further setback after lunch when hints of a trading programme were put forward as another reason behind the selling in leading stocks. Conclusive evidence of programme trade activity came as a series of large deals flashed across the market's Seaq trading screens. One of the UK's big integrated securities houses was reported to have carried out the programme, said to have been weighted to the sell side. The FT-SE 100 Index reached the day's lowest level, a fall of 16.1 at 2,296.5, as the large trades were in the process of being unwound by marketmakers, but thereafter showed signs of stabilising to close 14.2 down at 2,298.4. Turnover, in spite of being boosted by the programme trade, could only reach 312.9m shares. Customer business in the equity market has reached Pounds 1bn on only one occasion during the past two weeks. Analysts and traders expect the market to trade in a narrow range ahead of the French referendum and pointed out that under French law no new opinion polls are allowed. But one senior trader said that as soon as the Maastricht referendum is over, fund managers will have to come to terms with an even bigger affair in the form of the US Presidential election in November. The electricity distribution stocks ('recs') were aggressively sold ahead of the cessation of trading in the Electricity Package tomorrow; dealers are reluctant to take on stock in the more illiquid 'recs' as institutions unbundle their remaining Package stocks. The housebuilding sector provided the market's three weakest performers yesterday in percentage terms after Persimmon, the highly rated construction group, announced disappointing figures.</p>

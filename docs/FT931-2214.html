			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: The Telegraph If minority shareholders in The Telegraph were unhappy at the thought of investing Pounds 72m in Southam, the loss-making Canadian newspaper group, they must be doubly so after seeing the terms obtained by Power Corporation. It is buying shares direct from Southam at CDollars 14.00. The Telegraph is supposed to buy them from Hollinger at CDollars 18.10, thereby reliquifying its majority shareholder while saving it from realising a loss on its original purchase. The Telegraph will use the proceeds from the sale of its holding in Trinity International which was also wished on it by Hollinger. Since that stake made The Telegraph a profit, it is understandable that Mr Conrad Black should want it to help out again. In the back-scratching world of independent entrepreneurs, that gives the deal a certain logic. It is different - especially given the high standards required post- Maxwell - when those involved also have responsibilities to outside shareholders. High on the list of those responsibilities is a duty to ensure that any deal is done at the best possible price. Given the Power terms, The Telegraph cannot possibly argue that a premium is being paid for control. Nor is the put option on the stake worth much unless its independent directors can force the company to exercise it. They made a bad start by recommending the deal in the first place. At least Power's involvement gives them an opportunity to redeem themselves by calling a halt.</p>

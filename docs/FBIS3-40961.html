			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Ulas: "To Whom Does the Ukrainian Rocket </F> Army Belong?" -- first paragraph published in boldface]    [Text] During the third year of our independence, we have  finally learned that there are certain military units deployed  on Ukrainian territory with servicemen who have not taken the  oath of allegiance to the state that feeds, clothes, and  provides housing for them.    In the era of the Soviet Union, communist propaganda would  describe similar military units as occupying forces. Even if  foreign armed forces were deployed on the territory of certain  country, for example Germany, they were financed and provided  with all necessities by the state that had sent them, and to  which they had pledged allegiance. Americans have always made  payments to the governments of those countries in which their  Armed Forces have been deployed, even for use of the land.    Which military units deployed on Ukrainian soil pledged  allegiance to the USSR, and are still living according to the  laws of the deceased Union? No, this is not the Black Sea Fleet  which has been proclaimed Ukraine's property following Russia's  example, which has appropriated all former fleets of the USSR  and property of units that were deployed outside the borders of  the former Soviet Union. God bless the fleet, if no responsible  official in Ukraine wants to even hear about its problems.    Yet, the subject of this article is different. This is the  Vinnytsya Rocket Army, the weapons and property of which belong  to Ukraine according to agreements between Russia and Ukraine,  which have also been recognized by the international community.  The paradox of the situation lies in the fact that missiles  with nuclear warheads remain in the hands of those who continue  to serve the nonexisting totalitarian state.    This can be confirmed by the fact that military leaders of  the Army refuse to make officers and warrant officers take the  oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people, and fail to sign  contracts with those who consider themselves servicemen of the  Russian Army. Even today, symbols of the former Soviet Union  remain on the headquarters and barracks of certain units, and  officers and warrant officers wear uniforms with emblems of the  nonexistent Soviet Army. Perhaps they all expect that the past  will return? Exactly the opposite.    This refuge of communist ideology is preserved thanks to the  political speculations and intrigues of the Army leaders and top  officials in divisions. They slyly gamble on today's hardships  of officers and warrant officers, comparing Russians and  Ukrainians.    Each time the issue of administering the oath of allegiance  to Ukraine arises, insinuations of violating the rights of  Russian servicemen appear, and rumors are spread that as soon as  they take the oath they will have to return to Russia.    As a matter of fact, Russian troops are not going to leave  until they sell the apartments provided them by the Defense  Ministry. They are not pricing them too low, either: A  one-bedroom apartment costs no less than $5,000. Let us figure  the losses for our state. They curse Ukraine and threaten to  drop from service, they do not leave their apartments, and they  continue to consume their food rations and buy dollars with the  money they receive from the Defense Ministry of Ukraine. This  is the life of Russian soldiers according to the oath of  allegiance to the Soviet Union, and nobody knows exactly who  they serve.    However, the last statement is not completely true, since at  the beginning of November, the defense minister of the Russian  Federation inspected the combat readiness of the units and  conducted a training exercise for commanders of the Rocket Army  of Ukraine. How can one understand this? What will the  commander in chief of the Ukraine's Armed Forces say on this  occasion?</p>

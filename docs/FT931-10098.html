			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts suffer jitters on fears of rising UK inflation INFLATION worries depressed the UK government bond market and pushed gilt prices down by as much as half a point, but the market later recovered most of the losses as investors bought on weakness. The release of worse-than-expected producer input prices for January heightened fears of rising inflation. Input prices for manufacturing jumped 1.5 per cent in January - giving a year-on-year rise of 7.2 per cent - whereas the market had expected to see a 0.5 per cent rise on the month. The news helped to push the March Liffe gilt futures contract down from its opening level of 101.08 to a low of 100.27, but the futures contract later recovered to reach 101.05 by late afternoon. In the cash market, prices were depressed across the curve, but picked up as investors bought on weakness. BELGIAN government bonds were marked down around a point, with dealers pointing to the recent easing of the Belgian franc against the D-Mark and concern about the country's heavy borrowing requirement. The Belgian franc came under pressure last week before the German Bundesbank cut its key interest rates. 'The recent easing of tensions within the ERM and return of confidence to the French franc has killed off interest in the Belgian bond market,' said one dealer. 'Belgium was seen before as one of the hard core currencies in the D-Mark bloc, but now yields on French and Belgian 10-year paper are the same,' he added. JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally strongly, helped by the combination of a sharp rise in the yen against the dollar, stock market weakness and another round of bond-buying by the finance ministry. The yen strengthened from Y124.35 to the dollar, to Y121.75 yesterday spurred by market talk that Japan's trade partners were stepping up pressure for a stronger yen. The Nikkei index fell below the psychologically important 17,000 level, but ended the day 259.46 lower at 17,022.27. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.29 per cent, corresponding to the low price of the day, and moved to 4.23 per cent before ending at 4.245 per cent. The June futures contract, which took over as the new benchmark yesterday, rose from 109.14 to a high of 109.54 before closing at 109.50. THE AUSTRALIAN government bond market closed firmer as prime minister Mr Paul Keating yesterday unveiled proposals to cut corporate tax in an attempt to spur investment and employment growth. Mr Keating promised that a re-elected Labour government would cut the company tax rate to 33 per cent from 39 per cent, and would give an immediate 10 per cent taxation allowance for business investment. In addition, he announced that the government now expects a budget deficit of ADollars 15.9bn in the year ending June 30, against an original targeted deficit of ADollars 13.39bn. Most of the difference will be funded through extra bond sales. Bond prices edged up as the market had already discounted the financial package and participants covered short positions. US Treasury prices were flat to lower yesterday after a successful, if uneventful, afternoon auction of Dollars 15.5bn in three-year notes. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 105 5/32 , yielding 7.196 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also slightly weaker, down  3/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.199 per cent. In the absence of important economic data, all eyes were on the note and bond auctions. In early trading prices eased, primarily because given the recent strength in Treasuries, market participants were reluctant to bid up prices before the first tranche of the refunding programme for fear of scaring away potential retail buyers of the new issue. The three-year sale was subsequently completed at an average yield of 4.73 per cent, much as expected. Prices recovered some of their lost ground after the auction, but news of a strong store sales from the Johnson Redbook report ensured the market's bias remained on the downward side.</p>

They have resulted in an abundance of reflections,  suggestions, and very interesting critical assessments, all of  which have been aired in a climate of free participation by the  workers.    Since the beginning of the year, the Cuban labor union  movement began consulting with its rank-and-file on how the  nation can increase work efficiency and resolve its internal  finances. It is estimated that by the end of the process --  early March -- a total of 3 million workers will have  contributed their points of view. One of the most prominent  matters, and one that has been reiterated in thousands of  parliaments in the workplace held up until now, is related to  the harmful impact of excessive personnel in factories,  workshops, and service centers. Excessive personnel works  against efforts to reduce costs and to increase profitability.    True, there is concern about the ultimate fate of workers  who  are declared redundant, because these workers may have become so  involved with their jobs and with their coworkers that they may  not want to change jobs. Nevertheless, beyond this  understandable situation, the truth is that no Cuban fears being  fired as a result of measures aimed at rationalizing the work  force. The nation's authorities and the labor unions agree on  the need to find alternative formulas to avoid the abandonment  of one single Cuban.    Along these lines, ideas have been discussed on organizing  courses to retrain workers, as well as on assigning excessive  personnel to farming or housing construction duties. Maybe,  because they feel secure in terms of their future, the  participants in the parliaments in the workplace have so far  agreed that the country cannot continue having exaggerated  personnel rosters in the majority of its centers of production.  The attendees, amid heated labor union discussions, have  suggested solutions, some of which could possibly be applied by  company administrators.    Meanwhile, the nation's authorities are not sitting back,  and  certain practices are being tested, as with the publishing house  in the eastern municipality of Palma Soriana. After the  production of books was halted because of a lack of paper, the  publishing house assumed alternate tasks and retained its work  force. Now it is making a profit. As long as there are  resources available, the Cuban Government will encourage such  emergency formulas in order that the unavoidable process of  personnel rationing does not turn into unfavorable remedies for  the workers.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPUBLICANS AND ABORTION  </P> <P> Gov. Deukmejian demonstrated that he is truly a lame-duck leader.  </P> <P> By recommending that Republican anti-choice candidates stick to their  traditional positions on reproductive freedom issues, he has relegated the  Republican Party to permanent minority status in California and in the state  Legislature.  </P> <P> A 1989 Harris poll showed that 68% of all registered Republicans would oppose a  constitutional amendment banning access to abortion. GOP anti-choice candidates  will continue to lose if they don't recognize this important fact.  </P> <P> The governor is right, abortion is a moral issue, but the Webster vs.  Reproductive Health Services Supreme Court decision guaranteed that it is also  a political issue. If Republicans heed Deukmejian's advice, there is no future  for our party in leading California.  </P> <P> JULIA A. JUSTUS  </P> <P> La Verne  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BOTTOM OF THE ORDER ON TOP OF ITS GAME AS MAGNOLIA WINS  </P> <P> Orange League pitchers beware: Don't underestimate the bottom of Magnolia High  School's batting order.  </P> <P> The lower half of the Sentinels' lineup gave them all the runs they needed in  an 8-2 victory over Western Friday night at Glover Stadium.  </P> <P> Chad Phillips, the Sentinels' pitcher and No. 6 hitter, was two for three with  a double and two runs batted in. John Straits, who bats seventh, was two for  two with a triple and scored two runs. And No. 8 batter Mike Compean singled,  drove in a run and scored another.  </P> <P> "We're a fairly good hitting team," Magnolia Coach John Sharp said. "We don't  have a lot of power, but we watch the strike zone and don't swing at bad  pitches. That's half the battle right there."  </P> <P> Phillips, meanwhile, was winning the other half. He gave up four hits, all in  the first two innings, and improved his record to 3-1. He struck out 13 and  walked four before he was relieved by Jesse Carrow in the top of the seventh.  </P> <P> "Chad has a lot of colleges looking at him," Sharp said. "Stanford and the Air  Force Academy have seen him play and the Cleveland Indians were out here  tonight."  </P> <P> The victory kept Magnolia (5-6, 4-2 in league play) in the chase for the league  lead. Robert LeGendre (2-1) took the loss for Western (5-5, 3-3).  </P> <P> Western took a 1-0 lead in the first when Erik Dowell singled to right field,  moved to second on a base hit to left by Ed Serrano and scored on Jeff  Livingston's single to left-center.  </P> <P> The Pioneers' lead held until the third inning, when Magnolia struck for two  runs.  </P> <P> Straits led off with a triple to right over Livingston's head. LeGendre then  walked Compean.  </P> <P> Rob Sandoval sacrificed to center, scoring Straits and moving Compean to  second. Compean took third on a passed ball and scored on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> The Sentinels added two runs in the fourth on RBI singles by Straits and  Compean and four more in the fifth for their second victory over Western this  season.  </P> <P> In another Orange League game:  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda 4, Anaheim 1 -- Pat Simec (3-2) pitched a one-hitter with 10  strikeouts and four walks for host Brea (8-5-1, 3-2-1). David Geary had a  single in the fifth for Anaheim's only hit. Brian Travaglia had three hits and  scored three runs and Matt Selinske added two hits for Brea.  </P></p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: German pessimism is 'overdone' The extreme volatility of south-east Asian markets, where investors scrambled to bank some profits after the recent phenomenal rises, overshadowed the markets last week. Sharply divergent trends, however, were also seen in Europe. Germany was the Continent's big loser as the Metallgesellschaft rescue saga rumbled on. Nikko Securities says that some strong, non-German selling was seen amid the uncertainty and the unspecified earnings implications for the major German banks that would have resulted from a failure of the rescue effort. In addition, the Siemens results, and more importantly the earnings outlook they have given, indicated that the earnings forecasts generally adhered to are probably too optimistic. UBS takes the view, however, that last week's swing from optimism to pessimism, which took the DAX index down to 2,141.82 on Friday, went too far. 'With still a chance of a cut in the leading interest rates this week and support from a strong dollar, we expect the market to stabilise around the 2,150 to 2,175 level.' Finland, Europe's top performing market last year with a 91 per cent climb in the HEX index, was also last week's best performer, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Index. Strong foreign demand, particularly from US investors, was seen in the forestry sec-tor in response to the outlook for lower interest rates, the stronger markka, and optimism that this year will see positive economic growth for the first time since 1990. The advance also accompanied the run-up to Sunday's first round in the coun-try's presidential election, which resulted in two pro-European Union candidates winning through to the sec-ond and decisive round on February 6. In the Far East, Tokyo remained on the upward track as renewed foreign demand encouraged local investors back into the market. Elsewhere, it was a hectic week of switchback trading during which daily swings of 5 per cent and more were common. Kuala Lumpur was the week's biggest loser, with even a 9.25 per cent upward bounce on Friday unable to erase all of the losses suffered earlier in the week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                 % change in local currency**    sterling**  US Dollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                          1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +1.70    +6.90   +52.37   +44.85    +35.38       +33.42 Belgium       -1.66    +3.20   +30.05   +32.45    +22.44       +20.66 Denmark       +3.19   +13.27   +50.73   +52.41    +43.21       +41.13 Finland       +6.31   +17.51  +111.24  +121.38   +105.06      +102.11 France        -1.36    +4.30   +31.19   +28.71    +21.41       +19.65 Germany       -3.12    -0.68   +38.67   +37.15    +28.75       +26.88 Ireland       -0.58    +8.48   +62.35   +67.48    +49.60       +47.43 Italy         +1.37    -1.88   +33.11   +41.16    +23.60       +21.82 Netherlands   -0.82    +4.30   +41.36   +42.16    +33.87       +31.93 Norway        +1.22   +11.87   +45.07   +50.35    +39.86       +37.83 Spain         +2.67    +7.36   +46.36   +54.13    +24.17       +22.38 Sweden        +0.94    +9.27   +48.02   +47.4 3   +29.11       +27.23 Switzerland   -1.68    +4.26   +44.48   +45.51    +46.20       +44.07 UK            -1.05    +2.79   +25.18   +22.01    +22.01       +20.24 EUROPE        -0.99    +3.24   +33.51   +32.32    +26.77       +24.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +0.34    +5.80   +40.88   +36.41    +38.85       +36.84 Hong Kong     -2.73    +2.03   +87.45   +99.65   +102.98      +100.04 Japan         +2.58    +1.95   +20.58   +16.83    +33.08       +31.15 Malaysia      -5.50    +1.89  +113.35  +107.18   +101.44       +98.53 New Zealand   -0.23    +7.53   +53.09   +47.53    +62.50       +60.15 Singapore     -4.26    -0.42   +59.02   +57.66    +63.18       +60.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +1.33    +5.80   +28.86   +27.06    +24.11       +22.31 USA           +1.05    +1.73    +8.39    +8.45    +10.05        +8.45 Mexico        -4.95    +4.53   +41.06   +41.09    +43.76       +41.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -4.56    +5.77   +50.97   +58.94    +83.05       +80.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.58    +2.37   +20.75   +19.61    +23.80       +22.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on January 14th 1994.

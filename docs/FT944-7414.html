			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (7): Deutsche Bank builds on purchase of BAI - Foreign banks: a look at the contrasting fortunes of retail and commercial institutions There could hardly be a greater contrast between the activities of foreign investment banks and foreign retail and commercial banks on the Italian market. While investment banks and securities firms are building up their Italian activities or turning what was a mere foothold on the peninsula into a base camp for further expansion, their commercial counterparts have mostly retreated, badly bruised. Lloyds, of the UK, and First Chicago and Wells Fargo, of the US, have all been and gone from the Italian commercial banking sector. Citibank sold its Naples-based chain of banks to Banco Ambrosiano Veneto. Credit Lyonnais is said to be seeking a buyer for its investment in Credito Bergamasco in northern Italy, while others - Credit Agricole and Banque Nationale de Paris, National Westminster of the UK, and Creditanstalt of Austria, for example - maintain only minority stakes in Italian partners. Only Deutsche Bank has made an out-and-out operational success of an Italian commercial banking investment. It has built on its purchase of Banca d'America e d'Italia (BAI) from Bank of America in 1986. A year ago, it bought Banca Popolare di Lecco, a regional bank based near Lake Como, and now has some 300 branches in Italy and 4,200 employees. Underlining its success, the bank has just changed the name of the old BAI network to Deutsche Bank, a brave move in a country which, 50 years on, is still sensitive to anything that implies German occupation. Mr Gianni Testoni, Deutsche Bank's chief executive in Italy, puts the success down to the German parent's capacity to 'think globally, and act locally' and work 'prudently, gradually and continuously' - but he still admits that the bank is the exception that proves the rule. For foreign investment banks and securities houses, the market is a little more crowded, and is likely to become even more so. For example, Finanziaria Indosuez, part of Banque Indosuez of France, is beefing up its Italian securities trading and research operation; while Salomon Brothers' New York headquarters took a decision in June to expand its presence from a tiny representative office to a full bond-dealing operation with a staff of nine or 10. This is comparatively small beer, compared with the activities of some of the longer-established operators. JP Morgan, which has been in Italy for some 25 years, has more than 300 employees in the country, while Morgan Stanley has registered itself as an Italian bank in its push to win even more Italian business. The main reason why foreign securities houses have increased their profile in Italy in the past four years is the internationalisation of the Italian government bond market, the largest in the world after the US and Japan. This year the Italian government has introduced a new category of bond dealer - the 'superprimary' dealer - to encourage the screen-based second market in government securities. Such dealers are entitled to greater privileges on the market (for example, a right to participate in supplementary bond issues) than ordinary dealers or primary dealers, but have to take up a greater proportion of issues and trading volume over the year. The title may also appeal to the vanity of anglo-saxon firms, three of which - JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America - are among the 12 authorised superprimary dealers, while others are believed to be considering an application. For these banks, the Italian market has enough potential to justify a little local bureaucratic inconvenience, one of the elements which has hampered the growth of foreign companies in the commercial and retail banking sector. For example, UK merchant banks attacked the Italian law which restricts direct access to the market to locally registered securities houses, called Sims, claiming it was against EU rules. But most have still opted to establish a Sim, or buy into an existing firm, rather than wait for the European Commission or Court of Justice to rule on the case. Schroders, for example, is poised to receive a Sim licence, and by the end of the year should have 15 corporate finance professionals and 25 securities traders working mainly out of its Milan office. 'At the end of the day, it's probably going to take you almost as long and cost you more to fight the Sims law,' admits one foreign banker. However, many UK and US firms still maintain important operations, including equity-research and corporate-finance activities, in London, sending professionals over to Italy when necessary. Goldman Sachs, for example, has a comparatively small office in Milan, and Mr Claudio Costamagna, who heads the Italian investment banking operation, says the fragmentation of the market makes it almost as easy to work out of London as out of Milan, when it comes to visiting clients. He adds: 'By being in London, being exposed to the rest of the international business community you can bring something to the client that you wouldn't otherwise bring.' Whether based in Italy or overseas, most foreign firms are after a share of corporate finance business in Italy. Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, has a firm hold over corporate finance for the largest Italian companies, but the foreigners believe they can capture a share of international M&amp;A business, and carve a niche in advice for medium-sized local companies looking to expand, float on the stock market, or take over competitors. They are also front-runners in the competition to advise on Italy's large privatisation programme, which was launched two years ago. This has led to much hand-wringing in the Italian press about the dearth of Italian investment banks. Over the summer, there were even veiled threats from some more extreme members of the new right-wing Italian government that respected firms like Morgan Stanley might be cut out of government business if they continued to put their names to unfavourable research about the Italian economy. Happily for foreign firms, these appear to be isolated incidents - indeed, Morgan Stanley has just won the mandate to advise the government on next year's sale of shares in Stet, the telecoms holding company. However, there is certainly increased political pressure to nurture small Italian investment banks, which suggests that domestic competition could hot up over the next few years. That is a trend generally welcomed by foreign bankers. 'The culture of the domestic participants in the market has become much more international,' says Mr Hendrik van Riel, managing director of JP Morgan in Milan. 'Anybody can have a view about whether that could have happened faster, but it certainly has, and it's never slowed down. I'm convinced it will continue.'</p>

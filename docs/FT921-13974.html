			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's risks flight of Names - and insurance giants will fill the void (1) Sir, It is going to need more than just the useful and constructive report (January 16) on Lloyd's by David Rowland's task force to reverse the trend in Lloyd's, if my own experience is anything to go by. In May this year I wrote and spoke to my Lloyd's members' agency requesting a face-to-face meeting by August 31 (the last date by which a Name can formally resign for the 1992 year). Despite repeated requests, August 31 went by with no meeting. After repeated requests for an explanation, the agency informed me that it had been 'too busy'. I apparently have no redress, and this was one of Lloyd's biggest Names agencies. I have been a long-standing Name and underwrote approximately three times more premium than its average Name. Until this complacency and arrogance is removed from Lloyd's, surely it will have difficulty prospering. My members' agent had my unlimited liability in his hands, and he could not even spare five minutes to meet me, and, what is more, he seemed surprised that I wanted to discuss and understand what was going on] I resigned.

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Financial watchdog blames Brussels for wasted funds A COMBINATION of weak management, poor financial controls and fraud in member states cost European Union taxpayers at least Ecu115m (Pounds 87.6m) in 1992, according to a report published by the Court of Auditors yesterday. The EU's financial watchdog criticises the European Commission for wasting money in fisheries policy, aid to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, training programmes in east Germany and a multi-million pound Euro-promotion exercise at the 1992 Olympic Games. The UK and Germany, which are waging a campaign for tighter financial controls on the EU budget, are likely to find plenty of ammunition in the Court's 404-page report. Waste, fraud and inefficiency continues to plague the Ecu36bn Common Agricultural Policy which represents just over half of Brussels' annual expenditure. The report identifies numerous areas where mismanagement and inefficiency is endemic: The cost of public storage of agricultural stocks such as cereals and milk products was Ecu4.5bn in 1992. But the Commission was unable to produce any records on how cereal prices were estimated. High subsidies for milled rice exporters to the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean have cost taxpayers up to Ecu50m over the past five years, even though supply has often outstripped demand on the French colony. The EU spent Ecu232.7m on subsidising milk and dairy products for schoolchildren, but only 11 per cent of the population under 19 benefit from the measure. The Court criticises 'unnecessary and inappropriate' humanitarian aid to Russia, including the dispatch of 20,500 tonnes of rapeseed to Moscow and St Petersburg when there was no demand for it. Specific criticism is levelled at the Commission's decision to spend Ecu12.5m to promote the idea of the EC as host of the 1992 Olympic Games at Albertville and Barcelona. It also found irregularities in the way the contract had been awarded to an advertising agency involved. The report says the Commission paid a third of the costs of the opening ceremony at Albertville and a half at Barcelona. But 'the idea of dual loyalty on the part of athletes and of using the Community flag when medals were being awarded came to nothing when some of the national Olympic committees refused to participate'.</p>

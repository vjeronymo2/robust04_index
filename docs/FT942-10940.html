			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition: Dangerous descents in Mont Blanc's shadow Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They began in North America, moved to Europe in March, and are now on their way to India and Japan. High above Chamonix, Lucy gazed in wonder at the astonishing array of needle-sharp peaks, huge seracs and moraines and said: 'This must be the most awe-inspiring and beautiful descent on skis in the world.' We were half way down the Envers du Plan route to the Mer de Glace, and allowing for possible French bias, she could be right. We shall see. Perhaps there will be something to cap it in the Himalayas next week. Both the pace and the temperature of the Financial Times Round The World Ski Expedition are hotting up. Far from relaxing towards the end of our 524 miles of skiing in April (more than 100 vertical miles), we have been skiing some of the most demanding off-piste slopes in the French Alps: in Courchevel, Val d'Isere / Tignes, Argentiere and Chamonix. And before dashing to Geneva for our flight to Delhi, we set off bright and early on Wednesday morning for a 15km extravaganza down the Vallee Blanche, to be followed almost immediately by helicopter skiing in Val Grisenche, Italy, with Jean-Marie Olanti, our host in Chamonix. There are more than 100 glaciers in the Mont Blanc massif. If your guide is patient and lets you admire the view on the way down, you can see dozens from the Vallee Blanche alone - and a myriad crevasses. Our guide, Jean-Paul Balmat, knows his way around them as well as any man: his great great great grandfather, was - with a Docteur Michel Paccard - the first to set foot on the summit of Mont Blanc on August 8, 1786. During our descent we also met Georges Payot, another guide, whose father was killed by an avalanche during the attempted rescue of passengers from an air crash in 1950. There are three main routes down the Vallee Blanche from Chamonix's spectacular Aiguille du Midi (12,602ft). The main one, which most skiers take, is fairly easy skiing but potentially dangerous because of the Glacier du Geant, a huge serac and crevasse field below the Refuge du Requin (the hut below the Shark's Tooth). The other two routes - the Vraie Vallee Blanche and the Envers du Plan - are steeper and much more enjoyable for stronger skiers, with plenty of genuine off-piste terrain. Such runs are new to Lucy, who only a year ago could never have handled such conditions. But during the past four months she has experienced just about every kind of descent in very kind of snow. Her ski school report might read: 'Enthusiastic, but Lucy still has a tendency to sit too far back when turning in difficult terrain, with the result that she sometimes shoots out of the turn too fast and loses a little control.' This could be dangerous in glacier country, and indeed, on the one occasion she fell during our descent of the Envers du Plan, close to a gaping crevasse. In Val d'Isere and Courchevel, Lucy and I stayed in chalets for the first time during our expedition and found it hugely entertaining. I am not sure that all the other guests shared our view. There are definite pros and cons about chalets. The food at the Gros Caillou was excellent, but the lock on the downstairs lavatory/bathroom did not work easily, so one of the guests (a TV producer) was interrupted twice during her bath. Chalet staff are wonderful inventions, and we could have done with them down the road in Champagny-en-Vanoise where the accommodation we were given was grubby enough to prompt Lucy - dressed for skiing - to roll up her sleeves and do some cleaning. They would also have been invaluable when Margit Pfund, the director of tourism at St Gallenkirch, Austria, who had with great pride taken us to lunch at the Nova Stoba, the resort's top mountain restaurant, discovered after a long wait that the waitress had forgotten her lunch (but fortunately, not ours). While we waited, Edwin Ganahl, the director of the Silvretta Nova lift company quenched our thirst in the 220C heat with sparkling wine. This was less lethal than the 'Black Widows' showered on us the following day by Ganahl's opposite number Emil Isele in neighbouring Gargellen. This concoction - kirsch-flavoured coffee with cream - was offered at every pit stop until Lucy called a halt saying: 'Too many Black Widows for Arnie will make me a real one.' It was Emil who greeted the Prince of Wales during his last unofficial trek across the Swiss border from Klosters. Uncertain as to whether Charles would go for Black Widows, he settled for serving him a Schnapps. Frontiers seem to have little relevance when one is on skis. Just as the Prince was able to ski from Switzerland into Austria, on April 1 (when Lucy fell for my April Fool's joke that I did not feel like skiing that day) we did the reverse, from Ischgl to the duty-free Swiss resort of Samnaun, where to our relief we were able to use a credit card for lunch. Almost no one in the Austrian mountains accepts plastic which meant we were forever having to try to extricate cash from automatic dispensers. Centuries ago when Samnaun was cut off from the rest of Switzerland, the villagers struck a deal allowing them huge tax concessions. This created a smugglers' paradise, and the story goes that one villager from Ischgl, using the common excuse of crossing into Switzerland for a 'day's hunting', bought a consignment of cigarettes, went straight to Innsbruck without even stopping to sleep, sold the cigarettes for five times what he paid for them, and after further trade-offs, surprised his wife by returning to Ischgl from his 'hunting trip' with a live Ox. There is little scope for smuggling when crossing the border by chairlift, and new lifts between the two resorts are being planned. The Swiss can be odd about their lifts: in Leysin we found a chair (or rather did not find it) which has been on the lift map for almost 10 years - although it does not exist. It was planned for the winter of 1987/88, but was never installed. Newcomers to the resort sometimes search in vain for it, and have been known to become quite upset when they discover it simply is not there. In Flims most of the lifts have been upgraded, but one - the Stargels - still judders and jolts its way to the top of the mountain as it has done for years. Nursing a sore shoulder after a bumpy ride, I asked Shelly Kuratli, the resort's marketing manager, when they were going to replace it. 'Soon,' she said, adding - with disarming honesty - that the lift was so famous for its rough rides that it was known as the 'Tumble Dryer'. One must not be too critical. We may encounter worse before the year is over. And so to India and Japan. As I gaze up directly at the vast white dome of Mont Blanc, basking in the late afternoon sunshine, I find the unfortunate link between Indian airliners and Mont Blanc playing slightly on my mind. Two of them crashed on the summit of Mont Blanc - in 1950 and 1966 - and to this day, climbers still find gruesome relics of the tragic events. Looking up, it is not difficult to imagine how pilots would need to take great care not to commence their descent into Geneva airport too early. Luckily, we are flying in the opposite direction.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           FACTS AND FIGURES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- April statistics  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Miles skied: 524 (Total since January 1: 1,413) Vertical feet: 600,465 (Total: 1,620,350) Vertical miles: 102 (Total: 294) Miles driven: 1,512 (Total: 13,529) Resorts visited so far: 142 (US: 49; Canada: 13; Austria: 27; Italy: 10; Germany: 1; France: 21; Switzerland: 21)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Resorts skied in April  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria: Ischgl; Nauders.

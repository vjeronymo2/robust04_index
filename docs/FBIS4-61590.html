			<p>BFN     [Text] Steps must be taken to attract Russians, notably  refugees from former Soviet republics, to areas bordering on  China, Vladimir Podoprigora, chairman of the Federation  Council's International Affairs Committee, said at a news  conference in Moscow Friday.    He said that the population of the Khabarovsk and  Krasnoyarsk  Territories and the Amur Region had been declining, which was  alarming in the light of media reports of Chinese expansion into  the Russian Far East.    Podoprigora also noted that the government and parliament  had  to upgrade the powers of those regions while not losing sight of  national interests. He believed that serious thought had to be  given to the Chinese proposal that an economic cooperation zone  be set up in Blagoveshchensk.    Podoprigora emphasized that regional interests should not be  neglected in drafting Russian-Chinese relations. He added that  the residents of border areas were not all happy about the  agreement between the former USSR and China under which the  border should run along the mainstream of the Amur. The former  border line used to be practically the Chinese bank of the river.    Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs  Committee of the State Duma, said at the news conference that  Russia's active military and political cooperation with the West  had to go hand-in-hand with stepping up cooperation with China  in these fields.    He called for introduction of regulations for Chinese  citizens on Russian soil. According to the police, there are  nearly 370,000 of them, he said.    Lukin said that a State Duma delegation headed by Ivan  Rybkin  will visit China on 14-18 May. He thought that the visit would  contribute to dynamic development of the bilateral relations.</p>

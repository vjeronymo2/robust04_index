			<p>BFN     [Text] The Diqing military subdistrict has deployed 10,000  Army officers, soldiers, and militiamen in an emergency disaster  relief operation, rescuing people and livestock afflicted by the  greatest snowstorm of the past 40 years, thus effectively  alleviating the aftermath of the disaster.    An extremely strong snowstorm in the Diqing Zang Nationality  Autonomous Prefecture hit the prefecture in late March. To  fight the snowstorm, the Diqing military subdistrict promptly  organized soldiers and militiamen and set up first-aid  detachments to plunge into an emergency operation. (He  Zhiguang), commander of the military subdistrict, acted as the  general commander of the operation. Under his command, fighters  and militiamen protected with their own bodies the great dam of  the Chongjiang He hydropower plant in Zhongdian against the  snow, rescued more than 100 teachers and pupils of the Sanba  Primary School in Weixi County who were trapped by flooding, and  made arrangements for pupils to continue their studies. So far  the soldiers and militiamen in the Diqing military subdistrict  have rescued more than 1,700 people, took good care of more than  1,300 people, and saved economic losses worth more than 12  million yuan.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / The Markets: The fundamental things apply - Global Investor Having endured a terrifying spring ride on a roller-coaster, can global bond and stock markets now look forward to an enjoyable summer rally? That might seem overly optimistic at the start of a week when markets on both sides of the Atlantic remain jittery, and when poor German money supply figures could put additional pressure on the dollar. A stronger dollar seems essential for a sustained rally in the US bond market, which in turn is driving global sentiment in fixed income and equity markets. Still, the Federal Reserve's firm tightening action last week, coupled with a statement implying that it will not raise rates for some time to come, has prompted a modest rally in US stocks and bonds and gone some way to helping sentiment in Europe. The rally, and more recent technical signs of base-forming, suggest that markets may have come to terms with the initial shock of the turn in the US interest rate cycle; the accompanying liquidity problems which exaggerated the three-month correction; and concern that the Fed was not sufficiently tough on inflation. More fundamental factors may now start reasserting themselves. The US now faces two crucial questions: can the dollar rally? And is the Fed's action sufficient to slow the economy to a more sustainable 2.5 to 3 per cent growth rate, with inflation ticking up at 3 to 3.5 per cent, extending the current expansion into 1996-97? On both scores, the signals are likely to be confused for some time. In the short term, that may prevent the long bond yield getting out of a trading range of 7.25 to 7.50, which implies a need for further Fed action later in the year to slow growth. But if this benign environment does materialise, the yield curve could flatten dramatically in the second half, with the long bond staging a powerful rally to as low as 6.5 per cent. History, after all, suggests that long-dated US bonds traditionally yield some 3 per cent above the rate of inflation. As for the dollar, the market's swing from optimism about the currency three months ago (Fed tightening good) to the current fashionable pessimism (trade and money flows bad) may be overdone. Figures last week underline that the US trade gap is mainly with Japan, and the recent resumption of US-Japanese trade talks, and optimistic weekend noises about progress, might help the dollar in the short-term. Japanese economic recovery, though some way off, should ameliorate the problem over the longer term. If there is a strong second half rally in US Treasuries, it may be hard for European markets to match. Germany and the continental block pegged to its interest rate structure do not look particularly attractive on a six-month view, with the German economy showing signs of recovering more rapidly than expected. It is not surprising, then, that last week should have seen considerable switching out of bunds into US Treasuries, gilts and French OATs, though the narrowing bund/OATs spread could be reversed later in the year as the market faces a trade off between between heightened political risk (the 1995 French Presidential election) and continued easing by the Bank of France. US CYCLICALS The current stage of the disjointed global recovery - strong growth in the US, Europe showing the first signs of following the American pattern of an initially tentative revival - argues for a strong exposure to leading US blue-chip cyclical and technology stocks with a worldwide spread of interests and a record of big efficiency improvements over the past few years. If the US really has recovered its global competitive edge, the profitability of these companies should powerfully reflect this. Now may be a good time to pick up bargains, since cyclicals have suffered particularly badly in the market correction of the past few months. Chrysler, for example, is selling on a prospective 1995 price/earnings ratio of just 5, despite record first quarter profits and last week's boost to its dividend. Ford and General Motors are on p/e's of 6. The market is worried that the boom in US vehicle sales may peak next year, though the car companies themselves are looking to 1996-97. This could continue to hold back Chrysler, which has virtually no foreign production, but Ford and GM will benefit strongly from a reviving Europe. Other cyclical and technology blue-chips with strong earnings momentum include Caterpillar, shares in which have been depressed by a still spluttering industrial dispute; and AT&amp;T, winner of a huge contract last week from Bell Atlantic which puts its hardware arm in pole position to supply America's multi-media revolution. BRAZIL Emerging Latin American equity markets have been given a modest fillip by the Fed's tightening, but last week's sharp rise in Brazil was due as much to a reappraisal of domestic political risk. The market has slid over the past few months on fears that left-winger Luiz Inaco Lula da Silva will win October's presidential election, rather than former economics minister Ferndando Henrique Cardoso, who is committed to open the economy further and keep a cap on inflation. Da Silva is way ahead in the polls, but the market has been buoyed by two events last week which should help Cardoso narrow the gap: the withdrawal from the race of former president Jose Sarney, who would have siphoned away votes, and passage by congress of measures to curb run-away inflation, notably the introduction of a new currency on July 1. If this slashes inflation to single digits, as economists hope, Cardoso should benefit. All this has encouraged analyst Tamzin Hobday of Barings to go marginally overweight on Brazil in her model portfolio, but as she points out: 'There's still huge risk there.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 19/5/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     % change over period                 US      Japan     Germany      France     Italy      UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week          0.08       0.04       0.10        0.11      0.14     0.09 Month         0.33       0.19       0.47        0.51      0.67     0.43 Year          3.56       3.31       6.69        6.69     10.19     6.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week          1.70       0.30       0.24        0.77      0.40     1.12 Month         0.95       1.32       0.91        1.26      0.77     0.54 Year          1.10       7.88       7.94        8.39     18.36     6.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week          2.71       0.99       1.18        1.88      0.55     2.12 Month         1.47       2.47       1.59        1.56      0.82     0.38 Year          0.75      11.84       7.89        9.56     24.57     7.72  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week           3.0       -0.6        0.1        -0.3      -3.0     -0.5 Month          3.4        0.0        3.0         1.3       2.9     -0.2 Year           4.5        4.4       36.5        25.0      42.7     16.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Hainan To Allow Foreign Businessmen </F> To Buy Shares in State Enterprises"]    [Text] Haikou, 12 May (LIEN HO PAO)--It has been learned  that the Hainan Special Economic Region recently announced that  trade, automobile transportation, and accounting offices have  been opened to foreign businessmen.    In the financial field, the Hainan Special Region currently  has three foreign-invested financial organizations. It is  planned that three more foreign-invested banks and two  foreign-invested insurance companies will be set up this year,  and one or two relatively large investment companies run by  foreign businessmen will be set up on a trial basis.    In the commercial field, foreign businessmen will be  encouraged to run shops selling brand-name commodities, gift  boutiques, chain stores, large shopping arcades, and  joint-venture supermarkets. The commerce and investment in the  Yangpu Development Zone and the Haikou Bonded Zone will be  opened fully, and foreign businessmen will be able to set up  joint-venture, cooperative, or solely-owned commercial  organizations and operate large shopping arcades.    In the foreign trade field, foreign businessmen will be  allowed to invest in enterprises, to have shares of enterprises  in the province which have the right to import and export goods,  or to jointly run these enterprises in a bid to give full play  to the strong points of foreign capital and domestic capital and  to let them supplement each other.    Likewise, in addition to allowing foreign businessmen to  invest in the construction of superhighways, railways, ports,  and wharves, and to operate these projects, they will be able to  invest in automobile transportation. Preferential policies will  also be implemented and comprehensive compensation will be made.    Hainan will also allow foreign businessmen to invest in and  operate airport construction, aircraft maintenance, and airport  services projects. First rate foreign airlines with a good  reputation will be invited to take part in such projects, and  one or two Sino-foreign joint venture or cooperative airlines  will be set up on a trial basis. Hainan will also set up one or  two foreign- invested accountant offices and lawyers' offices on  a trial basis. The lawyer agency system will be gradually  implemented in a bid to speed up the convergence of Hainan's  tertiary industry with international norms.    Hainan will allow foreign businessmen to buy shares of state  enterprises and to take over or annex state enterprises. Hainan  will also allow foreign businessmen to transform state  enterprises through leasing and contracting.</p>

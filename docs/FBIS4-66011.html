Dusko Cvjetkovic,  26, is said to have directed a "paramilitary operation" as the  leader of a unit of Bosnian Serbs in the Bosnian village of  Kucice on 14 July 1992, a spokesman for the Salzburg Provincial  Court stated on Tuesday. Preliminary investigations for  genocide, murder, and arson are being made against Cvjetkovic.  If these accusations are confirmed in the further  investigations, charges within the framework of substitute  jurisdiction may be brought against the Serb in Austria.</p>

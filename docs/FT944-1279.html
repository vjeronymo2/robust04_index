			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Management: When King Herod called in the PR men - Rupert Morris has unearthed an ancient manuscript which could have changed the course of history Gadarene Design Group Galilee King Herod The Palace Holy Land Judea December Your Majesty, I am delighted that you have chosen to approach Gadarene Design with this intriguing proposition - to market your revolutionary population control programme. I have read our marketing director's preliminary report following his meeting with you, and this is how I assess the current situation. Background. This brief comes to us following the failure of Magi Marketing to adhere to the terms of their contract. While we normally have the greatest respect for our competitors, we must make a brief observation here. It is one thing to follow your star, but for their three representatives to go missing en route for Bethlehem, and then send you a bill for the 'necessary purchase of gold, frankincense and myrrh' as gifts for the inhabitants of some obscure stable is thoroughly unprofessional. I can well understand that your faith in the Judean public relations industry has been badly shaken by this experience. We shall do our utmost to restore that faith, and I assure you we will only invoice you for fees and expenses notified and agreed in advance. The project. We understand that the Prophets Forecasting Centre has foretold the birth of a saviour to the people of Israel. It has further given notice that this 'saviour' will be a first-born child. Clearly this is a major cause of concern, given the number of impressionable disciples wandering round the region. Your instinct to deal with the problem at the root, as it were, is surely right, and we wholeheartedly endorse your decision to restructure Herod Holdings and create a new division - Herod Population Control. However, the words 'population control' are open to mis-interpretation, and we would advise shortening the name to HPC Ltd. Vision statement. We now come to your mission statement. No one could disagree with your admirably worded opening: 'HPC's goal is to be a world leader in the administration of people, while taking every opportunity to empower managers to take initiatives at local level.' When you go on to say that 'every area manager should ensure the slaughter, without mercy, of the first-born child of every family,' we feel uneasy. Surely 'slaughter' is an inappropriate word in this context. What we are proposing is not slaughter, but the limited downsizing of households - a temporary measure in the interests of national security. It is, moreover, a measure with significant benefits for the population as a whole: It will reduce the nocturnal disruption to individual families, and thereby maximise the productivity of the workforce. It will reduce the weekly budget of the average household, giving them more shekels to spend, thereby optimising the prospects for consumer recovery. We would accordingly round off the vision statement as follows: 'Our employees will prevail over the primary issue at the customer interface, thereby optimising the benefits for the community as a whole.' Corporate logo. As graphic designers, we attach great importance to the corporate logo, and here we feel that a radical rethink is required. The current logo, the bloody sword, is undeniably impressive - graphic indeed - but open to misrepresentation. We feel that HPC should concentrate less on its methods, and more on the benefits that will follow from what is essentially a re-engineering process. With the inevitable increased productivity levels, resurgence in the economy and increased leisure time, more people will be able to enjoy holidays by the Sea of Galilee. That is why we have chosen the logo of a golden orb against a blue background - representing the warm sun in a cloudless sky over a still sea. Share option scheme. We feel there is a need to incentivise not only the administrators, but also the people of Israel themselves. To encourage families to join the household downsizing scheme, we should consider giving them something in return. If we were to give every man, woman and child (excluding the first-born) a share in HPC, it would help convey to them a sense of ownership and commitment (see diagram). Conclusions. This is one of the most challenging assignments we have tackled, but we are confident that on the basis of the strategy we have outlined, we can market HPC both to its own employees and to the wider public, while achieving all your personal goals. Coincidentally, we have just rewritten our own statement of vision and values. It now reads as follows: 'Our commitment is to consistently exceed expectations at the customer interface, regardless of external considerations, which might include the termination of individual life-cycles.' We feel this is so much more customer-friendly than our old motto: 'We'll help you get away with murder.' Please take our advice, your majesty. If you do not, God only knows what will happen. Kind regards etc etc.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Labour set to speed up contest for leadership: Support grows for Blair but Brown looks ready to stand Support for Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, hardened yesterday as the party appeared set to speed up the contest for a successor to succeed Mr John Smith as leader. As both major parties struggled to come to terms with Mr Smith's sudden death on Thursday, it became clear that Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, was also determined to stand. But amid confusion about the timing and rules for an election, Labour MPs said there would be strong pressure on the two men to avoid a divisive struggle by agreeing on a single leadership candidate representing the party's 'modernising' tendency. Senior Conservatives said the changed political landscape may prompt Mr John Major, the prime minister, to postpone his planned cabinet reshuffle to give the government time to develop a strategy for combating Labour's new leader. Cabinet ministers said there was virtually no risk of an autumn challenge to Mr Major, but rightwing backbenchers said his future continued to depend on strong leadership. Some Labour MPs said the outcome of the party's leadership contest could depend on Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment secretary, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the leftwing acting leader. Mr Prescott is minded to enter the race, but is considering a deal with Mr Blair under which he would become deputy leader with responsibility for running Labour's election campaigns. Such a 'dream ticket' would team the telegenic Mr Blair, one of Labour's key 'modernisers,' with a deputy with strong links to the trade unions and the party's traditionalists. But it would be difficult to arrange unless Mrs Beckett agrees to stand down as deputy leader before the party conference in late September. The party's national executive committee will meet on May 25 to discuss the timing and rules for the election, but is likely to put off a decision until mid-June. This would accord with the shadow cabinet's wish that leadership campaigning should not start until after the European elections on June 9. The result would probably be announced at a special conference in July. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's chairman, said the party would move 'sensibly but quickly into resolving the leadership, and the opinion appears to be we should try and do that by mid-July'. Mr Blunkett urged candidates not to engage in open campaigning until the race is officially declared open. Voting could take up to five weeks because of the requirements of the one member, one vote, electoral system - introduced last year at Mr Smith's insistence. It gives a third of the votes to each of three groups: MPs and MEPs, individual party members, and union supporters who pay the political levy. The introduction of individual voting will reduce the influence of leftwing trade union leaders, and is likely to benefit moderate candidates such as Mr Blair and Mr Brown. Most MPs regard Mr Blair as the clear favourite. However, some warned that his greatest handicap might be the strong support for his candidacy emerging in the media. Some MPs said that either Mr Prescott or Mr Brown might be more acceptable than Mr Blair to constituency activists. Mr Brown, who represents Dunfermline East, may also win strong backing from the large group of Scottish Labour MPs. However, Mr Brown was thought likely to face opposition from Mr Prescott and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, another potential candidate with strong links to the traditionalist wing. The bookmaker William Hill cut the odds on Mr Blair to 1-3 favourite. Odds against Mr Brown are 5-2, Mr Prescott 10-1, Mrs Beckett and Mr Cook 16-1, Mr Jack Cunningham 33-1, Mr Neil Kinnock, Mr Peter Mandelson and Mr Jack Straw 50-1. Labour announced last night Mr Smith's funeral will be at Cluny parish church, Edinburgh, next Friday.

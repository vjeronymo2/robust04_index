			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Acting for AIDS Funds: Actors and theater companies across the nation have  scheduled special events this week to raise funds for members of Actors Equity  who have AIDS. The annual Actors Equity Fights AIDS Week, today through Sunday,  will see the theater community involved with bake sales, flea markets, craft  fairs, raffles, car washes, memorabilia and poster sales. Cabaret performances  will also raise awareness and funds. Some companies will make audience appeals  for donations at performance intermissions. Since setting up its Equity Fights  AIDS fund-raising organization in 1987, the actors' union has raised $600,000,  which has been distributed directly to more than 500 Equity members to offset  medical and other expenses.

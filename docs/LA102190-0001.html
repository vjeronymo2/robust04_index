			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> The Searchers (TBS Monday at 5 p.m.). One of the most beautiful epic Westerns  and one of the most influential films of all time, this 1956 John Ford film is  the classic trek movie in which John Wayne embarks on a long odyssey in search  of his niece (Natalie Wood) captured by Indians.  </P> <P> Woman of the Year (Channel 5 Wednesday at 2 a.m.) This 1942 hit, written by  Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin and directed by George Stevens, marked the  first teaming of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy; Hepburn is a major  political columnist -- her character is patterned after Dorothy Thompson -- and  Tracy is the sportswriter who cuts her down to size.  </P> <P> Atlantic City (Channel 13 Wednesday at 10 a.m.) Director Louis Malle and writer  John Guare tell the stories of dreamers that the resort of Atlantic City  attracts as if they were fairy tales; the amusing, enchanting result is one of  the key films of the '80s. Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon star.  </P> <P> The Narrow Margin (TNT Thursday at 9 p.m.) Ingenious 1952 film noir thriller,  directed crisply by Richard Fleischer, starring Charles McGraw as the decent,  reflective cop assigned to escort hard-as-nails Marie Windsor on the train from  Chicago to Los Angeles.  </P></p>

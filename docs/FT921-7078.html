			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Cazenove Hoare Govett's deal with ABN Amro is welcome in one parochial respect. It secures the future of a house that offers an alternative to Cazenove for companies who prefer something other than the typical integrated merchant banking operation. The problem with Cazenove, as its recent spat with Steetley shows, is that its client list is simply too long. Companies need a good broker more than ever at the time of a bid, but the chances are that if one side is on the Cazenove list, so is the other. That was true not only of BTR and Hawker Siddeley, but also of Ultramar and Lasmo. It is also the reason for Cazenove's weekend untimely resignation as Steetley's adviser in its defence against Redland. Cazenove's practice is to stand down from both sides when there is a conflict of interest on a bid, but to complete any business in hand. So Steetley could reasonably have questioned where Cazenove would stand as regards its Redland defence if its joint venture with Tarmac, another Cazenove client, fell through. The unusual circumstances imposed a duty to make absolutely sure Steetley knew the score. Cazenove's failure to do so suggests a disturbing lack of circumspection in managing its multiple relationships.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN QUITS ANNAPOLIS OVER 'ASSAULT'  </P> <P> A 19-year-old Encinitas woman has resigned as a second-year midshipman,  sparking an inquiry into an alleged incident of harassment at the Naval Academy  at Annapolis, Md., in which the woman was handcuffed to a pipe above a urinal.  </P> <P> Gwen Dreyer tendered her resignation last week, citing "some very serious human  relations problems" at the Naval Academy, which prepares professional officers  in the naval service.  </P> <P> Dreyer -- a third-generation midshipman at the academy -- said she will now  intern at General Dynamics in San Diego and pursue mechanical engineering  studies at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> The incident that sparked her resignation occurred in December when a snowball  fight apparently got out of hand at a co-ed dormitory. Academy officials said  that, after one of Dreyer's snowballs hit a male midshipman in the face, he and  another man forced Dreyer into a men's restroom, where she was handcuffed to  the pipe. She was taunted and photographed before her friends pleaded with the  midshipmen to give up their keys to the handcuffs.  </P> <P> All the participants in the incident were clothed, and Dreyer was not  physically hurt, academy officials said.  </P> <P> The snowball strike "certainly did not justify the action taken by the male  members," said Cmdr. Ed Kujat, an academy spokesman.  </P> <P> Dreyer's stepmother, Carolyn Dreyer, told reporters:  </P> <P> "We still don't believe that they understand that it (handcuffing) was in fact  an assault -- an assault. And it would have been treated that way in any other  school, in any other situation."  </P> <P> She declined further comment, and Gwen Dreyer could not be reached Monday.  </P> <P> The two male midshipmen were punished with demerits and a loss of vacation time  by Rear Adm. Virgil Hill Jr., the academy's superintendent. He called the  incident "dehumanizing" and said the offending students "clearly went beyond  the bounds of acceptable behavior."  </P> <P> Hill said the punishments were among the more severe he has meted out during  his tenure at the academy.  </P> <P> Kujat, an aide to Hill, said that, because of the incident, the academy will  reconvene its Women Midshipmen Study Group to review recommendations made three  years ago for better treatment of women at the academy. About 10% of the  academy's 4,500 students are female.  </P> <P> Kujat also said the academy's Human Relations Council will be replaced with a  review board in which officers -- and not midshipmen -- will first hear of  discrimination complaints.  </P> <P> Kujat said the incident seemed to be more a spontaneous reaction to the  snowball fight -- an act of "oneupsmanship," and not a premeditated form of  hazing.  </P> <P> In her resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Capital, an  Annapolis newspaper, Dreyer wrote:  </P> <P> "What disgusts me most about the Academy is to see people who once had  tremendous drive and determination feel crushed and therefore satisfied with  just getting by.  </P> <P> "I understand that steps are now being taken to correct some very serious human  relations problems. However, after what I've been through and seen, not only  because of what happened to me personally, I have decided to leave."  </P> <P> Dreyer's resignation letter also reportedly said that "a portion of the academy  leadership has done me an injury" by its handling of the incident, and said she  was further troubled that classmates taunted her for reporting it.  </P></p>

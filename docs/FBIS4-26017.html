			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Forum" column article by Yi Zhi (2496 0037): </F> "A Move That Is Hard To Understand"]    [Text] On 8 June the three parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina  reached an agreement in Geneva on a complete cease fire for a  month. The following day, the U.S. House of Representatives  passed a resolution, calling on the Clinton administration to  unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. In response to  this, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev pointed out in  Moscow on 14 June that such a move would lead to a complicated  political situation. General Ross, commander of the UN  peacekeeping force in Bosnia, expressed disappointment, saying  that the U.S. congressional decision was tantamount to  "undermining the Bosnian peace process."    In September 1991 the UN Security Council passed a  resolution  calling on all countries to impose an arms embargo on all  republics in the former Yugoslavia. The current U.S.  congressional decision actually wants the U.S. Government to  ignore the Security Council resolution and act independently.  Judging from their reactions, the relevant quarters obviously  find it hard to understand and cannot agree with the idea of  unilaterally lifting the arms embargo.    On the question of maintaining the arms embargo on all  parties in the Bosnian conflict, there always have been  differences of opinion between the United States, the European  alliance, and Russia. The United States has constantly stressed  that failure to provide arms to the Muslims has "undermined the  military balance among all the parties in Bosnia" and is "not  conducive to the peace process." In the view of European  countries, however, the argument that it would be conducive to  peace to provide a large amount of weapons to a certain party in  Bosnia is "illogical." Although the United States intends to  lift the arms embargo on the Muslims, it does not want to act  alone for fear that this would undermine cooperation with the  allies and Russia on the Bosnian issue and would bring about  "serious consequences."    The aforementioned resolution of the U.S. Congress has  deepened people's impression: Just as the Bosnian peace process  is making some headway, there seem to be some discordant voices  coming from the United States to cause fluctuations in the peace  process. People still remember that when the seven foreign  ministers of the United States, Europe, and Russia reached an  agreement on the Bosnian issue in Geneva a month ago, the U.S.  Senate passed a resolution calling on the government to  unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. It aroused a  strong reaction from the Russian parliament. On this occasion,  just as the three parties in Bosnia had reached a cease-fire  agreement, the U.S. Congress again called on the government to  unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia in an attempt to  place its own resolution above that of the Security Council.    The month-long cease-fire agreement reached in Geneva among  the three parties in Bosnia is the first complete cease-fire  agreement reached by all parties since the Bosnian civil war  broke out two years ago. It was not easy to come by and  generally has held so far. All parties to the Bosnian conflict,  as well as the major powers concerned, should treasure this  achievement. Particularly in a crucial situation, it is better  to act with prudence.</p>

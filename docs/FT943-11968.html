			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (4): Accountability is core issue - Philip Coggan examines the debate about possible independence British economic policy debates are rarely short of what Americans call the 'high concept' solution - an idea that can be explained in a sentence. In the past, the panaceas have varied from incomes policies through monetary targets to membership of the exchange rate mechanism. The current 'high concept' is Bank of England independence. Only with an independent Bank, enthusiasts argue, can monetary policy be freed from the interfering and inflationary hands of politicians. Only with an independent Bank can monetary policy have the credibility to convince sceptical international financial markets. Enthusiasts point to the long-running, anti-inflationary success of the Bundesbank and, more recently, to the record of New Zealand, where the central bank has been given a precise 0-2 per cent inflation target. In part, however, the tide of enthusiasm for Bank independence stems from the shock created when the pound was forced out of the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. ERM membership had been the cornerstone of the government's economic policy. A replacement strategy was needed - and quickly. Norman Lamont's decision was to give a greater role in policy to the Bank. The publication of a quarterly inflation report by the Bank, accompanied by an official inflation target of 1-4 per cent, was the centrepiece of the new strategy. Kenneth Clarke, Lamont's successor, has steadily increased the Bank's autonomy. The Bank now has the power to set the timing, if not the direction or size, of interest rate changes. The minutes of the monthly monetary meetings between the governor and the chancellor are now published, six weeks after the event. This should, so the theory goes, make it clear when the chancellor is ignoring the governor's advice and pursuing for his own political motives a monetary policy which was too lax. But while the government has allowed this steady trend towards de facto independence, it has shown only modest enthusiasm for making that independence de jure. The issue of accountability is at the core of the debate. Bank independence involves the ceding of control over important areas of economic policy to unelected bankers, whose sympathies are more likely to be in tune with bond investors than, say, the long-term unemployed. After Norman Lamont's resignation speech, in which the former chancellor called for Bank independence, John Major said that 'were a way to be found to get the benefits of an independent central Bank without the loss of parliamentary accountability, my views would be very close to that of my Rt Hon Friend'. The Treasury view has been that considerable steps have already been taken to give the Bank autonomy and these need to be 'bedded down' and assessed, before any further moves towards independence are contemplated. Nevertheless, there is a fair head of steam behind the independence idea. As well as Norman Lamont, another former chancellor, Lord Lawson, has come out in support thereof. City support was shown by a Centre for Economic Policy Research paper in 1993, which proposed that the Bank should have full control of short-term interest rates, subject to emergency powers which the government (with parliamentary approval) could invoke. Both Eddie George, the governor, and the deputy-governor, Rupert Pennant-Rea, have backed the idea, albeit with the proviso that independence would be useless without a general anti-inflationary consensus. Quoted in the spring issue of Central Banking, Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'What we are really after is a greater appreciation of the benefits of a stable macroeconomic background and anything that contributes to that better understanding is a good thing. Frankly, until we have that understanding spread across quite a wide range of informed opinion and parliamentary opinion, you shouldn't be talking about independence as an imminent possibility.' The tercentenary has created the opportunity for some subtle lobbying in favour of independence. One of the papers in the Bank's tercentenary symposium, from Stanley Fischer, the soon-to-be deputy-managing director of the International Monetary Fund, made a strong pro-independence case. 'The evidence leaves little doubt that, on average, economic performance is better in countries with more independent central banks,' argued Mr Fischer, concluding that 'on her 300th birthday, it is time for the Old Lady to be allowed to take on the responsibilities of independence.' Mr Fischer's paper sets out the intellectual case for Bank independence. First, he argues there has been an inflationary bias in the economic policy of most countries. One reason is seignorage, the revenue which flows to governments from the creation of money. A second cause may be dynamic inconsistency, the tendency for governments to promise one thing (such as low inflation) and deliver another. Years of experience have persuaded the public not to believe government pronouncements on fighting inflation, and to act accordingly. Inflationary expectations are thus built into wages and prices, making it all the more difficult for inflation to be reduced. Whatever the academic merits of the issue, independence for the Bank is clearly a political matter. The chances must be that it will take another failure of economic policy - for example, a long period in which inflation exceeds the present 1-4 per cent target - before there is a real chance of the Bank getting its wish.</p>

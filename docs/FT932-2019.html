			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Observer: Danger no object One of the stranger aspects of the Michael Mates / Asil Nadir affair is why Mates would want to hang on to a job that most ordinary people would least like to have  - that of being the Northern Ireland minister in charge of security. The chance of being blown up is far higher than average and the oppressive security that goes with the job remains long after a minister steps down. But politicians get their kicks in different ways. Mates is a former soldier who appreciates the challenge of tackling some of the world's most sophisticated, as well as merciless, terrorists. Northern Ireland is also the closest British ministers can get to acting as mini viceroys. The system of 'direct rule' from Westminster means few decisions can be effectively challenged and the tight security can only add to the sense of self-importance. There should be no shortage of volunteers for Mates's job, if he should decide to go.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns lower on opposition by-election victory SHARE PRICES weakened in thin trading as last Friday's fall on Wall Street and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in an upper house by-election at the weekend depressed sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue Nikkei average closed 287.60 down at the day's low of 21,819.52 after opening at the session's high of 22,054.11. The index finished below 22,000 for the first time in three trading days. Volume fell to 137m shares from 200m, as market participants refrained from activity ahead of the national holiday today. Declines outnumbered advances by 747 to 208, with 165 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 14.48 to 1,612.94, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.34 to 1,230.89. The victory for the opposition in the House of Councillors Nara prefecture by-election, in eastern Japan, raised uncertainty over the progress of the budget bill which is currently being debated, and the upper house elections in July. Mrs Mineko Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse, said: 'The instability of the LDP will affect stock prices.' However, Mr Jason James, equity strategist at James Capel, said the political stall could increase pressure from the LDP on the Bank of Japan to cut the discount rate. Minolta Camera dropped to Y486 before closing down Y15 at Y500, following last week's US district court's ruling ordering Minolta to pay Dollars 96.35m to Honeywell, the US technology company, for patent infringement. Other precision makers also lost ground, with Olympus Optical falling Y30 to Y1,380. Weakness spread to other high-technology stocks, with Matsushita Electric Industrial retreating Y50 to Y1,400 and Sony Y30 to Y4,250. Clarion, a speculative favourite, advanced Y30 to Y1,100 on active cross trading. Some individual investors were noted trading the stock for quick profits. Nippon Steel lost Y4 to Y350. Traders said the stock was being neglected due to fears that institutional investors would liquidate holdings ahead of the March book closing. QP, a leading mayonnaise maker, weakened Y30 to Y1,260 on profit-taking. It had gained last week on news of lower egg prices. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 209.47 to 23,481.73 in volume of 56.1m shares. Trading was limited to window dressing ahead of the March book closing. Chemical and machinery stocks lost ground while engineering and transport equipment firmed. Roundup KUALA LUMPUR and Hong Kong stood out in a generally mixed Pacific Rim yesterday, one closing at a six-month high and the other achieving its third consecutive record peak. HONG KONG shook off an early bout of profit-taking and closed at another record high. The Hang Seng index advanced 22.19 to 4,733.56 and turnover remained heavy, at HKDollars 2.88bn after Friday's HKDollars 2.80bn. While property counters declined modestly, utilities and the commercial and industrial sector registered solid gains. Banks were narrowly mixed. KUALA LUMPUR extended last week's rise on strong support from institutions. The composite index closed above 600 for the first time since August 1, ending 13.51 or 2.3 per cent up at 603.35 in volume of 95m shares (55.8m). Renong was the most actively traded, firming 2 cents to MDollars 1.18 in volume of 7.6m shares. SINGAPORE closed mixed as investors concentrated on neighbouring Malaysia. The Straits Times Industrial index recouped a five-point deficit to end 0.13 up at 1,526.42, in turnover of SDollars 167.4m (SDollars 145.5m). MANILA fell back on fears that International Monetary Fund approval for its economic plans might fail after the senate rejected a tax proposal. The composite index relinquished 19.04 to 1,234.53 in turnover of 146.9m pesos. SEOUL eased after the suspension of an electronics group believed to be seeking protection from creditors. The composite index dipped 4.30 to 687.18 in turnover of Won416.4bn. Construction shares registered gains on good business outlook. TAIWAN surrendered an early advance and ended lower, the weighted index losing a net 13.08 at 5,204.55 after an intraday high of 5,290.27. Turnover rose to TDollars 51.02bn from Saturday's half-day TDollars 37.19bn. BANGKOK concentrated on Bangkok Land and Krisda Mahanakorn which accounted for more than one-third of turnover. The SET index closed 0.18 higher at 780.26 on turnover of BT8.75bn. Bangkok Land lost Bt4 to Bt177, its first fall since its debut on February 5, with Bt1.92bn worth of shares changing hands. AUSTRALIA rose after earlier falls: the All Ordinaries gained 4.0 at 1,594.9. Commonwealth Bank put on 21 cents to ADollars 7.12 after denials that further rights issues were being considered. News Corp fell 16 cents to ADollars 15.60: its interim profits are due on Thursday. NEW ZEALAND recovered some losses, having been depressed by falls in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE-40 index shed a net 8.82 to 1,458.30 in turnover of NZDollars 15m. Telecom lost 4 cents at NZDollars 2.29 and Fletcher Challenge 5 cents at NZDollars 3.44. BOMBAY rallied strongly as fears receded over a border dispute with Pakistan after reports of a build-up of troops on the border. The BSE index gained 78.99 or 3.60 per cent at 2,273.47. KARACHI also recovered after the government banned a planned march by Kashmiri militants. The index rose 14.32 to 1,410.72.</p>

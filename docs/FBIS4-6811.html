			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning Foreign Minister Squadron Leader  Prasong Sunsiri and his party inspected the situation along the  Cambodian border in Surin Province. In Kap Choeng District,  they were received and given a briefing by Major General Sanan  Marangsit, commander of the Suranari Force. According to the  briefing, the Suranari Force is responsible for security along  the Cambodian border in five Thai provinces: Surin, Buriram,  Ubon Ratchathani, Sisaket, and Amnat Charoen. The border in  this area is about 800 km in length. The Lao border also makes  up part of this length. The border problems in Surin mainly  concerned damage from shells from the fighting in Cambodia.  Recently, nearly 200 artillery shells landed in Thai territory  during the clashes in that country. There were also nine  incidents of border encroachment. The Suranari Force has  informed the agencies concerned of these incidents in order to  protest to the Cambodian Government. There were also 21  incidents of vehicles being hijacked near the border, 19 of  these incidents being solved. Interrogation showed that  Cambodian soldiers participated in the car hijacks.    The Suranari Force commander said trading activities along  the Surin border have slowed considerably. The Chong Chom pass  in Kap Choeng Distric remains closed. Thai officials have been  providing safety for Thai people along the border. It is  expected that fighting along the border will continue as long as  problems in Cambodia remain unsolved.    The foreign minister then proceeded to inspect the situation  in Chong Chom pass. He also met with Cambodian vendors selling  Thai goods on the Cambodian side of the pass. The vendors  wanted Thailand to reopen the border for trading as soon as  possible. The foreign minister assured them that if fighting in  Cambodia subsides, the Thai Government is likely to reopen the  pass.    The foreign minister said he will use information obtained  during the current trip to improve the overall situation.</p>

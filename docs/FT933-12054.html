			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / World Trade News: BAe facing delay in Taiwan deal - Talks continue over Pounds 250m venture to build jet aircraft BRITISH Aerospace may have to extend a July 31 deadline for a deal finalising the company's Pounds 250m joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC). Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, acknowledged yesterday the deadline might not be met. 'We're still in discussions to see how the two sides can agree and accept,' he said. Mr Chiang Ping-kun, Taiwan's minister of economic affairs, intends to write to Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, urging BAe not to insist on the deadline for finalisation of the project. BAe said it would 'review its position' if the deadline were missed. It has a mandate from its board to negotiate until July 31. Success of the venture is vital to BAE's recovery strategy. The joint venture - Avro International Aerospace - will manufacture BAe's RJ family of regional jet aircraft in both the UK and Taiwan. The Taiwanese site is close to east Asia's fast-growing market and will have lower labour costs. Late yesterday Mr Chiang sent an official request to the Taiwan cabinet for official backing for the project. Written confirmation may come today, but further discussion of financing details may delay the deal's final signing. Mr Yang Shih-chien, Taiwan's deputy minister of economic affairs, said Mr Lien Chan, the premier, 'stated his support in principle'. An executive at one of the island's state-run banks said local banks would not feel comfortable in approving funds to Avro without high-level government support in writing. The local bank consortium has said it will not extend financing until Avro is legally formed. Taiwan banking law prohibits a bank from extending unsecured financing to a venture in which it holds more than 3 per cent. Mr Ko also said the company was seeking 'clarifications' on 'two or three' of the seven key conditions put forward by the Taiwan side to BAe. 'We hope that this can be done in the next few days,' Mr Ko said. These are likely to involve Taiwan's request for a Pounds 5m 'technology transfer assistance fee' to help TAC undertake the assembly operation.</p>

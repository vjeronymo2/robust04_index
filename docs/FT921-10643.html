			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec oil output 'at highest level for 11 years' OPEC CRUDE oil production in January rose to levels unseen for about 11 years despite promised cutbacks in the latter half of the month, according to a Reuter survey of industry executives and analysts. Estimated January production was 24.2m barrels a day, about 70,000 b/d above the December level. Voluntary cutbacks agreed by nine members in the latter half of the month totalled around 410,000 b/d. But some countries never mentioned what level they were cutting from, so it was difficult to determine who did what exactly. Opec oil output in the last few months has matched levels of 1980-81. Crude output averaged about 25m b/d in 1980 and 23m in 1981. But a drop is anticipated this month as Opec talks in Geneva on February 12 are expected to decide to cut output further. Opec's big two, Saudi Arabia and Iran, stepped up output last month, but there were wide variations and less certainty about the estimates for both. Some analysts said Saudi output was as high as 8.7m b/d excluding neutral zone, while others put it as low as 8.4m b/d. Reuters judged that a fair figure was 8.5m b/d, partly based on comments from observers in Dhahran, home of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, and from tanker trackers. 'It doesn't ring true with what I've seen. There were the usual weekly swings but no big jumps in production last month,' a Dhahran trader said of the higher estimates. Including the neutral zone share the Saudi total is put at 8.65m b/d. But whether excluding or including the neutral zone Saudi output is about 150,000 b/d higher than for December. TWO TRADE houses, Sucres et Denrees (Sucden) of France and Switzerland-based Marc Rich, are negotiating to barter about 1m tonnes of raw sugar for oil with sugar buying agency Prodintorg on behalf of Russia, a Sucden trader said, reports Reuters from Paris. But he said no deal had yet been signed and that former Soviet agency Prodintorg was studying Sucden's offer in Moscow. Traders in London said on Monday that a major deal could be concluded shortly between Prodintorg and international traders. The Sucden trader said he did not think the deal involved commodities other than oil, such as metals, as some London traders had said.</p>

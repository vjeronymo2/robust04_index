			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes dissident rules out making bid MR JACQUES Murray, the dissident shareholder at the centre of an increasingly bitter battle for boardroom control of Andrews Sykes, yesterday ruled out making a bid for the industrial services and environmental products group in the current circumstances. European Fire Protection Holding, Mr Murray's main investment vehicle through which he now holds a 29.2 per cent stake in Andrews Sykes, said yesterday that it considers the company to be 'substantially overvalued at the current market price,' and added, 'in the absence of a material change in circumstances - which would include an offer by a third party - EFP will not make an offer for the company at this level.' Mr Murray has criticised the recent financial performance of Andrews Sykes and has set down resolutions calling for the removal of Mr David Hubbard, the chairman, and Mr David Crowe, a non-executive director, from the five-man board and their replacement by himself and three of his associates at an extraordinary meeting on Friday. Andrews Sykes' shares closed unchanged yesterday at 130p after gaining 5p on Friday when European Fire increased its stake in Andrews Sykes from 26.6 per cent to 29.2 per cent by buying shares in the market. However yesterday's statement is clearly designed to dispel any shareholders' hopes that the battle could develop into a full bid. In a letter to shareholders on Friday, Mr Hubbard launched a fierce attack on Mr Murray and his record as chairman of Nu-Swift, where he is the majority shareholder, and urged them to vote against Mr Murray's 'unnecessary and unmerited' proposals. European Fire countered yesterday that Mr Hubbard had failed to address its 'legitimate concerns' and was seeking to 'divert shareholders attention away from the question of Andrews Sykes' survival and the absence of an effective strategy to reverse its decline.'</p>

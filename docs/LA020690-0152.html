			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> KOHL CALLS FOR TALKS TO COMBINE EAST AND WEST GERMAN CURRENCY  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called today for immediate talks with East  Germany on combining their currencies in an effort to stop people from fleeing  the economically crippled Communist nation.  </P> <P> Kohl made the announcement during a meeting with leading politicians of his  Christian Democratic Union and the allied Christian Social Union.  </P> <P> He said details will be worked out when East German Premier Hans Modrow visits  Bonn next week.  </P> <P> Discussions on using West Germany's robust currency to revive, replace or  reinforce the comparatively puny East German mark have grown more intense as  the Communist country's economy nears collapse.  </P> <P> Earlier today, the influential president of West Germany's central bank said it  was too early for a monetary union that would make the West German mark East  Germany's currency.  </P> <P> Deutsche Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl also said he is opposed to the  idea of introducing the West German mark as a parallel official currency in  East Germany. He spoke to reporters after talks in East Berlin with Horst  Kaminski, president of the East German central bank.  </P></p>

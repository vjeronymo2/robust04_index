			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Boost to Ecu sector from Bank of England THE BANK of England yesterday gave an important boost to the Ecu securities markets when it announced its intention to build a same-day Ecu clearing and settlement system by next summer. The development of this key piece of market infrastructure, with the backing of the central bank, was welcomed by market participants yesterday, who said that it would add to London's appeal as a centre for the Ecu financial markets. The Bank said its new European Settlements Office would be based on an electronic book-entry transfer system, similar to those it already operates for gilts and sterling money market instruments. The arrangement would help the development of the Ecu markets by strengthening collateralised lending of the currency, encouraging the development of the repo market in Ecu securities. According to the Bank, banks have already given their commitment in principle to join the European Settlements Office. A number have also agreed to provide custodial services. Half the Ecu bond market makers yesterday tightened the spreads between their buying and selling prices, repairing some of the damage done to investors' confidence when market makers suspended dealings between each other 12 days ago. After suspending normal market making for one day, banks had agreed to resume last week at wider spreads to protect themselves in the face of heavy selling of Ecu securities. Yesterday, spreads for large liquid issues were halved again from 20c to 10c, with quotes being firm for amounts up to Ecu5m. However, the tighter spreads were quoted only by 22 of the 44 Ecu market makers, reinforcing claims by the leading banks that many of their rivals have never been fully committed to the market.</p>

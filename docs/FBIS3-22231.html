			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Olga Kolinko, Ukraine deputy procurator </F> general, conducted by Leonid Gashin: ``Fines (!) Are Being  Squandered'']    [Text] Throughout the entire world there is a legal  norm according to which those who pollute and destroy nature  must pay. This is also stipulated by Ukraine's Law on  Environmental Protection. Money exacted from enterprises,  officials or just citizens is supposed to be used for the  purposes of environmental protection. Seventy 70 percent of this  money is to go for establishing nonbudgetary environmental funds  under local soviets, and the rest of it is to go for  establishing a state environmental fund.    Recently the Ukrainian procurator general checked up on  fulfillment of the requirements of legislation regarding the  establishment, formation and use of these funds. Olga Kolinko,  Ukrainian deputy procurator general, tells about the results of  this inspection.    Kolinko: Before talking about the environmental  funds' receipt of funds and expenditure of them, it should be  said that these funds do not yet exist in all oblasts. Often  they are not established under rural soviets until after the  procuracy has intervened. That was the case in Odessa,  Kirovograd, Sumy, Cherkassy, Volynskiy and Zhitomir oblasts.  Because of that, money collected for the violation of  environmental-protection legislation and for the restitution of  losses went into the accounts of the rayon finance departments  or was left for the use of monitoring agencies. In 1991-1993  environmental funds in Ukraine failed to receive at least 100  million karbovantsy for this reason.    In other places, enterprises' payments were credited to the  rayon nonbudgetary fund. In Perevalskiy Rayon, Lugansk Oblast,  such a fund has been established under the rayon state  administration, rather than under the rayon soviet. Another  example in which payments have been misdirected: The Lisichansk  Petroleum Refinery, in transferring 5 million a year to the city  soviet's nonbudgetary fund, does not pay a single kopeck to the  Belogorovka, Maloryazantsevo or Volcheyarovka settlement  soviets, on whose land it is located. However, they should be  the first to be compensated by the refinery for its harmful  impact on land, bodies of water and air.    And very often people at the local level ``forget'' that  payments for environmental pollution are supposed to go  precisely to city and rural soviets. And the rayon and oblast  soviets may receive only part of the payments for the use of  natural resources.    Gashin: But do the soviets always receive those  payments?    Kolinko: Unfortunately, no. Today a situation has  developed in which payments are made only by conscientious--as  strange as this may sound--polluters. The amount of those  payments is supposed to be determined by the local state  administration, and agencies of the Ministry of Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources are required to report  allowable levels of discharge to them. However, the job of  making the necessary calculations has been transferred to the  enterprises themselves, and the agencies in question merely  confirm the figures that are presented to them. Therefore, not  wanting to pay, enterprises are in no hurry to make the  calculations.    To this day, allowable levels of emission and discharge have  not been set for more than 100 enterprises in Odessa, Donetsk  and Zhitomir oblasts alone. And in Kupyanskiy Rayon, Kharkov  Oblast, for example, one in every three enterprises is not  making payments because of the lack of any set allowable levels.    The state also sustains considerable losses because of flaws  in the recalculation of payments. Given today's inflation,  delays play into the enterprises' hands, especially since local  soviets and state administrations, and state administrations of  the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources  have not been exercising their powers to charge penalty fines.    There have also been cases in which enterprises have simply  been relieved of payments for environmental pollution. This has  been done either by agencies that lack the power to do so, or  without grounds for doing so.    Gashin: And just how is the money that does  actually end up in nonbudgetary environmental funds being  utilized?    Kolinko: That is where the greatest number of  violations were uncovered. For example, last year the executive  committee of the Zolochevskiy City Soviet in Lvov Oblast  allocated 4 million karbovantsy to hold a gala concert during  the celebration of the city's 500th anniversary. Altogether, in  1992 about 15 million karbovantsy was spent out of the  nonbudgetary funds to build roads, landscape cemeteries, hold  soccer tournaments and acquire equipment. In Kharkov monies from  the fund were used to augment the social development fund and  fund for the social protection of the population, and to provide  loans, while in Yenakiyevo, Donetsk Oblast, such monies were  used to improve the health of the employees of the city soviet  executive committee, the tax inspectorate and the civil defense  agency.    The most violations of this sort occurred in Kirovograd,  Lugansk, Volynskiy and Ivanovo-Frankovsk oblasts and the Crimea.    The problem is that the statutes on nonbudgetary  environmental funds that have been confirmed by nearly all the  local soviets do not accord with existing legislation. This  includes that part of the statutes that pertains to the funds'  use.    Gashin: That's at the local level. What about the  ``center?''    Kolinko: No better. Local deputies ``copied''  those very statutes from the Statute on the State Nonbudgetary  Environmental Protection Fund that the government confirmed last  year--a statute that also codifies the unlawful expenditure of  ``environmental'' money. Therefore, it is no surprise that over  the course of 1991-1992 monies from the state fund were spent to  index the wages of scientists working under contracts with the  Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, to  support the journal RODNAYA PRIRODA, and to make contributions  to all manner of funds.    One gets the impression that environmental-protection  objectives are really going unnoticed. After all, last year only  one-sixth of the republic fund was utilized. And this year,  having 80 million karbovantsy and 20 million in hard currency at  its disposal, the Cabinet of Ministers, based on a  representation by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources, has confirmed an estimate of only 28 million  karbovantsy.    That is not the end of the ``bad examples'' that the center  has set for local governments. For example, Instead of  transferring to the state fund 30 percent of the fines and sums  paid in restitution for damages that had been collected,  agencies of the Ukrainian Gosrybkhoz [approximate expansion:  State Committee on the Fish Industry] spent more than 1 million  to pay bonuses to their employees. Only at the procuracy's  demand was the violation eliminated. Back last September the  Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources sent  out a letter explaining that enterprises supposedly had to pay  restitution for damages only when those damages were caused by  the accidental discharge of pollutants. Following a protest by  the Ukrainian procurator general, the unlawful explanation was  withdrawn. However, for nearly a year the Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources filed no claims  for the restitution of damages.    Gashin: Why has such a widespread practice of  ignoring the law become possible?    Kolinko: The soviets of people's deputies, local  agencies of the state executive branch, and specially authorized  state agencies, especially the Ministry of Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources, have made fundamental  miscalculations and errors in setting their priorities for  monitoring activities. There's the main reason.    And the violations of the law really are widespread, and  they  exist in every oblast, without exception. If we do not get rid  of them, they could cause substantial damage to the state's  interests.    Gashin: Has the procuracy already taken any  measures?    Kolinko: Based on the results of the inspection,  83 orders to eliminate violations have been issued, 63 protests  have been lodged, and 147 claims have been filed for collection  of a total of more than 80 million karbovantsy. Considering the  seriousness of the situation, a representation has been made to  the Cabinet of Ministers demanding the urgent elimination of  violations. I. Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme  Soviet, has been informed.    The government has responded rapidly to our efforts, the  Supreme Soviet Commission on the Environment and the Rational  Utilization of Natural Resources has expressed its gratitude,  and reports have been coming in from localities where efforts  are also being made to rectify the situation.</p>

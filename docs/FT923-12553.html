			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: American Barrick sets earnings record AMERICAN Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has again reported record quarterly earnings thanks to rising output at its flagship Goldstrike mine in Nevada, lower costs, and an active hedging policy. Net second-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 36.8m, or 26 cents a share, from Dollars 24.6m, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 115.5m from Dollars 90.2m. Half-year earnings jumped to Dollars 59.9m, or 42 cents a share, from Dollars 40.2m, or 30 cents. Second-quarter output from Barrick's five mines in the US and Canada climbed by 45 per cent to 292,700 ounces. Goldstrike's production jumped by 68 per cent to 238,300 ounces. Output at three of the four other mines dropped, but Mr Robert Smith, president, said the company is in 'an excellent position' to meet its 1992 production target of 1.2m ounces. Cash costs dropped to Dollars 229 per ounce from Dollars 277 per ounce, thanks largely to the higher production at Goldstrike. Barrick's practice of hedging a large chunk of its output resulted in an average gold price for the quarter of Dollars 422 per ounce, compared with the average Comex price of Dollars 345.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Oil price The good news to emerge from the opening day of the Opec meeting is that the gap between Saudi Arabia's demand assumptions and those of other Opec members appears narrow by historical standards. But with so much at stake, it will not be surprising if it takes longer than usual to close. Judging by yesterday's nerves, the spot crude market still thinks Opec is going to find it hard to secure price stability by the time demand starts to fall in the second quarter. The haggling in Geneva is the more fraught when one considers that production in Kuwait is continuing to creep upwards. The market will want some reassurance that any agreed production ceiling takes that into account. Otherwise, the oil price will continue to be driven by short-term fears of over-supply.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Equity Plans (23): Look at performance then at the spread - Unit Trusts / Most investors should choose a trust with a high yield or the prospect of dividend growth UNIT TRUST managers have been very grateful for the existence of personal equity plans over the past couple of years. Conventional unit trust sales have been hard to come by, given investor caution following the 1987 crash and the 1990 Gulf crisis; and those few small investors who have been persuaded into the equity market have recently been enticed by the rival charms of investment trusts. Net sales of unit trusts (gross sales less redemptions) in 1990 were just Pounds 392m, and even the figure for the first 10 months of 1991 (Pounds 2.61bn) was well down on 1987's record of Pounds 6.33bn. But sales of unit trust Peps have been growing strongly - from Pounds 310m in 1989 to Pounds 498m in 1990, and Pounds 520m in the first three-quarters of 1991. And Pep investments are highly stable, with monthly repurchases running at only 12 per cent of sales in 1991, compared with a 72 per cent repurchase rate on overall trust sales. A big attraction - and selling point - for unit trust Peps is that they rarely involve any additional charges. So if you are going to buy a unit trust anyway, there is little reason not to buy one in Pep form and receive your income and capital gains tax-free. But the advantages of a Pep only become significant over the long term. Past figures from the Unit Trust Association suggest that the Pep investor placing Pounds 1,000 in the average unit trust would have beaten his fellow non-Pep unitholder by around 50 per cent over 15 years and 100 per cent over 25. The reason why it takes so long for Pep gains to come through is that, for most investors, it is the income tax, rather than the capital gains tax, exemption that is important. With capital gains tax exemption at Pounds 5,500 per individual per year, and with indexation allowed on post-1982 investments, few unitholders are likely to face a capital gains tax bill. Most investors pay income tax at 25 or 40 per cent. But on a Pounds 3,000 investment, even a trust with a 5 per cent yield would pay an annual income of only Pounds 150. So the potential tax saving in the first year would be Pounds 60 for top-rate payers and just Pounds 37.50 for those on the basic rate. Eventually, and with the help of reinvestment, this tax saving will grow into a substantial sum. The fact that Pep repurchases are so low - only Pounds 28.7m in the third quarter of 1991 - indicates that investors have absorbed this lesson of long-termism. But it also means that most private investors must make yield a prime consideration in choosing a unit trust Pep. A trust with a high yield, or one with the prospect of substantial dividend growth, is the way to make the best use of the tax advantages. Only those who frequently pay capital gains tax should opt for a high-growth, low-yield Pep. These calculations may change, of course, if a Labour government is elected this year. An increase in the top rate of income tax to 50 per cent would heighten the attractions of high-yielding trusts; a decrease in the CGT threshold (and an increase in top rate CGT) would raise the allure of growth trusts. Otherwise, when choosing a unit trust Pep, investors have only two real criteria they can use. The first is performance - and the important consideration here is not to be seduced merely by short-term (one year or less) growth. Remember that it is only in the long term that a Pep investment will really pay off. Look for consistency of performance over longer periods - there are tables ranking unit trusts over five years at the back of this Review. The FT's sister publication, Money Management magazine, carries performance statistics every month. Experts generally agree that first-time investors should stick to trusts investing in the UK. Those who want to invest overseas should start with the international funds rather than opt for the more volatile specialist country funds. The second criteria is to look at the spread between offer and bid prices (the prices at which you buy and sell). The greater the spread, the more your investment will have to grow to get your money back. Spreads tend to vary between 5 and 9 per cent. If the performance records of two trusts are equal, it is usually best to opt for the fund with the lower spread. Larger investors may be put off unit trust Peps by the government's Pounds 3,000 limit on collective-fund plans (and Pounds 1,500 on those trusts without 50 per cent of their assets in Europe). Investment trusts have been able to sidestep the rule through the new-issue market, a route not open to unit trusts. Instead, unit trust managers have offered top-up schemes, in which Pounds 3,000 goes into the trust and the remainder into individual shares, but this dilutes the diversification principle, which is one of the main attractions of collective funds. Investors need to check carefully that the top-up element is not spread so widely as to incur substantial dealing costs. And if they are not likely to pay capital gains tax, they should also ensure that the top-up investments offer a decent enough yield to take advantage of the income tax exemption.</p>

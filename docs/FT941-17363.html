			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Leftwing hopes for NCU poll hit The top job in the National Communications Union, the main union in British Telecommunications, looks less likely to swing to the left after the intervention of a Workers Revolutionary party member who is likely to split the hard-left vote. The NCU already has a left-dominated national executive. Mr Bill Fry, the union's leftwing president, is expected to mount a strong challenge to Mr Tony Young, the general secretary, in the vote for his job later this month. But Mr Fry's chances may have been damaged by the last-minute decision of the Trotskyist Mr David Wiltshire to stand. Mr Fry is also handicapped by having spent most of his working life at Royal Mail rather than at BT, where the bulk of NCU members work. During the next few months the finishing touches will be put to a merger of the 130,000-strong NCU and the rather larger postal workers union, the Union of Communication Workers. Some NCU activists fear that Mr Fry's postal background would make him too favourably disposed to the UCW in the negotiations. The result of the election will be known by mid-February. If Mr Fry does win it is likely to signify a tougher fight over the next wave of redundancies being sought by BT. In his election address Mr Fry attacks the 'low profile' of Mr Young's leadership and calls for more passion and protest. Mr Young, general secretary since 1989, says there is no point recalling an 'industrial era which no longer exists'. Mr Young's low-profile style can claim some successes. BT has one of the best redundancy packages in industry and last month the company agreed to withdraw a controversial system for assessing which staff should be made redundant.</p>

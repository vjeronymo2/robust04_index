			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kirichenko and Azer Mursaliyev: </F> "Possible Consequences of River Diversion Projects"]    [Text]  <H5>  Northern Diversion Regions </H5>   1. Flooding of farmland and timber land by reservoirs;  rising  ground water levels.    2. Damage to the fishing industry due to changes in the  hydrobiological conditions of rivers.    3. Changes in the permafrost layer (primarily in Siberia).    4. Archaeological, historical and cultural damage as a  result  of construction and flooding (primarily in the northern European  section).    5. Disruption of traditional ways of life and cultures due  to  the influx of tens of thousands of construction workers into  sparsely populated areas.    6. Climatic changes along the shores of large reservoirs.    7. Changes in ice coverage and climate at the mouths of  major  Arctic rivers (due to reduction in water volume and thermal flow  and changes in the river discharge schedule).  <H5>  Southern Diversion Regions </H5>   1. Possible introduction of harmful aquatic species and  diseases as a result of the merger of northern and southern  watersheds.  <H5>  Effects on an International Scale </H5>   1. Degradation of certain fish species of international  significance (for example, the Atlantic salmon).    2. Effects of European water diversion on the hydrological,  saline and biological condition of the Caspian Sea will affect  Iran.    3. The tremendous amounts of diversion (200-300 cubic km  annually) from rivers in the Arctic Sea basin that are possible  by the next century could cause changes in permanent Arctic Sea  ice cover (particularly in the Karsk Sea) sufficient to cause  climate changes extending beyond the borders of the CIS.</p>

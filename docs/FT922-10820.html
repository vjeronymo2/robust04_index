			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: USDA acts quickly to beat African snail threat THE US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has set up a 'dragnet' to capture giant African snails, which it believes may get free in the US, reproduce swiftly and begin feeding voraciously on American vegetables and fruits. In the week since it raised the alarm, the department has 'recovered' more than 125 of the fist-sized snails, of the species Archacatina Marzinata, mostly from the relative safety of pet shops. Only one suspect was sighted in the fields - in Kansas - but it turned out to be an indigenous broccoli snail. Ms Roberta McCorkle, a USDA spokesperson, said the creatures looked like 'a slime puddle' or 'melted chocolate' when they left their shells to feed. They reproduced easily, she said, although they did need partners. The snails were illegally imported from Lagos, the commercial capital of Nigeria, from a broker through John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, according to Mr Glen Lee, a department official. The shipments were listed as reptiles and therefore not seen by USDA inspectors. They are popular as terrarium pets, and department officials are worried that they may be freed by their owners, intentionally or - as was the case with the costly gypsy moth - by accident. In the 1970s it took the agricultural authorities nearly six years to eradicate a similar giant African snail, and the final bill was estimated at between Dollars 5m and Dollars 7m. Department officials are now ploughing through pet store records to determine just how many of the threatening gastropods were imported and distributed. They are asking owners to turn in their snails for 'humane' disposal.</p>

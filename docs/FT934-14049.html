			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Observer: Point of principal The 'personal reasons' that Neil Johnson cited last week when he unexpectedly revealed his intention to quit the Engineering Employers' Federation before the end of the year seem to be of a rather unusual kind. Deeply involved in the federation's talks concerning a proposed link-up with the Confederation of British Industry, the engaging director-general now lets on that his 'fundamental belief in the rectitude of the proposal' was, 'perversely', the reason for his going. He felt the affair was becoming too 'personalised', which must surely translate into the concern, that, were he to stay, the whole endeavour might founder on the issue of which of the two federation chiefs, he or Howard Davies, emerged as top dog. Whatever his motives, Johnson's departure is unlikely to have done his career much harm, for the Sandhurst-educated industrialist has proved himself a highly articulate and affable advocate of the cause since his arrival in July last year. He has got away with saying some pretty damning things about the government, even if he may have been a trifle demob-happy in his latest criticism of Treasury officials as 'totally unspoiled by failure'. He says he had several offers of non-executive directorships when time did not permit him to say yes. He will be hoping the phone rings again.</p>

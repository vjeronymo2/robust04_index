			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Four-and-oh is no fluke. Stamp the Raiders as legitimate Super Bowl contenders  after the way they handled the previously unbeaten Chicago Bears. . . .  </P> <P> Perhaps the only thing that could keep the Raiders out of the expanded playoffs  would be more injuries. They've had enough already to deplete an ordinary team.  . . .  </P> <P> The crowd of 80,156 was the biggest in the NFL this season, but not among the  best behaved despite the push to make the Coliseum a nicer place on Sunday  afternoons. . . .  </P> <P> Scoreboard message that was ignored by many fans, mostly in the east end: "Be A  Team Player -- Root Responsibly!" . . .  </P> <P> Block of the Day: Marcus Allen's demolition of Richard Dent during a 20-yard  Jay Schroeder- to-Mervyn Fernandez pass play early in the fourth quarter. . . .  </P> <P> Schroeder, who isn't forcing anything, is making all the right decisions. . . .  </P> <P> The Raider defense has scored three more touchdowns than the Pittsburgh Steeler  offense this season. . . .  </P> <P> An early defensive rookie of the year candidate is linebacker Aaron Wallace. .  . Strangest penalty of the day was the one assessed against the Bears for 12  men on the field -- on the first play after a timeout. . . .  </P> <P> Thumbs up to Raider Steve Wright, who has filled in superbly for the injured  Bruce Wilkerson at offensive right tackle. . . .  </P> <P> Who would you rather have as your offensive coordinator, the Vikings' Joe  Schnelker or the Steelers' Joe Walton? . . .  </P> <P> It's hard to believe, but the Cleveland Browns, Minnesota Vikings and  Philadelphia Eagles are each 1-3. . . .  </P> <P> The New England Patriots got what they deserved Sunday. . . .  </P> <P> This has been a great year for Eddie Murray, the Dodger slugger, but a lousy  one for Eddie Murray, the Detroit Lions' kicker. . . .  </P> <P> It's time to give the Cincinnati Reds some credit.  </P> <P> They bent, but didn't break.  </P> <P> The biggest reason the Pittsburgh Pirates won the NL East pennant is that they  were hungrier than the New York Mets. . . .  </P> <P> I liked Comiskey Park better than Wrigley Field. . . .  </P> <P> However, a different name should have been given the new park across the  street. Bill Veeck Stadium would have been perfect, but White Sox owner Jerry  Reinsdorf wasn't a big fan of the greatest showman in baseball. . . .  </P> <P> This is Tom Lasorda's second best job of managing. His best was in 1988 when  the Dodgers won the World Series with maybe the weakest lineup ever in the  Series. . . .  </P> <P> This will be remembered as the year the New York Yankees and St. Louis  Cardinals finished last. . . .  </P> <P> Lost and found: The USC and UCLA rushing attacks. . . .  </P> <P> In Nevada, all bets are called off if 55 minutes or more aren't played in a  football game. The USC-Ohio State game was stopped after 57 minutes and 24  seconds. . . .  </P> <P> John Cooper should ask his athletic director never to schedule Larry Smith  again. . . .  </P> <P> UCLA-Washington State was an exciting game, but were you able to stay up until  the end? It didn't end until around 11:30 p.m. because of the late starting  time dictated by ESPN and all those TV commercials. . . .  </P> <P> Tommy Maddox is going to make Bruin football exciting for the next three-plus  years -- or until he opts for the NFL draft. . . .  </P> <P> Hype of the week: ESPN announcer Wayne Larrivee calling Northern Illinois  quarterback Stacey Robinson a "bonafide Heisman Trophy candidate" before the  Huskies were routed by mighty Northwestern. . . .  </P> <P> Despite its come-from-ahead defeat to Notre Dame in South Bend on opening  night, Michigan may have the best team in the nation. On a bad day, the  Wolverines still were able to handle decent Maryland, 45-17. . . .  </P> <P> BYU quarterback Ty Detmer on being intercepted five times by Oregon: "I threw  'em, they caught 'em." . . .  </P> <P> So much for the hot Arizonas. . . .  </P> <P> Auburn Coach Pat Dye sure loves ties. He wore a grin and waved his cap to the  fans on his way to the dressing room after the Tigers' 26-26 tie with  Tennessee. And remember that draw with Syracuse in the Sugar Bowl? . . .  </P> <P> If Dye had gone for one point instead of two when the Tigers trailed 19-9, they  would have won Saturday. . . .  </P> <P> Ohio State freshman running back Robert Smith had his problems against USC, but  he's a dead ringer for O.J. Simpson with those long, graceful strides. . . .  </P> <P> Bad taste award: To CBS for reporting that New York Jets Coach Bruce Coslet was  fined by the NFL for making an obscene gesture -- and then showing it on "The  NFL Today." . . .  </P> <P> No changes were reported over the weekend in the NFC West standings or Willie  McGee's National League batting average.  </P></p>

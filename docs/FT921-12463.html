			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Campaign launched to save Devonport DML, THE privately owned company that manages Devonport dockyard under contract from the Ministry of Defence, has launched a campaign to save the dockyard from closure. Mr Mike Leece, managing director, has warned the 5,000 workforce 'there is a real possibility that the Devonport dockyard could close'. He is supported in the campaign by Mr John Ingham, Labour leader of Plymouth City Council, who has said that 'Devonport can stand the strictest comparison with Britain's other naval facilities. It fully deserves to flourish'. If the dockyard were to close under the ministry's Options for Change policy review, it might lead to serious doubts over the future of the associated naval base itself, which employs some 4,700 people. MoD officials say that closure of the base is ruled out, but that reductions are likely. The city council has estimated that closure of the two would cost the south-west of England more than Pounds 1bn a year directly and indirectly and lead to the loss of some 15,000 jobs in the dockyard, the naval base and the supply industries. 'We are fighting for the survival not just of the dockyard but for Plymouth and the whole south-west,' Mr Leece said. At thecentre of the matter is the contest for the contract to refit nuclear-powered submarines. Under present arrangements, Devonport handles some 'conventional' nuclear submarines while refitting work on the Polaris ballistic-missile fleet is undertaken at Rosyth in Scotland by Babcock Thorn. Last year the MoD, as part of Options for Change, asked the two companies to present proposals for merging all submarine work at one yard. The ministry has been holding the two reports since last November and there are fears in Plymouth that after the outcry over the closure of the Ravenscraig steel works in Lanarkshire the government will throw Scotland a bone before the election and place all its submarine work in Rosyth. The decision on whether to concentrate all the nuclear submarine work at a single site has not yet been made, and is thought unlikely before the election. A report commissioned by Plymouth City Council from Mr Eric Grove, an independent consultant, concluded that 'Devonport offers the greatest efficiency and scope for growth of all the naval base/dockyard complexes'. There are voices, however, warning the city and company against intensive lobbying. Dr David Owen, a Plymouth MP, has said that defence decisions will be taken with national objectives in mind and that pressure lobbying might be counterproductive.</p>

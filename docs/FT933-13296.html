			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / RTZ to sell Nerco's oil and gas interests for Dollars 510m RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining company, has signed definitive agreements to sell for Dollars 510m (Pounds 340m) cash the oil and gas interests it acquired only last month when it bought Nerco, the floundering US natural resources group previously 82 per cent owned by PacifiCorp. The UK group has also already sold some of Nerco's gold mining assets for Dollars 40m and is negotiating the sale of the rest. These sales should be completed by the end of this year. RTZ announced the acquisition of Nerco in February and completed the deal on June 2 for Dollars 470m plus the assumption of Dollars 692m debt. RTZ wanted only Nerco's coal operations in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, was retained to sell the oil and gas interests because they did not fit the UK company's strategic objectives. Most analysts considered that RTZ bought Nerco for a bargain price and they were also impressed by the value and speed of the oil and gas assets sale. RTZ's share price reflected this positive sentiment and gained 15p to close last night at 683p. Mr Nick Hatch, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, said: 'The price is about 10 per cent better than I expected and the deals will help to reduce RTZ's gearing to a comfortable level faster than most people believed possible.' RTZ's cash outlay for Nerco was reduced to Dollars 245m by a loan from PacifiCorp to be repaid from Nerco contract revenues. However, RTZ's gearing briefly rose to 63 per cent. The company said that the oil and gas sale plus the impact of an enhanced scrip dividend would reduce gearing to about 45 per cent. Western Gas Resources, the US energy group, will pay Dollars 156.05m for Nerco's Black Lake field, onshore in Louisiana, and the Black Lake Pipeline Company. Louisiana Land and Exploration Company, another US energy group, is to buy the remainder rest of Nerco's oil and gas operations for Dollars 353.7m. Lex, Page 14 Commodities, Page 22</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: BCCI report set for delay PUBLICATION of the Bingham report into the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International looks set to be delayed until late next month or July - almost a year after the inquiry was set up. Treasury officials warned yesterday that the conclusions of Lord Justice Bingham might not be released until after the Commons rises for summer recess - probably the middle of July. The delay, to what could be a deeply embarrasing report for the government, appears to have resulted from the enormous scope of the investigation, covering the roles of the regulatory authorities and ministers in uncovering fraud at BCCI. When he announced the setting up of the inquiry last July, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he hoped its conclusions would be released before the general election. But that timetable became impossible to achieve when Mr John Major set April 9 as election day. The Treasury subsequently said publication would be in 'spring or early summer, it is hoped.' Officials yesterday said that, although no date for publication had been fixed, June or July were likely but early June looked optimistic. Both Downing Street and the Treasury confirmed that it remains the government's intention to publish as much of Lord Justice Bingham's report as possible. Parts that will not be released will be those that might prejudice possible criminal trials or which must remain confidential under Banking Acts. The Bingham inquiry was set up amid fierce political rows in the Commons over the extent of the government's responsibility in the affair. It was supposed to cover how much minsters knew and at what stage. A cross-party report by the Commons Treasury select committee before the general election was critical of the Bank of England for failing to act sooner against BCCI but ministers escaped blame.</p>

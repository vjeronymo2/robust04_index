They closed a penny off at 180p, against the strong trend of the market, in above average turnover of 2.8m. The newspaper is hoping to get the ban lifted or to have its restrictions eased. Ladbroke obtained the injunction 10 days ago to prevent the Mail from repeating allegations about the company's relations with its bankers. However, the episode heightened concern among investors and commentators regarding Ladbroke's sensitivity over the issue, and prompted a spate of negative press comment.</p>

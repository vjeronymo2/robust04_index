			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Siebe seeks Pounds 184.3m via rights - Acquisition of Eckardt is third continental European buy this year SIEBE, the international controls and engineering group, yesterday launched a Pounds 184.3m rights issue to buy Eckardt, a family controlled business in Germany and the group's third acquisition in continental Europe this year. The 1-for-10 issue is priced at 485p, a 14 per cent discount to the 565p at which the shares closed on Tuesday. Siebe's shares rose 9p yesterday. Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman and chief executive, said Eckardt, which makes process automation and control systems, was being acquired because of its fit with the European operations of Foxboro, the US business bought three years ago for Dollars 650m. Eckardt is a well-known name in control engineering and was called by one analyst yesterday a 'small European Foxboro'. It will give Siebe an enlarged European manufacturing base and access to a bigger pool of German engineering expertise. The company made a DM6.1m pre-tax loss in the year to December 31 1992 on sales of DM230.7m, after charging DM7m above the line for restructuring. Mr Allen Yurko, managing director and chief operating officer, said he was confident Siebe could turn Eckardt into a significant profit and cash generator within 18 months and that there was scope to reduce costs substantially. Siebe will be paying DM212.8m (Pounds 85.1m), including the assumption of DM33.8m of debt. Initially the group will make a DM30m subscription for new Eckardt shares, which will give it control and substantially repay bank debt. The German families, led by the Sieglin family, which control Eckardt have asked to receive the balance of DM179m next October. Siebe is also repaying debt taken on earlier this year when it paid Pounds 27.3m to buy two controls companies, Eberle in Germany and Schmidt in Austria. After the acquisitions Siebe will be left with cash of about Pounds 72m which it will not be using to repay debt. Mr Stephens said Siebe was only currently looking at one other potential acquisition, a small European company in the controls field. The group had not wanted to raise money via a placing, because that route denied some shareholders the opportunity to sell rights in the market. To have raised less than the amount implied by a 1-for-10 rights was not practical or worth the cost, the advisers had said. Gearing after the acquisitions will be no higher than 39 per cent, but significantly lower after a fair value adjustment to reflect better a higher value of Eckardt's assets. Siebe said when it bought Foxboro and gearing rose to 100 per cent that it would cut the debt equity ratio to below 55 per cent within three years. Mr Stephens said Siebe had achieved this target on a pro-forma basis before the two acquisitions earlier this year. Eckardt makes gross margins of 35-40 per cent, has net book assets of DM29.1m and substantial hidden assets on the balance sheet, Siebe says. Mr Stephens said the deal would not be dilutive. The group says it expects to achieve PBIT margins similar to the 19 per cent achieved at Foxboro within 18 months. Siebe is in its close period. But Mr Stephens said trading was currently on target and the group continued to be cash generative. The company said it would pay a 3.66p interim dividend - a 10 per cent rise - on the increased shareholder base. The purchase of Eckardt takes Siebe further into the controls business which already accounts for 70 per cent of group sales of Pounds 1.6bn. The group only entered this area in 1983. The rights issue is fully underwritten by SG Warburg. See Lex</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Premium income falls at leading Japanese insurers Premium income at Japan's leading life insurance companies declined during the six months ended September, the first half-year decline ever recorded by the industry. Combined premiums fell 1.5 per cent to Y10,647.3bn (Dollars 97.9bn). The life companies, however, managed to post higher unrealised profits on stock holdings for the period. These rose 8.1 per cent. The value on stock holdings at the eight life companies rose by 52.3 per cent compared with figures at the end of March, to Y12,800bn. Returns on asset investment rose 7.1 per cent due to sales of securities worth Y280.8bn. Life companies increased their disposals of shares in order to cover for weak investment returns following the decline in interest rates. The fall in Japanese share prices has hit the life industry hard, although unrealised profits on share holdings have acted as a buffer against losses on high-risk investments. However, some of the larger companies yesterday said they would begin to increase securities investments during the current six months. Now was a good time to buy, they said. Nippon Life and Sumitomo Life said they would be committing more funds to the Tokyo stock market. Although combined bad loans were 1 per cent lower at Y400bn, the worsening economy increased bad loans at some life companies. The industry is likely to raise premiums next April for the second consecutive year, while cutting dividends on new policies for the fourth year in a row. Nippon Life, the industry leader, saw a 7.8 per cent rise in total assets to Y33,259.8bn. Policy payments rose 7.4 per cent to Y1,415.3bn while latent profits on stocks rose 88 per cent from the previous year to Y4,489.9bn. Dai-Ichi Life more than doubled its unrealised profits on stocks to Y2,345.1bn while Sumitomo Life increased its latent profits by 5.2 times to Y1,014.8bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of  Finance today made a public offering of 10 billion yuan in  one-year state treasury bonds.    This is the second group of state bonds issued this year.  The first issuance of five billion yuan in six-month bonds  occurred a week ago, on January 23.    Both offerings are in the paperless form, that is, the  purchase, trading or interest payment on the bonds will be done  through computer networks of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.    The one-year bonds carry an interest rate of 11.98 percent  while the rate on half-year bonds is 9.8 percent, one percentage  point higher than the bank deposit rates for the corresponding  periods.    The 15 billion yuan in bonds have all been sold to 35  primary  dealers, namely banks and non-banking financial institutions,  according to an official with the Ministry of Finance.    This year's issuance is two months earlier than usual, and  the short-term bond is being tested for the first time in China.    The early issuance is mainly intended to lay the groundwork  for the central bank's open market operation, which will  formally begin in early March in Shanghai.    It will also help to cover the huge financial expenditure  during the peak time of Spring Festival, which falls on February  10 this year, the financial official noted.    The bonds can be held by banks, enterprises and individuals.  However, the Shanghai Stock Exchange can only open accounts for  individuals who buy at least 10,000 yuan worth of bonds.    But the state will soon set up a treasury bond fund for the  convenience of small investors, he said.    He said the total amount of this year's state bonds will be  discussed and approved by the National People's Congress in  March.    Nonetheless, more than 70 percent of this year's total  issuance will be conducted in paperless bonds.    The state will still issue some amount of paper-note bonds,  mostly in three-year and five-year terms to sell in small cities  and towns which cannot be covered by the computer networks in  the Shanghai Stock Exchange, as well as in rural areas.</p>

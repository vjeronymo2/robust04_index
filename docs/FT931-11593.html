			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / People: Hawley resigns from HMH Mel Hawley has resigned as chief executive of Haden MacLellan Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, only a year after his promotion to the post. His responsibilities have been taken on by Harold Cottam, appointed chairman last September, and by the heads of the two main divisions, Clive Mayhead and Richard Taylor. Cottam says these two were 'almost joint managing directors' so it was difficult for the chief executive 'to add a great deal of value in operational terms'. As he, Cottam, had been brought in to help 'restore the group's fortunes, to look at its management structure and to transform its image in the City, it was difficult for the ceo to contribute in that area' either. He adds that Hawley, 47, lived in Yorkshire when the group's head office was in Surrey, and so he had 'become a little remote'. The parting was natural, with a reasonable settlement. Hawley, a chartered accountant whose links with companies that are now part of Haden MacLellan - notably London and Midland Industrials - go back more than 20 years, became chief executive in February last year when Philip Ling, his long-time leader, became non-executive chairman. Cottam, formerly managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young, is in the process of withdrawing from his remaining roles at the accountancy firm. He is spending most of his time with HMH, which last year saw its first-half pre-tax profit slide from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 2.4m and slashed its interim dividend. One of the chairman's goals is to recruit a financial director - a new post for HMH. Cottam says: 'In a sense everyone has been a finance director . . . and that's not the way to do it' - a neat piece of counter-culture when part of the Ling credo was: 'It doesn't matter who gets it right so long as someone does.'</p>

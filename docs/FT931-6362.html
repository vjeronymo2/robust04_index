			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Former head of merger task force joins Allen &amp; Overy - Legal Briefs MR COLIN Overbury, the outgoing director of the European Commission's merger task force, has joined the international London-based law firm Allen &amp; Overy as a consultant on competition issues. Mr Overbury, who qualified as a solicitor in 1955, joined the European Commission in 1973 and was put in charge of competition in mechanical, electrical and electronic industries in 1984. From 1986 to 1990 he was in charge of competition for financial services, media, telecommunications, information technology and all manufactured products including motor vehicles. In 1990, Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner, asked Mr Overbury to set up and head the merger task force. He is widely credited with its success in making important decisions within the tight deadlines of the EC Merger Regulation.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / GMB opposed to platforms for Tories Delegates at the GMB general union conference yesterday passed an emergency resolution calling on unions and the Trades Union Congress not to provide platforms for Conservative politicians. The vote was a blow to the TUC policy under Mr John Monks, general secretary, to seek a dialogue with the government. Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, said: 'There is a feeling in our union that the trade unions should not provide a platform anywhere for this deadbeat, lameduck government. 'Delegates have made a tactical decision. Why should we offer resuscitation to a government that is past recall?' Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, is expected to address a TUC full employment conference in July. Mr Steven Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, spoke three months ago to a TUC public services conference. The GMB's decision follows last Thursday's move by the TGWU general union to boycott the TUC's employment conference in July in pro-test at Mr Hunt's presence as well as that of Mr Howard Davis, the director-general of Confederation of British Industry.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Why the dollar may be oversold President Bill Clinton is right to argue there is something puzzling about the degree of downward pressure on the dollar. Currency crises usually erupt when an exchange rate has been held at an artificially high level for too long or when the economic outlook is clouded by some grave imbalance. Neither condition applies in the US today, so the dollar may prove more resilient than some 'gurus' expect. By most objective criteria the dollar is undervalued rather than overvalued, absurdly so in the case of the yen. And, as Mr Clinton has stressed, the economic fundamentals are mostly encouraging. The US economy has been growing since early 1991. Businesses are expanding industrial capacity: gross fixed investment rose 12 per cent in the year to the first quarter. Productivity growth and corporate profitability are impressive. And, although the prices of some commodities are rising, upward pressure on wages and consumer prices remains quite subdued. Some investors believe that growth prospects are better still in Europe and Japan, which are only just emerging from recession. But recovery in these regions could easily falter (as happened in the early stages of the US upturn), especially if the yen and D-mark soar to ridiculous levels. Currency volatility aside, it is rash to assume that returns on investment will exceed those in the US, where growth is so much better established. Pundits in small, open economies such as the UK under-estimate the US's ability to ride currency storms. The 'failure' of concerted intervention on Friday has not created a national crisis, as it might have done in Britain. The front pages of the Sunday Washington Post and New York Times contained no reference to the dollar. This reflects the instinctive view of most Americans that their economic futures will be determined mainly by their own efforts in this hemisphere. There is some concern that a falling dollar may push up long bond yields and hence mortgage rates. But most observers here are guessing that, with yields already 4-5 per cent in real terms, the bulk of the adjustment has already occurred. Trade (the average of imports and exports) accounts for only about 11 per of US national income, and much of that is with Canada and Mexico, nations whose currencies are closely linked to the dollar. The US thus thinks and acts much as the European Union would do if it ever manages to create a single currency. Much of the point of a single currency is to prevent Europe being buffeted by adverse international trends; the US has been in that happy condition for 200 years. But surely the US is vulnerable because it is a net international debtor, having run a trade deficit for many years? This is a small problem. The net debt is still tiny relative to the size of the US economy. The trade deficit has expanded sharply since last year but this mainly reflects growth differentials among the leading economies. This year it will reach only 2 per cent of GDP, far below the 3.5 per cent peak hit in the mid-1980s, and quite manageable in a world of mobile capital. Since US exports are likely to grow rapidly as growth accelerates in Japan and Europe, the deficit may shrink next year. Markets should also note that the Clinton administration is, finally, clarifying its policy on the dollar. Until recently traders assumed that if talks on opening the Japanese market were going badly, the US would favour a stronger yen as an alternative way of squeezing the Japanese. Sometimes senior officials directly encouraged such an interpretation: 'I'd like to see a stronger yen,' Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, told reporters at an infamous meeting at the National Press Club last year. That kind of rash talk is now history. The yen has appreciated 18 per cent since Mr Clinton took office - enough for anybody. Accordingly, in early May, Mr Bentsen said he saw 'no advantage in an undervalued currency'. Late on Friday afternoon, a senior Treasury official (no prizes for guessing whom) took the new policy one step further. The Clinton administration had intervened on Friday, he said, 'to demonstrate that it prefers a stronger dollar'. Underlining the point, he added: 'It is our view and the G7's that further appreciation of the mark and yen would be counter productive for global recovery.' It is safe to assume that Mr Bentsen will also soon speak of 'preferring' a stronger dollar. The US view is that Friday's intervention did not fail because it was intended to send a message rather than dramatically alter exchange rates. The message is that the US and its Group of Seven partners do not want the dollar to fall further. Markets, of course, are at liberty to ignore this advice. But if they do, US officials are unlikely to panic. The US lived through an extraordinary appreciation of the dollar in the mid-1980s; it is equally capable of handling an erratic depreciation. Indeed some officials probably regard depreciation as the lesser evil as it would accelerate the shift in resources from services to manufacturing. The Federal Reserve is less worried about dollar depreciation today than in the 'Carter crisis' of late 1970s because growth is solid and inflation is under much better control. There is little chance that the Fed will jack up interest rates sharply in order to 'defend' the currency. That would simply play into the hands of speculators who would never be satisfied. It is likely, instead, to focus mainly on the outlook for US inflation and growth. Rates will rise further, but as part of the measured tightening of monetary policy underway for domestic reasons.</p>

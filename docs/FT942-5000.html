			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Observer: Free love Tom Spencer is standing as the Tory party candidate for the Surrey constituency in the European elections on June 9. For some reason Spencer chooses to sign his election leaflet not 'yours', nor even 'yours sincerely' but 'love'. 'My starting point is that Surrey is geographically and industrially at the heart of Europe,' says Spencer's handout. Clearly a man fuelled by wishful thinking and desperate optimism; an ideal candidate for the Tories.</p>

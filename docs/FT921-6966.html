			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons renews terrorism measure AN incoming Labour government would seek an all-party consensus on new anti-terrorist legislation, Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, told the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes. Before the Commons voted on renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act Mr Kenneth Baker, dubbed 'the cheapest home secretary of this century' by Mr Hattersley, confirmed that the Conservative party would seek to make Labour's 'softness' on terrorism a central election issue. The home secretary suggested that Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, should overrule Mr Hattersley on whose initiative the opposition had embarked on the 'irresponsible' course of voting against extending the terrorism act. Mr Baker emphasised that it was the last Labour government that introduced the act, under which suspects can be detained for up to seven days for questioning, or deported from mainland Britain. Mr Hattersley said a Labour government would establish a judicial tribunal to determine whether the period a suspect could be detained should be extended from 48 hours to seven days. Labour would also retain the provisions under which the IRA and other terrorist groups could be proscribed, Mr Hattersley said. Renewal of the act for a further period was approved by a government majority of 185 (300-115). Editorial Comment, Page 18</p>

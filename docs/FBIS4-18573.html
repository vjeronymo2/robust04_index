			<p>BFN     [Text] With a unanimous decision, the National Council has  called on the UN Security Council to examine effective  alternative ways to promote a Cyprus solution based on the  principles of international law. The National Council position  is included in a joint statement issued this afternoon following  the council's two-hour meeting chaired by President Glavkos  Kliridhis. The president briefed the members of the National  Council on the latest developments in the Cyprus issue in view  of the UN secretary general's report on the direction of the  proximity talks.    The joint statement notes that the National Council wants to  express its displeasure and disappointment with the Butrus-Ghali  report to the Security Council. The statement adds that the  National Council affirmed that the negative Turkish stance and  lack of political will for a Cyprus solution, which make  continuation of the dialogue unproductive, were ignored.    Replying to a question after the National Council meeting,  government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that President  Kliridhis will decide how to handle the issue when such a  decision becomes necessary. Asked what President Kliridhis will  do by the end of April and whether he will receive the UN  secretary general's representatives to continue the proximity  talks, the spokesman referred to the president's statement  issued yesterday according to which he does not accept  discussion of new documents or new amendments to the existing  documents. Referring to the political leadership's trip to  Athens to coordinate with the Greek Government, an issue raised  by every political leader at the National Council meeting, the  spokesman said the government does not object to the visit. He  added that the time for such a meeting would be decided after  consultations between the two governments.    Reliable information obtained by CyBC [the Cyprus  Broadcasting Corporation] notes that in the letter he will send  to the UN secretary general, President Kliridhis stresses that  he will accept no discussion of any new document or new  amendments to the latest UN document of 21 March. Kliridhis  notes that he accepts that document as it is. He emphasizes  that the Security Council should proceed to examine alternative  ways to implement its decisions.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GERMANYS BEGIN UNIFICATION TALKS;  </P> <P> MEETINGS WITH WORLD WAR II VICTORS TO START NEXT WEEK  </P> <P> The two Germanys today began preliminary unification talks, preparing for next  week's meeting with the four World War II allies on German unity.  </P> <P> Ernst Krabatsch, East Germany's deputy foreign minister, was meeting with  Dieter Kastrup, head of the political department at West Germany's Foreign  Ministry. They declined to comment to reporters.  </P> <P> The election commission, meanwhile, said 24 political parties will contest East  Germany's first free elections on March 18, the ADN news agency said.  </P> <P> Commission spokeswoman Petra Blaess said the final list includes the  Communists, now renamed the Party for Democratic Socialism; the Social  Democrats; the liberal Free Democrats; and the Alliance for Germany, a  conservative coalition backed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian  Democratic Union.  </P> <P> East Germany's 12.2 million eligible voters will seat a new Parliament with 400  members, 100 fewer than the current People's Chamber.  </P> <P> Today's discussions are part of the so-called "two-plus-four" formula of  unification negotiations agreed to in Ottawa last month. Under that formula the  two German nations are to discuss the domestic aspects of unification.  </P> <P> On Wednesday in Bonn, the two Germanys are scheduled to meet with low-level  officials from the four World War II victors -- the Soviet Union, the United  States, Britain and France -- for initial talks on how unification would affect  European security and the concerns of other nations.  </P> <P> Although the talks come barely a week before March 18 elections that are  expected to remove East Germany's Communist government from power, the East  Berlin government is carrying out the dialogue with the approval of 15 other  parties.  </P> <P> The four World War II powers have given their blessing to the idea of German  unification, but enormous problems need to be overcome.  </P> <P> One of the thorniest stems from Moscow's insistence that a united Germany not  be a NATO member. Kohl on Thursday reassured NATO members in Brussels of West  Germany's wish for the new country to remain in the Western alliance.  </P> <P> "We will continue talks on all levels. Nobody need fear Germany will go its own  way," he said.  </P> <P> In addition, Poland on Thursday reiterated its demand for a role in the talks,  despite a vote by West Germany's Parliament that a united Germany should honor  Poland's western border. About a third of Poland was German territory before  World War II.  </P> <P> Kohl has come under fire abroad and at home for his previous reluctance to  unequivocally state that a united Germany would never lay claim to land ceded  to Poland after the Third Reich's 1945 defeat.  </P> <P> Kohl, apparently trying to avoid offending conservative voters before federal  elections in December, had insisted that only the government of a united  Germany could address the matter.  </P></p>

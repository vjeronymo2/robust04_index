			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Housing trust to buy 400 homes PEABODY TRUST, London's biggest charitable housing trust, plans to spend Pounds 23m during the next four months buying 400 homes from residents in Croydon, Greenwich, Wandsworth and Westminster. The purchases are part of the Pounds 750m scheme to buy empty properties, announced in the Autumn Statement. Peabody is one of 27 housing associations chosen to share the first tranche of Pounds 577m. Peabody said yesterday it was interested in talking to owners of freehold homes whose properties were in excellent condition. It did not rule out buying empty new houses or repossessed homes. The trust added that repossessed homes were often in a poor state of repair because of the financial position of former owners.</p>

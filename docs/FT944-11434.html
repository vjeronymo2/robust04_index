			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Drunk as a philosopher: Fancy a quick drink? Socrates was your man Fancy a quick one after work? Think very carefully about it, for you will either be substantially decreasing your chances of succumbing to heart disease, or you will be stumbling on a slippery slope which leads inexorably to cancers and chronic liver complaints, dependence, violence and crime. There is, it would seem, no middle way. This week's tiff between the World Health Organisation and a couple of reputable British scientists over the effects of alcohol consumption has severely dented our confidence in that most insidious of myths, that the moderate embrace of a vice can turn into a virtue. Fancy a quick one after work? It used to be such an innocent question, easily considered and quickly answered, perhaps a brief consultation with the crumpled railway timetable, a swift call home, but no more. That such an inquiry could now lead us straight into pained calculations on mortality and even (after a couple to warm up) the after-life is an unhappy indictment of our positivistic culture which claims to know so much more than it does. The WHO is, to be fair, only doing its job. It believes genuinely that there is 'no minimum threshold below which alcohol can be consumed without any risk'; its message to the world is a catchy 'The less you drink, the better', which I can just see jostling in the global consciousness with the glossy Martini ads and lurid billboards of young, semi-naked bodies imbibing various versions of the hard stuff. I wonder what the Greeks would have made of it. They liked a drink, although you would hardly know it listening to the sanctimonious claims made on behalf of their culture. I have always asked myself why people are only too happy to quote the ancient world when they are discussing subjects of gravitas, such as the nature of beauty or the appeal of democracy, but ignore what John Stuart Mill would have called the pursuit of the baser pleasures which took up so much of their time. For the fact is that all that contemplation of the virtuous life and the philosophical intrigues of existence was undertaken in an alcoholic fog the likes of which would send our dear old friends at the WHO diving into their glasses of mineral water in fright. Consider the evidence: the comic poet Eubolos gave a pithy account of his own health advice to contemporaries: 'Three kraters only do I mix for the temperate - one to health, which they empty first, the second to love and pleasure, the third to sleep.' So far, so good. 'When this is drunk up, wise guests go home. The fourth krater is ours no longer, but belongs to insults, the fifth to uproar, the sixth to drunken revel, the seventh to black eyes. The eighth is the policeman's, the ninth belongs to vomiting, and the tenth to madness and hurling the furniture.' Whoops, sounds like we are on that slippery slope. When one considers that a krater held about 14 litres of naturally fermented wine, admittedly diluted with water, which serviced a gathering of about seven couches (two, of course, to a couch), we get some idea of what these sessions involved. After the talk was finished, the group would go on a ritual drunken revel (komos) during which they would parade through the streets, singing and dancing, assaulting passers-by and damaging property. All this in the name of Dionysus, though it might as well have been Arsenal. The respect for the joys of the grape can clearly be seen in Plato's Symposium, when the drunken roar of Alcibiades threatens to disrupt the hitherto civilised discourse on the meaning of love. 'Will you welcome into your company a man who is already drunk?' he asks his colleagues; not only do they welcome him, they ask him to contribute to their musings. At the end of his contribution, the party fizzles out in 'general uproar, all order was abolished and deep drinking became the rule'. This is not to champion the cause of drink, nor to persuade any of you to stay behind for a quick one at the end of your next working day. That would be irresponsible. But the association of love, beauty, truth and drunkenness has a history which goes a little deeper than the oracular verdicts of today's scientists, and we would do well to bear that in mind too.</p>

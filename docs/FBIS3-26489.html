Reportedly,  after he arrived in Shanghai late last year, he occasionally  went out. In addition to visiting some places in Shanghai, he  also made a tour to Suzhou and Wuxi.    According to reports by some Shanghai newspapers, on 23  December 1993, Deng Xiaoping inspected Yangpu Bridge in the  company of Deng Xiaoping [as published]. [Hong Kong TA KUNG PAO  in Chinese 8 February 94 page two carries a similar report which  asserts that "on 13 December 1993, accompanied by his beloved  daughter Mao Mao, Deng Xiaoping inspected the Yangpu Bridge in  Shanghai."] There, he got out of the car and walked on the  bridge. He also visited the Bund. On New Year's Day, he came  to the New Jinjiang Hotel.    Reportedly, Shanghai municipal leaders reported Shanghai's  recent development situation to Deng Xiaoping, who expressed  satisfaction at Shanghai's developments and changes.    Most members of Deng Xiaoping's family are now also in  Shanghai, accompanying old Deng. His eldest son Deng Pufang  appeared on a public occasion on 4 February.    For the last few years, Deng Xiaoping was used to spending  the Chinese New Year holiday in Shanghai. It is expected that  he will also stay in Shanghai in the coming Chinese New Year.</p>

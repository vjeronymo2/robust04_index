			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Salvation Army probe widens FRAUD SQUAD detectives have flown to Luxembourg as part of a continuing investigation into a Pounds 6.2m alleged fraud against the Salvation Army, the world's largest voluntary organisation. Detectives are understood to be seeking details of Pounds 4m missing from the charity's funds which were supposed to be frozen in a Luxembourg bank account. It is thought that the police investigation has made little progress since it arrested and subsequently bailed Mr Stuart Ford, a Birmingham businessman alleged, in a civil action brought by the Salvation Army, to be at the centre of the fraud. Mr Ford denies any wrongdoing. The Salvation Army said yesterday that it remained determined to do everything possible to recover the missing funds, but was in the meantime being forced to reorganise its internal funding arrangements to deal with the anticipated shortfall in its accounts. Profits generated by Reliance, the Salvation Army in-house bank, by Sagic, the charity's insurance arm, and by Salvation Army Publishing and Supplies, are to be used more directly in supporting social projects. The reorganisation of the charity's internal funding arrangements was ordered by the Salvation Army's board of trustees, which is chaired by Commissioner Dinsdale Pender. The Charity Commission meanwhile said that it was continuing its investigation of the affair, although the Salvation Army believes a final report will not be ready until early next year. In April the charity dismissed one of its top officials, and moved three others to new jobs at the end of its own internal investigation into the alleged fraud. It said there was no suspicion of dishonesty by any of the disciplined people.</p>

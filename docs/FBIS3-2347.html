			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's  Gansu Province has slightly increased its cultivated area over  the past five years, a local government official said here today.    The gain comes from a consistent policy of protecting  farmland and an active approach to reclaiming wasteland.    He said that since 1989 about 33,367 ha of farmland had been  taken over for non-agriculture construction in the province,  while 46,953 ha of wasteland had been reclaimed.    Though its per capita possession of farmland is 0.16 ha,  about one third higher than the national average, expanding  cities and towns had been nibbling away cultivated area by some  20,000 ha -- almost a mid-sized county -- a year in the early  1980s.    To arrest the decrease in its cultivated area, the  provincial  government issued a series of laws and policies, according to  which, taking any land for construction purpose had to be  approved by, and only by, the land administration.    The provincial government also ruled that performance in  land  administration would be an important aspect of assessing the  work of local governments.    The more than 60 development areas of the province were  subjected to a review, and those with scant investment were  declassified, so that the land could be cultivated again.    Over the years, the province also uncovered 1,494 cases in  which construction projects had gone ahead without proper  approval for use of land.    Meanwhile, the province has been encouraging farmers to  reclaim wild land. Newly-developed farmland is used by the  reclaimer and is immune from agricultural tax for the first  three years.    In another development, 57 counties in the province have  completed the setting up of "farmland protection areas," a  program aimed to subject to protection those farmlands that are  considered essential to its grain production, the official added.</p>

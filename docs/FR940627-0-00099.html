			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gouania vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was first collected on dry hills in the district of Waianai [Waianae] during the U.S. Exploring Expedition in 1840. Asa Gray was given the task of preparing a report on all of the foreign plants collected by the expedition. Of the two volumes he produced concerning these specimens, only one was published, and in it  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was described as a new species (Gray 1854). The species epithet was derived from the Latin  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vitis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a vine or grapevine, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> folium <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , leaf, as the toothed leaves of this species resemble those of the grape. The Maui Island population of this species, first collected above Lahaina on West Maui by Edward F. Bishop, probably in the 1870s, was described and named  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. bishopii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in honor of its discoverer by William Hillebrand (1888). In his monograph of the genus, St. John (1969) described  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. hawaiiensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a new species based upon a collection made in the Kau District of Hawaii Island in 1853 by Jules Remy. Both of these taxa are currently considered synonyms of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gouania vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a member of the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae), is a climbing shrub or woody vine with tendrils. Leaves are papery in texture with a moderate to dense covering of short, soft hairs on both surfaces. The leaves are elliptic to broadly oval in outline with toothed or lobed margins and 1.2 to 3.2 in. (3 to 8 cm) long by 0.8 to 1.9 in. (2 to 4.8 cm) wide. Flowers are arranged in axillary spikes 0.3 to 2.8 in. (0.8 to 7 cm) long. The flowers are small with sepals and petals ranging from 0.03 to 0.04 in. (0.7 to 1.1 mm) in length. Both the sepals and petals are white. The 2- or 3-winged fruit are about 0.4 in. (9 to 10 mm) long. Seeds are oval, glossy, dark brown, and about 0.1 to 0.2 in. (3.4 to 5 mm) long. This species is the only Hawaiian member of the genus with tendrils and toothed leaf margins (St. John 1969, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was known from West Maui, the Kau District of the island of Hawaii, and the northwestern portion of the Waianae Mountains in Makaleha, Keaau, and Waianae Kai Valleys (Degener and Greenwell 1947, HHP 1992c1 to 1992c5, St John 1969, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). A single population of five individuals was discovered in 1990 on the slopes of Waianae Kai Ridge on State-owned land (Anon. 1991, HHP 1992c5). The five plants are close to one another, growing in a single patch in a forest of mostly naturalized, non-native taxa (HHP 1992c5), and may represent clones of a single individual (Joel Lau, HHP, pers. comm., 1992). A second, smaller patch was discovered near the first, and probably represents a second clone. Information is scant, but data from herbarium labels indicate that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  prefers dry, rocky ridges and slopes in dry shrubland or dry to mesic forests at an elevation of about 2,000 ft (610 m). Associated taxa include strawberry guava, kukui, Christmas berry, huehue haole, and mamaki (HHP 1992c5). The major threats to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are competition from alien plant taxa such as strawberry guava and Christmas berry, habitat destruction by feral pigs, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of extant individuals, all of which may be genetically identical (HHP 1992c5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diellia unisora <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was considered threatened and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gouania vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was considered extinct in that document. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant species named therein. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant species.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gouania vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was considered endangered in the proposed rule, but  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. unisora <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as a threatened species, was not included. The list of 1,700 plant species was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gouania vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was included as a Category 1* species on all three notices of review. Category 1* species are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats in the recent past, but which may have already become extinct. Because a population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. vitifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was discovered in 1990, it is considered herein for listing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diellia unisora <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was considered a Category 1 species on the 1980 and 1985 notices, but was changed to a Category 1* species on the 1990 notice. Category 1 species are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea grimesiana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> obatae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  first appeared on the 1990 notice, as a category 2 species. Category 2 species are those for which there is some evidence of vulnerability, but for which there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the time. Additional recently acquired biological information supports listing of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. grimesiana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> obatae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The September 30, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 51143) notice of review indicated all three of these species were proposed for listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

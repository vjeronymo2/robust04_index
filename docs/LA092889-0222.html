			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UKRAINE PARTY BOSS REPLACED  </P> <P> Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev oversaw the firing of the last major  Brezhnev-era holdover today as Ukrainian Communist leaders removed hard-line  party boss Vladimir Shcherbitsky and ended his 17 years of iron rule in the  southern republic.  </P> <P> The Ukrainian Communist Party's Central Committee chose Vladimir Ivashko to  replace Shcherbitsky as first secretary of the republic's party apparatus, Tass  press agency said.  </P> <P> Shcherbitsky, 71, was retired from the ruling Communist Party Politburo on  Sept. 20 in a move that cemented Gorbachev's hold on the party, and  Shcherbitsky's removal as Ukrainian party chief had been widely expected.  </P> <P> Other than Gorbachev himself, he was the last Politburo member from the days of  now-discredited former President Leonid I. Brezhnev and was widely regarded as  one of the most conservative forces on the Politburo.  </P> <P> Ivashko, the No. 2 Ukrainian party leader, was pitted in a secret ballot  against another party official, Stanislav Gurenko, Tass said. It did not say  what the vote total was, but it said Ivashko received solid support from  Ukrainian regional party chiefs who participated in the balloting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Backer of Reforms  </P> <P> Analysts say that Gorbachev probably has been a patron of Ivashko's for some  time and that his writings indicate he is a firm backer of the Soviet leader's  reforms.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's decision to participate personally in the meeting showed the  significance he attached to making the change. The party's general secretary  would not ordinarily be present for the changing of a republic party chief.  </P> <P> Two years ago Gorbachev went to a Moscow city party committee meeting to fire  maverick Boris Yeltsin, and he traveled to Leningrad in July to retire that  city's party chief, Yuri F. Solovyev, who had been defeated when he ran  unopposed for a seat in the new national Parliament.  </P> <P> Ukrainian reformers blame Shcherbitsky for squelching dissent and holding back  Gorbachev's economic reforms in the nation's breadbasket.  </P></p>

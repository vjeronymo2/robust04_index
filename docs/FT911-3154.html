			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Red faces as Spain's socialists air their differences THE British Chancellor's remarks about car telephones being a modern day scourge came true in Madrid yesterday, when the entire pious panoply of Spanish politics seeped unceremoniously out of a cellular telephone belonging to Mr Txiki Benegas, the third most powerful man in the governing Socialist Party. Meet 'the dwarf' (Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga), 'el One' (Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez), and 'el Catalan' (his deputy, Mr Narcis Serra). On April 18 Mr Benegas, administrative director of the socialist party, was in his car when he made, or received, two calls from party associates during which they talked about forthcoming local elections and Mr Solchaga's dismissal of a party proposal to finance cheap mortgages for poor homebuyers by making banks set aside funds for the project. The issue had poisoned already delicate relations between Mr Solchaga and the party and an embarrassed Mr Gonzalez, who also thought the party's idea a poor one. As is possible with cellular networks, the conversations were picked up and Spaniards spent most of yesterday listening to them on a commercial radio station. Caller: 'What is Solchaga trying to do? He is going to destroy our election strategy  .. Why? He wants to go into a general election with a new team in Ferraz (party headquarters in Madrid). He's not stupid.' Benegas: 'No, he's not stupid. I'll tell you about how cocky he gets with me  . (but) the problem here isn't Solchaga, its with 'el One'.' The caller then goes on to say that it is no longer just a personal problem between Mr Solchaga and Mr Alfonso Guerra, a sworn political enemy and former deputy prime minister who is still deputy party leader. 'If the Catalan starts opining as well he'll do it much more carefully, if at all.' Benegas: 'No, no, the Catalan is on the fence .. what the Catalan knows is that the problem that this government has is, precisely, The Dwarf.' Mr Benegas said the broadcasting of his conversations were a form of 'telephonic terrorism' and proved no Spaniard was safe any more. Mr Solchaga, cornered by reporters, was laughing too hard to say more than that he did not take the remarks seriously. But it is becoming increasingly clear that the fight between Mr Solchaga and the party is widening into one between the government and party and that Mr Gonzalez will have to act forcefully to stop it. Senior party officials, who regard Mr Solchaga as too conservative, have been trying to trip him up for more than a year.</p>

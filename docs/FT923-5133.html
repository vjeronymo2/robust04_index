			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Premier of South Australia resigns THE growing problems of the Australian Labor party were underlined yesterday when Mr John Bannon, premier of South Australia, resigned in the wake of ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) losses incurred by a state-owned bank. Mr Bannon has been under pressure since it emerged last year that property lending by State Bank of South Australia would cost taxpayers ADollars 2.5bn, later increased to ADollars 3.15bn. His departure after 10 years as premier may also mark the end of a decade when Labor enjoyed uninterrupted control of the federal government and dominated the six state governments. Mr Bannon was one of a group of Labor leaders who rescued the party after Mr Gough Whitlam's federal Labor government was defeated in a constitutional crisis in 1975. The group included Mr Bob Hawke, prime minister from 1983 to 1991, and Mr Neville Wran, Mr John Cain and Mr Brian Burke, respectively premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. All have left office in the wake of declining popularity.</p>

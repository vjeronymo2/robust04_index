			<p>BFN     [Text] From 27 to 29 April, Liu Ronghui, deputy secretary  of the provincial party committee, went to a series of rural  areas and factories in Anzhai and Xian, and in the (Yancheng)  oil deposit administration to conduct investigations and study.  On the afternoon of 29 April, after hearing the report  submitted by the Yanan Prefectural CPC Committee and  administrative office, Liu Ronghui said: The ongoing fiscal and  tax reform touches on a wide range of endeavors. We should  strive to meet the requirements of the reform, seek new tax  funds in line with the new requirements, and properly handle the  relationship between the state, the local enterprises, and the  individuals, with the stress on the active disposition of new  tax funds. State income tax comes mainly from state-owned and  individual enterprises. We should pay close attention to the  collection of the business tax from tertiary industrial  undertakings and [words indistinct] tax. We should approach tax  collection from a strategic prospective. We should carry out  tax collection work efficiently and at an early date, otherwise  we will fall behind and suffer great losses. In this regard, we  should place great stress on the smooth transition of the new  taxation system and should institute and improve tax collection  work at the departmental level as soon as possible. On one  hand, we should upgrade and readjust tax collection and  management, and on the other hand, [words indistinct].    When discussing Yanan's oil exploitation, Liu Ronghui said:  One should not think that one will make a name for himself as  long as he has resources or the one will have nothing to do as  long as the state takes care of his resources. Both unrealistic  optimism and pessimism are wrong. We should take the road of  developing the oil industry by exploiting oil through reliance  on the policy set by the provincial authorities. In light of  Yanan's actual conditions, we should consider the development  orientation of oil from the angle of the market economy, promote  the transformation from commodity type to commodity-operation  type and from fuel type to fuel [words indistinct] type. In  refining, we should coordinate with colleges and universities,  large enterprises, and scientific research institutes.    As for the issue of coal, when put on the market, coal  should  be priced appropriately. If we set too high a price, we will be  unable to sell it, but if we set too low a price for coal, we  will suffer losses in operation. We should energetically  develop a diversified economy and [words indistinct].</p>

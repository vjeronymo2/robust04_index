			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown attacks BES 'misuse' LABOUR YESTERDAY called for immediate action to end 'misuse' of business expansion schemes as it stepped up its attacks on the government for not standing up to the banks and big business. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, targeted BES-linked schemes which he said could cost the Treasury Pounds 400m and was making 'the misery of the repossessed homeless into a tax-avoidance opportunity for top-rate taxpayers and the banking establishment'. Claiming that BES companies launched in the last 10 days alone would cost the Treasury Pounds 160m, Mr Brown promised that Labour would try to put a stop to them by tabling amendments to the post-Budget Finance Bill if the government did not act. Mr Brown said the failure of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to take action against lending institutions - typically banks and building societies  -was either 'incompetence or a failure to stand up to the vested interests close to the Conservative party'. Under the business expansion scheme lending institutions with repossessed properties on their books are able to transfer the property to a BES company, which then rents it out for five years before selling it back to the original lender. Investors buy shares in the BES company, receiving tax relief of 40p in the pound if they pay income tax at the top rate, making an effective net investment of 60p. Six months later the institution makes loans of typically 74p for each pound invested. Shares in the BES company are the only security for the loan and there is no recourse to the investor's other assets.</p>

Significant progress has been made at  talks on national reconciliation. Despite this, the Luanda  regime and the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, oppose the much desired peace for  Angola. The communists, led by Eduardo dos Santos, use the  talks to resort to Machiavellian practices to make the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] disappear  from the Angolan political scene, beginning with the  assassination of UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi and  other UNITA officials.    This was, at least, what MPLA-PT ideologue Lucio Lara said  in  Strasbourg, France, four days ago, and UNITA will be protesting  to the United Nations about such underhanded and barbarous  views. UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim  has had this to say about it:    [Begin Valentim recording] The UNITA team to the Lusaka  peace  talks has rejected with repulsion the remarks made against UNITA  President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi and other UNITA officials  by MPLA baron Mr. Lucio Lara, who is a deputy to the National  Assembly on behalf of the party currently in power in Angola.  Coming as they do at a time when national reconciliation is  being discussed, Mr. Lara's remarks put the Lusaka peace talks  at great risk. The UNITA team to the Lusaka talks cannot  believe that the talks will go well if the government fails to  clarify its real intentions. It would be naive for UNITA to  believe in national reconciliation while gallows intended for  UNITA officials are being put in Luanda. The UNITA team to the  Lusaka peace talks intends to protest energetically to the  mediation and the observers on this matter. [end recording]</p>

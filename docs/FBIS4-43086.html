			<p>BFN     [Text] What are Washington's intentions toward Greece  regarding its relations with Turkey and the problem with Skopje  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]?    This question is becoming particularly significant at a time  when a dialogue with Ankara is being manipulated and U.S.  Presidential envoy Matthew Nimetz has begun a new round of  contacts in Athens and Skopje.    According to reliable information ELEVTHEROTIPIA received  from official lips, the current U.S. position is as follows:    1. Relations with Turkey. It is necessary to break the ice.  Although "Attila's" [the Turkish troops in Cyprus] presence in  Cyprus is a fact, the two countries can begin meetings and reach  agreements on secondary issues (tourism for example). This will  make bilateral relations easier and will benefit both countries.  It will also remove a factor of tension in the Balkans.  (Regarding the Cyprus issue, the United States admits that in  the past few years it has more or less "forgotten" it and it is  not among the top issues of concern).    2. The Skopje Issue. The problem focuses on the name issue.  The United States considers all the rest--symbols,  constitution--as subsidiary. It stresses emphatically that both  sides must show flexibility [previous word in English]; but  because Greece is the strongest, richest, and most stable  country in the Balkans, it should be the one "to make the first  step."    In addition to the above "advice," the United States  stresses  that in no case should Greece consider it an alternative to  relations with the European Union [EU]. It stresses: "We are  friends with Greece and all of the EU member states."    The United States implies that it does not make concessions  to any country, especially Greece.    This "advice" was expressed after--and obviously  during--U.S.  President Bill Clinton's meeting with Greek Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou in Washington.</p>

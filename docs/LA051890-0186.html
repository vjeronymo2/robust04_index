			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLOCH SURVEILLANCE DATA OKD FOR HEARING;  </P> <P> STATE DEPT. CAN USE INFORMATION IN MOVE TO FIRE SUSPECTED SPY  </P> <P> The State Department today won the right to use evidence gathered through  electronic surveillance in proceedings to dismiss suspected spy Felix S. Bloch  from the Foreign Service.  </P> <P> A federal judge said in an order released today that the electronic  surveillances were conducted lawfully under the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris rejected a contention by Bloch's attorneys  that the surveillances were illegal and could not be used in the State  Department dismissal hearing.  </P> <P> The proceeding had been scheduled to begin last week but was postponed pending  court action on the case.  </P> <P> While not charged with any crime, Bloch has been suspected by the FBI of  selling secrets to the Soviet Union when he was posted in Europe as a diplomat,  most recently at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna.  </P> <P> Bloch, a 30-year veteran of the diplomatic corps, was placed on administrative  leave last June after the investigation began.  </P> <P> On Feb. 8, the State Department said it had suspended Bloch's annual salary of  $80,700 and would seek to dismiss him from the Foreign Service.  </P> <P> The FBI conducted extensive surveillance of Bloch last summer while the case  was under active investigation.  </P> <P> The surveillance ended late last year after the bureau decided it was unlikely  it could prove that Bloch passed classified information to the Soviet Union,  according to law enforcement sources.  </P></p>

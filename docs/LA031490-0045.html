			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: RUSSIAN DRESSING  </P> <P> THE MOVIE: "The Hunt for Red October"  </P> <P> THE SET-UP: Tom Clancy's pre-Gorbachev thriller about a defecting Soviet  submarine captain, Marko Ramius (Sean Connery) and the American voice of reason  CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin), is the basis of the movie. But this is no  update on "The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming." No comrades, the  submarine carrying the pensive, brilliant Capt. Ramius is a top-of-the-line  typhoon-class sub able to travel without a telltale sonar echo. Which comes in  real handy when avoiding those speed traps near Thor's Twins off the coast of  Iceland. Needless to say, this ship (the Red October of the movie's title)  becomes the hottest, most sought-after vehicle in the Greater North Atlantic.  Sorta like an ocean-going Miata.  </P> <P> THE LOOK: Uniformly speaking, it's the basic, monochromatic, no-nonsense look  from the American military Establishment: khaki shirts and slacks above the  waterline, and in the belly of the American sub in hot pursuit, it's a little  more Navy: navy blues, denim shirts and even a little J. Crew, with white  turtlenecks under the officers' jackets. We've seen it all a thousand times.  But those Soviets: ahh, a little more romance, a little more stylish flair.  Connery looks like Russia's last czar with his l-o-o-n-g buzz cut,  distinguished beard, and severe, cobalt blue tunic jacket with a stand-up  collar. His officers are dressed similarly, their chests aglow with combat  ribbons and medals and the shine of brass buttons. The lesser seamen wear navy  blue and stripes. Co-star Baldwin tries for a typical bureaucratic, rumpled  look: slacks, white shirts, and at one point, a purloined Navy officer's dress  uniform. Russians win the style war, hands down.  </P> <P> THE LABELS: For the U.S. Navy, especially the khaki, the source was Army-Navy  surplus. The rest of the uniforms (500 of them) were handmade by costumers  under the film's wardrobe supervisor, Jim Tyson. The Russian uniforms were  based on what Tyson could find among collectors who had Russian paraphernalia.  "We Hollywooded it up some. It's not that the Russian uniforms are incorrect,  it's just something they'd be more likely to wear in an office or for dress.  What they really wear on submarines is blue fatigue jumpers. More like a  janitorial jumper than anything." The most difficult thing to get was the  Russian insignia and braids for the uniforms. "Believe it or not," Tyson said,  "the Mainland Chinese make the insignia for the real Russian Army. However,  Chinese New Year occurred right before we had to start shooting, and they  celebrate for weeks! We got the stuff literally the day before we began!" SUE  MARTIN  </P></p>

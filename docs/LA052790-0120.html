			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> SEPARATED AT BIRTH: Imitation is definitely the most sincere form of flattery,  especially if you're trying to make a name in rock radio (where everybody's  always sincere). So it hardly came as a surprise Monday to hear KLOS-FM morning  sensations Mark &amp; Brian blast a pair of Seattle deejays who've promoted  their KPLZ-FM morning show with a billboard-ad campaign picturing the duo as  8-year-old kids.  </P> <P> That's right -- almost the exact same ad campaign Mark &amp; Brian have been  using to hype their show. Instead of getting mad, Mark &amp; Brian got even.  After recruiting a lawyer from their audience of morning commuters, M&amp;B  impishly phoned the Seattle morning team of Kent &amp; Alan and read them the  riot act, hanging up only after their "attorney" had aired a blustery fusillade  of obscure legal threats.  </P> <P> Was the threat real or just Mark &amp; Brian-style Memorex? "No, we aren't  really going to sue them," acknowledged KLOS program director Carey Curelop.  "If we were, you certainly wouldn't hear about it on the Mark &amp; Brian Show.  But it's amazing. There are several stations that are using our campaign, with  children's photo-style pictures of their deejays." Curelop was most impressed  by the quick response from L.A. legal eagles. "We had five lawyers call from  their car phones, all offering their services for free. We thought the free  part was pretty hysterical -- and very much out of character."  </P></p>

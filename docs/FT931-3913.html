			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Chinese vice-president dies General Wang Zhen, a hardline member of the Chinese leadership, died yesterday, on the eve of the National People's Congress, or parliament, which is expected to urge speedier economic liberalisation and further entrench reformists in power, Tony Walker writes from Beijing. Gen Wang, 84 and a veteran of the Communists' 'Long March', was vice president, a largely ceremonial role. However, he remained active behind the scenes, and until quite recently was opposing what he considered hasty liberalisation.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Cable News Network will begin direct broadcasts in Moscow by the end of the  summer via an agreement with the Soviet television authority, Gosteleradio.  "The service is designed primarily for hotels, businesses, governmental  agencies, international apartment buildings. But it also will be available to  Soviet citizens who want to pay for it," said Robert Wussler, executive vice  president of Turner Broadcasting System, CNN's parent company. The signal will  be scrambled, not to deny access to Soviet citizens but to make sure that those  receiving CNN paid for it. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

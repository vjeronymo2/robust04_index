Sarkozy, who is also budget minister, said a total of 40  tonnes of drugs were seized in 1993, including 38 tonnes of  cannabis resin, 1.28 tonnes of cocaine and more than 230  kilograms (464.6 lbs) of heroin.    He added that the French customs had helped the customs  services of several foreign countries to seize more than 33  tonnes of drugs "through intensive exchange of information and  coordinated operations."    The minister said it was difficult to tell if the customs  service was working more efficiently or whether there had been a  rise in drug smuggling. "In any case, this demonstrates an  extremely preoccupying situation," Sarkozy said.</p>

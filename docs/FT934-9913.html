			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Consumer demand fuels economic recovery GROWING EVIDENCE that consumer demand is proving the main prop of economic growth in Britain was supported yesterday by news that net lending to consumers more than doubled in September to the highest figure for more than 3 1/2 years. But a survey today by the Confederation of British Industry of trading conditions in UK high streets does nothing to alleviate the picture of a patchy and hesitant recovery. In the first of a series of official figures to be published in the three weeks to the November 30 Budget, the Central Statistical Office said net borrowing by consumers from building societies, finance houses and on credit cards operated by the Visa and Mastercard systems jumped to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 489m in September from Pounds 225m in August. The increase was partly the result of higher net lending to consumers by finance houses, which analysts believe reflected aggressive credit sales campaigns by car manufacturers. In addition, there was a turnround in credit card borrowing, with a net Pounds 89m repayment by consumers in August followed by net borrowing of Pounds 106m in September. The Treasury welcomed the figures as 'consistent with the continued upward trend in consumer spending'. But the CBI, in its October survey of the retail, wholesale and motor trades warned that sales in the high street, while growing, were below normal for the time of the year, falling short of expectations. The CBI reported that while sales in Britain's shops and department stores increased last month, the growth rate was below rates recorded during the summer. The survey suggests that retailers expect sales to grow more strongly in the year to November, but Mr Nigel Whittaker, the chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said: 'Consumer uncertainty about the impact of the forthcoming Budget could dampen high street trade over the coming weeks.' The absence of a strong upturn was underlined by producer price data released yesterday which showed that inflationary pressures in Britain's factories remained subdued last month. The CSO reported that the increase in the price index for sales in the UK of manufactured goods dropped to 4 per cent in the 12 months to October from 4.2 per cent in the year to September. Prices for raw materials and fuel purchased by industry fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.1 per cent between September and October. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The figures indicate the recovery is continuing, without the appearance of undue cost pressures.'

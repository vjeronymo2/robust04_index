			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Royal Bank may face legal action BIFU, the banking union, was yesterday considering legal action against Royal Bank of Scotland for allegedly breaching agreed procedures for suspending staff. The dispute over pay has developed into a wrangle on whether staff are entitled to withdraw from overtime they normally work. Last night the two sides disputed the number of staff on suspension. Bifu said more than 40 staff, including some in Edinburgh, had been told to stay away from work. The bank said 26 staff were still refusing to work overtime and that the action was restricted to central Glasgow.</p>

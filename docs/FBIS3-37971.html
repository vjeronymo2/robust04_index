The accord had been under negotiation for one and a half  years. Lithuania and Poland completed the talks Tuesday in  Warsaw.    So far there have been no reports as to the exact formulas  chosen to mention the 1920-39 occupation of Vilnius and its  region by Poland.    Vaclovas Domarkas, Lithuanian deputy minister of foreign  affairs, said after the fifth and final round of talks that the  treaty includes "historic moments which trouble us, but no  specific names or dates."

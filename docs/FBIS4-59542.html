			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible official source has rebutted the lies  and fabrications 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the war criminal, the leader  of the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] command, and the killer of children and women in  defenseless cities, made at a news conference the day before  yesterday. The source emphasized that everything he said is the  figment of the imagination of a man who has been overwhelmed by  the thirst for absolute power since the era of the one-party  dictatorship and a man who is fond of statements that emanate  from the complex of leadership and abhorrent megalomania.    The source explained that it is uprising and ironic that the  deposed al-Bid speaks about legitimacy and delivers legal  opinions about it, he who has been divested of legitimacy after  he refused to comply with the people's will and accept the  results of the legislative elections on 27 April 1993, to be  sworn in before the House of Representatives as vice chairman of  the Presidential Council, and to respect this constitutional  body. He is well aware that this position was given to him  although the constitution does not provide for such a position.  He also insisted on being given this title in the news, despite  of the fact that he had not taken the constitutional oath. The  YSP also assumed the third position on the Presidential Council  in accordance with the results of the elections on 27 April  1993, in which the YSP won 56 seats, coming third after the  General People's Congress [GPC], which came in first, and the  Yemeni Reform Grouping, which in came second.    In spite of this, the GPC gave up its right to three seats  on  the Presidential Council in accordance with the elections  results and gave the YSP two seats on the Council. The GPC also  agreed to give al-Bid the position of vice chairman out of  concern for national interests and national accord and to avoid  any exacerbation of the crisis that al-Bid started with his  return to Aden on 19 August 1993.    It is strange that al-Bid speaks about the legitimacy of the  others, who enjoy full legitimacy and who were elected by the  constitutional establishment as representatives of the entire  Yemeni people out of their free will, which they translated  through the legislative elections. This butcher continues to  call himself vice chairman of the Presidential Council knowing  full well that he is not legitimate because he has violated the  Constitution and has not taken the constitutional oath and  because such a position is not provided for in the Constitution.    The source explained that al-Bid was the first to circumvent  democracy and party pluralism when he refused to comply with the  people's will and did not accept the results of the elections.    The source added that the criminal butcher al-Bid goes so  far in his lies and falsification of facts as to deny the  indiscriminate use of weapons of mass destruction -- long-range  missiles -- to hit secure civilians in Sanaa, Ta'izz,  al-Hudaydah, al-Rahidah and other cities in the republic. As a  result of this odious crime and treacherous, brutal act of  aggression, many innocent civilians among the elderly, children,  and women were killed and many houses and civilian installations  were destroyed. We do not know what the butcher al-Bid can say  about those innocent victims who were killed under the debris of  the houses destroyed by the missile that he and his gang fired  on 11 May. Nor do we know what al-Bid can say about his missile  that landed on the al-Rahidah hospital, killing many patients  lying on their beds in the hospital, or what this butcher and  his clique can say about his media trumpets' haughty, conceited,  and insane appeals and threats to fire more missiles into cities  to intimidate citizens who have been terrorized by the rancorous  missiles that poured down over their heads while they were  sleeping in their homes.    The source added that al-Bid is shamelessly lying and  continues to lie, believing that he can deceive others. He is a  psychologically disturbed person suffering from a state of  psychological, political, and media schizophrenia, with his  words constantly contradicting his acts. Because of this  illness, the butcher al-Bid triggered the war in Yemen and mired  the Yemeni people in a cycle of bloody fighting to peddle his  secessionist plan, the features of which have begun to become  clear since he ignited the crisis on 19 August 1993, the  subsequent steps of the military explosion, and then the  starting of the war. This plan started on the eve of the  signing of the pledge and accord document in Amman. Then,  military units were moved from Hadhramaut, Shabwah, and Aden to  besiege and destroy al-'Amaliqah Brigade in Abyan. Afterward,  they fomented sedition in (Harf) Sufyan, the Shabwah  Governorate, 'Imran, and Dhamar, and attacked central security  personnel in Aden and the personnel of the 2d Armored Brigade in  al- Rahah, Lahij.    The source explains that this criminal butcher and his  secessionist clique would do well to leave the homeland or  surrender themselves for fair trial so as to spare our Yemeni  people further bloodshed and suffering and the homeland further  destruction. The source stressed that our Yemeni people and  public opinion abroad have become fully aware of the reality of  al-Bid and his rebellious, secessionist gang and their lies and  fabrications, which cannot fool anyone anymore.</p>

However, the applicant states that none of these dealers was willing to buy the securities at the prices quoted to due to their small aggregate balance. Bank Western ultimately purchased the interests held by the Plan in GNMA Pools A, C and D for a total cash acquisition price of $1,409,709 based upon market quotations that were obtained by the Trustees on December 27, 1990 from an unrelated source, ``Bloomberg Financial Markets, Commodity News'' (the Bloomberg System). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Plan's investment in GNMA Pool B was valued at $49,385 on or about December 20, 1990 by the Denver, Colorado office of Prudential Securities, Inc. (formerly, Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc.), another unrelated appraiser.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to the applicant, the Bloomberg System is a national information and pricing data-based system which provides current market analysis and pricing information on most financial markets and instruments, including GNMA Pools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. The CMO <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As of December 1990, the Plan had received interest income of $7,688 with respect to its $75,000 investment in the CMO as well as a return of principal of $48,428. Also as of December 1990, the CMO had a remaining balance plus accrued interest of $26,172. Thus, the gross return to the Plan with respect to this investment was $81,035. In addition, the Plan realized a net gain of $6,035.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the applicant, the Denver office of Merrill Lynch, an unrelated party, determined that, as of December 19, 1990, the CMO would trade for 93 percent of its outstanding balance and it attempted to sell the CMO for that price but to no avail. Therefore, Bank Western purchased the asset for 93.6875 percent of its par value of $26,172 or $24,519.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> c.

At the time of the December sale, the Mobile Home Loans had an outstanding principal balance of $24,599 and Bank Western paid the Plan a total sales price of $23,143. Thus, the Plan received a gross return of $40,423 for this investment and it realized a net gain of $11,396.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the applicant, there was no independent appraisal of the Mobile Home Loans in order to determine their fair market value. Instead, SAC, Bank Western's affiliate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated the fair market value of the Mobile Home Loans by discounting them to yield a market rate of return equal to the current quoted rate for new mobile home loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> d.

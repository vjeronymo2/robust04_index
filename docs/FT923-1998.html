			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Kvaerner buys German shipyard KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering, shipping and shipbuilding group, has acquired the Warnow shipyard in eastern Germany for a symbolic NKr4m (Dollars 682,000). The deal, which propels Kvaerner into the very top league of world shipbuilders, pushed the company's shares up sharply yesterday. Its A shares jumped 8 per cent yesterday. After 13 months of difficult negotiations the Treuhandanstalt, the German state privatisation agency, has agreed to fund a NKr2bn restructuring programme for the yard to be undertaken by Kvaerner through 1996. The German agency will also cover losses of up to NKr2bn on new contracts during the yard's restructuring. 'The sum is fixed and cannot be readjusted to match the actual level of losses,' Kvaerner said. The yard has contracts to build seven ships. For its part, Kvaerner will supply the yard with technology and knowhow estimated at NKr400m and will provide NKr80m in cash for the purchases of services required by the yard. Kvaerner will invest an estimated NKr60m annually from 1996 for the yard's maintenance. It will shed 1,000 of its 3,000-strong workforce, costs which will be covered by Treuhandanstalt. The acquisition makes Kvaerner Europe's biggest shipbuilder. Shipbuilding accounted for one-third of Kvaerner's NKr6bn plus revenue in 1991. In 1988, Kvaerner acquired Scotland's Govan shipyard and three years later purchased Finland's Masa-Yards. The company said the Warnow yard was expected to generate revenue from 1996 and that the market for shipbuilding would improve significantly during the second half of the 1990s. The shipyard will build vessels of up to 180,000 deadweight tonnes. It was established in 1955 and has largely delivered specialised tonnage to eastern Europe, but has also supplied a number of vessels to the West.</p>

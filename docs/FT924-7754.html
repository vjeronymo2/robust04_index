			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Councils' scope for spending is curbed MEASURES to ensure that local authorities do not squander their freedom to spend proceeds from council house and other sales were announced yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary. A Capital Partnership programme announced yesterday by Mr Howard seeks to encourage councils to spend receipts on 'worthwhile projects' by tying the award of grants and credit approvals to the amount of receipts local authorities are prepared to invest in housing, urban, environmental and rural developments. Mr Howard yesterday said grant and credit approvals for schemes such as the Estate Action programme will depend on the willingness to provide part of the finance from its capital receipts. There will be a separate scheme to award funds to local authorities with few or no capital receipts. He said: 'Altogether there will be Pounds 200m of government grant and approvals available. In addition, the Housing Corporation will have Pounds 400m available for new schemes in 1993/94.' Councils were freed in Thursday's Autumn Statement to spend all receipts from council-house and other sales raised to the end of next year. Local authorities previously were allowed to spend only 25 per cent of proceeds. The environment department said its projections - of Pounds 2.29bn in usable capital receipts this year and Pounds 2.62bn in 1993/4 - were based on estimates of 'previous sales and what we know councils have authorities left to sell.' Most treasurers - with the collapse of the property market - are revising sharply downwards their estimates of likely receipts, and are not optimistic about an upturn next year. They say that council house sales, a main source of receipts, have slowed dramatically. Local authority treasurers, however, said government forecasts of Pounds 1.75bn extra receipts over the next two years were highly optimistic. Liverpool City Council, which realised Pounds 60m in receipts in 1989-90 and about Pounds 20m last year, said it expected to raise only Pounds 10m this year. Birmingham City Council has reduced its estimate of proceeds from council-house and other sales from about Pounds 41m to Pounds 33m since the spring. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, accused the government of presenting an 'illusion', intended to disguise the real level of resources for housing agreed in the Autumn Statement. The Tories see it as a significant advance that the programme will give the government a way of encouraging the direction of the new capital spending. It will also help conservative councils which have few assets left to sell, because of earlier sales of council houses.</p>

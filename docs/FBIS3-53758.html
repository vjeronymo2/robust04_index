			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jerusalem correspondent Nadav Shragay] </F>   [Text] Two reports on illegal building by Arabs in East  Jerusalem have recently been submitted to senior Jerusalem city  officials. The first report points to "massive" illegal  building in the Arab sector in the last few months, particularly  in 'Isawiyah, Ra's al-'Amud, 'Anata, the Old City, and Herod's  Gate.    Most of it does not consist of building infractions, rather  construction of new houses. According to city officials, these  activities are financed by Palestinian elements in view of  reports about Israeli plans for accelerated construction in the  eastern parts of the city in anticipation of the negotiations  about the permanent arrangement in Jerusalem scheduled to begin  in three years.    According to the reports, construction is very rapid, with  the foundations and the ceiling being built simultaneously so  that people may move in as soon as possible. The buildings are  connected to makeshift water and electricity mains, and most of  the work is done on Saturdays and holidays when municipal  inspectors are off.    According to the municipality's report, a total of 344  building infractions (most of them new housing starts) was  registered in East Jerusalem in 1993 alone: 189 in Bayt Hanina,  Kafr 'Aqab, Shu'fat, and the northern part of the city; and 155  in the Old City, Jabal al-Mukabir, Sur Bahir, and Umm-Tuba.    The second report, issued by the Interior Ministry's  Planning  and Construction Inspection Unit, notes that as of July 1993  "there has been intensive illegal construction in East  Jerusalem," in the face of "massive lack of inspection" on the  part of the authorities, including the municipality. A map  charted in recent months (which includes only parts of East  Jerusalem and green and unzoned areas) shows that 438 buildings  were built without permit in the last two years. As noted, the  map does not include built-up areas, where the volume of illegal  construction is estimated at hundreds of units.    Some 23 solid structures and 12 temporary Bedouin dwellings  were built within the perimeters of the airport in 'Atarot; 29  illegal buildings were erected in a green area in Bayt Hanina;  51 in Walja; 19 in Khirbat Mazmuriyah; 41 in a green area in  Abu-Tur; 23 in a green and unzoned area in al-Tur; 17 in a green  and unzoned area in 'Isawiyah; 32 in an unzoned area in Hizma,  on the edge of the municipal lines; and 13 in Dayr al-'Amud.    The report stresses that the charting is partial and has not  yet been extended to areas where there is a greater incidence of  illegal construction, such as 'Arab al-Sawahirah, Kafr 'Aqab,  Ra's al-'Amud, Jabal al-Mukabir, etc.    The report states there are numerous reasons for the illegal  construction, the main ones being:    -- Lack of massive inspection in the field.    -- The absence of city blueprints indicating where  construction is legal.    -- Population growth.    -- The rise in the standard of living after 1967 which  affords additional building.    -- Vagueness about the boundaries of Jerusalem's  jurisdiction.    -- Water connections installed by the municipality, as  well as water and electricity connections installed by the Arab  electricity and water companies operating in Jerusalem.    The Interior Ministry's report asserts that Jerusalem  Municipality indirectly caused the rise in illegal construction  and the establishment of new neighborhoods through the large  number of legal suits it files against building infractors and  its lack of power to demolish illegal buildings. "This means  that an illegally-built structure stands many years as the legal  proceedings continue. The suits usually end with the infractors  paying fines or serving short prison terms. Another factor is  the long-standing policy apparently adopted by the municipality  not to use a heavy-handed approach on the issue due to internal  and external pressures."    The report goes on to say that the Interior Ministry's chart  shows the existence of hundreds of inhabited illegal buildings  in unzoned and green areas included in urban blueprints. Many  such buildings have been included in city blueprints and  legalized retroactively, but many others remain illegal. A  study based on an air photograph carried a few years ago showed  over 1,000 structures built without permits. The number of such  buildings has increased considerably since then.</p>

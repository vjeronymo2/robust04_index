			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Observer: Up yours Kenneth Clarke's verbal thuggery spreads abroad, notably in two recent bouts with Jacques Delors in which the Frenchman was treated to manners usually reserved for Britain's police and medics. Brussels folk are beginning to ask how Clarke got a reputation as one of the most pro-European ministers. An obscure Euro-law on urban waste water supposedly costing the British taxpayer Pounds 10bn caught the rough edge of Clarke's tongue - the only problem being that the British government had itself supported the directive in a unanimous vote. The chancellor was also pretty rude about the benefits of work-sharing, neglecting to acknowledge that Delors had distanced himself from that very principle. A pained EC president wondered aloud why Clarke was obsessed with winning and losing. He even offered to build a cricket pitch next door so his English friend could wield his brick-bats elsewhere. Why not exploit both men's sporting loves in a more constructive fashion by arranging a tryst at the Anderlecht football ground during the chancellor's next visit?</p>

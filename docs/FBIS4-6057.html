			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 13 April that the U.S.  authorities rejected the Japanese request that they share part  of the compensation paid to residents around the Yokota Base  under the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement [SOFA]. This  compensation arose from the verdict pronounced on the first and  second Yokoto Base noise pollution litigations. The Japanese  request was based on the SOFA stipulation that the United States  shall pay three-fourths of compensation paid as a result of  "illegal acts" on the part of U.S. Forces.    The U.S. authorities asserted that "the flight of aircraft  does not constitute an illegal act." The application of this  SOFA provision is expected to become a controversial issue in  both countries.    In February 1993, the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict  on  the first and second Yokota litigations, ruling "the noise  surpasses the limit of the residents' tolerance, and is  illegal." The court ordered the government, the accused, to pay  compensation totalling about 113 million yen to Yokota residents  for past damage from noise pollution. This verdict has been  confirmed.    Even before the Supreme Court verdict, the Defense  Facilities  Administration Agency [DFAA] had paid the compensation in full  to the plaintiffs in accordance with an earlier verdict by an  intermediate appellate court. After the final verdict was  pronounced, the DFAA asked the United States to share in the  payment of compensation under Article 18 of SOFA.    SOFA provides that Japan pay 25 percent, and the United  States 75 percent for compensation to damages caused by "illegal  acts" by U.S. military aircraft. The United States is being  asked to pay around 85 million yen in the present case.  However, the U.S. side served notice that it refuses to pay  because "flight of aircraft at Yokota Base is in accordance with  the Japan-U.S. Security Pact, and is not illegal."    While the DFAA is presently discussing with the Foreign  Ministry about making the request again, it intends to argue  with the United States along the line that "the court ruled that  the noise was illegal, and that noise was produced by the flight  of U.S. military aircraft."    In the verdict on the third Yokota litigation confirmed on  13  April, the government is again ordered to pay a total of 710  million yen in compensation. The DFAA asserts that in this  case, too, the U.S. Forces have the obligation to pay 530  million yen.    However, while all past verdicts affirmed that noise "is  beyond the limit of tolerance, and is illegal," they ruled that  the flight of U.S. military aircraft per se is "beyond Japanese  jurisdiction," and court cases seeking a ban to such flight have  all been "rejected." It remains unclear whether noise from U.S.  military aircraft constitutes an "illegal act" as stipulated in  SOFA.    Even some DFAA officials are doubtful about this, saying  "unlike in the case of accidents, will the United States agree  to the application of the provision on compensation for noise?"  Nevertheless, the Japanese financial authorities will probably  refuse to pay the whole amount, and insist on a U.S. share in  the payment.</p>

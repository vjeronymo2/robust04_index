			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Japan company wins Malaysian minerals appeal A Japanese-controlled chemical company operating in Malaysia has won its appeal against a court judgment which had found it guilty of emitting radioactive waste. The Asian Rare Earth company (ARE), 35 per cent owned by the Mitsubishi Kasei group, Japan's largest chemical company, had been producing, at its factory near the town of Ipoh in northern Malaysia, minerals used mostly in the manufacture of electronics components. In July last year, the Ipoh High Court accepted evidence of a growing number of cases of leukaemia, infant deaths and congenital disease in the vicinity of the factory. But the Malaysian Supreme Court said the Ipoh trial judge had seriously misdirected himself in assessing the case put before him. 'Our view is that the judged had erred in law, in his finding, with regard to factual and scientific evidence' said the judgment by the Supreme Court. The court also ordered damages to be assessed in favour of ARE. A group of local residents who brought the original action against ARE said it was very disappointed with the new verdict. About 3,000 residents had come to Kuala Lumpur to await the judgment. An earlier Supreme Court judgment had allowed ARE to continue its operations pending the appeal. The ARE case has aroused interest among environmental groups, both in Malaysia and Japan, with Japan's multinational companies accused of exporting dirty industries to countries with less stringent environmental rules.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: British Land British Land's agreement to buy a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope highlights how Mr John Ritblat conjures up deals that no one else dreams possible. His immediate intent appears to be to buy a cheap seat at the negotiating table to influence Stanhope's restructuring. The longer term goal must be to prise free the attractive Broadgate and Ludgate developments. Whether that is possible depends on how well Mr Ritblat can arm wrestle with Stanhope's bankers. He will have to convince them to take a painfully large debt write-off to ensure Stanhope's future viability given the company is still bleeding cash. Stanhope has been trying to stage a rights issue to recreate its balance sheet. But that is difficult when the biggest shareholders cannot afford to inject fresh funds. British Land may hope to underwrite that rights issue in return for access to Stanhope's assets. But Stanhope's puzzled response to British Land's approach suggests the negotiations will be tortuous.</p>

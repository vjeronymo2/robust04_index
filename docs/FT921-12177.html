			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Discreet rumblings of discontent in Labour ranks - Voices raised to question the party's pre-election campaign strategy A POINT of order yesterday about an alleged misuse of Commons photocopiers by a Labour prospective candidate was more interesting as an example of modern campaign techniques than as an abuse of parliament. Mr Bryan Davies, secretary to the parliamentary Labour party and candidate for Oldham and Royton, had used a 4,000-name petition opposing the 'opt-out' of Oldham hospital from the control of the local health authority to mass-leaflet its signatories. MPs cannot get enough of petitions these days. With modern word processors, they offer a god-given opportunity to target voters with letters fine-tuned to their pet issues. Furthermore, for sitting MPs, a petition shares the status of a constituent's letter and can therefore quite legitimately be answered using Commons post-paid envelopes. Such details of modern campaign techniques may provoke yawns at the beginning of a parliament. Right now they are all the rage. And as the election nears, the talk among backbenchers in the Commons tearoom is centring less on the nitty-gritty of party policy and more on crucial election tips that might make the difference between five more years at Westminster or a forlorn visit to the headhunters. None of that alters the fact, however, that the mood music from the public policy battle, waged daily in the media, may be worth a lot more. Among some Labour backbenchers in the Commons yesterday there were mixed feelings about the party leadership's current score. After the weekend poll figures and an apparently unharmonious duet from Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, and Mr Jack Cunningham, the campaigns co-ordinator, on the timing of Labour's 'kick-start' for industry, there were murmurs of mild discontent. 'There is no sense of a panic, but a lot of people are growing uneasy that after three weeks on the tax issue we are still fighting on Tory ground,' said one loyal Kinnockite. 'We should have a core of three or four key organisers like the Tories do. There are just too many committees.' Another discreet critic of Labour's recent campaigning said that while it was right to tackle the Tory attacks on tax now, not enough effort had been made to go on the offensive. In particular, mix-ups on policy detail led from too much defensive explaining and not enough ridicule of Tory claims such as the charge that Labour has a Pounds 35bn programme of public expenditure. 'It is really absurd that they should get us into a fix about a Pounds 1bn kick-start for the economy when that represents less than a half a percentage point of total spending,' he said. 'We should simply say: 'If these are Norman Lamont's projections, you know how much they are worth - Next question please'.' Labour's campaign organisers repeatedly claim their campaign howitzers - the National Health Service and the quality of public services - have yet to be announced. The debate over tax and spending is best held now, they argue, leaving it less potentially damaging when the 'official' election gets under way. None the less, some are dubious about the real value of the regional tours recently occupying Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, and his economic team, while there is fierce hand-to-hand combat under way in Westminster. Others disagree, claiming that feeding the regional media now is a shrewd medium-term investment. To accuse Labour of complacency when it is currently campaigning at the rate of three policy briefings a day would be unfair in the extreme. Still, yesterday's crop - on poll tax, EC aid and nursery schools - suggested more a blunderbuss approach than a rapier. Even away from the intrusive microphones, a clear majority of Labour MPs appear as convinced off the record as on it that little or nothing can stop their party from, at the very least, forcing the Tories into a hung parliament. 'We are neck and neck at one goal all, and there is 15 minutes still left to play,' was the image conjured by one seasoned electioneer close to the heart of the Labour campaign team. If that is really the apposite metaphor, then a Conservative outright victory cannot be ruled out and it is still anyone's game.</p>

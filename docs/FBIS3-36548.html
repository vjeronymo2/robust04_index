			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] Russian presidential council member Emil Pain, who  heads the Ethnic Policy Research Center of the Russian Foreign  Policy Association, is convinced that the Russian leadership  should not place special emphasis on coming to terms with  Tatarstan in the process of making Russia a federal state.    He told Interfax Monday [7 February] that he did not see  much  sense in hurrying up the signing of a treaty between the Russian  Federation and Tatarstan on mutual delegation of powers at the  expense of "unprincipled concessions" by Moscow. "The treaty is  being worded, there is a schedule of drafting documents and  there has been no departure from the constitutional process,"  Payin believes.    In his view, similar treaties on power sharing between the  center and the Federation's constituent parts must be signed  with all Russia's areas. "It would be highly undesirable to make  some constituent part an exceptional case," Payin emphasized.    Staying away from the elections does more harm to Tatarstan  than to Russia, Payin said. In his words, by ignoring the  December parliamentary elections that republic lost the chance  of being represented in the Federation's top legislature and of  influencing federal policies, particularly as far as the shaping  the structure of the Federation is concerned.</p>

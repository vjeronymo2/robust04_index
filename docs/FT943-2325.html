			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Expansion on the agenda - Two surveys indicate recovery and growth British industry and commerce seem to be getting itchy feet. Many senior executives are contemplating moving their headquarters to new cities as their businesses recover and they feel constrained by their surroundings, according to two separate surveys. The most surprising feature of the surveys is that expansion is the biggest reason given by companies expecting to relocate in the next five years. Over the past few years cost cutting and staff reductions were the biggest reasons for moving headquarters. Neither the identity of the companies, nor the extent to which relocations might include manufacturing operations, has been revealed. Some of the businesses may be divisions of big groups, but many appear to be small and medium-sized companies with an average annual turnover of Pounds 26m. The survey by Black Horse Relocation, part of Lloyds Bank, and Management Today magazine, shows that more than a fifth of senior executives who responded expect to relocate in the next five years. John Carolan, managing director of Black Horse Relocation, says: 'The recession has not prevented new businesses from being formed or growing. A number of these appear to have reached the size where they will need to move. There may be some bunching with companies postponing decisions until they feel more confident that the recovery will be sustained.' The survey received replies from chairmen, chief executives and other senior directors from 536 companies. More than a third cite expansion as the main reason for moving, twice the proportion indicating restructuring or reorganisation. 'It is the first time in the 21 years that I have been in industry that companies have cited expansion as the main reason for moving. It is very encouraging for the economy,' says Carolan. A separate survey of 480 directors and senior managers by property consultants Richard Ellis shows that 31 per cent expect to relocate their office buildings in the next five years as a result of 'major structural changes in their industries'. Among the most important features in choosing a business location, according to the surveys, are quality of the local workforce and road communications. Property costs are regarded as much less important, says Richard Ellis. The survey says that only half of those interviewed 'claimed they knew the annual cost per person of occupying their present building and only 22 per cent knew their moving costs per person'. Quality of life appears to rate highly with executives who chose Bristol, Edinburgh and Nottingham as the most favoured centres for locations in the Black Horse survey. Provincial cities such as Norwich, Plymouth and Exeter were highly regarded. The most important personal factors in support of relocation cited by executives include: overall quality of life (57 per cent), cost of living (30 per cent), crime rate (29 per cent), access to countryside (27 per cent) and the quality of schools (26 per cent). On business grounds the main reasons cited by executives are quality of the local workforce (57 per cent), cost of overheads such as local authority rates (36 per cent) and availability of local customers (23 per cent). Property costs and competitive wage rates score 21 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Black Horse, which expects to move about 4,500 families this year on behalf of companies and public-sector organisations, says: 'We are still evaluating the results of the survey but there appears to be a new dimension to relocations compared with the 1970s and 1980s, which mainly were concerned with reducing overheads rather than improving the quality of the business.'</p>

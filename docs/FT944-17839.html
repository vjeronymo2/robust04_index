			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Technology: Front row seat - In-flight interactive TV is coming to a 747 near you Depending on whom you believe, interactive in-flight television is either with us, about to be with us, or still so lost in the planning stage that no one can be sure when it will arrive. Interactive TV will mean the end of the communal screen and the tyranny of the in-flight movie by offering passengers a choice of viewing on individual video screens. It will also mean a new source of revenue for airlines, which will be able to charge economy class passengers an extra fee to watch the latest films or play computer games. It will also tempt passengers to do their duty-free shopping by choosing items from the screen and paying for them with a credit card swipe device rather than calling the flight attendant. This opens up a new world of in-flight possibilities. Satellite data links will enable passengers to book hotel rooms, hire cars and send flowers; airlines will be able to use interactive screens to run instant customer surveys; passengers will be able to look up information about their destination; and video on demand will be a reality, with passengers selecting the programmes they want to watch, when they want to watch them. Virgin Atlantic and United Airlines are both working on basic video interactivity. In Virgin's case, this means a Pounds 12m system designed by Hughes Avicom of California, which can provide 14 TV channels, plus video roulette, poker and fruit machine games and duty-free shopping with a credit card swipe. United Airlines is developing a similar set-up using hardware provided by GEC/Marconi (at a cost of Pounds 65m) and software by Microsoft and Sony. Six TV channels, duty-free shopping and electronic games will be the main interactive ingredients when the facility appears on United's new Boeing 777 fleet some time next year. Virgin's system is already operating. Installed in six of its 12 aircraft earlier this year, it has not been without teething troubles; but it is at least there, rather than merely promised. Tests on British Airways' new in-flight system are not due to be held until early 1995, and installation throughout the fleet will have to wait until the end of that year. But BA argues that its system will offer the full range of interactive video facilities, not just some of them. It will take time because BA - and any other airline hoping to offer a range of facilities of this complexity - will have to use the latest high-performance hard disc digital servers to process the vast quantities of information. Digital servers are at the heart of it all. Their job is to parcel out material to each user as he or she wants it, remember which user is where in the programme and give him or her the right bits of material at the right moment. A server system must be able to cope with all users choosing the same programme simultaneously as well as at different times (a digitised, compressed movie takes up about one gigabyte of hard disc for every hour of screen time), and be fault tolerant so that it can continue to deliver material even if a drive fails. It must also be light and compact enough to fit into an aircraft, and must avoid high operating temperatures. BE Aerospace of Irvine, California, is designing the BA aircraft installations, each one comprising four hard drive servers, with each hard drive holding 90 gigabytes of information. Other servers will be needed to handle such services as games, car hire and hotel information. BA estimates that fully installed, the technology will cost around Pounds 80m. Every system will add about 2 tonnes to an aircraft's payload. It is clear that this is not something that BA wants to rush into. In which case, will Singapore Airlines steal BA's thunder? SIA is being coy about its plans, announcing, like Virgin and United, that the new year will see them offering a mix of fixed-schedule TV channels, destination information and catalogue shopping, and some games. SIA is widely believed to have struck a deal with Micropolis, a California-based information storage and video systems company. Micropolis's claim to fame is that it has been supplying video on demand to hotels in the US for the past six months, using its own digital video server, the AV Server 100. This is up and running in seven US hotels and already allows up to 32 viewers simultaneous access to 20 films. The technology can be tailored for airline use without having to compromise the equipment's basic specification. Singapore Airlines may be at least six months ahead of the pack and possibly more. But this is not the end of it. Everyone is talking about using interactive video principally to access pre-recorded material, downloaded on to the aircraft before it takes off. But there will soon be the option of picking up digital quality live TV and other real-time information on an aircraft in flight - as demonstrated earlier this year, when a Swissair aircraft picked up a live CNN broadcast on a flight from Tokyo to Zurich. This looked like a stunt: the broadcast was short and the capability to repeat the exercise is limited. But it is there, promising live news broadcasts, weather checks for your destination and all the local television viewing you can handle at 30,000ft. This raises a further point: how much TV should an airline allow for, before the quality starts to evaporate? That may prove to be a tougher problem than all the technology put together.</p>

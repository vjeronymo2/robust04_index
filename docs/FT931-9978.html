			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fourth-quarter advance at EDS ELECTRONIC Data Systems (EDS), the computer services subsidiary of General Motors, yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 178m from Dollars 155.9m a year earlier. Earning's per share were 12 per cent higher at 37 cents against 33 cents, while revenues were up 2 per cent at Dollars 2.14bn from Dollars 2.09bn. On Wall Street, shares in General Motors' class E stock, whose value is tied to EDS's performance, rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 at close of trading. The stock climbed above Dollars 35 earlier this year on rumours that British Telecom might be discussing buying a stake in the business. The results met analysts' expectations. For the whole of 1992, EDS earned Dollars 635.5m, or Dollars 1.33 a share. A year earlier, net income stood at Dollars 547.5m, or Dollars 1.14, including a charge of Dollars 15.5m, or 3 cents for accounting changes. Revenues reached a record Dollars 8.22bn from Dollars 7.1bn in 1991. EDS, which was founded by Mr Ross Perot and acquired by General Motors in 1984, is relying less on business from its GM parent. EDS said revenues from non-GM sources grew to more than 59 per cent of its total revenues. General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), General Motor's large financial services arm, posted net income of Dollars 936.1m for 1992, including charges on the adoption of new accounting standard SFAS Number 106. In 1991, the company reported net income of Dollars 1.37bn, including Dollars 331.5m gains from the adoption of SFAS Number 109 and after-tax charges of Dollars 170.9m for a special wholesale loss provision. Stripping out one-time items, Mr Robert O'Connell, GMAC's chairman, said 1992 net income stood at Dollars 1.24bn against Dollars 1.21bn in 1991 on a comparable basis. 'Importantly, GMAC's 1992 performance was achieved in a year of challenging events and significant change for the GMAC worldwide organisation,' he said. Income from GMAC's financing operations was Dollars 1.03bn, down slightly from the Dollars 1.04bn earned a year earlier. During the year GMAC financed or leased 33 per cent of new GM vehicles sold in the US against 35 per cent in 1991. The number of new cars and trucks financed or leased by GMAC slipped to 1.6m from 1.7m last year in the US.</p>

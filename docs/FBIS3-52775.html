The committee in its report  has called for allowing the private sector and foreign companies  in the insurance sector. But it has suggested certain controls  for its efficient working in the new economic conditions. The  33-point recommendation submitted by the former governor of the  Reserve Bank of India, Mr. R.N. Malhotra, has suggested that the  private sector companies must have a minimum pay-back capital of  100 crore rupees and the promoter stage should not exceed 40  percent of the capital. The report said that if the foreign  insurance companies were allowed, they should float Indian  companies. The committee has recommended that LIC [Life  Insurance Corporation] should be converted into a company  registered under the Companies Act.    The report says Postal Life Insurance should be permitted to  transact life insurance business in the rural areas among the  general public. The committee has recommended that the  ownership pattern of the LIC, GIC [General Insurance  Corporation] and its four subsidiary companies should be changed  by reducing government share holding to 50 percent. It has also  suggested that all insurance companies should be equally  governed by the provisions of the Insurance Act. The committee  was set up in April last year to examine the existing structure  of the insurance industry and to suggest changes in light of the  new economic policy.</p>

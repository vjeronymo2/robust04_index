			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Israeli-backed south Lebanon militia pounded by guerrillas ARAB guerrillas blasted positions of Israel's proxy militia in southern Lebanon drawing retaliatory fire yesterday, in the fiercest attack on the zone since last month's Israeli offensive. The resurgence of violence came a day after Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, warned the Beirut government against taking independent action in southern Lebanon, such as the recent decision to deploy Lebanese soldiers in the area. The pro-Iranian Hizbollah, which constitutes the backbone of the Lebanese 'resistance' to the Israeli control of a self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon, has vowed to continue attacks despite an informal ceasefire agreement brokered last month by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. Israel has said it will respond harshly to any new attacks on its forces. A further escalation in violence is expected in the run-up to the eleventh round of Middle East peace talks, due in two weeks in Washington, which Hizbollah opposes. Syria, which could exert its influence to curb Hizbollah attacks, has sent conflicting signals about peace with Israel and the role of Hizbollah, which it continues to use as leverage against the Jewish state. Last month, during Mr Christopher's visit to the region, President Hafez al-Assad bolstered Israeli hopes of a breakthrough in bilateral peace talks by sending a series of messages to Jerusalem. However, the Syrian leader has refused to completely halt Hizbollah's activities and has strongly criticised the Lebanese government's troop deployment, which was scaled down when Damascus expressed reservations. Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday it would - for the first time - appoint some Palestinian negotiators from the Israeli-occupied territories to its highest decision-making bodies. The PLO, ruling out prospects for progress in the next peace talks, made the move as part of its continuing strategy to force Israel to open a direct dialogue with the organisation as the only way to unblock the peace process.</p>

The money units are the Chinese Yuan, the Indonesian Rupiah,  the Thai Baht and the ECU (European Currency Unit) of the  European Union.    Beginning April 11, local banks will provide money exchange  services for these currencies.    China, Indonesia and Thailand are among Korea's 20 largest  trading partners and more Korean tourists are visiting these  countries, increasing the need to change the Won into their  legal tenders, the announcement said.    The need for an ECU exchange is also rising as the European  Union transforms into a single monetary area, it added.    The number of currencies whose exchange values against the  Won are included in the daily foreign exchange rates posted by  the Korea financial telecommunication and clearings institute  will increase from the current 25 to 29.    The 25 present currencies are the U.S. dollar, the Japanese  Yen, the British Pound sterling, the German Mark, the Australian  Dollar, the French Franc, the Italian Lira, the Canadian Dollar,  the Swiss Franc, the Hong Kong Dollar, the Swedish Krona, the  Dutch Krona, the Belgian Franc, the Austrian Schilling, the  Norwegian Krone, the Dutch Guilder, the Saudi Arabian Riyal, the  Kuwaiti Dinar, the Bahrainian Dinar, the United Arab Emirates'  Dirham, the Singaporean Dollar, the Malaysian Ringgit, the New  Zealand Dollar, the Spanish Peseta and the Finnish Markka.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PADRES' ROB NELSON SHOWS PERSEVERANCE  </P> <P> How unfortunate that the gross misconceptions about dyslexia held by San Diego  Padres farm director Tom Romanesko have contributed to Rob Nelson's inability  to be given a fair shot at the big leagues.  </P> <P> Dyslexia is a disorder characterized by the brain's difficulty in processing  the written information it receives. It does not affect an individual's ability  to hit a baseball, nor a particular pitch.  </P> <P> I believe Rob Nelson's dedication and perseverance would make him a valued  member of any major league team, many of whose members, past and present, lack  the strength of character that this gifted man possesses.  </P> <P> MARK BASKIN, M.D.  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hays shows modest growth to Pounds 29m HAYS, the business services group, increased pre-tax profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 29.1m in the six months to December 31. However, the group said that the early opening of a Milton Keynes distribution depot for Waitrose in January had brought forward Pounds 1m of extra costs which would have an effect on the second half's results. The shares closed 14p lower at 227p. Mr Ronnie Frost, chairman, said the group had performed well: 'The operating profits of both the distribution and commercial core activities showed good growth.' Group turnover rose from Pounds 341m to Pounds 381.8m and operating income increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 30.2m. The distribution division's operating profits rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 17.5m. The group said the performance of Fril, the French distributor bought for Pounds 37.5m in June, had been up to expectations. Hays Network Distribution, which encompasses the Dagenham, Network and Marine businesses, had been substantially reorganised by its new managing director who was appointed in August. About 20 redundancies, at a cost of Pounds 250,000, reduced profits. However, Mr Frost said these cuts, and closure of two offices, would save Pounds 1m a year. Chemicals distribution's profits declined, mainly because of a surplus of caustic soda. The commercial division increased operating profits by 15 per cent to Pounds 10.6m. In spite of the Post Office delaying an increase in the first-class letter rate, Britdoc's profits continued to grow strongly due to new business areas and increasing volumes of mail. The group said its parcels business, Data Express, had done well in a difficult market, increasing both turnover and profits. The personnel division's operating profits fell from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 2.1m, partly because of about Pounds 350,000 of reorganisation costs. All 123 branches, which mainly provide accountancy staff, continued to contribute to profits. Earnings per share rose to 4.9p (4.7p). The interim dividend is lifted to 1.7p (1.5p). COMMENT Yesterday's figures were at the bottom end of expectations and that was enough to knock the share price, which has enjoyed a good run from 163p since September. However, the performance of the main businesses remains impressive. The commercial division continues to thrive and the dip in multi-user distribution and the chemicals side shows that recovery would not just benefit Hays' depressed personnel division. Analysts have brought their full-year profit forecasts back to about Pounds 67m, which puts the shares on a prospective multiple of about 20. The 20 per cent premium to the market does not seem unjustified for a group which will respond speedily to economic upturn.</p>

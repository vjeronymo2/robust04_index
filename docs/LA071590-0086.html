			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OVERFELT LEADS GLENDALE TO 2 WINS OVER SUN VALLEY  </P> <P> Brent Overfelt, receiving his first starting pitching assignment of the season,  led Glendale to a 6-4 American Legion District 20 Eastern Division victory over  Sun Valley on Saturday in the second game of a doubleheader to give Glendale a  sweep at Poly High.  </P> <P> In the opener, Overfelt drove in John Aguilar with a double to tie the score,  2-2, in the fifth inning and scored on a passed ball in Glendale's 3-2 victory.  Overfelt (4-1) walked none and struck out seven in the next game, but he did  not allow a hit until Robert Aros singled with none out in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> The Glendale right-hander had expected to start the second game in right field.  But when scheduled starter Manny Fernandez arrived late, Overfelt was given the  call.  </P> <P> He said he fulfilled a seasonlong desire by starting on the mound at least once  this season.  </P> <P> Glendale finished the regular season at 18-5, a half-game behind first-place  Sun Valley (18-4). Panorama City, which won two games against Van Nuys-Notre  Dame on Saturday, is 17-5. Sun Valley and Panorama City have one game  remaining. The top two teams in the division advance to the playoffs. There  also will be two wildcard berths.  </P> <P> Sun Valley is scheduled to play a makeup game against Verdugo Hills today at 9  a.m. at Poly High. Panorama City will play Verdugo Hills in a makeup game  Monday.  </P> <P> "What's going to happen is I have one of the best teams around and I'm probably  going to go in the playoffs as a wildcard," said Glendale Coach Mike MacDonald.  </P> <P> Glendale enjoyed a 6-0 lead in the second game, but Sun Valley struck back in  the seventh.  </P> <P> Overfelt carried a two-hitter into the seventh, but was knocked out after  issuing three walks and two hits as Sun Valley closed to 6-2.  </P> <P> Eric Asselin replaced Overfelt with none out and the bases loaded and struck  out the first batter.  </P> <P> He then gave up a two-run single to Sun Valley pitcher Marlon McKinney, but he  ended the game by striking out Robert Flores and retiring Roy Lozano on a weak  grounder to second.  </P></p>

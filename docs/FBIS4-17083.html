			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 21 Apr -- A meeting between Boris Yeltsin,  Bill Clinton, representatives of the United Nations and the  European Union, to settle the Balkan conflict is possible within  a month, Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian Federation president's  press secretary, told a Kremlin briefing today.    He said that late last night Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton  had a long telephone conversation, lasting some 40 minutes.  Vyacheslav Kostikov noted that during the conversation the  Russian Federation president said "Russia and the United States  have a common path of democracy and partnership, there is no  crack in the partnership, but a sober and pragmatic account of  national interests does exist."    The Russian Federation president again confirmed Russia's  position with regard to NATO's bombing raids. "Russia is not a  supporter of any party to the conflict, but it does have and  will continue to have its own levers to influence the situation  in the region," Kostikov said. He also said that during his  telephone conversation with Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin yet  again came out "categorically against bombing raids not  previously agreed upon with Russia, and in response, got  Clinton's assurance that the USA would refrain from sharp  actions in this direction."    Vyacheslav Kostikov thinks that in order to settle the  Balkan  crisis, it is necessary to find "a single plan and to set about  implementing it." "The attempt by the parties involved to get  individual dividends from the crisis is doomed to fail and is  not constructive," the press secretary emphasized.</p>

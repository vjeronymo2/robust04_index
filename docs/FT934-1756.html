			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Restaurants hit at discount scheme A trade association rep-resenting small restaurants has criticised a discount scheme which the Financial Times plans to promote next year. Mr Michael Gottlieb, vice-chairman of the Restaurateurs Association of Great Britain, said the scheme, which offers 25 per cent discounts at participating restaurants, would result in customers' assuming that the industry made far bigger profits than it actually does. The association represents 700 restaurants. Transmedia, the US-based company running the scheme, said 99 UK restaurants had agreed to participate and that it offered a fair deal to customers and the industry. Diners who take advantage of the scheme will use a restaurant card to pay the full cost of the meal. The amount will then appear on their credit or debit card bill, less 25 per cent of what they spent on food or drink. There is no discount on the value added tax or service. It is planned to offer the card free through the FT for the first six months of next year. After that it will cost Pounds 35 a year. Participating restaurants can negotiate loans with Transmedia which are paid off when customers with restaurant cards have spent twice the amount advanced. For every Pounds 100 spent on food and beverages, Pounds 25 is returned to the customer, Pounds 25 is retained by Transmedia and Pounds 50 goes towards paying off the loan. Mr Gottlieb, who owns the two Smollensky's restaurants in London, said he feared the card-holding customers would displace full-paying clients on busy evenings. Restaurateurs would be giving 25 per cent back to the customer and 25 per cent to Transmedia, badly damaging profits. Mr Gottlieb admitted that he had 'flippantly' asked Transmedia for a Pounds 250,000 loan, which had been refused. Mr Richard Exham, managing director of Ebury Wine Bars, which has subscribed to the scheme, said the loan would enable him to invest in new equipment in his five London outlets and attract customers he would not otherwise have had.</p>

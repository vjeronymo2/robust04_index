Guided by a Wise Budget'':  ``Science Will Not Remain in Debt''--first six paragraph are  POISK introduction]    [Text] Each time, when attending a general meeting of the  Russian Academy of Sciences, you try to detect in what is  happening something new, a mark of what has been introduced into  science by our fast-paced times. What is meant are not only the  problems and achievements of academic science, an extensive list  of which was contained in the speech of RAS [Russian Academy of  Sciences] President Yuriy Osipov and the report of Chief  Scientific Secretary of the Academy Igor Makarov, but also the  changes, which affect the overall mood and future of the  scientific community. This time the meeting took place, it  appears, guided by timid hopes for bright prospects for the RAS  this year. The State Duma Decree ``On the Crisis in Russian  Science'' and the changed, as one wants to hope, attitude of the  government toward the needs of research collectives became the  culture medium of the cautious optimism of scientists. In the  draft of the federal budget, which the State Duma should pass,  the science line is supported by a figure that for the present  is quite reassuring. Moreover, they are also promising to pay  last year's debts. Vladimir Khlebodarov, president of the  Council of Trade Unions of Workers of the RAS, acquainted people  with a letter, which was addressed to the council by Deputy  Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation A. Astakhov. Here  are a few excerpts from this letter:    ``In the draft of the budget of the Russian Federation for  1994 the reimbursement of the outlays on the repayment of the  debt during the past year in the amount of 22.9 billion rubles  [R] is envisaged for the RAS and its regional departments.    Moreover, the amounts of financing of these institutions, 10  percent of which were sequestrated and which were envisaged by  the draft of the republic budget of the Russian Federation for  the second through fourth quarters of that year in the amount of  R60.2 billion, were restored.    The appropriations were increased by R16.4 billion in March  of that year in connection with the increase in December 1993 of  the minimum wage by 1.9-fold."    And although no one saw the promised money, and no one knows  when it will begin to arrive, the spirit of hope hovered above  the heads of those who had gathered. For some it resurrected the  dream of returning to the good old times--at that time familiar  exultant self-reports with prospects for a subsidy were heard  from the rostrum. Before others the hope afforded new prospects,  and they spoke about what is needed in order to make them come  true and proposed their own means of the organization and  development of Russian academic science.    In this issue we acquaint the readers with brief accounts of  the speech of Yu. Osipov and the report of I. Makarov at the  general meeting of the RAS. Lists of the newly elected full  members and corresponding members of the Russian Academy of  Sciences are published on page 2 of the newspaper.''  <H5>  Science Will Not Remain in Debt </H5>   In describing the situation, under which the academy  operated, it is possible, unfortunately, to repeat much of what  was said in the speeches at the general meetings in December  1992 and April 1993 and to speak about the confusion of  statewide goals and guidelines, including in the area of  science, about the deformation of social values, about the  destruction of historical traditions, and about the problems of  science, culture and education under the conditions of the  economic crisis and political upheavals.    But however difficult it is for us, our academy is being  preserved and is operating, it is playing a decisive role in  Russian science--as the most important component of the  spiritual and intellectual wealth of Russia. The main  contribution of the academic community of the present and future  of science also lies in this.    In my speech I would like not only to speak about several  results of the year, but also to touch upon a number of very  urgent and difficult problems, with which the academy had  occasion to be faced.    I should say at once that, in spite of all the difficulties  which the meeting participants know better than anyone, the  academy succeeded as a whole in maintaining a high level of  conducted research.    (The president dwelt in detail on the achievements, by which  the work of a number of scientific collectives of the RAS was  commended.)    Only individual examples of the scientific results of the  year under review were named. I, of course, do not have the  opportunity to mention other results. But such results exist.  And this inspires certain optimism.    I will speak about several other aspects of our activity.    I will recall that our regional departments are financed by  a  separate line in the state budget. The total budget of the  academy in 1993 was R141 billion. Incidentally, in comparable  prices it is one-fourth to one-tenth as much (here the estimates  are different) as the 1990 budget. I stress that it is  one-fourth to one-tenth as much as the 1990 budget.    We failed to receive R22 billion last year, mainly during  the  fourth quarter, therefore, the budget was fulfilled by  approximately 85 percent. And the fact that this indicator is  higher than in other scientific departments of Russia, of  course, is not comforting. And how the academy literally monthly  wrung out these meager assets is a theme for another discussion.    A few words about scientific personnel. The presidium of the  RAS tried to do everything possible to preserve the personnel  potential of the staff of the academy. In 1992 the total number  of workers decreased by 4.5 percent and in 1993, by 3.7 percent.  Here the number of candidates of sciences decreased by 1.4  percent, while the number of doctors of sciences even increased  by 5.6 percent. This testifies that people are defending  doctoral dissertations, in spite of all the difficulties. It is  gratifying that after the sharp decrease of the hiring to  academic institutes of young specialists by a factor of 3.5 in  the last three years during the year under review this process  has been starting to stabilize somewhat--1,149 people came to  us, I have in mind the central part of the academy, which is  slightly more than in 1992. Some change in the dynamics of  admission to graduate studies emerged. In 1993, 767 graduate  students were registered. This exceed by 100 this indicator in  1992. However, the total number of people studying in academic  graduate studies decreased from 5,000 in 1992 to 4,220 in 1993.  The ``brain drain,'' which is worrying us, has continued,  although on a smaller scale. We have lost not only prominent,  established scientists, but also talented young people: In the  past two years approximately 500 associates of the academy have  gone abroad for permanent residence, and more than 1,700  associates are on extended missions.    I think you will agree that our international relations have  become more striking and diverse. Cooperation within the  framework of long-term agreements with our foreign partners,  membership in international organizations, as well as  participation in international scientific projects remain the  basic forms of our relations. Today there are 74 agreements,  which encompass nearly all the directions of contemporary basic  science, with scientific organizations of the far and  intermediate abroad.    We have membership in 235 organizations. However, it is  alarming that the Russian Academy of Sciences is beginning to  lose its positions in these organizations, although five Russian  scientists have been elected presidents, 50 have been elected  vice presidents, and about 80 have been elected members of the  governing bodies. In the past two years funds have been allotted  to us to pay the dues in international organizations. The  Russian Academy of Sciences represents not only its own  interests, but also the interests of the state. However, the  funds being allotted are insufficient, and due to this we are  beginning to lose positions in international scientific  organizations.    It is gratifying that the scientific ties of the RAS with  the  academies of sciences of the former republics of the USSR have  begun to be restored. I believe that these academies are parts  of the common organism of our scientific community, which are  united by scientific schools, unique tools and sets of  scientific research, and organizational principles. Integration  is now being carried out both within the framework of bilateral  agreements and through the International Association of  Academies of Sciences.    I would like to say a few words about cooperation with state  structures. It is necessary to mention a number of important  decisions that were made by state bodies on the initiative and  at the insistence of the Academy of Sciences. There is the  well-known edict of the president of 21 September 1993. It  applies to all the scientific associates of Russia, who have the  academic degree of candidate and doctor of sciences. This is a  significant edict, unfortunately, its implementation is being  dragged out. But the situation all the same is straightening  out, and now they are beginning to allocate money for these  purposes.    I would like to note the very important April decree of the  Supreme Soviet of 1993. According to it all the land, which the  academy had at its disposal, is passing to its permanent,  gratuitous, free use. And, of course, the Supreme Soviet helped  us, having adopted the decision which prohibits the  privatization of the scientific facilities of the Russian  Academy of Sciences with the permission of the presidium of the  Academy of Sciences. But I have to say that the State Committee  for the Management of State Property is continuing to violate  this law.    The protocol with the Ministry of Finance on the budget for  1994. This, I believe, is an important agreement. In my opinion,  it was proposed to allocate about R5 trillion for science, then  this figure was lowered to R4.18 trillion, then Boris  Georiyevich Saltykov fought with the Ministry of Finance and  raised this figure to R4.4 trillion. The budget of the academy  remains the same, they did not touch it, it was not cut in  comparison with the budgets of other departments. And, of  course, I cannot but speak here about the important statement in  support of science, which the State Duma has now adopted.    To preserve and develop our basic science is only a part,  though the main one, but only a part of the duty of the academy  to Russia. And reality is such that we will not get the support  of society, if we keep aloof of its concerns and shut ourselves  up in our own problems. The academy is obliged to make its  contribution to overcoming the crisis of Russia, a more  substantial contribution than so far.    There is a historical law: Since the times of Archimedes, if  not earlier, scientists came to the aid of their society, during  wars and during dislocations and economic and political  upheavals.    We have considerable resources to help the country. In the  area of the natural and exact sciences the academy has basic  developments with enormous potential introduction. Given the  proper organization of the matter and the support of the  authorities many of them could be used in the immediate future.  The legislation that now exists, unfortunately, is impeding the  development of this work.    In the area of the social sciences our scientists should  make  their contribution to the understanding of what is now happening  in the country, from where the decay of civil ethics, outbursts  of mass violence and blood-letting ethnic clashes originated,  whether there are real means of their prediction and prevention  or has the decline of civilization as we know it begun.    The academy should give help to the state, participating in  the work of specific commissions and committees and in the  drafting of specific programs and documents, which require  professional scientific knowledge. In particular, it is  necessary in the immediate future to develop the legal basis of  state science and technology policy and the status of the  scientific organization and the scientific associate. To insert  proposals in the draft of the new civil and customs codes and in  tax and credit legislation and to specify the competences of  federal and state bodies of management.    Russia needs a Federal Program of the Development of Science  for the Next 10 Years. The academy of sciences should take an  active part in the formulation of this program, particularly in  the area that concerns basic research. State guidelines in the  area of science should thereby be formulated.    The academy should coordinate basic research in the country  to a greater extent. From this standpoint the role of the  scientific councils attached to the presidium and the  departments should be increased substantially.    The academy is obliged to use its prestige for the support  of  prominent centers of sectorial science, many of which are in a  more difficult position than the academy.    We should participate most actively in the immediate  completion and in the carrying through legislative bodies of a  package of laws that are connected with the existence and  activity of our science cities. Much is being said on this  theme, but no headway is being made.    The thorough integration of the academy with leading  universities of Russia is necessary.    Keeping in mind the recertification of institutes, it is  necessary first of all to assess what contribution the institute  has made, say, in the last five years to basic science. Of  course, recertification is also needed for the improvement of  the scientific structure of the academy. There are proposals to  consider the question of the possibility of changing the  academic status (from the standpoint of base financing) of the  subdivisions, in which basic science is poorly developed and the  nature of the activity of which--at times extremely important  activity--does not correspond to the basic tasks of the academy.  We should also think about uniting in the interests of the cause  several of our subdivisions.    A number of proposals concern the possibility of decreasing  the number of scientific departments of the RAS and uniting  several of them. This question is a very ticklish one and cannot  be settled imperatively, inasmuch as such radical changes can  worsen the contact with institutes, while the material gain from  such unification is small. Not rejecting the very posing of the  question, I think that it should be studied carefully by the  presidium.    The procedure of distributing base financing should promote  the elimination of inefficiently operating subdivisions and of  associates, who do not carry a significant and necessary load,  and the reorientation of individual collectives and associates  in the priority directions. It is not a question of mass  reductions at the academy. The presidium if opposed to such a  statement of the question.    We should receive very substantial assets for science, if we  are to use correctly our property and basic developments that  are ready for pilot introduction. For this it is necessary to  raise the professionalism in the use of these sources and to  create an atmosphere of openness and mutual trust and serious  control.</p>

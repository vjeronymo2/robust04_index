Khusro, editor of THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS: </F> "Tackling Kashmir Issue"]    [Text] All these years the Government of India took the  position that the Kashmir issue had been settled legally and  historically and that no dialogue was necessary on this score.  But since 1984, particularly more recently, unimaginative and  wooden nature of its Kashmir policy has led to a weakening of  this position internationally. Pressures have mounted to such a  degree that the matter could not be left in abeyance any longer.  There has been an emergence of many new but important  peripheral issues. By handling these badly it has strengthened  Pakistan's position, so much so that Islamabad has been  encouraged to ask the Human Rights Commission to send a  fact-finding mission to Kashmir to investigate the violation of  human rights by the Indian Army and the para-military forces in  the valley.    Even when these peripheral issues are resolved and the wood  cut to be able to see the trees, the main Kashmir issue will  remain and will need to be tackled effectively. But the  periphery must be addressed first:    (I) There has been a failure to start a political process in  the State of Jammu and Kashmir, especially the valley, without  the intervention of non-Kashmiri political parties in the  valley, a failure to end President's rule and have an elected  government.    (2) There has also been a failure to win over the voting and  the non-voting population in the valley which is getting sick of  the terrorist activity and would be willing to go back to the  pre-1984 position of staying with India, provided that (a) fair  and free elections are conducted; (b) a coalition government is  not imposed on the people of Kashmir and (c) adequate economic  and employment opportunities are provided to Kashmiris both  within and outside the State.    (3) Owing to incursions by military and men from across the  Line of Control into the valley, despite the presence of the  army and the para-military forces at the border and elsewhere,  there has been a failure to deal effectively with the terrorists  and militants. There has at the same time been a failure to set  up a Human Rights Commission early enough to demonstrate to the  world that India does not condone atrocities by anybody.    (4) There has also been an unwillingness to allow various  critics such as the human right groups, Congressmen and Members  of Parliament from other countries to visit the valley and to  see for themselves what is happening.    (5) When the population in the State of Jammu and Kashmir  and  specially in the valley became totally dissatisfied and the  international community became a scathing critic on all the  above counts, there has been a failure to start a dialogue with  Pakistan and the various interested groups in Kashmir, giving  the world a strong impression of adamance and total rigidity  which aroused the international community further and enabled  Pakistan to capitalise on this adamance of the Indian Government  and unrest among the people.    As international community is getting seized of the Kashmir  issue and agitations and pressures are mounting, India has had  to concede a dialogue -- which incidentally has been provided  for in the Simla Agreement as well as in the earlier U.N.  resolution. Our Kashmir policy has always been halting and  Pakistan has been taking full advantage of this. However, with  some dynamic thinking and action it should be possible for the  country to get rid of the peripheral problems, win over  international opinion and deal with the main issue from a  position of strength.    It would appear that some of the following measures would  have to be taken in order to achieve a position of strength:    (a) The composition of the newly-established Human Rights  Commission could be strengthened further, in order to avoid some  criticisms, and the Commission could be asked to deal firmly and  fairly with every case of human rights violation and atrocities.    (b) Human rights groups and other interested groups and  individuals who wish to visit Kashmir should be allowed to go  there freely and see things for themselves. The positive impact  of having seen things for themselves and even adverse reports by  these observers would be far more positive for India than the  abominable suspicion generated by the clamour that India does  not open the area for a fair observation as it has numerous  things to hide from the world and is actually condoning the  atrocities by its security forces and others. Such visits, if  permitted freely, would bring out openly the killings, the rape  cases and other atrocities committed by the terrorists and their  allies too. If Pakistan has been sending men and arms in huge  quantities across the border, visits to the valley by  international observers and human rights groups can easily bring  out this phenomenon and open the eyes of the world than any  assertion by the Government that such incursions actually exist.  There is no doubt that India has incontrovertible evidence of  many such intrusions, and is said to have handed over evidence  to Pakistan more than once. But anything that India can  demonstrate regarding such intrusions can ever equal the  effectiveness of the proof provided by international observers.    Once a strong Human Rights Commission functions in a fair  manner and identifies and punishes the offenders, and once free  access to the disturbed areas is available to the international  institutions and groups, India should publicise these facts in  world forum and get rid of the sharp criticism that it has had  to face. This will improve the credibility of India's arguments  which in themselves are good enough but are being demolished  owing to the emergence of the secondary and peripheral factors.    (c) Pakistan has been asking for a dialogue on Kashmir but  India has been refusing it. Now that under heavy pressure or  whatever India has agreed to a dialogue, another irritant which  bothered the international community has been removed. The  dialogue should focus on the alternative ways of tackling the  basic issue of Kashmir. India's position has all the  possibilities of being substantiated and a solution around  accepting the Line of Control will not be found to be the least  acceptable among the various alternatives.    (d) By far the most important element in the settlement of  the Kashmir issue would be the generation of new signals to the  Kashmir population to the effect that the political process will  soon be revived, that elections will be held, that a democratic  set-up will be in place, at any rate in the valley, that the  Kashmiris will be able to govern themselves as freely as the  Maharashtrians and Tamil people without an external party  breathing down their neck, and that adequate employment  opportunities would be made available to them within as well as  outside Kashmir.</p>

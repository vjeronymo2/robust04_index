			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidates of Technical Sciences A. Dubovoy and </F> S. Baskov, experts of the Association of Practitioners of Space  Science, under the rubric "Space Science Abroad": "The  `Spot'--Commerce or Reconnaissance?"]    [Text] Space systems for Earth observation have  traditionally been divided into civilian and military  reconnaissance. Many countries, however, can purchase and use  the information obtained by civilian satellites as  reconnaissance information if they do not possess their own  space hardware.    One visible example of this is the commercial application of  the French Spot-1 remote Earth sounding satellite, equipped with  two cameras with a resolution of 10 meters in the visible and 20  meters in the visible and near infrared spectrums. Its first  launch into space from the Kourou space facility into a  heliosynchronous orbit 832 km [kilometers] high was accomplished  by an Ariane launch vehicle in 1986. This resolution of the  special gear makes it possible to distinguish many  objects--roads, buildings, the dividing strips between  agricultural lands etc., but the pictures obtained are not  considered to be reconnaissance pictures in accordance with a  decision by the French government. This became the pledge of  commercial success for the firm of Spot-Image, which had  captured half of the world market for the sale of satellite data  as early as 1987. A broad opportunity appeared for the  acquisition and use of photography of various sections of the  Earth's surface, including secret military facilities and the  areas of combat operation and weapons deployment, by  governments, organizations and the mass media.    The fact that the information being disseminated could be  used for reconnaissance purposes was not only not a secret, but  was even vigorously advertised. Assistance was offered in some  materials for the identification of targets outside the limits  of accessibility of reconnaissance aircraft, including  determination of the positions of air-defense complexes, the  structuring of stereoscopic depictions of them and the approach  routes to targets. It was also pointed out that high-precision  digital models of the terrain created using the information  obtained from the spacecraft make it possible to create  databases for target designation for ground-attack aviation.    Many foreign specialists feel that the use of civilian  remote  Earth sounding satellites in the interests of various agencies,  including military ones, is the sole expedient way of making  highly efficient use of expensive space hardware. There are few  scientifically sophisticated and very expensive reconnaissance  systems of the American KH-11 type. The opportunity thus  appears, to the extent of improvements in the quality of  information from commercial satellites and reductions in the  time between requests and the receipt of materials, for the use  of the necessary data in a large number of fields with relevance  to national security. The U.S. Defense Department, for example,  spent six million dollars in 1990-91 for the procurement of  5,000 photos from the Spot satellites from the American  affiliate of the Spot-Image firm in Reston (Virginia). Some of  them (data on 24 airfields in the former USSR) were employed in  laying out routes to non-traditional destinations for the U.S.  Air Force, to ensure the safety of flights of American C-5 and  C-141 military-transport aircraft delivering humanitarian aid to  our cities.    There were about 240 portable systems for flight support  available to the U.S. Air Force at the beginning of 1992, which  could be programmed for the automatic modeling of images of  sections of terrain from any flight altitude according to the  information from Spot. The systems compare photos from the  spacecraft with digital geometric data on the terrain. The use  of this technology was launched after its successful utilization  during the war in the Persian Gulf.    Another interesting direction is the use of these satellites  for monitoring in the interests of maintaining peace and  international security. The Carnegie Worldwide Assistance Fund  was engaged in a study of this problem in 1988. Pictures from  the Spot and Landsat satellites and some other space systems  were studied. It was established that the Spot apparatus made it  possible to obtain images with high resolution that contained  more useful information than the Landsat pictures. All bridges  proved to be detectable in them, and measurement of the images  made it possible to obtain such important characteristics as the  traffic capacity of bridges. They were also able to determine  the deployment areas of headquarters, barracks and other  buildings, and the sites of motor-vehicle pools, airports and  air bases. Boeing-727 aircraft were also visible in the pictures.    The international community, based on the results of the  Carnegie Fund, has been discussing the possible creation (with  the presumed participation of the United Nations) of means to  provide for arms control in the interests of preserving peace  and stability. The tasks that could be accomplished with the aid  of such a space system include monitoring the observance of arms  treaty obligations, ceasefires and troop disbanding, as well as  supporting the efforts of popular diplomacy to defuse tense  situations.    Proceeding from this, the trend toward increasing the  resolution of the photos received remains as topical as before.  The Spot-4 spacecraft, planned to be launched in 1995, will be  equipped with modern HRVIR high-resolution cameras (visible and  near and middle infrared bands).    The Helios satellite is presumably being developed on this  basis in two versions--for reconnaissance in the optical band  and for radar reconnaissance. The resolution at the ground in  the optical band is expected to be no worse than one meter in  surveillance from an altitude of 600--700 km. The frequency of  observation of a system of two spacecraft should be one day.    Italy and Spain are taking part in the Helios project along  with France. The first launch of the satellite is planned for  1994, and the second in 1997. The extent to which they will be  able to be used as commercial satellites can be judged after  their launch.

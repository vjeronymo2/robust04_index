			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / ITV seeks changes in EC directive on fees THE ITV companies have launched a campaign to win changes in a proposed European Community directive which they fear could affect co-production funds and lead to the renegotiation of thousands of performers' contracts. The proposed directive would base payments to performers when a work was exploited in other markets, such as video rental and cable and satellite television, on 'an adequate proportion of income'. Mr Mike Chattin, ITV's industrial relations adviser, said yesterday the directive would have a serious effect on international co-productions. ITV said investors would not put money in productions 'if they did not know that they were purchasing full rights, free of any obligations to artists for the areas covered'. There are fears that the new obligations would put European television producers at a disadvantage compared with US and Australian programme makers.</p>

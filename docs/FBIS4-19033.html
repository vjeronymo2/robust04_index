			<p>BFN     [Text] Norway and Sweden have concluded in Brussels the  texts of the agreements on the conditions of EU membership.  Norway managed to get its demands on fishing concessions  included in the text of the agreement. The fishing questions  concerning Sweden's agreement were also solved a little while  ago. And the STT [Finnish Telegraph Agency] is reporting right  now that the text of the Finnish membership agreement has now  also been concluded. Austria concluded its negotiations last  night. The negotiations were urgent because the texts of the  agreements must be presented to the European Parliament today so  that the Parliament can vote on new members on 4 May.</p>

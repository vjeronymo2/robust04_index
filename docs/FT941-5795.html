			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Flemings to launch India fund Flemings is launching the first UK-listed investment trust concentrating on India. It will be a single country fund, rather than covering the sub-continent. The launch announcement has been delayed several weeks through problems with India's imposition of both short-term and long-term capital gains tax on foreign investors, except through Mauritius. The problems have been resolved. The trust hopes to raise Pounds 100m or more, to be raised through a placing, starting within a few weeks, and a public offer, possibly in May. The fund will be managed from Hong Kong by Jonathan Boyer, who already manages the Hong Kong-registered Jardine Fleming India unit trust. Research will come from Jardine Fleming's Bombay office.</p>

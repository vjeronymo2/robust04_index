			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> SHERIFF CONCLUDES DISMISSAL DEFENSE  </P> <P> The Ventura County Sheriff's Department wrapped up its case Wednesday before  the county Civil Service Commission in defense of its decision to fire an  officer for alleged incompetence and inefficiency, using testimony from three  of his training officers and his supervising sergeant.  </P> <P> Paul Duron, 28, who appealed his firing to the commission, is scheduled to  present his case today.  </P> <P> Duron's attorney, Paul Goyette, said he will call on Duron's supervisors at the  Ventura County Jail, where Duron served for two years before failing to  complete a two-month patrol officer's training course in 21 weeks.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the Sheriffs Department brought three of Duron's patrol training  officers to the witness stand, all of whom testified that Duron had trouble  reading maps, writing reports, picking up radio signals and locating the  appropriate sections of the vehicle code while writing traffic tickets.  </P> <P> Goyette said Duron was never given a chance to succeed after he fell behind  during the first weeks of his training program and that his client had proven  himself while working at the jail.

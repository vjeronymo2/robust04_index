			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- Serb Krajina President  Krajina Milan Martic today told the TANJUG reporter in Geneva  that negotiations on economic issues between Croatia and the  republic of Serb Krajina would be held on 16 and 17 June in  Plitvice.    This has been agreed with the Croatian side, Martic said.  This afternoon he talked in the Palace of Nations with special  UN envoy Yasushi Akashi and cochairmen of the Conference on the  Former Yugoslavia Owen and Stoltenberg. Martic said that in  Plitvice, talks will take place on economic issues regardless of  the unresolved political problems with Croatia. He confirmed  that there was full solidarity between the people of the  republic of Serb Krajina and their brethren in the republic of  Srpska and added that the Sava corridor was of vital importance  to them. The president of the republic of Serb Krajina also said  that his delegation might talk to UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali tomorrow in the Palace of Nations in Geneva.    At a later news conference, Owen and Stoltenberg described  today's talks as a small step in the right direction and added  that the next round of talks with the leaders of the republic of  Serb Krajina would take place on 30 June. They did not specify  the site or the agenda.</p>

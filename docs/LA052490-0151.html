			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO BURIES DEFENDING TITLIST KENNEDY, 7-3  </P> <P> San Fernando High baseball Coach Steve Marden has been through this playoff  business about a million times. Consequently, he has developed his own  terminology, partly to coerce, partly to scare his team.  </P> <P> After all, if a club shows up with its head in the sand at this stage of the  season, the other team might just kick dirt all over the rest of it.  </P> <P> Marden, then, is part caretaker, part undertaker. For instance, he refers to  the single-elimination format as "sudden death." And if that doesn't send a  chill up his team's collective spine, there's always the creaky, cobweb-filled  pine box in his office.  </P> <P> "There's an empty box inside the office," Marden said with a grin, "just  waiting to be filled up with uniforms."  </P> <P> A tad grim? Perhaps, but San Fernando was indeed the reaper Wednesday, taking  advantage of 11 walks to defeat visiting Kennedy, 7-3, in a City Section 4-A  Division quarterfinal game. San Fernando (18-6-2) will play El Camino Real in  the semifinals Friday.  </P> <P> From the outset, Marden ordered his team to sit back on Kennedy starter Denny  Sharp (8-5), who had pitched a complete game four days earlier. The tactic paid  off; Sharp walked four batters in the second inning, two of whom forced in runs  to help hand San Fernando a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> Trailing, 4-1, defending champion Kennedy (17-10) rallied for two unearned runs  in the fifth off left-hander Canto Franco. Ben Guzman led off with an infield  nubber and moved to second on Billy Ramirez's walk. With two out, Franco (9-0)  hit Troy Bourne in the foot, loading the bases for Garret Anderson, who had  doubled and scored Kennedy's first run in the fourth.  </P> <P> Anderson delivered, drilling an 0-2 curve off the glove of a leaping David  Rojas at second to bring Kennedy to within 4-3.  </P> <P> On came reliever John Najar, who had as much smoke on his fastball as he had  coming from his ears. Najar had come to the plate three times -- twice with the  bases loaded -- and stranded seven runners. In the bottom of the fifth, he  would fan for the second time with the bases loaded.  </P> <P> Time for atonement.  </P> <P> "I had to make up for that," Najar said. "That was embarrassing."  </P> <P> With runners at first and third, Najar retired Lazaro Campos on a grounder to  short to maintain the one-run lead.  </P> <P> San Fernando added two runs in the fifth on a pair of bases-loaded walks and  another in the sixth on a run-scoring single by sophomore shortstop Luis  Rodriguez, but Kennedy mounted one last rally in the seventh.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter John Davis led off with a double and moved to third on a single by  Jason Rosen. Najar then retired Bourne on a ground out, bringing up Anderson --  who has signed to play at Fresno State.  </P> <P> Najar struck out Anderson on three pitches, the last a wicked slider. Najar  walked Campos to load the bases before striking out Palmer Drain -- the  potential tying run -- to end the game.  </P> <P> Call it a stake through the heart.  </P> <P> "John didn't do the job with the stick," Marden said. "So I guess he realized  he had to do it with his arm."  </P></p>

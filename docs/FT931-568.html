			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Rally calls for industrial action over coal report MORE than 2,000 miners and their supporters, including nuclear power workers, rallied in central London yesterday to protest at the Coal White Paper, followed by a lobby of parliament, writes Lisa Wood. Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP, joined forces with Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM leader, to call on workers throughout the country to take industrial action to halt the pit closures. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman and Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the TUC, were both booed by sections of the crowd - who called upon the Labour party and the TUC to play a more prominent leadership role in the dispute.

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 TROJAN PLAYERS CHARGED;  </P> <P> COURTS: FRESHMEN MEMBERS OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM ARE ACCUSED IN ALLEGED SEXUAL  ASSAULT ON A COUNSELOR.  </P> <P> Misdemeanor charges were filed Monday in L.A. Municipal Court against three USC  football players in connection with an alleged sexual assault on a 23-year-old  graduate student, a spokesman for the city attorney's office said.  </P> <P> Freshmen Willie McGinest of Long Beach, Jason Oliver of Bakersfield and Michael  Jones of Granada Hills will be arraigned Nov. 2 in Division 82 of the municipal  court, spokesman Ted Goldstein said.  </P> <P> Jones, 18, faces one count of sexual battery, which carries a maximum sentence  of six months in county jail, a $2,000 fine or both, and one count of false  imprisonment, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in county jail, a  $1,000 fine or both.  </P> <P> McGinest, 19, and Oliver, 18, also face one count each of false imprisonment,  and one count each of battery, which carries a maximum sentence of six months  in county jail, a $2,000 fine or both.  </P> <P> The allegations stem from an incident July 20 in Pardee Tower, a campus  dormitory at USC. The alleged victim said that the players took her to a  dormitory room and assaulted her.  </P> <P> The woman was a peer counselor in a summer college indoctrination program in  which the players participated. The incident allegedly took place during a  program-ending party in the residence hall.  </P> <P> The case initially was brought to the L.A. County District Attorney's office,  which forwarded it to the city attorney's office. Charges were filed after  review of the case, which included interviews with six witnesses, Goldstein  said.  </P> <P> The three players remain on the team. Coach Larry Smith declined comment on the  charges, referring questions to Jim Dennis, USC's vice president in charge of  student affairs. Dennis said that the status of the players will remain  unchanged pending the outcome of criminal procedures.  </P></p>

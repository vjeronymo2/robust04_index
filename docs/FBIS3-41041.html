He said in an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine that it was  necessary to consider some provisions of the trilateral  statement in the parliament. In his words, it was hard to  understand "why primarily the SS-24 missiles controlled by us  must be withdrawn from Ukrainian territory and not the obsolete  SS-19 which we do not control and cannot launch."    In his opinion, "it was necessary to demand the  states-parties to the Helsinki, Paris, Vienna and Lisbon  agreements and the UN member-states to participate in the  agreement of the three presidents. It is necessary that not  only Ukraine give up its missiles but that the other parties  also reduce their numbers," Kotsuba pointed out.</p>

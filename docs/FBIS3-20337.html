Following the second round of the cantonal  elections, which did not live up to all that the majority and  especially the Matignon [prime minister's office] expected,  Edouard Balladur yesterday called together the young leaders of  the university and high school student movements which are  organizing demonstrations against the CIP (Job Training  Contracts). It was a two-hour working meeting which, although  it did not defuse the student protest since Thursday's [24  March] protest meeting will take place, opens the door to an  honorable compromise to replace the CIP rejected by the young  people with another more appropriate system. This is a  compromise which enables the government to come out with its  head high from this social stalemate, while giving the young  people guarantees of "good will." This is a strategic maneuver  preceding the final withdrawal of the plan, which the Hotel  Matignon wishes to approach in two stages: suspension of the  CIP for a week, long enough to start negotiations with the  representative organizations; replacement of the CIP after this  period by another plan which will have been negotiated and  approved.    Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said at the end of this  working meeting that "the government does not intend to make the  CIP a taboo. There are 750,000 unemployed people in France  below the age of 25, in other words four times as many as in  Germany. Of this figure, there are 690,000 young unemployed  people without qualifications. We cannot tell them that we are  no longer bothering with them." Therefore, because the CIP  presents problems, "it must be replaced by a new formula which  addresses youngsters' concerns. The government wishes to  succeed" through consultation. "The negotiations are open and  young people are not without imagination. All formulas are on  the table. When there is good will...."    The government is therefore proposing to reopen the issue on  the basis of three points:    1. The CIP is suspended for one week. During this time, a  mission headed by Michel Le Bon, director general of the ANPE  [National Employment Agency], will work on drawing up a new  formula in consultation with the employers' and employees'  organizations and with representatives of the university and  high school students. "Only detailed consultation and the  support of the majority will make it possible to find a solution  to the problem of youth unemployment," Edouard Balladur  stresses. The prime minister is also putting forward the idea  of setting up a job-seeking service for young people, which  would be equivalent to a youth ANPE.    2. The prime minister wants a general meeting on youth held  shortly because "its problems are not limited to employment."  He therefore wishes to alert the public authorities, the local  councils, the associations, and young people themselves to  preparation for such a meeting. It will be organized in the  coming weeks by an interministerial committee bringing together  the government chief, National Education Minister Francois  Bayrou, Higher Education Minister Francois Fillon, and Youth and  Sports Minister Michele Alliot-Marie.    3. The government pledges to study new ways of establishing  a dialogue with young people which "enables them to participate  in a number of bodies, in which they are not currently  represented."  <H5>  No `Revealed Truth' </H5>   Young people have sent us several messages by demanding the  abrogation of the CIP, Nicolas Sarkozy added. They are  expressing "a desire for dialogue" and a need for recognition.  "They are saying to us: Trust us, we have ideas too. We will  not hold back this confidence." Under pressure on the one hand  from a section of his majority to take a firm stance against the  youth demonstrations and to speed up his reform program, and  worried on the other about the risks of escalation prompted by  the growing number of demonstrations, Mr. Balladur is seeking a  way out which enables him to calm things down without giving the  impression of "backing down." Last week, speaking to several  journalists, he expressed surprise at the tension surrounding  the CIP when there was no malice in the government's approach.  He remarked that it was not his plan which was being booed in  the streets, but the bill amended and rewritten by the deputies.  "I do not identify with the idea of revealed truth," he said.  "When you realize that a law" does not correspond to the  country's expectations, and is not understood "it must be  changed." But how to back down without giving the impression of  crumbling under the pressure of a minority and without exposing  yourself to the criticism of your political friends? The second  round of the cantonal elections, which resulted in a drop in  votes for the majority, gave him the opportunity to back down  without risking too much criticism from a section of the  majority. On Sunday evening, Mr. Balladur announced a series of  initiatives to help young people. On Monday morning, he  telephoned student leaders to invite them to come and talk.    They arrived punctually. They put forward three  preconditions for the opening of dialogue: withdrawal of the  CIP; release of the imprisoned demonstrators; and return to  France of the two Algerians expelled. "We have not come here to  sidestep the issue," one of the 17 "guests" said as he entered  the Matignon. And yet, aside from the FIDL [Independent  Federation of High School Students] (organization close to the  Socialist Party), which walked out after one hour of  discussions, the other groups chose the path of negotiation. "I  can only give you an answer on one point," Mr. Balladur told  them in substance, "that of the CIP. The other two depend on the  legal authorities and it is not for the government to exert any  pressure." While maintaining "the pressure" in the schools and  universities, the students agreed to participate in the proposed  consultation. "We obtained partial satisfaction," Philippe  Campinchi, from the UNEF-ID [National Union of French  Students-Independent and Democratic]. "We welcome the  government's change of tone... We say yes to the mission to  extricate young people from unemployment and despair. It is a  first step. It must be continued."</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOST STOCKS ADVANCE, BUT DOW SLIPS 0.18  </P> <P> The stock market turned in an indecisive showing Thursday, pausing after its  rally of the past three sessions.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 38.48 in the week's first three  trading days, slipped 0.18 to 2,281.34.  </P> <P> But advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New  York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 726 up, 716 down and 498 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume came to 159.95 million shares, up from 144.24 million  Wednesday.  </P> <P> NYSE trading has been listless this week. Only about 560 million shares have  changed hands. But some analysts said Thursday's performance was encouraging.  </P> <P> "There were more gains in some stocks than I've seen in a long time," said  Louis Ehrenkrantz, money manager at Reich &amp; Co. "That's a healthy sign. I  think we're looking at money seeking individual stock selections."  </P> <P> But others said investors will wait until they have more confidence in the  economy's direction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Analysts Still Concerned  </P> <P> "It (the market) is puzzling over what the trend of events might be," said  Monte Gordon, research director at Dreyfus Corp. "It's a very emotional market.  Three weeks ago we worried about inflation; now we're worried about recession."  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported Thursday morning that new factory orders  declined 2.3% in February.  </P> <P> That provided fresh support for the view that the pace of the economy began to  slow last month.  </P> <P> But analysts have been reluctant to conclude from a single month's data that  the Federal Reserve has succeeded in its efforts to subdue inflationary  pressures by tightening credit.  </P> <P> The first indication of whether the slowing continued in March isn't expected  to come until the Labor Department's monthly employment report late next week.  </P> <P> In the meantime, stocks got little support from the bond market, where interest  rates rose slightly.  </P> <P> Money center bank stocks were strong for the second straight session,  apparently benefiting from increased confidence among institutional money  managers about their prospects for weathering Third World debt problems.  </P> <P> Bank shares dominated the list of active stocks, rising before Sunday's  International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings, which may clarify the  Third World debt situation. A bank symposium Wednesday embraced Treasury  Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan to reduce Third World debt, analysts said.  </P> <P> Citicorp rose 1 to 29 1/2, Chase Manhattan rose 1 3/8 to 37, BankAmerica added  5/8 to 24 1/2 and Continental Bank climbed 7/8 to 21.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Genentech Stock Falters  </P> <P> Illinois Power led the active list, down 1 3/4 at 14 on turnover of more than  4.3 million shares. The Illinois Commerce Commission granted a much smaller  rate increase than the company had sought.  </P> <P> Genentech dropped 1 5/8 to 17 3/4. An article in the New England Journal of  Medicine reported on a study suggesting that the company's clot-dissolving drug  for treatment of heart attacks is no more effective than a much less expensive  alternative drug.  </P> <P> Smithkline Beckman, which markets the alternative drug, rose 7/8 to 55 5/8.  Smithkline has also been the subject lately of takeover rumors and speculation.  </P> <P> Sears, Roebuck rose 1/2 to 43 1/2. The company announced plans for a major  revamping of its organizational structure.  </P> <P> The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,892.618, up 3.488.  </P> <P> Blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 3,337 compared to  Wednesday's 3,026.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged up 0.13 to  164.38.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 0.06 to 336.86; its 500-stock  composite index was up 0.17 at 292.52.  </P> <P> The NASDAQ composite index gained 0.86 to 404.56; the American Stock Exchange  market-value index closed at 325.47, down 0.11.  </P> <P> Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soared to another record on the strength of  a late rally Thursday, spurred by a weakening U.S. dollar and renewed interest  in Japanese government bonds. The Nikkei 225-share index jumped 88.85 to close  at 32,826.13, its second straight record high.  </P> <P> On the London Stock Exchange, share prices closed sharply lower after a steep  drop in the afternoon. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 22.3, or 1.1%,  to 2,049.4.  </P></p>

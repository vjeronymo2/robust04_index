			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Major Bank Fined for Money Laundering: U.S. District Judge William Hodges  ordered Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International to forfeit more than $15  million after pleading guilty to drug money laundering charges in a case with  links to deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega and Colombian cocaine  traffickers. Hodges also placed two divisions of the Luxembourg-based bank on  five years' probation for their role in a $32-million laundering operation. The  sentence imposed by the judge was in line with a plea bargain deal that BCCI  reached with federal prosecutors in mid-January to avoid facing a criminal  trial in Tampa, Fla.  </P></p>

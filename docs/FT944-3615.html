			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Greeks strike over curbs on tax evasion Greece yesterday felt the first impact of the finance ministry's new effort to reduce tax evasion by self-employed workers: taxi drivers, truckers and bus drivers staged a nationwide 24-hour strike. The union of professional drivers threatened to hold more strikes over the Christmas holidays unless the government drops measures designed to increase tax paid by the owner-drivers who control most of Greece's road transport industry. The drivers' walk-out launched a wave of strikes ahead of Friday's parliamentary debate on the 1995 budget, which restricts public sector wage increases and attempts to broaden the tax base by setting objective indicators for assessing incomes in the private sector. The drivers object to a directive making the purchase of a new taxi, truck or bus an indicator of their income level. They also refuse to pay a 30 per cent tax on transfers of vehicle operating licences and a one-off tax on income earned over the past 10 years. A finance ministry official said: 'Road transport has escaped proper regulation because it's seen as a public service, and the drivers have taken advantage of this. Like other self-employed workers, they have to start contributing their share.' The self-employed, from doctors and lawyers to plumbers and drivers, make up about 20 per cent of the Greek workforce. They sustain an underground economy estimated at more than 30 per cent of gross domestic product, according to the finance ministry. However, the main tax burden is carried by public sector workers and pensioners whose taxes are deducted at source. The finance ministry is counting on a successful crackdown on tax evasion next year, together with settlement of more than 700,000 pending income tax disputes, in order to boost budget revenues by more than Dr300bn (Pounds 790m). The Greek trade union federation has called a 24-hour strike for tomorrow in protest against next year's income policy, which restricts increases for public sector workers to 6.1 per cent, against a projected inflation rate of almost 8 per cent. The civil servants' union has called a four-hour work stoppage the same day which is expected to shut government ministries, public utilities and state-controlled banks.</p>

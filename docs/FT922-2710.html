			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Technology: Price is the name of the game - How PC makers are striking back as cheap clones invade their market What's in a name? Not much, it seems, when it comes to personal computers. Over the past year an overwhelming number of personal computer buyers have decided that cheap 'clones' from little-known manufacturers will do the job just as well as the more expensive brand-name PCs from companies such as International Business Machines and Compaq Computer. The trend is forcing startling changes in the personal computer industry. Compaq yesterday launched a range of 'affordable' desktop and notebook computers, abandoning its decade-old 'premium pricing' strategy. IBM is taking a different tack. By establishing its own clone-sales subsidiaries in Europe and Canada, the market leader aims to preserve the quality-brand image of its own PS/2 and PS/1 product lines, while participating in the fast-growing, 'price-sensitive' segment of the market. For both companies, these are painful adjustments. In the 1980s they dominated personal computer market trends, vied for technology leadership and looked down their corporate noses at the lesser 'second- and third-tier' clone makers. But by last year 'premium branded' personal computers, including those from other large computer companies such as NCR, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba, accounted for less than one third of personal computer unit sales in the US, according to market researchers International Data Corporation. 'We lost some of our customers' business,' acknowledges Eckart Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive. Corporate buyers, among them some of Compaq's best customers, switched to lower-priced vendors when Compaq's price premium became too high to justify, the company now recognises. Yet as IBM and Compaq struggle to stem their market share losses, they face a tumult of competition from hundreds of clone makers vying for a piece of a shrinking market. US unit sales of PCs declined by 12 per cent for the three months ending in April, according to David Korus, a Kidder Peabody analyst, and revenues were down 26 per cent. The average selling price of personal computers is plummeting. Mounting competition in the market for microprocessors, the 'brain' chips inside personal computers, has fuelled the fire. Intel, for several years the sole supplier of microprocessor chips to PC manufacturers, is now engaged in a market battle with Advanced Micro Devices and a growing cadre of microprocessor companies with their own versions of Intel's chips. More important, however, is the shifting attitude of personal computer buyers. 'Customers have matured from an intimidated, non-technical, obedient audience to a savvy, price-sensitive, well-educated, hard-to-please market,' observes Lucianne Painter, Salomon Brothers' PC industry analyst. One explanation for the ferment in the personal computer market is that a bulge of second-time buyers; those who first purchased a PC when the industry was in its heyday, has coincided with economic recessions in the US and Europe, creating a high degree of price sensitivity. Corporate PC buyers are now also tuned to the rapid advancement of personal computer technology. Two years ago, PCs based on Intel's 286 microprocessor were top sellers. Today, these machines are almost obsolete, unable to take full advantage of the latest PC software such as Microsoft's Windows. The PC is fast becoming a disposable product. Like yesterday's newspaper, a three-year-old PC is hardly worth saving, even though it may still be in working order. Thus the longevity of higher priced, more rugged brand-name PCs becomes of questionable value. Yet reliability and quality remain a serious concern among PC buyers, especially where PC networks have become the backbone of a company's information systems. The dilemma for brand-name suppliers is how to compete in the lower margin segment of the market without losing the 'quality' image that has set them apart in the past. For Compaq, the answer has been to reduce drastically its costs through a big restructuring of operations, and now to offer what the company calls 'affordable quality' products. Compaq's new ProLinea desktop PCs and its Contura notebook computers are designed to compete with the clones. US prices start at Dollars 899 for a desktop 386SX model with a 40Mbyte hard drive, and Dollars 1,700 for a notebook computer based on a 386SL microprocessor. Compaq's new products will not be the cheapest, but the differential between its prices and those of lesser-known manufacturers will be substantially reduced and the company aims to lure buyers with a Dollars 100m advertising campaign stressing the reliability of its products. 'We have done all the things we felt we had to do to win our corporate customers back, and in addition to become a strong competitor in the small business and individual buyers segments of the market,' says Pfeiffer. However, the danger for Compaq is that in cutting costs it may also have compromised its quality controls. Not so, Pfeiffer insists, although the final 'burn-in' tests performed on its new models are significantly shorter than those for more expensive Compaq products. Even so, Compaq's engineering and manufacturing strengths are widely recognised and its testing is extremely rigorous. Unlike Compaq, IBM will not legitimise the clones sold by its new subsidiaries with its own corporate logo. The 'Ambra' products, manufactured in Asia by an unnamed third party, will be 'no better or worse' than other clones, Cannavino says. The Ambra products will not benefit from the exhaustive testing of quality and compatibility that IBM demands for its own PS/1 and PS/2 product lines, he stresses. Neither will IBM's sales force be compensated for selling Ambra products. For PC buyers, the latest moves by IBM and Compaq raise anew the question of whether price should be the primary consideration in purchasing a PC. 'For large organisations that rely heavily on PCs, buying cheap ones makes no sense,' says Cheryl Currid, an industry consultant who studies the use of clones by US companies. Low-cost clones are more prone to failure, Currid maintains, and there are 'very real compatibility issues'. The true costs of such problems are much higher than the price of a new PC, she points out. 'The real expense is the loss of productivity.' Yet a recent survey of PC users by PC Magazine, a US publication, suggests that clones are equally as reliable as brand-name PCs and that many users of brand-name machines are inclined to purchase their next one from a clone maker. One thing is clear, the price of PCs will continue to fall rapidly. IBM is expected once again to slash prices on some brand-name PCs and a host of other companies are said to be planning to follow suit, accelerating the price war. Many analysts are predicting an industry shakeout as profit margins are squeezed. The most vulnerable companies are those offering the lowest-priced clones. 'When there are too many suppliers and too much undifferentiated product, a shakeout inevitably occurs. We believe that 1992 marked the beginning of consolidation in the PC hardware industry,' say analysts at Salomon Brothers. For PC buyers this raises another new consideration. How much is it worth to know, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the company you buy a PC from today will still be there to support it in a year's time?</p>

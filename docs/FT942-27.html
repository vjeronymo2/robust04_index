			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (5): Staying ahead of the law - Case study - Rhone-Poulenc of France Rhone-Poulenc, one of France's largest chemicals groups, has also been one of the most ambitious with respect to environmental policy. In 1992, it set itself a target of reducing emissions in water, air and solid waste by 50 per cent by 1995, taking 1990 as a base year, and by 65 per cent by the year 2000. According to Mr Jean-Marc Bruel, vice chairman and head of the group's environmental policies since the early 1980s, the setting of fixed targets and the publication of the data represent the second major step in the field of environmental protection. The first step dates back to 1981 when Mr Jean Gandois, then chairman, appointed a manager to deal exclusively with environmental issues. Since then, Mr Bruel claims that Rhone-Poulenc, along with other French and European chemicals companies, has made significant progress in reducing pollution and protecting the environment. 'We have always been ahead of legislation,' he says, citing the company's adoption of the responsible care programme, a charter for environmental protection in the industry which was first introduced in Canada. 'No other industry has made the kind of progress that has been seen in Chemicals.' He says that efforts in France to respond to the problems of environmental pollution from the chemicals industry have been assisted by an administrative system whereby regional government has the ability to fine and to subsidise polluting industries. Rhone-Poulenc is itself spending a substantial amount on reducing pollution and increasing safety, despite the constraints of recession and the group's debt burden. Over the past two years, the company has committed FFr3.6bn on environmental and safety projects, the lion's share in France and the US. But how effective has this expenditure been? The publication last month of its annual environmental report shows a mixed result. 'We are on target with respect to water pollution, for air emissions we are a little behind our target, but we can make this up. It is solid waste has proved the problem,' says Mr Bruel. Mr Bruel's conclusions are drawn from a detailed series of pollution and safety indices, audited by the accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and in line with the format adopted by Cefic, the European chemicals industry federation. At the end of last year, according to these statistics, the index of water pollution showed a 32 per cent decline from the base year of 1990. 'This should enable the goal of a 50 per cent reduction by 1995 to be achieved,' he says. The air index improved last year year by 9.5 per cent, bringing the total reduction since 1990 to 23 per cent. 'We are a little behind schedule, but I think we can maintain the target because we will make a big push over the next two years,' says Mr Bruel. In the area of waste, however, hitting the target will be a harder proposition. In 1993, the index remained static, showing just an 18 per cent decline from 1990. Part of the explanation, according to Mr Bruel, lies in a shift in emphasis, since 1990, towards increased prevention and safety, rather than remedies. 'We have put more money into the prevention of accidents,' he says. 'Why? because when you have an accident you have a pollution that is short in timescale but very significant in its immediate effects.' The stability of the waste index, however, also reflects the conflicts between some of the group's environmental objectives and the priorities attached to the various targets. 'We attach the greatest importance to reducing emissions in water,' says Mr Bruel. 'But when you solve the problem with water, generally you generate some waste.' The stubbornness of solid waste pollution was magnified by the system used by Rhone-Poulenc to calculate the various pollution indices. According to this system, the various pollutants are assigned a coefficient which is determined by their undesirability. In air emissions, for example, nitrogen oxide is given a relatively high coefficient of 5. In water, salt has a coefficient of a mere 0.001. In 1993, the neutralisation of toxic waste at the company's Le Havre plant led to landfill storage of inert residue from calcium sulfate. Because this has a high coefficient of 10, the impact on the solid waste index was correspondingly increased. Despite the hiccough in the solid waste department, however, Mr Bruel is confident that the objective of a 65 per cent improvement by 2000 is attainable. 'The target of a 50 per cent reduction by 1995 will be delayed, but a research programme for clean technologies is underway to correct this trend,' the company says. Clean technologies for the group's final products are also of growing importance in the battle against pollution. According to Mr Bruel, the group is developing an expanding number of products which reduce harmful waste and emissions at every stage of their lifecycle. The Regent insecticide, for example, which has been launched by the company, degrades without creating toxins. The Nabion detergent, produced with sodium carbonate and sodium silicate, is completely soluble in water and requires no treatment. Internal efforts are, however, not the only considerations. The wider economic situation also has a bearing on the levels of pollution produced by Rhone-Poulenc's plants. According to the company's environmental report for last year, the largest single factor behind the improvement in the water index resulted from reduced business activity. The next most important factor was technical progress, which accounted for 4.5 per cent of the improvement.</p>

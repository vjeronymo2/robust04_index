			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / International Company News: The victim of a data revolution  -Citicorp got left behind after buying Quotron Mr Walter Wriston, the legendary head of Citicorp until the mid-1980s, had grand plans in the information services business. 'Information about money is almost as important as money itself,' he once said. 'The information business could easily rival any of our banking businesses as a profit generator in the 1990s.' It was one of those sweeping, visionary statements of which Citibank bosses are so fond. Mr John Reed, Mr Wriston's chosen successor and the current chairman, is also given to such weighty ponderings. And it was Mr Reed who, acting on Mr Wriston's precept, pushed through the bank's bold Dollars 680m acquisition of Quotron, a supplier of screen-based financial information, in 1986. The extent of the gap between Citicorp's ambitions and the realities of the information services business finally became clear this week, as the US's biggest bank announced it was selling Quotron's stock-price information business to Reuters (it will keep Quotron's foreign exchange business). The bank had written down its investment in the information company by Dollars 400m in October 1991, and is thought to have been looking to dispose of it ever since. Now, it is taking a further Dollars 179m charge and has agreed to pay Reuters money if Quotron's weakened market position deteriorates much further. Quotron's problems spring from its failure to adapt to a market which has changed quickly in recent years. When acquired by Citicorp, it was the market leader in the US equity market, with some 80,000 of its screens in use. The market for screen services was growing fast and price competition among information providers had yet to bite. Things look very different now. For a start, the market (estimated at around 150,000-200,000 screens in the US) has stopped growing. The provision of share-price quotations (the basic 'quote vendor' service on which Quotron's business is based) is a low-value service for which prices have been falling: prices supplied by the New York Stock Exchange are available for onward transmission to any information provider, making this a 'commodity product'. At the same time, Citicorp admits to a lack of investment in Quotron's products until recently, when it revamped its service for the small brokers and institutional investors who comprise the low-value end of the share-price information market. Quotron's competitors, led by Automated Data Processing, have been more ambitious, adding additional services to their basic quote service and developing interactive screens. Also, many users now prefer to take share-price quotes in the form of an electronic feed, which they can then access on PCs. The decline in Quotron's market share indicates that it has been left behind. Citicorp puts the number of Quotron screens still in use at 'more than 40,000'. Big national broking firms such as Dean Witter and Kidder Peabody have dropped its service, though Paine Webber remains a customer. The company has been left to concentrate on the low-value end of the market, where users pay little - typically Dollars 100 a month or less - or a basic quote and news service. The difference between the Quotron service and that provided by rivals like ADP and Reuters is like 'the difference between a Hyundai and a Mercedes Benz', says Mr Michael Ellmann, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder. Quotron's problems have also sprung from the uncertainty about its future over the past two years. The question now is whether Reuters can make any money out of the business. It is reported to have touted the idea of a screen service for the low end of the US equity market at the beginning of the decade, only to pull back when it concluded there was not enough money to be made. Things may have changed since then. For a start, the technology has moved on. It may be possible for Reuters to find other ways to deliver the Quotron service, at a profit. The UK company may also believe it can sell its Instinet share trading service, which has become a highly profitable operation, to Quotron's users. Much will depend on how much Reuters has to invest to develop Quotron and strengthen its market position. Based on its current customer base, the Quotron acquisition will make Reuters one of the two biggest providers of screen-based information to the equity markets alongside ADP, with around 40 per cent of the market between them. It will also reinforce the UK company's attempts to move beyond the foreign exchange market, where it is a dominant force, and extend its leadership into other financial markets.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: US administration no longer has eyes solely for Tokyo - Subtle changes in the relationship IN Washington for talks with the Clinton administration recently, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, was very diplomatic in public. As far as putting together an assistance package for Russia was concerned, he declared that Japan had 'behaved correctly and shrewdly as chairman of the G7'. Privately, a senior British official was willing to impart a subtle nuance. 'The great US concern,' he said, 'was not to undermine Japanese leadership of the G7, to which Japan attaches such importance.' Thus the question of an emergency summit of the leaders of the industrialised nations after a ministerial meeting in Tokyo in mid-April, but before the scheduled annual get-together in the Japanese capital in July, had been 'held in reserve for the moment'. There is no reason to dispute either version. Whatever its motivations and its misgivings, Japan has a lot to offer Russia by way of practical assistance and the meeting of foreign and finance ministers may well be substantive. It would also be true to form that Washington would not want to be seen to put at risk its considerable leverage over Tokyo, even to the extent of indulging the formalistic Japanese obsession with 'great events', particularly when it plays host. However, publicly and privately senior members of the US administration are prepared to be less kind. President Bill Clinton himself used his first formal press conference to deliver a frontal assault on the intractability of Japan's bilateral trade surplus with the US. Mr Mickey Kantor, his trade representative, complains about Japan's refusal to engage in serious discussions about the Uruguay Round. Other officials have been talking freely of the need for 'managed trade' and quantitative targets in negotiations with Japan. Reports from Tokyo are of increasing scepticism from the US Treasury about the details of Japanese macro-economic policies. This is not at all what Japan has come to expect of its relationship with Washington. No matter how many Japanese radios were smashed on the lawns of Congress, no matter how many political candidates threatened dark retaliations, there was always the assumption that at least the president understood that Japan required special treatment. Yet this was a Cold War protection, understandable when Japan, harbouring 860,000 US military personnel and blithely denying that US nuclear weapons ever entered its territory in violation of its own non-nuclear policies, was a necessary US strategic bulwark in Asia. North Korea's renunciation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty recently was a tart reminder of potential instability but even before that the Clinton administration, unlike that of President Jimmy Carter, had shown no inclination to flutter the Asian dovecotes further by contemplating military withdrawal. But, in the new administration's holistic view of the world, relations with other countries are no longer defined solely on the basis of their value as security assets, with all other aspects, such as trade, confined to separate, insulated compartments. As repeatedly explained by Mr Clinton himself, national security now has a big economic component - and the US Congress, if differently motivated, agrees with him. This is precisely why Japan, once comfortable in the certitudes of the Cold War and in its recognition as a fully paid-up member of the G7, is currently discomfited. It does not help that its own economy is under unaccustomed duress and that its political leadership is more than usually weak and introspective. This puts the US on the horns of a dilemma. At the very least, Japan was a dependable ally. If it could not send troops to the Gulf, it did send money (now, as in Cambodia, it is doing both). If it was exhorted to expand its economy to help global growth, it usually obliged (though the capacity to do so now may be more limited). Its contributions were enough that Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, was prepared to acknowledge recently that, in theory, Japan's case for permanent membership of the UN Security Council had, along with Germany's, been made. Barring a miracle, it is unlikely that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, will get an assurance, if he has the nerve to seek it from Mr Clinton when he comes to Washington in the middle of this month, that the US will push its case at the UN. It will not be enough for Japan to offer a trade concession here and an economic stimulus package there. Japan is facing the necessity, perhaps for the first time in the post-war years in what both sides still ritualistically call 'the most important bilateral relationship in the world', of widening its own horizons, of broadening its own perception of national self-interest, in order to continue to enjoy US trust and even protection. As the senior British official noted, the emergency G7 summit to assist Russia is still 'held in reserve', not shelved for good. The July summit can still have its place in the Japanese sun, but only if the industrialised world acts in the meanwhile, assuming there is something to act on and with. Helping Russia, in the US view, now matters more than catering to Japanese sensibilities. That is a serious, if still not irrevocable, sea change for Japan.</p>

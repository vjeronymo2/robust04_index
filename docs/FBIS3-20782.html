Jaksic: "The Blackmailing of Former JNA </F> Officers"]    [Text] Ljubljana 15 February -- It seems even officers of  the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] have not been spared in  the merciless showdowns between Slovene politicians, as  eloquently indicated by the personal account in MLADINA of  Ljubljana of Sefko Suljevic, a captain in the former JNA. He  says that in Vienna, where he has applied for political asylum,  he had a visit from officials of the Slovene Defense Ministry  who asked him to supply them compromising material on Slovene  President Milan Kucan and Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek,  and in return they would provide him all the necessary Slovene  documents to return to his wife and children in Slovenacka  Ribnica, from whom he has been virtually separated for nearly  three years now.    Suljevic's story, however, is also of interest because of  many other details indicative of the character of the brief war  between the JNA and the Slovene militiamen and of the methods  used at that time by Slovene paramilitary units in attacking  garrisons or in unscrupulous showdowns even with those officers  of the former JNA who wanted to join their ranks, as in fact was  the case with Capt Suljevic, who was serving as  counterintelligence officer in Ribnica. In spite of his  "expressed loyalty to the Slovene state," then, Suljevic  encountered the kind of violence and savagery he never expected  to see even in his worst nightmare.    Suljevic first recalls the altogether unprovoked attack of  the Slovene militiamen on the garrison in Ribnica, although  Lojze Cesarek, territorial defense representative, had promised  on behalf of territorial defense that the garrison would not be  attacked.    After that Suljevic responded to the appeal of Slovene  authorities that was sent to all officers of the JNA, he left  the garrison and reported to Slovene territorial defense. He  reported personally to Tone Krnovic, commander of the "Moris"  Brigade, who incidentally is still the commanding officer of  that unit, but in Ljubljana, where they took him, he experienced  a real drama.    As soon as he arrived in Ljubljana, he was for all practical  purposes arrested and taken to Krkovic in handcuffs. "They  interrogated and beat me for four hours, and then they took me  to some basement where they stripped me naked and put me before  a firing squad. They gave me 20 seconds to tell them the names  of my collaborators, I waited, leaning against the wall, for  them to shoot me, and then someone came and took me out of that  basement."    Suljevic's story then turns back upon itself, since after he  was released from prison he went to Bar on a ship of the  Yugoslav Navy, but again he decided to leave the JNA and to  return to Slovenia, which again arranged a similar "welcome,"  until he ended up in Vienna, where he is still awaiting  political asylum, but he is not giving up on his intention to  return to Slovenia and join his family. The crowning touch is  actually the sudden about-face in the behavior of the Slovene  authorities towards him after the visit in Vienna by two men  from the intelligence service of the Slovene Defense Ministry,  who proposed that as a former counterintelligence officer he  prepare material compromising Kucan and Drnovsek (that material,  according to what he was told by those who visited him, is  supposedly in Belgrade), and then the Defense Ministry would  allow him to return to Slovenia.    Suljevic wrote a letter about this to Kucan and Drnovsek in  which he gave the details of that blackmail attempt as well as  the information that one of the two blackmailers was well-known  to him. The only question was whether Kucan and Drnovsek would  get on the trail and use the Suljevic case in the hot showdown  with Janez Jansa, Slovene defense minister.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SAVANNA DEFEATS MAGNOLIA, CLINCHES BERTH IN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Anaheim Savanna, once one of the least successful high school football teams in  Orange County and last season among the most notorious, erased some bad  memories Thursday night at Glover Stadium.  </P> <P> By virtue of a 42-0 victory over Magnolia, the Rebels clinched a spot in the  Southern Section Division VI playoffs.  </P> <P> It will be their first playoff appearance since 1983.  </P> <P> A year ago, the Rebels finished as the Orange League's co-champion with  Valencia. However, they had to forfeit all of their games because of an  ineligible player. The team's booster club attempted to get a court order to  reinstate the Rebels, but were denied.  </P> <P> Brad Belanger led the Rebels by completing 16 of 20 passes for 217 yards and  four touchdowns. Belanger had 155 yards passing the first half, throwing  touchdown passes of 14 and 20 yards to Hien Nguyen and nine yards to Scott  Bird.  </P> <P> Savanna is 6-2-2 overall and 3-1-1 in the league play. Magnolia is 1-9 and 0-5.  CHRIS FOSTER  </P></p>

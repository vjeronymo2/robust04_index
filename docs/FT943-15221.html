			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Fewer charities to be examined Thousands of charities are likely to escape the requirement for an annual independent examination of their accounts, under proposals to be unveiled by the government later this month. Charities with gross receipts of less than Pounds 10,000 year will require no external scrutiny, while those below Pounds 250,000 a year will not be required to conduct a full audit. The thresholds, which were proposed by the charity committee of the government's deregulation taskforce, have been accepted by the Department of Trade and Industry, according to a member of the committee. Mr Andrew Phillips, senior partner of Bates Wells and Braithwaite, the law firm, said the DTI was due to announce them as part of the taskforce's recommendations on July 19. He rejected the suggestion that relaxing the requirements might encourage fraud. 'A vast number of charities in the UK are run off someone's kitchen table,' he said. 'Fraudsters are not going to be either encouraged or discouraged by regulations.' The proposals remain stricter than the audit exemption requirements being introduced for limited companies. At present all require an audit, but changes from this autumn will remove the requirement for those with a turnover of less than Pounds 350,000 a year. Charities which are also incorporated will almost certainly be required to meet the higher standard under the charities requirement - exemption only for those with income below Pounds 250,000. A number of the committee's suggestions have been put forward as amendments to the deregulation and contracting-out bill being discussed in committee in the House of Lords.</p>

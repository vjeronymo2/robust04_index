			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Language indicates that crop damage caused by insects or disease is covered unless the damage is due to insufficient or improper application of control measures. It has always been the loss adjustor's responsibility to determine if good farming practices are carried out by the producer. This responsibility includes determining if cultural practices necessary to control insects and disease are followed. The new language does not change current loss adjustment procedures, or give loss adjustors the latitude to require unreasonable control measures. The language is intended to clearly advise insureds that they are expected to take control measures that typically would be used in the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment recommended adding the following language under failure of water supply as an insured cause of loss: ``(water source and means for supplying irrigation water, without regard to equipment or facilities). This includes the water source, dams, canals, ditches, pipelines, etc., necessary to supply water for movement from the source to the acreage but does not include any irrigation equipment or facilities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Failure of the irrigation water supply during the insurance period is a covered cause of loss. The ``supply'' includes several items not included in the recommendation, e.g., aquifers, precipitation, etc. Also covered are off-farm irrigation facilities and equipment used by water regulators and suppliers. The recommended language would not provide coverage when such facilities failed. Language in the proposed rule will remain unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment inquired if the provision concerning wheat replant payments includes replant payments for winter wheat as well as spring wheat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions provide a replant payment for winter wheat in counties with both a fall and spring final planting date, only if the winter wheat is damaged after the fall final planting date. A replant payment is also provided to replant spring wheat in counties with a spring final planting date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five comments were received opposing paying replant payments for wheat. The comments stated that: (a) Insureds have not requested replant payments for spring wheat; (b) insureds are currently replanting or ``sweetening'' stands at their own minimal expense; (c) replant payments for spring wheat will not reduce indemnity payments because insureds already replant at their own expense; (d) the cost of replanting wheat is much less than other spring crops; (e) unnecessary increased loss adjustment expense will result; (f) if FCIC persists with implementation of this proposal, provisions addressing these increased expenses should be made; (g) without a commensurate increase in rates, adding a replant payment has the net effect of increasing the loss ratio; (h) this provision will tremendously impact the loss adjustment expense; (i) the replant provisions are extremely hard to react to on a timely basis and very expensive to administer; and (j) replants on row crops are normally confined to smaller areas with fewer miles to travel. The same is not applicable to other small grains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The intended effects of replanting payments are to: (1) Provide coverage requested by wheat growers; (2) provide reimbursement to insureds for replanting expenses; (3) reduce indemnities by encouraging replacement of damaged or destroyed crops; and (4) provide equity among the various crops. FCIC understands that administrative costs will be associated with this coverage, however, replant payments are a loss control mechanism and may outweigh any additional administrative costs. Comments received did not establish findings that all damaged acreage is presently replanted in the absence of a payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Minister predicts education revolution Pupils leaving school at 16 without plans for further education and training will soon be a thing of the past, Mr Eric Forth, the new education minister, said yesterday, Lisa Wood writes. Mr Forth, commenting on education participation figures which take into account those entering post-16 education in September last year, said: 'The last 10 years have seen a revolution in the participation of 16 to 18-year-olds in education.' The figures show that: 80 per cent of those aged 16 are staying on in full and part-time education  -up by more than 15 percentage points since 1984. Nearly 73 per cent of 16-year-olds are in full-time education - up 25 percentage points since 1984. More than 55 per cent of pupils aged 16 to 18 are in full-time education - a rise of more than 3 percentage points since last year. The number of full-time pupils and students aged 16 to 18 is at an all-time high of 924,000 in spite of a decrease in the size of the age group.</p>

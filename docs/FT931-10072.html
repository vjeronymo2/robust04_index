			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (31): Improvement in 1993 unlikely - Overcapacity has been the main villain in a story of falling prices and reduced profits / Paper and pulp FOR Europe's leading paper and pulp groups 1992 was a tale of overcapacity, falling prices and reduced profits. Small wonder that so few of them managed to improve their position in the FT500 and that most of them slipped further down the table. Indeed, the fact that only nine paper and pulp groups even make the FT500 is a clear enough indication of an industry going through difficult times. There were no new entrants to the table in 1992, while one company, the Swedish group Mo och Domsjo (MoDo), fell out of the rankings. Judging by the fact that a further two companies, Germany's PWA and Sweden's Korsnas, only scrape in at 490 and 493 respectively, the list could be even shorter next year. So why are things so bad? Overcapacity, following the big investment programmes of the late 1980s, has been the main villain of the piece. Added to this have been weak conditions in many key European markets and a weak dollar that brought an increased flow of North American imports into Europe. Finally, there has been the impact of high interest rates on balance sheets groaning under the weight of past investments and acquisitions. None suffered more than the Swedes, though with three pulp and paper companies in the FT500 they still boast more than any other country. For much of the year they carried the additional burden of a strong krona, which meant they were uncompetitive against rival Finnish and North American groups. All three of the Swedish groups slid down the table - Stora from 162 to 213, Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolag (SCA) from 175 to 185 and Korsnas from 453 to 493. The changes pushed SCA ahead of Stora as Sweden's leading forestry group in terms of market capitalisation even though the latter, in output terms, is regarded as Europe's leading pulp and paper company. The irony is that their prospects have been transformed as a result of the devaluation which has followed Sweden's decision to float the krona on November 19, a factor reflected in the strong performance of pulp and paper shares on the Stockholm Stock Exchange since then. This has had an immediate impact. SCA, which had been expecting a break-even result when it published its eight-month figures, said in December it expected a 1992 profit of some SKr300-400m, partly because of the favourable currency movement. Stora, which posted a SKr380m loss in the first eight months, will still make a loss for the full year, but the devaluation effect and its extensive rationalisation programme holds it in good stead for 1993. Reflecting this confidence, the group announced new investments of some SKr1.4bn in the autumn. The Finnish pulp and paper groups did not fare much better in 1992, even though the markka was first devalued in November 1991 and then floated in September last year to give an overall devaluation of 25 per cent. Only one Finnish forestry group, Kymmene, actually made the top 500, coming in at a lowly 381, down just one notch from last year. It was lucky to fare as well as that, given that it slumped from profits of Dollars 81.7m to a loss of Dollars 111m year on year. Elsewhere, the UK's Bowater Industries, the packaging and printing group (which no longer sits particularly comfortably alongside the other pulp and paper companies), was conspicuous, simply because it advanced more than 100 places from 266 to 157 with a capitalisation approaching the Dollars 3bn mark. Profits eased slightly, but this was still considered a resilient performance in a recession. At the same time the company launched a share issue to help fund two acquisitions, DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging. The other leading UK paper group, Arjo Wiggins Appleton, saw its ranking slip from 124 to 202, as profits fell back to Dollars 382.6m. The group parted company with its chief executive, Stephen Walls, and it cut its interim dividend. The company's main paper types, carbonless and coated wood free, both struggled in the general paper market downturn. The year was characterised by subdued mergers and acquisitions activity after the binge of the late 1980s. The most significant move came in December when the three Dutch groups, KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG joined forces to create a company with annual sales of about Fl 13bn and a market capitalisation of more than Fl 2.3bn. KNP was the only one of the three with an FT500 ranking, which stood at 384 in 1992. However, the merged entity will be the second largest paper and packaging group in Europe, by total group turnover - smaller than Stora but larger than SCA and Arjo Wiggins Appleton. Otherwise, stretched balance sheets and depressed share prices restricted the funding possibilities for those anxious to go on the corporate expansion trail. Next year may be little different, given that there is no sign of a recovery. The first six months of 1993 do not promise much respite because demand will continue to be weak in many European markets. 'The optimists are looking at the second half of 1993 for some improvement, while the pessimists think 1993 may be as bad as 1992,' says David Clark, managing director of the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry, asked by  a KCNA today to comment on the Japanese justice minister's  recent outburst defending Japan's past aggression, said:    To the great consternation and resentment of the Korean  people, Asian countries and the world public, Japan's Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano in an interview with the MAINICHI  SHIMBUN newspaper 3 May said the Pacific war was not a war of  aggression and the Nanjing Massacre was a "hoax."    Dismayed at the strong protest of public opinion at home and  abroad, he called a "press conference" Friday to "revoke" and  "apologize" for what he had said. However, it is no use crying  over spilled milk.    The official statement of a country's justice minister  cannot  be regarded as a mistake. It reflects the political climate of  Japan embodying militarism.    It has been nearly half a century since the end of World War  II, but the Japanese authorities are trying to whitewash the  past crimes and defend militarism, far from properly liquidating  the past. This clearly shows they still have the old dream of  "the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" for which they  cried out during the Pacific war of aggression.    We cannot but take a serious view of the outburst because it  came at a time when the Japanese authorities were intensifying  their repressing and destroying maneuver [tanap malsal  chaektong] against the General Association of Korean Residents  in Japan as never before over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK  and undisguisedly resorting to the anti-DPRK campaign such as  legal study to cope with the case of emergency on the Korean  peninsula and debate on constitutional revision.    This proves that Japanese militarism has revived and plans  to  realize its aggressive design by force of arms and regards the  Korean peninsula as the first target.    It is crystal-clear how dangerous it is for Japan obsessed  with militarism and revanchism to work hard to take a permanent  membership in the UN Security Council allegedly for its  "international contribution."    The Asian peoples, who have fallen victim to Japanese  imperialism in the past, and the peaceloving peoples of the  world must pay due attention to and take precautions against  reviving Japanese militarism. Japan must clearly know that  militarist revival will lead to its own grave.</p>

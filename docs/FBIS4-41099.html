			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with A.V. Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the </F> Central Electoral Commission, by Valentin Maslennikov; place and  date of interview not stated: "Will We Manage Without Party  Distortions?"]    [Text] The draft law on the basic guarantees of Russian  Federation citizens' electoral rights has undergone approbation  in the State Duma committees. Soon it will be submitted to a  plenary session of parliament's lower chamber. What is its  importance and topicality? This question is answered by A.V.  Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission.    [Ivanchenko] We are waiting impatiently for the draft to  acquire the force of law. It is the first in a series of  electoral laws which open up a new stage in the reform of the  entire electoral system as a whole. On its basis the laws of  the Federation components on elections of representative and  executive organs of power and local self-management will be  adopted. The precise demarcation of the powers of federal and  regional legislators essentially begins with this draft. The  hands of representatives of power locally are untied. And our  law here will guarantee that no one can encroach on the very  important right of the citizen to elect and be elected.    The adoption of this law is awaited by the newly elected  authorities in the Federation's components. When the law  appears they will have a guarantee of the stability of their  existence.    [Maslennikov] Whose was the initiative to adopt this law?    [Ivanchenko] It was the initiative of the State Duma  committees for the affairs of the Federation and regional  policy, for legislation and court and legal reform, and for  questions of local self-management. It was they who were the  first to voice their concern at the course of the elections in  the regions. It was at their insistence that the Duma adopted  the decree in which it suggested that the president prepare a  draft of this law as a priority and submit it for its  examination.    To prepare the law a joint commission was created, which  elaborated this draft. It included deputies of the State Duma  and Federal Council, and representatives of the Central  Electoral Commission and leading scientific institutions. The  draft was discussed beforehand in local areas, in particular in  Kaluga, Astrakhan, and Khabarovsk. It was approved at  seminar-conferences which we have been holding. During this  work changes and amplifications were made to it. A number of  articles were radically reworked. In my view it is now in a  high degree of readiness.    [Maslennikov] Does the draft law really no longer contain  any contradictions which could give rise to deputies' objections  or disagreement?    [Ivanchenko] That is something which probably never happens  in lawmaking practice. Although the absolute majority of  members of the conciliation commission support the completed  draft law.    We are embarrassed by considerations of a different order,  to  be more precise the very fierce party allegiances of some  deputies. Thus, for instance, Deputy V. Sheynis (an active  developer of this draft, incidentally) has recently started to  encroach on the procedure for forming the electoral commissions  proposed in the future law. The present version provides for  equal participation in the appointment of the Central Electoral  Commission chairman and his deputy and the commission's  secretary and members by the president, Federation Council,  State Duma, and components of the Federation. In particular the  State Duma makes nominations put forward by the deputies'  factions and groups.    But Viktor Leonidovich Sheynis is inclined exclusively  toward the party principle for forming commissions. I think he  knows full well where this can lead, particularly locally.  Instead of a precisely operating commission at best we shall  get a debating club. In addition so far our multiparty system  is making itself felt more in Moscow but by no means in outlying  districts. There, with a party approach toward the formation of  commissions, there will probably be organs incapable of working.  Practice shows that electoral commissions locally have no taste  for debates so they must unfailingly be built on a balance of  interests of both representative and executive power.  Artificially imposing a multiparty system from above is fraught  with the danger of adverse consequences. The equal rights of  the candidates will be cancelled out and the interests of voters  in single-seat districts will be well and truly ignored. A  distortion in the direction of a party bias will unfailingly  result in an encroachment on the interests of independent voters  and their candidates.    The commissions created on the party principle will not be  able to be objective. The legislator must create real and equal  guarantees for the rights of voters and candidates and not  resurrect the monopoly of any party.    [Maslennikov] Voters have had many complaints against the  electoral commissions which obviously delayed the summing up of  election results....    [Ivanchenko] That is not their fault. Nor is it the fault  of the Central Electoral Commission. The statute on the 1993  elections to the benefit of the capital's party interests  excluded from the process of counting votes on party lists not  only the rayon and city but also the oblast and kray levels of  electoral commissions. And over 100,000 electoral commissions'  protocols were taken to Moscow by couriers. Disrespect and  distrust was shown toward the regions and the summing up of the  results was delayed. In the new law we have striven to avoid  blunders of this nature.    [Maslennikov] Is there certainty that the law will be  adopted immediately at the first reading?    [Ivanchenko] The enormous volume of work done in advance in  the Duma committees permits us to hope so. In addition both the  president and the deputies themselves are interested in the law  on basic guarantees of voters' rights beginning to operate as  soon as possible.</p>

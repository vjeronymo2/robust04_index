			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mun Myong-ho from Moscow] </F>   [Text] Grigoriy Karasin, spokesman of the Russian Foreign  Ministry, said on 31 May that Russia and North Korea had agreed  to allow North Korean workers working at timber logging camps in  Siberia, Russia, to separately and freely carry their passports  in the future.    In a regular briefing held that day, Spokesman Karasin said  that during the third Russia-North Korea negotiations to revise  an agreement on the forestry cooperation held in Pyongyang from  14 to 24 May, working-level delegates from both Russia and North  Korea had agreed to allow the North Korean loggers to carry  their passports in Russia so that they can immediately show them  to Russian officials when they are asked to show identification.    This indicates that the North Korean loggers can freely  travel throughout Russia, as well as go outside of Russia if  they want. It can be, therefore, regarded as important progress  for their human rights.    The Russian Foreign Ministry has said that all foreigners,  who legally stay in Russia with proper documents, can freely  travel to third countries if they have done nothing contrary to  the law, such as committing criminal acts in Russia.    North Korean authorities who have managed the timber camps  in  Siberia thusfar, have kept their loggers' passports all together  and instead issued certificates that can only be used within the  camps. This has served as an important factor in keeping them  from travelling freely.    Spokesman Karasin also said that the delegates from the two  countries agreed to include a special regulation which specifies  that the North Korean workers shall work according to the  Russian law and its working-hour system in their new agreement  on forestry cooperation.</p>

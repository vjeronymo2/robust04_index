			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Sixteen divides Twelve EFFORTS by the Belgian presidency of the EC to keep a potentially damaging row over the relative voting power of big and small Community states out of this Friday's Brussels summit looked yesterday as though they might have failed. A discussion by foreign ministers of the Twelve on how to adjust the EC's institutional arrangements to accommodate four small countries negotiating entry into the EC by 1995 - Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - ended in a stand-off between the big and small member states. Germany, the UK, France and Spain are looking to adjust the qualified, or weighted, majority voting system, to ensure they and their likely allies will continue to be able to block unpalatable legislation, after the Twelve become the Sixteen. They also want to ensure that the six-monthly rotation of the EC presidency, now alphabetical, will always ensure that a European power is involved in EC foreign policy, by adjusting the 'troika' system of representation through the current, preceding and succeeding presidencies. All the small member states said yesterday that institutional changes should wait until after enlargement, and be dealt with at the EC's next constitutional review in 1996. A debate now would 'fuel divisions in the EC which we do not need at this juncture', said Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister. Others said any appearance of rewriting the rules to favour larger states could sink the enlargement negotiations. 'This is a stand-off,' said a diplomat from one small member state, 'at the end of the day we are going to have to decide do we want enlargement or do we want institutional reform.' But Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, stressed: 'It is in the interests of Great Britain that there should be an adequate system of blocking minority (voting) after the entry of the new members.' The UK, Germany, France and Spain, acknowledged that it was a very sensitive issue, but said that although the Belgian presidency was refusing to put it on the summit agenda, it would almost certainly come up in discussions.</p>

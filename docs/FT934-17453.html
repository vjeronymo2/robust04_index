			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / VW set to close Seat's Barcelona plant VOLKSWAGEN, the German car maker, appeared last night to be positioning itself to shut down the Barcelona plant of its Spanish car subsidiary, Seat. The office of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, said his deputy, Mr Narcis Serra, had held several urgent telephone conversations already this week with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman. The two men are to meet in Madrid next Thursday. Up to 9,000 jobs would be threatened if VW were to decide, in the light of Seat's large losses this year, to close the company's old plant near Barcelona harbour and concentrate Seat production at its modern new factory at Martorell, about 25km south of the Catalan capital. The Seat crisis, which on Wednesday resulted in the resignation of the company's chairman, Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, has come at a bad time for the Madrid government. Mr Gonzalez's minority socialist administration is trying to negotiate a wages pact with the main trade unions in Spain and to win support from regional parties in Catalonia and the Basque country so as to be able to pass its 1994 budget, presented to parliament yesterday. Yesterday, though, the unions accused government of conniving with VW to cut jobs. In Barcelona, union officials promised fierce resistance to any effort to close down the plant, which produces Seat's new Toledo and old Marbella models. Spanish government officials said Madrid would do everything possible to help the plant survive, but this was likely to boil down to little more than persuasion. Mr Piech plans to spend several days in Spain next week to try to calm political tempers and popular fears roused by his demands for harsh cuts at Seat. The fire-fighting exercise will begin at the VW headquarters in Wolfsburg today, when leaders of Spain's most important trade unions, the UGT and CCOO, fly in for talks. Mr Piech and Mr Klaus Volkert, leading spokesman for the German workforce on the group supervisory board, would explain Seat's structural and financial problems, VW said. Mr Daz Alvarez's 'mutually agreed' resignation was announced one day after a VW group board meeting had rejected as insufficient his rationalisation proposals, including a 22 per cent cut in Seat's 23,000 workforce. VW's demands for radical and rapid action had followed the recent disclosure that Seat was heading for an 'unexpected' DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss this year. Volkswagen undertook to inject DM1.5bn but has refused any further financial assistance.</p>

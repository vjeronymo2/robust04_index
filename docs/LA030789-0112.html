			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA COUNCIL OKS CABLE TV SETTLEMENT, REBATES  </P> <P> The Santa Ana City Council late Monday ended a 15-month-old dispute with its  cable television company, approving a settlement to give rebates that could  affect about 26,000 customers throughout the city.  </P> <P> City council members voted 4 to 1 in a closed-door executive session to approve  the settlement, which calls for Comcast Cablevision to credit current  subscribers with the $4.45 monthly surcharge that was imposed last March.  Councilwoman Patricia A. McGuigan opposed the agreement.  </P> <P> The city's Cable TV Advisory Board had voted unanimously to reject the  settlement, but City Atty. Edward J. Cooper argued that it would be  prohibitively expensive -- costing up to $500,000 -- to pursue legal action  against Comcast.  </P> <P> Under the settlement, current Comcast subscribers will be reimbursed for the  surcharge, which boosted the monthly rate from $13.50 to $17.95. It was imposed  for services that the cable company was not providing but claimed that it would  soon be required to under its franchise agreement with the city. The agreement  does not require Comcast to reduce its rate.  </P> <P> The agreement also calls for Comcast to pay the city more than $1 million.  Councilman John Acosta said that no decision had been made on how the money  would be spent.  </P> <P> The settlement also releases the company from its obligations to equip a  $2-million TV studio, reduces the number of linkages that Comcast has to make  with other cable networks, and gives control of the city's local government  channel, formerly KCTY, on Channel 3 in Santa Ana, to Comcast.  </P> <P> "Subscribers will be receiving a refund for all this time we've been in  litigation. . . . Now we can get back to televising council meetings," Acosta  said.  </P> <P> James Bequette, western region vice president for Comcast, said Monday that he  would have to see a copy of the final agreement before he could comment on the  matter.  </P> <P> The dispute between the city and Comcast began in December, 1987, when Santa  Ana began fining Comcast $1,000 a day for its failure to live up to fulfill  contract provisions.  </P></p>

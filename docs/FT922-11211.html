			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Poll tax leaves legacy of debt THE POLL TAX has entered its final year, but its legacy of debt collection looks set for a long life. Mr Martin Pilgrim, of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said: 'The last bills have just gone out, but we reckon we will be collecting it until the end of the century.' Arrears vary around the country from less than 5 per cent to almost 40 per cent. Some local authorities have come up with novel ways of speeding up collection. Brent Council in north London pays for a monthly four-page newspaper supplement. It publishes lists of people against whom liability orders have been granted, to embarrass them into paying. The most recent issue offered a 5 per cent discount on the full charge of Pounds 271 if people paid up by April 14. 'We had people queueing up outside the town hall,' said a council official. The non-payment issue is particularly severe in Scotland, where the tax was introduced a year before it was in England and Wales. At the end of last month, Strathclyde Regional Council had 38 per cent of its total Pounds 375.5m billed for 1991-92 outstanding, in spite of an advertising campaign.</p>

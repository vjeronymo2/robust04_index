			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Communist Party Secretary-Elect Robert Hue </F> by Gianni Marsilli in Paris; date not given: "`Yes, I Shall Make  Changes, Like Marchais'"]    [Text] Robert Hue, newly elected to the head of the PCF  [French Communist Party], in his office in the immense glass and  cement Colonel Fabien Building, the party executive's  headquarters. In this interview -- "the first with a foreign  paper, I am greatly looking forward to it" -- he gives a preview  of the approach that he intends to take: in the footsteps of  Marchais, whom he considers a man of change; against the Europe  of Maastricht; cautious and unbending toward the PS [Socialist  Party], and caustic on the subject of the left-wing "big bang"  so dear to Rocard.    [Marsilli] Robert Hue, do you believe that Marchais'  membership of the party executive is compatible with your plans  for change? How can you avoid being considered a "sponsored"  secretary?    [Hue] Let us make one thing clear: The initiative was mine.  Marchais was against it, and I had to put a lot of pressure on  him.    [Marsilli] Why did you do it?    [Hue] First of all because we cannot do without the  contribution of a man like Marchais. Where top-ranking leaders  are concerned, moreover, I see similar things happening in other  parties, though they do not give rise to the same comments. As  for me, I have my own personality as an individual and as a  politician. Believe me, I am not under anybody's wing.    [Marsilli] Will you opt for continuity or change?    [Hue] I want to implement the policies that the communists  want and have decided on, those that emerged from our last  conference. If we want to give it a name, we may call it "change  within continuity." This party is evolving like a multistage  rocket. The first stage was launched in the seventies and  eighties, when we broke with the Soviet model....    [Marsilli] Broke?    [Hue] Yes. Wait a moment, let me finish what I was saying.  The second stage was launched at the 28th conference: renewal  that spreads and broadens as the communists continue the debate,  in a process taking us from a communist tradition bound up with  one model to a different analysis, another conception of the  party in which there is no place for false unanimity or  uniformity. Above all, there are a lot of people in this  country who deeply resent the policies of the Right now in power  and who are asking themselves just where society, dominated by  King Mammon, is going. We do not intend to propose that the  French people should do what has failed elsewhere. We do not  intend to repeat tomorrow what failed in France in the eighties.    [Marsilli] Do you regret the departure of Charles Fiterman  (leader of the reformists)?    [Hue] I respect his decision to resign his executive  responsibilities, but it saddens me. However, I hope to work  with him again and with those comrades within the party who  wholly or partly share his convictions. Moreover, I have  publicly expressed my displeasure at the instances of ostracism  that have occurred in the past: Party unity has nothing to do  with party uniformity. Indeed, the present executive comprises  comrades with different views.    [Marsilli] Allow me to run briefly over the party's history.  1956: We have to wait until the seventies before the French  communists are officially informed of the Khrushev report.  1968: The PCF dissociates itself from the Soviet invasion of  Czechoslovakia but does not break off relations with the  Soviet-controlled puppet government, quite the contrary. 1979:  Marchais gives his blessing to the invasion of Afghanistan.  The eighties: The PCF mistrusts Gorbachev and perestroyka.  Never an in-depth consideration of the relationship between  democracy and socialism. Will there be one with you?    [Hue] You say "never." Allow me to say that I find this  unfair. It is true, as far as 1956 is concerned, we reacted  late, very late, and this damaged us. I would add that in the  sixties, when the time came to provide a fresh answer to the  questions confronting French society following the establishment  of the institutions of the Fifth Republic, we were unable to  propose anything more than a remake of the People's Front. Not  enough. With regard to 1968, our condemnation of the Soviet  intervention was unequivocal, despite the fact that we did not  break with the "model." But from the early seventies things  have changed with Marchais.    [Marsilli] Oh yes, such as?    [Hue] We have worked out a self-managing socialism for  France, we have abandoned the dictatorship of the proletariat  for democracy. We now say that the great contemporary issues  center on the need for democracy. It is this need that  capitalism suffocates, barring the path to progress of any kind:  This path lies in fostering the individual's capacity for  initiative.    [Marsilli] Could you imagine abandoning the term  "communist"?    [Hue] It is up to each party, and I respect the decisions of  each one. As far as I am concerned, I believe that the  discredit deriving from a whole historical experience cannot be  miraculously shaken off merely by abandoning a word, especially  as we lay claim to our name as communists for reasons quite  different from events in the East. The term has existed in  France since 1789. In our eyes, it expresses, in spite of  everything, the finest struggle, the struggle for human  liberation.... The mentality that constituted our reference  model in the past has failed once and for all, and we reject it  to build something else. But what we are fighting for is a real  change in society that owes nothing to capitalism, a communist  society.    [Marsilli] What do you think of the "big bang" that Rocard  was talking about a year ago, and about the recent negotiations  on the Left?    [Hue] I saw "big bang" as exemplifying a frenetic search for  a new slogan, which the socialist defeat reduced to more  realistic proportions a few weeks later. That idea of Rocard's  set out to realign the French political scene toward the center,  excluding us. It was suicide for the Left: You cannot build  anything on division. I should welcome a more realistic approach  on the part of the PS today.    [Marsilli] The PS is now much weaker. Do you intend to take  advantage of this?    [Hue] I have no ambition to strengthen the PCF to the  detriment of the others, but I know that millions of people are  profoundly disappointed, that the left wing of the population is  out there, waiting. And so I want the PCF to be a force that  advances proposals, that attracts support. To this extent, the  answer is yes, but I do not intend to invert the claim that the  PS used to make: We shall take 3 million votes from the PCF....    [Marsilli] How do you see relations on the Left?    [Hue] I hope that the Left, and the PS in particular, which  has exercised governing power, will look itself hard in the  face. We have done so, but the socialists have not. I also  want the progressive forces, left-wing people, all those who  will not be seduced by the Right, to unite. We must join  forces, not in a logic of alternation, mere electoral majority,  but as a deep-rooted political alternative.    [Marsilli] What do you expect from the Socialist Party?    [Hue] That it should talk in concrete terms. That it should  reflect on its error in presenting Maastricht as an opportunity  for France. That it should seriously weigh up its experience in  government. This is what I hope; I do not want to be  quarrelsome or aggressive. What I ask for is not displays of  public breast-beating, but serious thought.    [Marsilli] To which political movement in Europe do you  currently feel closest?    [Hue] The distinguishing mark of the progressive movement in  Europe nowadays is its diversity.... All these forces are  confronting the problems involved in constituting an alternative  to the neoliberal austerity policies in different conditions.  We are working to foster all potential convergences, without  prejudices. The problems are the same, the labels are of  secondary importance.    [Marsilli] What is the motto that you will be taking into  the  European elections?    [Hue] The line of demarcation is not drawn nowadays between  pro-Europeans and anti-Europeans, but between those with a  progressive concept of Europe and the neomarketeers. We are in  favor of building a Europe united in the service of work and  social progress, a democratic Europe that shifts the  decisionmaking centers toward the people and enhances the  sovereignty of nations and peoples, incorporating present-day  needs for cooperation. We are in favor of a demilitarized  Europe....    [Marsilli] Should we look eternally to the United States to  solve our defense and security problems?    [Hue] No, we need an autonomous Europe. We are in favor of  demilitarization. We have to continue along the road toward  disarmament. We think that European security should be founded  on a political basis of cooperation.</p>

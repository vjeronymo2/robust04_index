The source said the six ambassadors or representatives of  London, Paris, Bonn, Rome, The Hague and Copenhagen, had jointly  called on Greece to drop its action against the former Yugoslav  republic during a meeting Friday night with the secretary  general of the Foreign Ministry, Khristos Zakharakis.    It said the ambassadors had conveyed their countries'  concern  over the measures adopted last Wednesday.    The six countries concerned had all forged diplomatic  relations with Skopje last December, before Greece took over the  rotating presidency of the EC, much to Athens' disgruntlement.    While Greece has been asked to explain its decision to a  meeting of the 12 EC foreign ministers in Brussels Monday,  Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis declared Saturday  night that the blockade would remain in force until Macedonia  backed down.    Greece accuses Macedonia of usurping the name which it  maintains is historically Greek and of harbouring expansionist  aims towards the Greek province of that name.    It has called on Skopje to renounce what it said was hostile  propoganda and drop the star of Vergina from its flag, a symbol  of the Macedonian dynasty in ancient times.    Athens is refusing to allow oil and other essential supplies  through its northern port of Salonika, saying this is the only  way to bring pressure to bear on Skopje to bow to Greek demands.</p>

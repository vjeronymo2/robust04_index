			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev by </F> Enrique Serbeto in Almaty; date not given]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The 8 March parliamentary  elections were regarded by international observers as out of  keeping with the high level of democratic guarantees. This is  the first blot on the record of this leader with the reputation  of being moderate and sensible, who defends himself by saying  that "when you speak of democracy in central Asia, in  Kazakhstan, it cannot be compared with France, Spain, or other  countries. If we are speaking of European standards, it must  also be said how many years it took to achieve them. It must be  borne in mind that women in the United States did not have the  right to vote until the beginning of this century. But these  states have 200 years of history, and France, Spain, and Britain  have thousands. We have only been independent for two years.  We are heading for democracy and the market economy step by  step. If we try to turn the democratic cart too quickly, we  will be in danger of overturning it."    [Serbeto] The economic reform and privatization are proving  very difficult in Russia. Has Kazakhstan used the lessons of  this Russian experience in order to design its own model?    [Nazarbayev] After many centuries of totalitarian rule,  people are accustomed to collective methods of leadership and  production, and so, from the psychological viewpoint, it is very  difficult suddenly to accept private ownership. But, despite  everything, we are prepared to hand over part of Kazakhstan's  resources to the country's population. We are conducting not a  chaotic privatization but one under the regulating control of  the government, which is accelerating the privatization process,  since it is very difficult from the grassroots. In agriculture,  we are not yet considering the total privatization of land,  although this is our medium-term aim.    [Serbeto] Are you in favor of the so-called "shock therapy,"  or of delaying radical decisions to the utmost in order to  preserve social peace?    [Nazarbayev] We started with "shock therapy" when we decided  to liberalize all prices, but we must be very vigilant because  the process could go wrong at any time. The monetarist  prescriptions against inflation are not sufficient in  themselves. In the West, they must realize that they reached  this situation after many years of evolution. For instance, in  Spain Franco left everything ready, but we had no Franco.    [Serbeto] What is Kazakhstan's nuclear policy?    [Nazarbayev] Kazakhstan is fulfilling its pledges for the  elimination of nuclear weapons. We were the first CIS state to  ratify START I and the Lisbon protocol. The only delays were  due to the fact that we were trying to secure guarantees that  this is our lawful property and that we will be compensated for  the cost of the enriched uranium in our nuclear warheads.    [Serbeto] The presence in this country of a large population  group of Russian origin is viewed as a factor of instability.  To what extent do you believe that this is a grave danger to  coexistence?    [Nazarbayev] It would be incorrect to say that this problem  does not exist. Some Russian politicians wish to use this for  their own ends, but we will not accept this in Kazakhstan,  because the Russians of Kazakhstan are our citizens. It cannot  be said that human rights are violated here, but if anybody  believes this, we invite all UN delegations to check this. In  my opinion, people's main concerns are a result of the  disintegration of the USSR. The fall of a great empire is  always painful, and so it has always been throughout history. I  know that Yeltsin and Kozyrev are very experienced people, but  these politicians should have thought about the Russians left  outside Russia when they signed the Slav treaty which dissolved  the USSR.    [Serbeto] Why do you not accept the proposal for granting  the Russians dual nationality?    [Nazarbayev] Just imagine if the Russians, who are 32  percent of the population, had two passports in their pockets.  They would have one foot in Russia and the other here. That  would destabilize the situation in Kazakhstan. Why do they say  nothing in Russia about the violation of the rights of the  non-Russians living in Russia? A million Kazakhs live in  Russia. Have they opened any Kazakh school in Russia? In  Kazakhstan, 65 percent of schools operate in Russian, and last  year 78 percent of the students starting high school did so in  Russian. Some 75 percent of the news media are in Russian. All  the state bodies use Russian, and I myself am speaking to you in  Russian. Can any other CIS state say that it respects  linguistic minorities as we do? We will resolve all the  problems of the Russian-speaking Kazakhs, because this is an  internal problem of ours -- not that of any other country.  Nobody can concern themselves about the Russians better than us,  and we want no assistance from Russia.    [Serbeto] Russia is trying to attract other CIS states into  its military and economic sphere of influence. Have you noted  this trend with respect to Kazakhstan?    [Nazarbayev] Nobody knows what Russia wants. They lack a  policy in this respect. It would be better to ask the Russians  what they want. We are a sovereign country and are not  dependent on Russia for either oil, coal, or food. Since we  introduced our currency, we have been living completely  independently, and Russia has understood this. We have oil,  gas, wolfram, gold, diamonds, and uranium. Russia's relations  with Ukraine and Belarus cannot be compared with those it  maintains with Kazakhstan.</p>

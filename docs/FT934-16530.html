			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Receiverships at lowest level for four years THE NUMBER of companies placed in receivership fell to its lowest level for four years last month, providing evidence that the 'credit crunch' which normally accompanies recovery and stimulates company failures may not occur. Only 184 receivership and administration orders were recorded in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes, fewer than half those of the same month last year and the lowest figure since the 135 reported in September 1989. The figure was about a quarter down on the figures of between 229 and 253 reported in each of the previous five months. On present trends, total receiverships for the year are likely to be 27 per cent down on those in 1992. Mr Christopher Morris, national director of corporate special services for accountants Touche Ross, said it was 'very encouraging for the British economy'. Past economic recoveries have tended to lead to a rise in failures as banks refuse to extend further loans to businesses which have suffered from an excessive debt burden during the recession. However, banks have reported weak loan demand despite the emergence from recession. Mr Morris said that the lack of failures indicated a 'general cautiousness' among both business owners and financiers. He said Britain 'could well be set on a steady and controllable expansion of trade if this trend continues, and may this time avoid the worst excesses of the traditional economic cycle'. Among industrial sectors, failures in building construction fell to 33, compared with an average of 65 in the preceding 12 months. There were 10 failures in hotel and catering, which was half the recent monthly levels. The worst affected region was Yorkshire/Humberside, which had 24 failures, or 13 per cent of the total. This means the region has contributed 10 per cent of company failures so far this year, a 2 percentage point increase on the area's share last year. The best-performing regions were the north-east, which had four failures, Wales, which had six, and the west Midlands, which had seven failures. Mr Morris said many receiverships and administrations were leading to financial reconstructions rather than absolute failures with full loss of employment. 'The strength and flexibility of the British insolvency system results in many businesses that have suffered losses during the recession being rescued and rehabilitated, as opposed to merely being closed down,' he said.</p>

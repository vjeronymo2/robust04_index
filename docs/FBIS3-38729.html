The foreign minister was inquiring about the chances of  completing the entry talks by the end of February. The planned  conclusion of the negotiations with the four membership  candidates will be the subject of a meeting between the 12 EU  and the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] foreign  ministers, who will meet in Brussels on Monday. In view of the  increasingly overt Croatian attacks against Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, they will also discuss imposing sanctions  against Zagreb, comparable with those against Serbia.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Caihong (7115 1752 4767), deputy chief </F> representative of the Seoul Representative Office, Chinese  People's Construction Bank: "Reform of Foreign Exchange Control  System; Adjustment of Banking System"]    [Text] The core of the reform of the foreign exchange  control system may be summarized as follows: "One passageway,  one exchange rate, and one market." This "three one's" reform  will have a major effect on the central banks' monetary policy  and on the operation of foreign exchange-assigned banks.    First, speaking of the central banks, because all foreign  exchange income within the boundaries of China must be sold to  foreign exchange-assigned banks, which, besides maintaining a  certain foreign exchange circulating fund, must sell the  surplus, if the foreign exchange taken in by the foreign  exchange-assigned banks exceed the highest limit of the  circulating fund, that foreign exchange must be sold to the  central banks. Thus, under the past system, out of the foreign  exchange held by each credit bank a very large part will  eventually be put into the central banks, so obviously there  will be an increase in the amount of foreign currency held by  the central banks, a situation that will certainly have an  effect on the central banks' monetary policy. Viewed from the  angle of currency and banking theory, when foreign currency is  held in different banks it will have a completely different  effect; the funds held and used by the central banks are the  basic currency to hold and use, and the funds held and used by  credit banks are the gradually expanding currency to hold and  use. On this point, the central banks' monetary policy must be  appropriately considered and adjusted.    Next, because the amount of foreign exchange held by the  central banks increases, the efficiency of, and restraint on,  the use of foreign exchange funds has become a major issue that  the central banks must consider, and issue in which what is most  important is the question of the structure of foreign exchange  assets as well as investment and speculation with foreign  exchange funds. This means that the central banks must increase  its "business-type" operations with foreign exchange funds,  doing business on the international currency market and gaining  economic returns from the use of foreign currency.    Finally, the foreign exchange transaction market between  banks needs to be specially managed by the central banks with  regard to the following points: First, how to determine well the  size of each bank's foreign exchange circulating fund; second,  how to intervene and control the application of foreign exchange  funds to market prices; and third, what measures to use in  control and regulation--all these problems need to be  conscientiously studied and solved. From a look at the reform  plan that has appeared, one sees that that this is a limited  foreign exchange transaction market, and that the central banks  try, through managing the foriegn exchange market between  control banks, to regulate and control the rate of all foreign  exchange. However, whether to use exchange rate measures to  regulate, or to use changes in the supply and demand to  regulate, is a question that requires study and finding out  which is best.    With regard to foreign exchange-assigned banks, the reform  plan that has appeared shrinks the foreign exchange deposit  business to the smallest possible size: Only enterprises and  individuals carrying the smallest amount of foreign exchange  will make foreign exchange deposits. Correspondingly, the  foreign exchange loan business of foreign exchange-assigned  banks will be almost completely eliminated, and there will also  be a necessity for the existence of a foreign exchange fund for  the capital formed by the banks that had made foreign exchange  loans.    Second, the foreign exchange-assigned banks' income from  doing business in foreign exchange will only be the price  differential of foreign exchange in over-the-counter business  and the difference between "buying low and selling high" on the  foreign exchange transaction market between banks, as well as  the profit from the banks' own regulation of the structure of  foreign exchange assets. Because the customer can use foreign  exchange to buy directly corresponding "hard currency" at a  foreign exchange-assigned bank, he no longer will need to have  the bank buy and sell foreign exchange for him, and the bank  will itself bear the risk in the aspect of the structure of  foreign exchange assets. Viewed from this angle, we see that the  foreign exchange-assigned banks are being pushed toward the  market, where its risks in doing business will increase.    Third, investment abroad by a foreign exchange-assigned bank  entails a two-way restriction. Under the old system, with the  approval of the investment abroad by a central bank, the foreign  exchange-assigned bank could use its own foreign exchange  capital, or directly use its own Renminbi funds, to buy foreign  exchange for investment abroad. Under the new system, the  investment plan of a foreign exchange-assigned bank must be  approved by a central bank, and also the sources of the foreign  exchange funds to be invested are required to have a central  bank undertake to sell them before they can be formed; this  selling of foreign exchange by the central banks touches on many  aspects in regulating the foreign exchange market and in  implementing the monetary policy. Therefore, the two-way  restriction on the plan and the foreign exchange structure  increases some systemic restraints on foreign investment by  foreign exchange-assigned banks.    At present, to link up with the world economy, the renminbi  must as early as possible take the path of an exchange rate and  in the end become a freely convertible currency, and China's  foreign exchange control system must be correspondingly  reformed. Today, the plan for reform of the the foreign exchange  control system that we are promoting is essentially the choice  to put into practice the socialist market economy. We should  adapt to this choice, adjusting China's banking system and  institutions, and ensuring that the course of China's overall  reform is not adversely affected.    This reform will add to the central banks' tasks in the  aspect of monetary policy, but it will also provide the central  banks with fairly appropriate means to solve difficult problems.  This is only the nature of the foreign currency market, and the  central banks should pay more attention to the influence and  effect on monetary policy exerted by the foreign exchange  transaction market between banks, and with relative flexibility  use foreign exchange measures to regulate the foreign exchange  transaction market and achieve relatively stable exchange rate  prices. At the same time, the central banks' public market  business should, as fast as possible, be put into substantive  operation, in order to ensure an appropriate measure of currency  supply, to prevent too-large fluctuations in currency supply  from forming an enormous pressure on the foriegn exchange  transaction market, and to help stabilize the exchange rate on  the foreign exchange transaction market. With regard to  intervention on the foreign exchange transaction market and the  public market, I personally think that now it is appropriate to  use simultaneously the dual regulation measures, both achieving  a controlled interest rate and exchange rate system, and doing  so by regulating the amount of supply and demand on the markets.    In addition, the central banks should, at each large  financial center in the world, set up a corresponding foreign  exchange regulation and business operations organization, and,  in line with the changes on the international currency and  foreign exchange markets, adjust the structure of the foreign  exchange assets that the central banks hold, thereby ensuring  that the value of the foreign exchange funds they hold are not  adversely affected, and under possible circumstances, striving  to hold foreign exchange funds that increase in value. In fact,  after reforming the foreign exchange management system, the  central banks will be faced with two marekts: One is the  domestic foreign exchange transaction market between banks; the  other is the international foreign exchange and currency market.  Only by operating with facility on these two large markets can  the central banks ensure the efficiency in use and the returns  on its foreign exchange funds, and ensure that the central  banks' monetary policy attains the predesignated goals.    As for the foreign exchange-assigned banks, the effect of  this reform will really demand that each bank begin to change  its past way and pattern of management, consider problems from  the angle of the market, and by taking risks on the market get  returns on the foreign exchange managed by the bank. Each bank  must, as fast as possible, train fairly many foreign exchange  counter personnel and fairly many foreign exchange transaction  personnel. At the same time, we need to train a large number of  specialists in business management and information processing on  the foreign exchange marekt, and to set up a corresponding  foreign exchange business management system and  institutionalized system with a tight-knit organization,  flexible operations, up-to-date information, and clear decision  making. As for the dual restrictions on ivestment abroad with  foreign exchange, this is a systemic change and it can, through  systemic adjustments, lead to the best advantage for investment  abroad by foreign exchange-assigned banks, taking into  consideration whether it is an overseas investment fund set up  by a central bank in each foreign exchange-assigned bank, with  its funds source and foreign exchange capital held by the bank.  After a central bank approves the overseas investment plans of  certain foreign exchange-assigned banks, the problem of finding  a source of foreign exchange will be solved by this fund.    Without the slightest doubt, the reform of the foreign  exchange control system will have an effect on the banking  profession, as well as on the corresponding adjustment measures,  and we need to change them in line with the changes in practice.</p>

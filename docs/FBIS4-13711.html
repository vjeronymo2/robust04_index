			<p>BFN     [Text] Monetary and banking regulations for the country's  free trade zones have been approved, and the import of goods  that are not illegal will be free without any limitations in the  free trade zones. This was stated by Alviri, secretary of the  Supreme Council for Free Trade and Industrial Zones, in an  exclusive interview with our correspondent. Alviri added: The  import of goods from the free trade zones to other parts of the  country will be subject to import-export regulations.    He described the monetary and banking regulations that were  approved by the Supreme Council for Free Trade and Industrial  Zones yesterday as one of the most important procedural  regulations of the law on free trade zones. He said: Domestic  banks as well as domestic and foreign credit establishments can  be either set or open branches in these zones, while foreign  banks can only have branches in these zones.    The secretary of the Supreme Council for Free Trade and  Industrial Zones also stated that the Iranian banks should have  an initial capital of at least 5 billion rials, while foreign  credit establishments should have at least $4 million to be  established in these zones. Alviri added: Domestic banks and  branches of foreign banks can carry out off-shore banking  activities, which are solely foreign exchange transactions and  will be exempt from the regulations and laws that apply inside  the country.    Alviri added: The banks in the free trade zones should  clarify their situation within a period of six months or conform  their articles of association with the banking and monetary  regulations that apply to these regions. Commenting on the  foreign exchange system that will apply in these areas, he said:    [Begin Alviri recording] Another noteworthy point is the  existence of a single-parity rate in the free trade zone. This  means that we will not have one rate announced by the Central  Bank and another rate that is the free market rate. There will  be a single parity rate system. In other words, the foreign  exchange market in the free trade zones will adjust its rate on  the basis of supply and demand. This will be the official rate  inside the free trade zones and the basis on which all the banks  will carry out their transactions. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Quebec separatist ardour cools: The confrontational tactics of the past few months have failed to produce the desired results A military college, a trade mission to China and an ailing St Lawrence River shipyard are among the disparate issues which Quebec's newly elected separatist government has pounced on to promote its case for independence from Canada. The steadily growing list comes as no surprise. Political observers predicted in the wake of last September's election that the Parti Quebecois would waste no time shaking every tree it could to prove that the francophone province was getting a raw deal from the rest of the country. The surprise is that the shaking has borne little fruit. The skirmishes have generated endless articles in the Quebec media about alleged slights and inequities and the PQ has often succeeded in putting the federal government in Ottawa on the defensive. However, Quebecois appear to be unimpressed. According to the latest opinion poll conducted by Leger and Leger of Montreal, support for sovereignty (which has the connotation of a 'soft' form of independence) has slipped to 40 per cent from more than 50 per cent before the election. Other polls put the number as low as 33 per cent. The issues which the PQ has seized on in the past two months illustrate both the opportunities and the pitfalls of beating the separatist drum. Even before taking office the PQ kicked up a storm over a federal plan to trim defence spending by closing the College Militaire Royal at Saint-Jean, south-east of Montreal. The college is the armed forces' only training centre for French-speaking officers. Quebec's protests have forced Ottawa to offer a compromise, which would allow the facility to stay open as a language school. The PQ has rejected the proposal. It has offered instead to pay itself for St-Jean to remain a military training college. But by doing so it has laid itself open to concerns that it is preparing to organise a Quebec army. On another front, Mr Jacques Parizeau, PQ leader and premier, refused to join a trade mission to China earlier this month which was led by prime minister Jean Chretien and included the premiers of all nine other provinces. Mr Chretien at first appeared on the defensive by refusing to accept Mr Parizeau's suggestion that Quebec's deputy premier go in his place. In the end, however, the mission's success - including contracts signed by several high-profile Quebec companies - did the separatist cause no good. The latest fuss has erupted over the future of MIL Davie, a Quebec City shipyard. The company is on the point of collapse, unless it receives new government contracts or an infusion of cash for a modernisation programme. The cash-strapped federal government, in keeping with a policy of letting troubled businesses sort out their own problems, has so far declined to come to the shipyard's rescue. The PQ has lambasted Ottawa for putting 2,300 Quebec jobs in jeopardy, and has offered to put up CDollars 60m-CDollars 70m (Pounds 28m-Pounds 32.7m) of its own taxpayers' money for a new ferry, which would keep the shipyard in business for at least the next few years. Mr Michel Vennat, a lawyer who heads the Council for Canadian Unity, says that 'the population knows that they (the PQ) are fabricating these issues to some degree. I don't think the mood of the province is to pick fights.' Another observer suggests that Quebecois are as fed up as English-speaking Canadians with the debate over the francophone province's place in Canada. This view is reflected in the refusal of both Mr Chretien and the provincial Liberal party, which was defeated in the recent elections, to assuage Quebec nationalism by reopening the constitutional talks which have been a hallmark of Canadian politics for the past decade. Despite his apparent inability to win converts to independence, Mr Parizeau has so far stuck to his pre-election promise of a sovereignty referendum before the end of 1995. The PQ is gearing up its organisation for a campaign starting early next year. But there is a growing feeling in Montreal that the separatists may be forced to change tack if the confrontational tactics of the past few months fail to produce results soon. However, a shift in strategy would require some agile footwork by Mr Parizeau, and could risk deepening divisions in the party. The alternatives include delaying the referendum, or framing the question so vaguely that even a Yes vote would fall far short of a mandate for outright independence. Some political observers suggest that the PQ may even adopt a more conciliatory approach to the rest of the country. This prediction is reinforced by the impression that last September's election result reflects Quebecois' desire for better government and some extra areas of provincial jurisdiction, rather than the risks of independence. Whatever course the PQ chooses, one conclusion is hard to escape. It seems increasingly unlikely that Canada's most vexing question - will Quebec stay or leave? - will be conclusively answered within the next 12 months. Quebec's government faced its first setback yesterday when a cabinet minister resigned after admitting she voted illegally in elections before becoming a citizen, Reuter adds from Montreal. Ms Marie Malavoy, culture and communications minister, whose parents moved to Quebec from France when she was a child, wrote in her resignation letter: 'I participated as a voter, before (becoming a citizen), in many Canadian and Quebec elections although the law did not allow me to do so.'</p>

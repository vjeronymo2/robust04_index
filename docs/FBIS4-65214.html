			<p>BFN     [Text] The opposition parties are sharpening their weapons.  The political coordination group of the Party of the Democratic  Left is holding a meeting and will discuss the proposal of party  secretary Achille Occhetto to extend a hand to the Center in  order to form a stronger opposition. However, the signals  coming from the Center toward the new government are discordant.  Guido Dell'Acquila reports:    [Begin recording of Mario Segni, Pact for Italy leader] I  thought [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi was going to chose an  AC Milan-type soccer team, in other words, a team full of  champions, a team capable of being an international force.  Instead he has put together a team which is somewehere between  the first and second division. [end recording]    [Dell'Acquila] Segni was using a soccer metaphor in order to  explain his opposition to the newly formed government. However,  in the galaxy that is the center of Italian politics, there are  a multitude of differing opinions. For example, the former  members of Mario Segni's Pact for Italy are trying to form a  relationship with the Berlusconi government.    [Begin recording of Alberto Michelini, head of the Liberal  Democrat Foundation] We must respect democratically the decision  of the Italian people, of the electors. I believe that the  government must be given a chance and so our opposition is one  which does not have any prejudices. Our position will be  determined by concrete facts. [end recording]    However, the largest centrist party is the Italian Popular  Party [PPI], where the left led by Bindi and Mattarella is most  definitely opposed to the government of Silvio Berlusconi, but  where the emerging group led by Roberto Formigoni has a  completely different stance.    [Begin Formigoni recording] If it were necessary, and if the  government's program were acceptable, then I believe that some  PPI senators -- in fact, I hope that party as a whole -- will  abstain in the confidence vote in order to support the  government so that it can get off the ground. Once this is over  then there will be everything to play for. [end recording]</p>

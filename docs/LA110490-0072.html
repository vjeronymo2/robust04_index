			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PHEASANT TRAPPING KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT  </P> <P> The instructions were all too reminiscent of failed snipe hunts of 30 years  past. Remember the family camping outing and the nightly ritual for the  ever-elusive -- and quite mythical -- snipe? I can still hear the words: "Get  the rope, the net, don't talk, and bring the box in case we catch him."  </P> <P> Now I was getting instructions that sounded distinctly familiar, only with a  complex twist.  </P> <P> "Your job is to take the spotlight and keep it on the bird," our leader  lectured. "It doesn't blind them, just dazzles them. And you, with the net, you  circle around them from the left, and make sure you are on your tip toes. Creep  up on them, and don't raise the net. You have to be patient but aggressive. God  makes netters, and we'll find out right away if you are a netter or not."  </P> <P> Yeah, sure, I figured. Little did I know how this intricate, nocturnal trapping  technique would lead to the capture of a number of pheasants, an important  procedure in assuring large populations of the birds.  </P> <P> John Massie is assistant upland game coordinator for the state Department of  Fish and Game. Part of his job for the past four years has been trapping wild  pheasants and relocating them to areas where their populations are sparse. Some  pheasants are relocated on private lands.  </P> <P> But private landowners have agreed to open their land to public pheasant  hunting on a community-hunt basis so the program benefits all.  </P> <P> Massie often has trouble finding help for the all-night mission.  </P> <P> "Sometimes the boss comes in and says we have to do it tonight," Massie said.  "Even when I know in advance, getting people to stay up all night pheasants is  often a hard idea to sell."  </P> <P> It's 10 p.m. Mike Grima and I are standing at a spot near the Yolo County  landfill. We just received spotlight and netting instructions from Massie.  Grima is a warden with F&amp;G, and neither of us had been pheasant trapping  before. We were both intrigued and decided to volunteer. "You guys have plenty  of caffeine in you?" Massie asked. "Let's go out and see what we can find."  </P> <P> With that, Massie started a six-wheel vehicle in motion. I was in the passenger  seat with a million-candlepower spotlight. Grima was in the back, another  spotlight in one hand, a big fish net in the other. The star thistle and giant  aster, some of it 8 feet high, made it difficult to clearly see any roosting  pheasants.  </P> <P> An hour went by, and nothing. Then a quick movement was seen, and some red eyes  reflected the lights. "Rabbits," Massie said. "Pheasant eyes don't reflect."  </P> <P> More movement -- a skunk -- along a bank. "That's not a good sign," Massie  said. Not good, because no one wants to run into a skunk in the middle of the  night, and skunks are good at eating pheasant eggs.  </P> <P> "We'll find them," Massie said. "Sometimes we go along and see nothing, then  all of a sudden 20 or 30 jump out. They bunch up."  </P> <P> Just then, a pheasant jumped and flew about 30 yards and landed. Grima jumped  out of the vehicle as Massie hit the throttle. I kept the spotlight on the bird  as well as I could.  </P> <P> When we reached where we thought the bird landed, Grima had already swung wide  left. The plan was to herd the pheasant to Grima.  </P> <P> "The exhaust is in the left front of the machine, and between that noise and  your spotlight, Mike should be able to sneak up on the bird. One of the states  that traps the birds has tapes of Janis Joplin blasting on the grill (to help  shield the trapper's movement)."  </P> <P> Just as I spotted the hen on the ground and saw Grima circling in behind, she  took off again, this time about 100 yards. Massie hit the throttle, and we were  off. Grima was left running through the thistle and aster, hoping a hole or  small ditch wasn't between him and the pheasant.  </P> <P> "She should be around here," Massie said as he slowed the vehicle. "Look for  the tops of the thistle moving. They'll run a little and then stop. There. Over  there about 10 yards to your left."  </P> <P> I turned the spotlight and saw the top of some thistle moving. By now, Grima  had caught up and was slowly getting in position. Massie moved the vehicle  toward the bird, and suddenly I could see the hen looking right at me. Massie  moved the vehicle toward at her, I kept her in the spotlight, and Grima moved  in from behind. Grima made a leap, and the hen was in the net.  </P> <P> I got out and grabbed her legs and pulled her out from the net and took her to  Massie. He tagged the hen, and we put her in the cage in the back of the  vehicle.  </P> <P> "I think we have a netter," Massie said of Grima. "Let's go see if we can find  some more."  </P> <P> Eight hours later, with Grima and me trading duties, we had 40 pheasants. The  last two hours, between 4 a.m and 6 a.m., were hardest. The birds did not fly  as much. They wanted to sleep, so they stayed on the ground a lot more. Problem  was, we also wanted to sleep. Our eyelids were heavy.  </P> <P> "For never having netted before, you guys did a good job," Massie said as he  transferred all the pheasants from the vehicle to a big van. "I would have been  happy with 20 birds. Thirty would had been great. But 40 is fantastic. I have  to get this vehicle (the borrowed six-wheeler) back to Grizzly Island and then  get the pheasants on a plane (for shipment to Imperial Valley in Southern  California). I'm doing this again tomorrow night. Anytime you guys want to  volunteer again, just give me a call."  </P> <P> One reason Massie pursues this program is to show the public that F&amp;G is  interested in doing pheasant management work.  </P> <P> "We are trying to help the pheasant population and show all those who buy  hunting licenses that we do put their money to work," Massie said.  </P> <P> Since 1974, wild pheasant populations have dropped from 50 percent to 75  percent. Ringnecks have virtually disappeared in some areas that had supported  good populations. Loss of essential cover is the primary reason to the decline.  Intensive control measures for weeds, insects and rodents, land leveling,  cropping patterns and practices, and other recent developments in agriculture  all contributed to loss of pheasant cover.  </P> <P> In 1989, the relocation program featured 10 release sites, some on wildlife  areas owned by the state, others on private land.  </P> <P> "We get some criticism that we are taking pheasants off public land and putting  them on private land," Massie said. "But -- and I want to emphasize this -- we  do not take pheasants off land that is hunted. And by putting them on private  land, which is open to the public for a fee, say $40 or $50, like most  community clubs charge, it's easier to control entry. It's not a problem for  the landowner, trespassing is cut down, and the public hunter gets a place to  hunt."  </P> <P> Massie is looking for a few good men or women to help him trap pheasants.  </P> <P> "Volunteers are always welcomed," Massie said. "The problem is that I never  know when I will have the chance, and it's hard for people to come out on the  spur of the moment and then have to go to work the next day after being up all  night."  </P> <P> If Massie can find areas to trap pheasants, he plans to trap them through  February. It is a job that requires some degree of conditioning and willingness  to stay awake all night.  </P> <P> "If people plan to help," Massie said, "they better plan to stay awake all  night and work all night."  </P> <P> Netting is more physically demanding than spotlighting. Often the spotlighter  stays in the vehicle and watches the pheasant, while the netter is either  chasing the vehicle and pheasant or circling to get in position to net the  pheasant.  </P></p>

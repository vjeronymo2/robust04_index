			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interviews with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, chief Palestinian </F> delegate to the negotiations with Israel, and Dr. 'Aziz  al-Duwayk, a former Hamas deportee, by correspondent Ahmad  'Ubaydat, place and date not given; from the "With the Midday  Events" program--recorded]    [Text] ['Urayqat] In fact, the [Security Council]  resolution [on the Hebron massacre] is disappointing,  particularly with regard to the U.S. abstention on Jerusalem.  The United States recognized Jerusalem's status in Resolution  672 of 1991. Resolution [904] did not discuss the main issue of  settlements and their gravity. Hence, this resolution is a  serious step back. I believe that what is needed now is a  mechanism that can be translated on the ground with regard to  international protection. We are awaiting the crystallization  of this issue.    ['Ubaydat] But after this resolution, talks will resume  between all Arab parties and Israel.    ['Urayqat] Mr. Christopher actually talked about the return  to negotiations by the three Arab parties; namely, Jordan,  Lebanon, and Syria. This, regrettably of course, shows the  impairment from which Arab coordination is suffering. Regarding  the Palestinian track, however, the matter concerns the  protection of people's lives because the peace process means  preserving people's lives. I believe that without placing the  issue of settlements at the top of the agenda, without providing  real international protection for the Palestinian people, and  without evacuating the settlements from Hebron, Gaza, and  Nabulus, the negotiations will be useless, even if they are  resumed, especially since Israel has not yet committed itself,  even orally, to the principle of withdrawing from the  territories it occupied in 1967, whether Palestinian, Syrian,  Lebanese, or Jordanian territories.    ['Ubaydat] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat: Will the Peres-'Arafat  meeting give a glimmer of hope?    ['Urayqat] I believe that what is important is not  formalities, procedural matters, and the level of the meetings.  What is important is the substance of the meetings.  Regrettably, the Israeli Government has been taking successive  formal procedures that have not yet risen to the required  serious level. Thus, I do not pin much hope on this expected  meeting. However, all I am saying is that the ball is now in  the Israeli Government's court. This government should make a  decision on evacuating the settlers from the centers of Gaza,  Hebron, and Nabulus and on not objecting to real international  protection for the Palestinian people.    ['Ubaydat] Dr. 'Aziz al-Duwayk: Security Council Resolution  904 condemned the al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre in Hebron and  called for international protection in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip. Do the Islamic circles have reservations over this  resolution?    [Al-Duwayk] Yes. This resolution disappointed all political  currents in the occupied territories. As a matter of fact, this  resolution shows that the United Nations, led by the United  States, is totally biased toward Israel. This resolution does  not contain any mechanism to achieve security for the  Palestinian people who were afflicted by the terrible bloody  massacre. Thus, the resolution is deficient in this regard  because it canceled the known fact that Jerusalem is an  indivisible part of the occupied Palestinian territories.    ['Ubaydat] But some circles have welcomed the deployment of  Palestinian police forces in Hebron.    [Al-Duwayk] We, in fact, do not need security forces that  lack the power of enforcement. The whole world is already  witnessing what is taking place. The media informs the world of  what happens. Thus, we do not need a new observer to tell the  world about the number of victims and losses. We are in a dire  need of real security and peace. In my opinion, this can only  be achieved if the occupation and settlements are removed.</p>

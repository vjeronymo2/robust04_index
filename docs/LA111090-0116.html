			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAINS IN FATAL CRASH MECHANICALLY OK  </P> <P> Investigators have found no evidence of mechanical malfunctioning preceding the  collision of two freight trains this week that killed four and injured two  others, railroad and federal officials said.  </P> <P> Tests of the locomotives, the rail tracks and the elevated signals that warn  railway workers of oncoming trains have indicated that the equipment functioned  properly -- apparently raising the possibility that Wednesday's crash was  caused by human error.  </P></p>

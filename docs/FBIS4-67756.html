			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GB/LL/PI: "Reinforced Cooperation Between </F> Cedra and a Swedish Company on Disposal of Radioactive Waste";  as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Wettingen, 21 Mar (ATS) -- The National Cooperative  Company for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (Cedra) and the  Swedish company in charge of the disposal of nuclear fuel (SKB)  have decided to strengthen their cooperation. Both partners  signed a research and development agreement on Monday, according  to Cedra. This four-year agreement will make it possible to  conduct research activities in two laboratories, one on Sweden's  Aspoe Island, the other in Grimsel, Switzerland.    In Grimsel, Cedra has been operating a laboratory 450 meters  below the Juchlistock summit. With this agreement, both  countries will reinforce and enhance the existing scientific  relations, Cedra said. Scientists will establish new safety  measures with a view to applying them at disposal sites.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Short contracts will not attract best managers Sir, The National Association of Pension Funds, in its zeal to correct a wrong, has forgotten some of the reasons that originated long rolling contracts. I have little or no sympathy with under-performing directors who lose their jobs because of incompetence or worse. However, what about directors who lose their jobs because of ill health or unwelcome takeovers? Is it fair that they suffer? I think not. I worked in headhunting for more than 25 years at the highest level. No able manager already running a successful business is going to consider a change unless there is some underpinning of the risk. The potential loss of pension rights, maturing stock options, bonuses and other fringe benefits cannot be sufficiently compensated in a move by a large salary increase. From time to time most companies need the infusion of a high-level manager from outside and will seek such an individual in a very competitive market place. Two- or three-year contracts have been part of the inducement for individuals to undertake the risk. In spite of careful selection, advice of headhunters and due diligence by prospective candidates there is still a significant chance of the individual and company not jelling. I suspect that, in future, top managers approached about a change of job only carrying a one-year contract, will feel the balance of risk has swung too far the other way.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Oblast Committee on Statistics: "Production </F> is Falling, Like the Tower of Piza"]    [Text] Industrial enterprises in the oblast produced 4238.8  billion rubles (R) worth of products, in effective prices. Of  that, 60 percent were produced by enterprises held in the state  form of ownership, 38 percent--in mixed ownership, and 2  percent--in municipal and private ownership.    Most industrial enterprises reduced their volumes of  production as compared with January-March of last year. The  decline in production at machine building and light industry  enterprises evokes particular concern: The "Ishimselmash" plant  (a decline of 86 percent), the joint-stock companies "Ishimskiy  Machine Building Plant" (82 percent), the "Electromechanical  Plant" (63 percent), the "Zavodoukovskiy Machine Building Plant"  (53 percent), "Krosno" (57 percent), and the "Ishimskiy Shoe  Factory" (by 72 percent). Product output at enterprises of the  "Russian Timber Merchants", in the fish and dairy industries and  others has declined by more than one-third.    Enterprises of the "Gazprom" concern, AO "Tyumenenergo," PO  "Yamalneftegazzhelezobeton," TOO "Turbomechanical Plant" and  others have increased the output of industrial production.    In January-March of this year, the volume of oil and gas  condensate extracted by the oblast's enterprises declined by 8  million tonnes (13.7 percent) as compared with the analogous  period last year.    There was 0.5 percent less natural gas extracted than in  January-March of 1993.    The major gas extracting association Urengoygazprom reduced  its extraction of gas by 4.4 billion cubic meters, or 5.9  percent, as compared with the analogous period last year.    Production volumes of electrical power, synthetic resins and  plastics, wood milling lathes, oil rigs, oil drilling and  geological survey equipment, technological equipment for light  industry, concrete mixers, prefabricated reinforced concrete  structures and parts, building brick and other types of  materials have declined.    At the same time, the rates of decline in the production  volumes of lumber materials and plywood and timbercutting been  reduced slightly as compared with January-February of this year.    Production has increased for diesel fuel, automotive  gasoline, machines for application of mineral fertilizers,  parquet flooring and cement.    The oblast's industrial enterprises produced 31.4 percent  less consumer goods than in the same period last year.</p>

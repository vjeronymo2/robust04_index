			<p>BFN     [Text] As the war of words between Hong Kong and Beijing  took another turn, the Governor, Chris Patten, yesterday  shrugged off the snub by Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, who said he would not meet him during a  trip to Hong Kong next week. "I've got a busy programme next  week as some of you may know so I don't feel particularly  neglected," Patten said. But he added: "Even though I'll have a  busy schedule next week, as he does, I'll be prepared...to  change the schedule at any time if it was convenient to director  Lu Ping."    According to an opinion poll conducted for EASTERN EXPRESS,  more than 70 percent of respondents think Lu should meet the  Governor. "I think the people of Hong Kong want to see us  cooperating. I think they want to see us getting on with  planning for the future. I think they want to see us working in  the interest of the livelihood of the whole community," Patten  said. "But, I've expressed my point of view, and I am sorry  that director Lu Ping's schedule is so busy."    He said it was the Hong Kong government and the Executive  Council that invited the Bank of China to become a note-issuing  bank. He said it illustrated the extremely good financial  cooperation between Hong Kong and China, which was an important  part of the transitional process. Patten said that, although he  was not invited to meet Lu, he hoped those who went to the  "important ceremony" celebrating the issue of new notes would  have a "smashing time". He denied a report by a British  newspaper that his heart was in the United Kingdom and he was  hoping to go back to the UK as soon as possible, saying he went  to London as frequently as his predecessor.    Zhang Jun-sheng, the deputy director of the local New China  News Agency (XINHUA) said Lu's refusal to meet the Governor did  not violate the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). "The MOU  said the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  should meet the Governor, but it did not say when. When there  is a meeting between the two, there should be something to tall  about," said Zhang.    Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for  Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), was disappointed by Lu's refusal  to meet Patten. "We hope Lu and Patten can meet as soon as  possible. Of course, we do not think one meeting can resolve all  the issues. But still we believe meeting with Lu and Patten will  be helpful," Tsang said. "We have been all along proposing to  both governments that normal and regular meetings between Lu an  Patten would be necessary an important for Hong Kong' smooth  transition."    DAB's vice-chairman, Tar Yiu-chung, believed that the excuse  of "having a busy schedule" was "superficial".</p>

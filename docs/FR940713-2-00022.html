CNG proposes to sell the facilities at the net book values, which are $56,571.55 for the Gibsonia and $17,211.13 for the Mars Station.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefore, the proposed activity shall be deemed authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filling a protest.

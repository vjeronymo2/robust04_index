			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Soviet debt to Finland falls as trade drops ACCORDING to figures released by the Bank of Finland, the total Soviet debt to Finland reached around FM5.6bn, (Dollars 1.4bn) at the end of last March, dropping from some FM6.5bn at the end of 1990. The drop in the debt was mainly attributable to credits and deposits received by Finnish commercial banks from the USSR. Of the total FM5.6bn debt owed by the Soviets to Finland, FM2.2bn was made up of over five-year-long clearing credits, FM1.2bn in five to seven-year hard-cash credits and FM1bn in one-year hard-cash credits given by Finnish banks. Another FM400m is in a special clearing account with the remaining FM800m being hard-cash payments in arrears. Apart from these receivables, the balance of payments in the clearing account is at present Dollars 100m in favour of the Soviets. This money will be used to pay back the debt owed by Moscow to Finnish companies. Finland is facing a severe recession which has also been exacerbated by the sharp plunge in trade with the USSR, after the Finnish-Soviet clearing system switched to hard currency at the beginning of 1991. Mr Mauno Koivisto, the Finnish president told Mr Valentin Pavlov, Soviet Prime Minister, this week in London that he hoped both countries could switch back to trade based on barter. Given the economic and political instability in the USSR, observers are sceptical of such a change. Meanwhile, Finnair, the state-owned airline, and the Soviet airline, Aeroflot, have signed an agreement which is aimed at studying the prospects of forming a joint venture to offer air services between Leningrad and the rest of Europe. With its home base in Leningrad, the joint venture airline would use a part of Finnair's DC-9 fleet and use Finnish airlines maintenance and training facilities in Helsinki.</p>

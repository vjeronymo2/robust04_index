			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Costs of closing London hospitals challenged THE CASE for restructuring London's hospital services is thrown into doubt by a study which challenges a central element of the financial basis of the closure proposals. The study, by Ernst &amp; Young, management consultants, was commissioned by the Royal Marsden and Royal Brompton hospitals. It says the capital costs of closing them under the government-commissioned Tomlinson report would be up to Pounds 62m. This conflicts with a health authority calculation that the closures would be Pounds 10.6m cheaper than alternative options. Ministers will make final decisions on the Tomlinson report next month. Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern regional health authority and author of the report, will today discuss his recommendations at a conference of National Health Service managers in London. The Tomlinson report's opponents believe the financial evidence with which ministers would have to defend some of the proposed hospital closures is thin and flawed. They will see the Ernst &amp; Young study as evidence that more research into the likely costs and savings of a closure programme is required. Under the Tomlinson recommendations, the Charing Cross hospital at Hammersmith would close. The Chelsea-based Royal Marsden and Royal Brompton  -the former a leading cancer centre and the latter specialising in heart and lung conditions - would then transfer to the vacant Charing Cross buildings. This plan mirrors a proposal put to the Tomlinson inquiry by North West Thames regional health authority, which concluded that it would be Pounds 10.6m cheaper than simply closing Charing Cross and leaving the Royal Marsden and Royal Brompton unchanged. However, the Ernst &amp; Young study concludes that the health authority's analysis contained a number of items - including income from the sale of two other redundant hospitals, the Western Ophthalmic and Samaritan - that would occur regardless of whether Charing Cross closed. When these factors were excluded, says the Ernst &amp; Young report, the net capital cost of closing the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden instead of Charing Cross 'could be as much as Pounds 62.5m, but not less than Pounds 47.4m.' The Ernst &amp; Young study was handed to Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, late last week. Under the Tomlinson recommendations, several of London's most famous hospitals, including St Bartholomew's in the City, would close. Sir Bernard's opponents were initially doubtful of their chances of success, given the broad support for transferring resources to family doctor and community services. However critics now feel that the financial basis of the proposals can be challenged. They believe government hopes of using revenue from the sale of surplus hospitals to fund the restructuring will prove unattainable in the current economic climate. The Ernst &amp; Young study estimates the current market value of the Charing Cross site at Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m, compared with a Department of Health valuation of Pounds 70m in 1990.</p>

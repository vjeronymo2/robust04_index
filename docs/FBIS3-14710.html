			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beirut, 26 Mar (MENA)--A Lebanese newspaper today  published new information about the Lebanese network that  recently carried out a series of sabotage operations, most of  whose members have been arrested.    Lebanon's AL-SAFIR says that Israel played a key role in  planning these operations. Two Israeli officers from the Shin  Bet, Israel's state security service, paid several visits to  Lebanon and held contacts and meetings with the members of the  network. Some of these meetings took place in Israel and  Cyprus. The paper adds that employees of the Lebanese Forces'  security service took part in these meetings.    The paper says that members of this network live outside  Lebanon. They were transported to Lebanon on rubber dinghies  with the help of the Israeli Navy to carry out these sabotage  operations and plant explosives in places of worship and the  headquarters of political parties and to attack religious  leaders in the Christian areas.    AL-SAFIR says that after the Sayyidat al-Najat Church  explosion, most of the members of the group that carried out the  operation were evacuated by sea or by infiltrating across the  occupied border strip with forged identity cards.    The paper says that the Lebanese security services received  important information about the suspects and explosives experts  who had carried out such operations during the civil war, thus  facilitating the quick arrest of the network members.    The paper explains that the information and confessions  obtained by the security services confirm that this network had  planned a further series of explosions in the Christian areas to  strongly shock the Christian community, cause sectarian strife,  and encourage Christian fundamentalists to begin clamoring for  autonomous security organs for the Christian community and  demanding international protection.    The newspaper AL-SAFIR says that the operations involved  attacks against places of worship and clerical and political  figures and the desecration of Christian cemeteries. The  masterminds of these operations aimed to undermine national  unity, disrupt relations with Syria -- a country that provides  Lebanon with its current security umbrella -- upset Syrian-U.S.  relations, impede the peace talks, and abort Pope John Paul II's  visit to Lebanon, scheduled for late May.    AL-SAFIR says that the scheme also aimed to point the finger  of accusation at the Lebanese Muslims after the discovery of an  unexploded bomb bearing the inscription: "There is no God but  God."    The paper accuses some French quarters of trying to  establish  an unofficial bridge between Lebanon and Israel by arranging a  meeting between former Lebanese Army Commander General Michel  'Awn, currently living in Paris, and Uri Lubrani, coordinator of  Israeli activity in Lebanon and the head of the delegation  negotiating with Lebanon.</p>

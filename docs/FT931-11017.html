			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers set limits on pact compromise COFFEE PRODUCING countries have set firm limits on the price they are prepared to pay for a new international pact, Brazil, the world's biggest producer, warned yesterday. After two weeks of talks the fifth round looks like ending today with virtually no progress towards a pact with economic clauses. Delegates were meeting late into last night in a bid to clear a deadlock over whether there should be a review of the export quota system after one year of operation. No attempt has been made to tackle crucial points such as how to determine quota size or the price range to be defended. The fourth round of talks ended in December with consumers blaming producer countries for the lack of progress. Yesterday Mr Valdemar Leao, the producers' spokesman, said producers had to a large extent agreed to consumer demands, particularly for a universal quota and selectivity, under which the mix of the different coffee types exported would be determined - the producers proposing division into four types, the consumers favouring three. 'We have compromised - but there are limits,' Mr Leao said. Mr Rubens Barbosa, the new head of the Brazilian delegation, said producers were not prepared to keep conceding without any concessions from the consumers. 'We have the political will to work for an agreement,' he said. 'We have doubts that the consumers still have this will.' The agreement expires at the end of March, and provision has been made for a sixth round of talks in the last week of that month.</p>

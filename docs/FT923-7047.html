			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Foreign exchange gains boost Canon CANON, the Japanese leading office equipment maker, posted a rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the interim term to June thanks to foreign exchange gains. The company unveiled a 4.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y39.9bn (Dollars 316.04m) despite a 2.8 per cent fall in sales to Y507.3bn and a 15 per cent decline in operating profits to Y31.2bn. After-tax profits rose a marginal 1.3 per cent to Y22.3bn. Canon said its sales were depressed by a slump in its camera sales due to the sluggish domestic and overseas economies. Camera sales fell 19.4 per cent to Y78.8bn, although office equipment, such as fax machines and information equipment, rose 3.3 per cent to Y406.6bn. A rise in non-operating profits, thanks to Y5.4bn in gains on foreign exchange, helped the company at the pre-tax profit level. For the full year to December, Canon forecasts a 1.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits on a 2.4 per cent increase in sales. The company expects brisk demand from retail customers for its printers to support overall sales.</p>

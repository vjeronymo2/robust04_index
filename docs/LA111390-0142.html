			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BANKS, S&amp;LS SHOW MIXED 3RD QUARTER;  </P> <P> FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: SOME FIRMS REPORT INCREASED EARNINGS BECAUSE OF  ACQUISITIONS, WHILE OTHERS SEE THEIR PROFITS FALL BECAUSE THEY PUT ASIDE MONEY  FOR POTENTIAL LOAN LOSSES.  </P> <P> Major banks and savings and loans in the area escaped big losses in the quarter  that ended Sept. 30, unlike some important banks nationwide. But, as a group,  the local banks and S&amp;Ls turned in mixed performances.  </P> <P> Of the nine larger banks and S&amp;Ls in the region stretching from Ventura to  Glendale, four reported an increase in quarterly profits, two reported profits  after losing money a year ago and three reported a decline in earnings. None  reported losses.  </P> <P> Usually results at financial institutions depend mostly on how they are  affected by interest rates. But in the recent quarter the most notable declines  and gains in profits depended on a variety of factors: Some institutions  reported increased earnings because of acquisitions, while others saw their  profits fall because they put aside money for potential loan losses.  </P> <P> Although recession fears abound nationwide, John Keating, chief executive of CU  Bancorp, the Encino parent of California United Bank said, "I don't see a  recession now."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, California United boosted its contribution to reserves for  possible loan losses. As a result, the bank's net income fell 22% to $1.2  million in the quarter, even while its assets grew 6% to $463.6 million. A  loan-loss reserve is money a bank puts aside in case borrowers default on their  loans.  </P> <P> By contributing $1.45 million to its loan-loss reserves this quarter, compared  with $300,000 a year ago, California United increased its overall reserve to  $4.79 million from $3.67 million a year before. But the change did not reflect  an increase in problem loans. Non-performing loans -- a category that includes  real estate the bank repossessed, plus loans with payments past due -- barely  inched up, to $5.99 million from $5.96 million a year ago.  </P> <P> So why did Keating boost these reserves now? To be conservative, he said, in  case the local economy really does slow down.  </P> <P> Banks and S&amp;Ls in the quarter saw prevailing interest rates fall slightly  compared with a year ago. One measure of the decline is that the average  overall interest rate paid by savings and loans in California, Arizona and  Nevada on their savings accounts, certificates of deposit and other money they  borrow fell from 8.81% in September, 1989, to 8.09% in September, 1990,  according to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.  </P> <P> But the decline was too small to be very important to banks. In general, banks  are able to cope with changing rates because they can quickly lower the  interest rate they pay on deposits if there is a decline in the interest rate  they can charge on loans.  </P> <P> The largest bank in the region, Independence Bank in Encino, said its net  income plunged 72% to $250,000 for the third quarter. But the bank's assets  grew 22% to $764.6 million on Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Independence's chairman, Fulvio V. Dobrich, said profits fell because in the  year-ago quarter the bank made no contribution to its loan-loss reserves, while  this year it added about $1 million to those reserves in the latest period.  Independence is privately owned, and Dobrich said it does not try to smooth out  its results by making smaller, more regular additions to those reserves.  </P> <P> From June 30 to Sept. 30, Independence's non-performing assets increased from  about $30 million to about $39 million, but Dobrich said the increase was due  to a single loan. And since the end of the quarter, he said, non-performing  assets have actually dropped to below $30 million.  </P> <P> Independence's addition to its loan-loss reserve meant the bank did not do well  during the quarter according to one key measure of performance -- return on  average assets. The ROA is the annualized rate of profit a bank earns on its  average assets, and a return of 1% is considered excellent. But Independence  turned in an ROA of just 0.13% in the latest quarter.  </P> <P> Levy Bancorp, the Ventura parent of Bank of A. Levy, said its net income  increased 30% to $2 million for the third quarter, giving the bank an  impressive ROA of 1.32%. Levy's assets grew 7% to $621.3 million as of Sept.  30.  </P> <P> Ventura County National Bancorp, the parent company of Ventura County National  Bank and Frontier Bank, saw its assets bulge 65% to $400.9 million on Sept. 30.  Meanwhile, Ventura's third-quarter profit jumped 71% from a year ago to $1.4  million. Both increases were due mostly to the bank's acquisition of Frontier  in October, 1989, and to its acquisition of the deposits of Westco Savings Bank  earlier this year. Ventura's third-quarter ROA was 1.04%.  </P> <P> TransWorld Bancorp, the Sherman Oaks parent of TransWorld Bank, said its net  income grew 13% to $620,000 for the third quarter, giving it an ROA of 1.13%.  TransWorld's assets grew 10% to $226.4 million on Sept. 30.  </P> <P> APSB Bancorp, the parent of American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks,  enjoyed a good quarter. APSB did increase its loan-loss reserves, although  problem loans haven't increased. But the bank's earnings continued to be strong  as net income grew 30% to $566,000 for the quarter, while its assets climbed  15% to $204.1 million on Sept. 30. APSB had an ROA of 1.14%.  </P> <P> "I've seen nothing related to recession yet," said Frank J. Ures Jr., chief  executive of the bank, which specializes in making loans to small businesses,  under a program sponsored by the federal Small Business Administration.  </P> <P> The story was different for thrifts in the period. Unlike banks, S&amp;Ls lend  most of their money in the form of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) whose  interest rates are sometimes adjusted only once or twice a year and so don't  keep up when rates are rising. Meanwhile S&amp;Ls have to pay higher rates to  attract and keep deposits.  </P> <P> A year ago, such climbing interest rates were hurting S&amp;Ls. But thrifts are  enjoying the benefits of a slight decline in rates this year, which took the  squeeze off their profits.  </P> <P> For example, Citadel Holding Corp., the Glendale parent of Fidelity Federal  Bank, said it had a profit of $4.9 million in the third quarter that ended  Sept. 30 compared with a loss of $2.3 million a year before. Citadel's assets  climbed 14% to $5.63 billion, buoyed by the thrift's acquisition in August of  the deposits and certain assets of Westwood Savings &amp; Loan and Investment  Savings &amp; Loan from the federal government. Nevertheless, Citadel's ROA for  the period was an unimpressive 0.36%.  </P> <P> Glenfed, parent of the region's largest thrift, Glendale Federal Bank, said its  profit fell 10% to $17.7 million in the period, its fiscal first quarter.  Meanwhile Glenfed's assets inched up 2% to $25.1 billion on Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Keith P. Russell Jr., Glenfed's chief operating officer, said one of the main  reasons for the profit performance was that Glenfed has all but stopped selling  mortgages it writes to investors; as a result, Glenfed's gains from loan sales,  before taxes, dropped to $1.5 million in the recent quarter from $19.1 million  a year before.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Glenfed halved its quarterly dividend to shareholders, to 15 cents,  to save about $5.4 million that the S&amp;L will use to boost its capital,  which is the money a thrift must have as a cushion against possible losses.  </P> <P> Still, Glenfed said its net earnings from "continuing operations" -- its basic  loan-making business -- climbed to $19.6 million for the first quarter from  $15.6 million last year.  </P> <P> Even Valley Federal Savings, a Van Nuys thrift, earned a profit of $5.5 million  for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 compared with a loss of $70.7 million a  year before.  </P> <P> Valley Federal has been operating under the terms of a strict agreement with  the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because its capital reserves do not  meet federal standards. In reaching the agreement last spring, Valley Federal  dodged the immediate threat of being seized by the federal government.  </P> <P> In the same quarter a year ago, most of Valley Federal's loss came from  writeoffs made in its All Valley Acceptance Co. subsidiary, which made loans on  mobile homes. But Valley Federal also lost money then on its basic  deposit-gathering and mortgage-lending business.  </P> <P> As of Sept. 30, the S&amp;L still had a deficit of $22.3 million in tangible  capital -- essentially its net worth minus the value of some non-cash assets.  Valley Federal said its earnings so far this year were slightly better than  what the government's plan requires. And the S&amp;L has shrunk in size, as is  called for under the plan, by about 14% to $2.72 billion in assets as of Sept.  30.  </P> <P> QUARTERLY REPORT FROM THE REGION'S LARGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  </P> <P> Note: This table may be divided, and additional information on a particular  entry may appear on more than one screen.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.43IN:2.22IN:2.33IN:2.00IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Assets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Sept. 30  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Change from  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Profit  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Change from  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Banks  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year ago  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (Loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year ago  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Independence Bank  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> $764.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> +22%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> $250,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> -72%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Levy Bancorp  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> $621.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> +7%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> $2.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> +30%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (parent of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bank of A.

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / EBRD staff told to fly economy class AMID the furore over the use of private jets by Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the bank disclosed yesterday that all other staff have been instructed to fly economy class. There are only two exceptions to the rule: Mr Attali and Mr Ron Freeman, the first vice president. Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the EBRD's budget director, said the ban on business class flights was made five weeks ago. Mr Attali and Mr Freeman were exempted because it is in their contracts, Mr Pissaloux said. Mr Pissaloux also said that 'a few months ago' he introduced a new system for controlling the costs of hiring jets for Mr Attali. The new system means that each time Mr Attali needs an aircraft, three charter companies are asked to submit bids. Mr Pissaloux said this was not a direct response to pressure from the bank's board of governors, though one of those governors, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said yesterday the governors had become concerned about the costs of the private airplanes. Mr Pissaloux added that each three months he informs the chairman of the bank's audit committee, which consists of representatives of the countries which own the bank, how much Mr Attali has spent on jets and other items in the previous quarter. 'We desire to be entirely transparent,' Mr Pissaloux said. Mr Attali, who is facing mounting criticism over internal spending at the bank, said in a recent interview it would be impossible for him to do his job without the use of private jets. 'I am sorry, I cannot do without it', he said. Such aircraft were needed, he claimed, for trips which were incompatible with commercial airline schedules. He gave an example of his schedule from 25 March to 29 March, when he flew from a meeting with the Prince of Wales, who was inaugurating the bank's head office, to Bucharest in Romania, for an environmental meeting. Then he went to Paris and from there to Hamburg. Finally he flew to Moscow where he had breakfast on the 29th with Mr Boris Federov, the Russian deputy prime minister. Mr Pissaloux insisted that private jets could sometimes work out cheaper than flying in a commercial aircraft, when large numbers of bank executives needed to be travelling together. The EBRD spent Pounds 600,000 on renting private aircraft last year and is budgeting to spend up to Pounds 400,000 this year for between 15 and 18 trips - roughly Pounds 22,000 for each use of a jet. Aircraft brokers said yesterday that even a small Learjet, seating three or four people comfortably, would cost around Pounds 2,000 an hour to charter. The bank recently called for tender offers for a chartered Learjet from at least one London area air charterer. It also wanted details on the British Aerospace 125 jet, which can carry six or seven people in luxury but costs about Pounds 3,000 an hour to charter. One air broker yesterday described the BAe 125 as 'the Rolls-Royce of private aircraft' and the Learjet as 'the Mercedes'. Private jet charter is a business that thrives on secrecy as much as economics. Corporate dealmakers like to own or charter private jets to conceal their movements from potential rivals who may monitor the public areas of airports. Mr Brian Wigham of consultancy, International Bureau of Aviation, says that private charterers buy 'convenience and security'. Luton is one of the biggest centres of private jet chartering in the UK, followed by Heathrow, Gatwick and Biggin Hill, Kent. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei  Province has simplified its enterprise registration system,  following the example of Hainan Province and other Chinese  regions.    Under the new system, enterprises need no longer get  approval  from government bodies other than the Industry and Commerce  Administration to go into operation.    To start an enterprise, an investor need only submit three  documents instead of the previous 11.    An eligible application will automatically be approved by  the  Industry and Commerce Administration, which will then issue the  business permit and give public notice of the same, official  sources said.    The new system also attaches no restrictions to an  enterprise's business range, except where state monopoly, public  security or health are involved. Therefore, no special licenses  are necessary, the sources said.    They noted that the new system is not yet fully applicable  to  stock companies, solely state-owned companies or group  companies, as it is still in the experimental stage.</p>

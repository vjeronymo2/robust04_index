			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Arts: To reconcile two quarrelling sisters - Architecture There is a theory that the English find it difficult to think in three dimensions and that the plastic arts are less appreciated here than the two dimensional or the literary. This exhibition shows that it has not always been the case. Architects' designs for sculpture 1600-1951 (until June 11, RIBA Heinz Gallery 21, Portman Square, London, W1) may not sound the most gripping of titles but the subject is a fascinating and much neglected one. Tim Knox, the curator of the exhibition, is one of the few scholars and historians with a real love for sculpture as well as an understanding of architecture. He quotes, in his small leaflet that accompanies this exhibition, the immortal words of Ruskin: 'Architecture stripped of sculpture is at best a convenient arrangement of dead walls; associated, they not only adorn but reciprocally exalt each other, and give to all the arts of the country in which they exist, a correspondent love of majesty.' When looking at this exhibition, spanning some 450 years and taken from the rich archives of the RIBA drawings collection, we see how sculpture and buildings had always been natural handmaidens. As we enter the entrance hall, the first thing we see is the splendid model of the Festival of Britain Sea and Ships pavilion, designed by Sir Basil Spence in 1951. This fascinating but temporary building was embellished throughout with works of art. It was in many ways a model of how things might have been if modern architects had continued the kind of collaborative partnership that Spence encouraged with other artists. He was to do the same thing at Coventy Cathedral, where Epstein's figures of St Michael and the devil are among the last conventional figurative sculptural commissions for a public building in this century. We have now become much more used to the inevitable Henry Moore on its lonely plinth outside a contemporary building. No one can doubt the fact that sculpture and architecture are sister arts - but standing as we do, contemplating the sad fag-end of modernism at the end of this century, all one can see in contemporary buildings is the visible evidence of the sisters' quarrel and falling out. The lack of understanding of sculpture, or indeed many of the visual arts, by contemporary architects is yet another example of their isolation. Knox does not enlighten us much about the current divorce between artists and architects beyond saying that engineering is now the ruling force in architecture, and that something like the Lloyds' building is itself so much a three dimensional object that it leaves no room for any other form of artistic commission. Architects traditionally learned to draw from the casts of antique sculpture, and on their Grand Tour travels in Italy and Greece, it was sculpture as much as architecture that took the eye. The evidence of those travels shows up well in the early part of the 18th century when pediments and skylines of new town and country houses were bristling with authentically classical sculpture. The choice of subjects for pediments, 'Hercules cleaning out the Augean cow byres', for example, ranges from the bizarre to the conventional. The formal arrangements of eighteenth century classical architecture demanded controlled cooperation from sculptors and they clearly enjoyed the discipline of working within a classical framework. Sculptors of the calibre of Rysbrack and Flaxman enjoyed the chance to work on a large scale and in prominent places. Knox is wise to point out that the Reformation killed off religious sculpture in England; and the modest scale of royal and state patronage also denied architects and artists the chance offered to their European colleagues - that of working on an heroic scale. English Baroque architecture does not have the sculptural content of much European architecture of the same date. By the middle of the nineteenth century there was a flowering of sculpture and decoration that matched the boom in architectural commissions. The Gothic revival and especially the work of Pugin and Barry at the Palace of Westminster brought the combination of the plastic arts and architecture to an unsurpassed apotheosis: the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the revival of church furnishings encouraged by the Ecclesiological Society almost led to the mass production of ornament and sculpture. Commercial firms took on the task of promoting ornament and the manufacture of artificial stone, terracotta and other materials made sculptural decoration universally available. The drawings in the exhibition of the Alfred Waterhouse's Natural History Museum show anthropomorphic art and decoration on a scale that no architect could ever imagine today. I particularly admired the intense drawings of Henry Wilson, who was to abandon full scale sculptural work and concentrate on his Arts and Crafts jewellery. His First World War memorial at Tonbridge school is a brilliant creation and it is a scandal that it is still lying dismembered after the fire that recently destroyed almost the whole school chapel. The attempt to show drawings of twentieth century works is inevitably limited. There is a telling horror of a student drawing by Lubetkin, a giant howitzer running with a flow of red water - a crude attempt to dramatise the horror of war in an animated memorial (mercifully never built).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, June 13 (MTI) -- Hungarian Socialist  Party (MSZP) Chairman Gyula Horn and Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ) Chairman Ivan Peto held an hour-long meeting at MSZP  headquarters on Monday in Budapest. Following the meeting, Horn  told journalists the MSZP presented a compromise proposal  regarding the guarantees of the coalition agreement which is to  be worked out. He said they had exchanged views on the  distribution of government offices and ministries, but no  concrete persons were mentioned in this context.    These issues will be discussed by the general negotiating  delegations of the two parties on Tuesday. The MSZP naturally  has ideas as regards personnel, but that is a topic for the  general committee talks, Horn said.    As regards the post of deputy prime minister, Peto said the  main point was not the introduction of the post itself, but  rather that the smaller coalition-partner will have a person  alongside the prime minister to represent it in the course of  coordinations. The name of the function -- deputy prime  minister or coalition deputy prime minister -- is a technical  matter to be decided. At the same time, it is obvious that the  SZDSZ's representative will not fill in for the prime minister  in a case of his absence, Peto added.    Both chairmen said the guarantees imply only the first step  towards a coalition agreement. The concrete issues are to be  discussed by the expert committees, and reaching agreements in  these will not be an easy task. Peto said they wanted to govern  jointly, but this does not mean they can quickly agree on the  details.    Horn and Peto also said they consider the first session of  the new parliament on June 28 to be a determining factor with  respect to the timetable for coalition talks. Their goal is to  complete negotiations by then, although the concrete  establishment of the new government is not bound to the opening  of Parliament.    According to the two chairmen, an agreement should be  concluded by around June 24, in order for the MSZP Congress and  the SZDSZ delegate assembly to be able to ratify the document  before the founding session of parliament.</p>

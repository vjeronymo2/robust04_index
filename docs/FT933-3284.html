			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Norway cold shoulders EC: Voter hostility to the Community KNOCK-OUT against the EC, proclaimed the tabloid headline yesterday alongside a picture of Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of Norway's triumphant Centre party, her hand held high like a victorious boxer. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour party may have 'won' Monday's election by upping its vote and reinforcing its hold on power as a minority government. But there was no doubt in Oslo yesterday that the advance made by the Centre party, surging to become the second largest group in the Storting (parliament) on the back of its vehement opposition to Norway joining the EC, was the most dramatic feature of the electoral race and one which poses considerable problems for the government. Labour was under no illusion before the election that winning a referendum on EC membership sometime during the term of the new parliament would be an easy feat. Now that task has been made more difficult, with anti-EC forces, even within Labour's ranks, strengthened in parliament. The result will also have sent a shudder through the right-centre governments in Sweden and Finland. Not only will opponents to the EC in those countries take heart from the Norwegian election result, but prime ministers Carl Bildt and Esko Aho will have been dismayed by the dismal performance of their ideological allies in Norway, the Conservative party. Under Mrs Kaci Kullman-Five, the Conservatives, the strongest advocates of Norwegian EC membership, suffered their worst defeat in 30 years, surrendering their traditional position as the second largest party. The Conservatives will have just 29 seats in the 165-member parliament, while the Centre party will have 31, almost three times its representation in the previous Storting. The other right-of-centre forces, the Progress party and the Christian Democrats, also lost heavily. Before the election the Centre party was a marginal force, ranking sixth among the seven parliamentary parties. Formed in 1920 to represent farmers, whose proportion of the workforce has now fallen to less than 5 per cent, its previous highest share of the vote was 11.6 per cent in 1973, following the 1972 referendum rejecting EC membership. On Monday it won 18.5 per cent of the vote as it cashed in on widespread support for its defence of Norway's independence and system of high subsidies to the country's remote rural communities. The party's popularity was boosted by the down-to-earth charm of the youthful Ms Lahnstein, who hammered home a relentless message that the EC must be rejected, earning the nickname 'The No Queen'. Ms Lahnstein, party leader since 1991, will now use the election result as a springboard to defeat Labour's pro-EC strategy. Ominously for the government, the party has suggested it may use its new-found strength to block ratification of membership even if a Yes vote is secured in a referendum. Anti-EC strength in the Storting is now sufficient to block the three-fourths majority required for ratification, regardless of a referendum's outcome. In the face of the Centre party's advance, Labour did well to increase its Storting strength from 63 to 67 seats, winning support particularly from the anti-EC Socialist Left party through a combination of an ambivalent campaign stance on the EC and an improving economic outlook. Its task now is to secure an EC accession agreement in negotiations with Brussels, which it could then sell to the electorate as a good deal on the key issues of oil, fish, agriculture and regional policy. With opinion polls showing 58 per cent of voters against membership, Labour leaders say they will not risk a referendum unless they win concessions from the EC. Although most of the Labour leadership is committed to Norway joining the Community, they are determined not to commit political suicide over the issue. Mrs Brundtland has left no doubt that she would withdraw Norway's application if she did not win the negotiating result sought. Indeed, Labour leaders talk of the 'fallback' position for Oslo provided by the European Economic Area trade pact, which Oslo has approved and which should come into force by next year. It would give Norway many of the economic benefits of full membership, albeit without the influence to shape policy. But they believe it is still possible to change opinion, just as they transformed poll ratings as low as 25 per cent for Labour during the summer into an election victory. 'When we have a negotiating result, we will start the EC campaign,' said Mr Jens Stoltenberg, Labour's deputy leader. 'So far it has been a one-sided war. The No camp has had a walk-over up until now. 'At least this election shows the Labour party is able to campaign and is able to change the minds of voters.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NORWEGIAN ELECTION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Projected results* Parliamentary seats: 165**  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1993         1989  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Labour                            67           63 Centre                            31           11 Conservative                      28           37 Socialist Left                    13           17 Christian Democrat                13           14 Progress                          11           22 Liberal                            1            0 Red Choice Alliance                1            0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Forecasts by the Norwegian news agency NTB, based on 89.1% of the vote. **The 1989 parliament had 164 seats.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

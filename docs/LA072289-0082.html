			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PIANIST MARCUS ROBERTS MAKES HIS LOCAL DEBUT  </P> <P> On a temporary leave of absence from the Wynton Marsalis Quintet, the widely  praised 25-year-old pianist Marcus Roberts made his local debut as a leader  Thursday at the Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill, heading his own acoustic quintet.  </P> <P> Like Marsalis, Roberts has elected to pattern himself along the lines of the  1960s hard-bop groups, using mostly conventional instrumentation and material,  with trumpet, saxophone, bass and drums for company.  </P> <P> If Roberts has not yet found a strongly individual route to follow, he  compensates through his often ingenious incorporation of a variety of early  keyboard styles.  </P> <P> Three pervasive elements of the set were the blues, John Coltrane and  Thelonious Monk. Of the six tunes, four had a blues basis, beginning with  Roberts' own "Country by Choice," continuing with Monk's "Blue Bolivar Blues"  and ending with the quirky "Raise Four." A Todd Williams original entitled "For  Coltrane" (also a blues) showcased well-crafted soprano and tenor sax solos by  Herbert Harris III, whose other feature, "I Wish I Knew," is a 1945 pop song  best known through Coltrane's recording.  </P> <P> Completing the group were the capable Scotty Barnhart on trumpet, and two young  musicians from St. Louis, Maurice Carnes on drums and Chris Thomas on bass. The  latter pair had a little trouble establishing the steady, sympathetic pulse  that could have given the rhythm section a fuller measure of cohesion.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, only the opening "Country by Choice" was excerpted from Roberts'  successful debut album. He would be well-advised to use more items from that  diversified collection. We bow to no one in our admiration for the blues, but  isn't four of six a trifle excessive?  </P> <P> Roberts closes Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

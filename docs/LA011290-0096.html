			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCDONALD'S TO OFFER DISCOUNTS TO HOMELESS  </P> <P> McDonald's Corp. has volunteered to provide discounted Big Macs and other  fast-food meals to homeless families enrolled in the city's emergency shelter  and voucher program, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley announced Thursday.  </P> <P> McDonald's, which will be reimbursed by the city, will provide 4,000 meal  coupons for distribution by nine social service agencies involved in the city's  program of offering hotel vouchers to homeless families whenever temperatures  dip below 40 degrees, or under 50 degrees when rain is likely.  </P> <P> "We think this is an innovative approach," Bradley said at a news conference at  the downtown Chicana Service Action Center, one of the nine facilities for  coupon distribution. "It is one of the ways in which other food service  corporations in this community can serve their social consciousness," Bradley  said.  </P> <P> Gregory Hogan, a spokesman for McDonald's, said the program was a first for the  company in Southern California.  </P></p>

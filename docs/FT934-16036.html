			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Property: Leaders and laggards - The notion that commercial property lags the main business cycle is wrong yields exceeding 9 per cent and capital values some 40 per cent below their 1989 peak - should have prompted institutional investors to snap up property at bargain prices 12 months ago. But the cocktail proved unappetising. It was to be another year before institutional buyers would rediscover their taste for commercial property. What went wrong? Most UK institutional investors believe that commercial property values still lag the main business cycle. This time differential, they add, can be beneficial to the industry: it gives insti-tutions plenty of time to react after the economy has turned. Institutions' willingness to watch the economy turn before making their own investment decisions is intimately linked to their rationale for buying property in the first place. Property provides a future stream of rental income, which is at least partially inflation-linked, via upward-only rent reviews. Commercial property is therefore perceived by institutions as an attractive home for the funds of those investors which have inflation-linked liabilities such as pension funds. Since inflation typically lags the business cycle by up to two years and is believed to drive property values, the commercial property market has come to be characterised as 'late cycle' - one that lags the main business cycle. Nevertheless, there is a negative side to commercial property investment - buildings are not a very liquid asset, unlike equities and bonds. This dilemma poses a problem for any fund manager who needs to make significant and rapid changes in a fund's property weightings in accordance with the swings in a business cycle. Despite this drawback, most fund managers remain comfortable with property as an asset. Fund managers believe they have ample time after spotting the turn in a business cycle in which to make strategic changes in their property weightings. But they are wrong. The conventional wisdom of 'late cycle' does not stand up to scrutiny. The evidence from a comparison of the behaviour of commercial property values and real gross domestic product shows that over the period covering the last three UK business cycles (1970-92) changes in commercial property values and real GDP have invariably coincided. The property investor should, on this evidence, be treating the markets as an 'early cycle' play - assessing his position and making investment decisions ahead of the general business cycle. Ignoring this 'early cycle' factor would doom him to chasing prices up while a seller would be resigned to pursuing falling values. As chart one shows, in a comparison of the absolute level of commercial property prices and real GDP, commercial property prices in the last cycle peaked in the fourth quarter of 1989 - two quarters before the peak in GDP. Similar time-lags have been identified in the UK economy, which bottomed out in the second quarter of 1991. The difficulty for investors on both occasions was that their recognition of a turn in the economy would have lagged by two quarters - the extra time was needed by investors to assimilate and respond to final official figures on the economy as a whole. Given that on average it takes a further six months to conclude a property transaction the investor would only have been in a position to amend his investment portfolio in the middle of this year - some 18 months into the economy's tentative recovery. Such time-lags provoke uncertainty and impede investments. What investors need, above all, is a reliable early warning signal that business activity and commercial property prices are on the turn. The preferred early warning indicator is interest rates, which provide a reliable and sufficiently long-lead indicator of business activity, primarily for three reasons: First, changes in interest rates will affect the real economy by altering individual consumption levels and the willingness of companies to invest. With a 12-18 month lag, tenant demand for commercial property begins to respond to changes in aggregate expenditure in the economy. Second, a large number of property transactions are financed by bank borrowings and are therefore sensitive to interest-rate changes. The volume of property transactions may be even more sensitive to the willingness of banks to make extra loans to the sector, given the extent of their bad property loans following the boom and bust of the late 1980s. The availability and cost of finance will have a greater impact over the short term than changes in rent levels (which are made every three to five years). Third, holding financial assets incurs an opportunity cost - the interest forgone on cash deposits. When interest rates for deposits fall they enhance the relative attractiveness of yields on all other financial assets, including property. The same is true of long-term interest rates on, for example, government bonds. On this basis it should have been possible to spot a 'sell signal' well in advance of the peak in property prices in mid-1989. This peak had been preceded by UK short-term interest rates reaching their low point 18 months earlier. An institutional investor acting at this low point in interest rates would have had a year in which to find buyers - allowing for the six months it commonly takes to conclude a property transaction. When should investors have spotted the buy signal? A declining trend in UK short-term interest rates only became apparent in the first quarter of 1991, when rates were 14 per cent, accelerating in the third quarter of 1992 when sterling left the exchange rate mechanism. Given the normal time-lags, economic recovery could have been expected to begin in the first quarter of 1992, which it did. In principle a property market recovery should have been discernible by September 1992. Yet by this summer there had not been a significant rise in property prices. However, the market average indicated by the Hillier Parker Capital Index masks a big rise in property prices in the significant retail segment of the commercial property market in the six months to June. Some properties with strong creditworthiness and long leases have already seen increases in value in excess of 10 per cent. In the present cycle, not only has the buying signal been given by an earlier decline in short-term interest rates, but it has been reinforced by the accompanying fall in long-term rates. The consequence is that for the first time in a generation property yields stand at a premium over long gilt yields. This suggests that investors are, in effect, valuing commercial property on the premise that future rental increases offer no protection against inflation. But worse than that, it actually implies negative rental growth over the lifetime of property assets. This is unduly pessimistic. Inflation still exists, albeit at a historically low level. It is therefore a factor which must be accounted for when valuing property assets. A full valuation of commercial property should reflect the importance of this hedge against inflation, which is provided by upwards-only rent review clauses included in most commercial property leases. On this basis we expect property to resume trading on lower yields than bonds. We shall remain buyers for some time to come.

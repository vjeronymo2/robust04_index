			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: New bypass scheme in Cheshire AMEC has joined forces with ALFRED McALPINE to win a civil engineering contract - the Pounds 36m A34 Wilmslow and Handforth bypass in Cheshire. With work already under way on the Walshford to Disforth section of the A1 and the A46 Leicester western bypass, the A34 contract award takes the total value of work won by the joint venture to almost Pounds 110m in just nine months. Located to the south of the Manchester conurbation, the A34 scheme entails construction of 15km of flexibly paved dual carriageway and up to 40 minor structures including 31 bridges, two river crossings, three railway crossings, footbridges, culverts and several reinforced earth retaining walls. The project is designed to ease congestion locally and will eventually form part of the eastern link road to Manchester Airport. Made up of AMEC Civil Engineering and Alfred McAlpine Civil Engineering, the joint venture will begin work on the 104-week contract, which was awarded by Cheshire County Council, in early October.</p>

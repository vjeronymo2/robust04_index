He believes that the Ukrainian parliament's resolution on  the  ratification of the START-I treaty, passed on February 4, 1994,  has many "ambiguous places." It does not say, for instance,  what percentage of nuclear weapons is to be eliminated.    Dubinin said that on November 18, 1993, the Ukrainian  parliament passed the resolution on the ratification of the  START-I treaty, according to which only 36% of the  Ukrainian  missiles and 42% of the warheads were to be eliminated.  "This  goes against both the START-I treaty and the Lisbon agreements.  It's still unclear whether Ukraine intends to eliminate  100%  of the nuclear weapons located on its territory in strict  accordance with the START-I treaty and the Lisbon protocol," he  said.    According to Dubinin, neither is it clear whether Ukraine  will join the nonproliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state.    Speaking about Ukraine's participation in NATO's Partnership  for Peace program, he said that Russia is approaching this issue  calmly. "Russia has already supported the partnership concept.  Why should Ukraine not join it?" he said.  <H3>  ...AND UKRAINE WILL SOON JOIN NONPROLIFERATION TREATY,  AMBASSADOR SAYS </H3>   Ukraine will be a non-nuclear state and will "shortly" join  the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the Ukrainian ambassador to  Russia said.    Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told a news conference in Moscow on  Monday that the Ukrainian parliament had now approved all the  points of Article Five of the Lisbon Protocol. "This eliminates  the main problem, and now everything is ready for joining the  Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the  immediate future," he said. All nuclear arms will be removed  from Ukraine, he said.    Kryzhanovskiy said the Ukrainian legislature had charged the  government with the exchanging of the START-I ratification  instruments and instructed it to take more efforts to enter into  relevant international agreements.    The ambassador did not rule out that Ukraine's membership in  the Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state would be  approved by the present parliament, but said this was most  likely to be done by the next legislature, to be elected on  March 27.    Commenting on Ukraine's relations with Russia, Kryzhanovskiy  said there was some friction but that it had set off no  conflicts between the two nations. As for the idea of the  incorporation of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea  into Russia through a Crimean referendum, he said it would be  the same as the incorporation of Russia's Kuril Islands into  Japan on the basis of the results of a referendum by the Kurile  population. "That's not serious," he said.    He said none of the former Soviet republics, including  Russia, "has given a kopeck" to return Crimean Tatars to Crimea.</p>

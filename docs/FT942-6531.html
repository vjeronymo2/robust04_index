			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): Gilbert to spearhead Biogen's move into Europe Biogen, one of the biggest of the US biotechnology companies which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is increasing its presence in Europe and appointing Alain Gilbert (right) as its first European vice-president, writes Daniel Green. Gilbert, 46, will be building a European sales organisation to promote two of the company's drugs: Hirulog, an anti-blood clot drug, and beta interferon, in late trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Gilbert, a French citizen, will be based in Paris or Brussels; the company will decide in the next few days which of these two cities will house its European headquarters. Gilbert joins Biogen from Idexx Laboratories, a Portland, Maine, biotechnology company specialising in veterinary products, where he has been president of European operations since 1990. Between 1987 and 1990, he was president of operations in Europe, Africa and the middle east for Medtronic, the US pacemaker and heart treatment device supplier. Before that, he worked for US drugs company Abbott Laboratories in sales and marketing where he became general manager of the Aids and hepatitis diagnostics division. The European appointment not only marks Biogen's expansion into Europe, but also its determination to move beyond licensing out of its products to drugs companies into sales and marketing on its own behalf. Gilbert says the structure of the company would be centralised with all main decisions taken at the headquarters. Sales and marketing people would be recruited in other countries and he predicts that within nine months the company would employ 100-150 people in Europe. Biogen's other investment in Europe, a research centre in Bracknell, west of London in the UK, would increasingly focus its activities on the European market, he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Each such finished food, when tested by the methods described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pertinent sections of ``Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> International,'' (formerly the Association of Official Analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemists), 15th Ed. (1990) meets the following specifications. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> International, 2200 Wilson Blvd., suite 400, Arlington, VA 22201&hyph;3301.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This publication may be examined at the Food and Nutrition Service,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nutrition and Technical Services Division, 3101 Park Center Drive, room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 607, Alexandria, Virginia 22302 or the Office of the Federal Register,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 800 North Capital Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The protein content (N x 6.25) is not less than 20 percent by weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (on a 13 percent moisture basis) as determined by the appropriate method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of analysis in the AOAC manual cited in (a)(2) under Enriched Macaroni  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix. The protein quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not less than 95 percent that of casein as determined on a dry basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the PDCAAS method as described below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The PDCAAS shall be determined by the methods given in sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.4.1, 7.2.1. and 8.0 as described in ``Protein Quality Evaluation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990, as published by the Food and Agriculture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organization (FAO) of the United Nations/World Health Organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (WHO). This report is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of this report may be obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Nutrition and Technical Services Division, Food and Nutrition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service, 3101 Park Center Drive, room 607, Alexandria, Virginia 22302.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This report may also be inspected at the Office of the Federal Register  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 800 North Capitol St., NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The standard used for assessing protein quality in the PDCAAS method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the amino acid scoring pattern established by FAO/WHO and United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nations University (UNU) in 1985 for preschool children 2 to 5 years of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> age which has been adopted by the National Academy of Sciences,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) To calculate the PDCAAS for an individual food, the test food must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be analyzed for proximate analysis and amino acid composition according  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to AOAC methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The PDCAAS may be calculated using FDA's limited data base of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published true digestibility values (determined using humans and rats).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The true digestibility values contained in the WHO/FAO report referenced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in paragraph 3.(a)(2)(i)(A) under Enriched Macaroni Products with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fortified Protein in this Appendix may also be used. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> digestibility of the protein is not available from these sources it must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined by a laboratory according to methods in the FAO/WHO report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (sections 7.2.1 and 8.0).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The most limiting essential amino acid (that is, the amino acid that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is present at the lowest level in the test food compared to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard) is identified in the test food by comparing the levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual amino acids in the test food with the 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pattern of essential amino acids established as a standard for children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 to 5 years of age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) The value of the most limiting amino acid (the ratio of the amino  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acid in the test food over the amino acid value from the pattern) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiplied by the percent of digestibility of the protein. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting number is the PDCAAS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) The PDCAAS of food mixtures must be calculated from data for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amino acid composition and digestibility of the individual components by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of a weighted average procedure. An example for calculating a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PDCAAS for a food mixture of varying protein sources is shown in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.0 of the FAO/WHO report cited in paragraph 3.(a)(2)(i)(A) under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enriched Macaroni Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

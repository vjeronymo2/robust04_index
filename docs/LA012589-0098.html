			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADOR REJECTS REBEL ELECTION PROPOSAL;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO DELAY VOTING BUT WILL STUDY PEACE PLAN  </P> <P> Government officials of El Salvador on Tuesday rejected as "unconstitutional" a  key demand by the country's Marxist guerrillas for a six-month postponement of  an upcoming presidential election as a condition for rebel participation in the  balloting and their acceptance of its results.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, Communications Minister Roberto Viera told reporters  that a 12-point proposal by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  (FMLN) disclosed Monday contains "positive elements" that will be studied point  by point and answered in detail.  </P> <P> This view was echoed by Fidel Chavez Mena, the presidential candidate of the  governing Christian Democratic Party and a close adviser to President Jose  Napoleon Duarte.  </P> <P> The major elements of the rebel proposal call for the government and the  military to:  </P> <P>  -- "Cease assassinations, arrests and repression."  </P> <P>  -- Agree to reorganize the electoral process.  </P> <P>  -- Respect the candidacy of the Democratic Convergence, a leftist political  grouping that is running in the current campaign.  </P> <P>  -- Withdraw the army from any involvement or interference in the voting.  </P> <P> In exchange, the guerrillas offer what represents a major shift of policy:  their participation in the electoral process without first obtaining a share of  power. Previous talks between the government and the rebels had collapsed over  that demand for power sharing.  </P> <P> The rebel proposal included a promise to accept the outcome of the balloting  and to stop intimidating mayors or the candidates of any party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open to Negotiation  </P> <P> Rebel spokesmen, who formally presented the proposal to the media in Mexico  City on Tuesday, indicated that its terms are open to negotiation.  </P> <P> Viera, in laying out the government's reaction, focused on the guerrillas'  demand that the voting scheduled for March 19 be delayed six months, until  Sept. 15. That demand presents "an insurmountable constitutional obstacle," he  said.  </P> <P> "President Duarte recognizes that the proposal is positive," Viera said, "but  the postponement can't be so long."  </P> <P> El Salvador's constitution requires that the first round of presidential  elections take place no later than two months before the new president is to  take office. In the current circumstance, Viera said, that means the election  must be held by March 31.  </P> <P> Despite the talk of finding positive elements in the plan and promising to  consider all of its points, other senior officials noted that the proposal  fails to deal with such key questions as whether the guerrillas will continue  the civil war that is now in its ninth year and whether they will lay down  their arms if a candidate they oppose wins the election.  </P> <P> Another development that gives a negative cast to the prospects for a  settlement of the civil war based on the guerrilla proposal was a statement  from the defense minister, Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova, that the plan "is a ruse  for power sharing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposed by Military  </P> <P> Furthermore, a senior government official, who asked not to be identified by  name, said that all senior military officers recommended that the guerrilla  plan be rejected, a stance also taken by leaders of the National Republican  Alliance, or Arena, the nation's major right-wing political party.  </P> <P> Former army Col. Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, vice president of the National Assembly  and a powerful influence in Arena, said the rebel plan is "a trap and  unconstitutional. . . . We are willing to talk. But what we cannot do is  subordinate ourselves to a group of terrorist delinquents."  </P> <P> However, while Viera and the others were tentatively rejecting the demand for  postponing the election, FMLN leaders were telling reporters in Mexico City  that all 12 points of their proposal, even the election date, are negotiable.  </P> <P> "We have made a proposal that we do not view as finished," said Ana Guadalupe  Martinez, an FMLN representative. The rebel leaders are willing to meet with  government and army officials publicly or privately, in El Salvador or in  another country, she said.  </P> <P> Another FMLN spokesman, Salvador Samayoa, denied that there is a serious  constitutional obstacle.  </P> <P> "Those people are not rejecting this proposal because it violates the  constitution, because they have never respected the constitution," he said. "It  is a purely formal, legal argument, an irresponsible argument in a situation in  which peace is the issue."  </P> <P> As to Vides Casanova's charge, Samayoa reiterated that the guerrillas are  dropping their previous demands for power sharing as a condition for ending the  war. In so doing, he touched on a crucial missing element in Tuesday's response  to the rebel proposal: the reaction of the United States.  </P> <P> "For eight years (the United States) has been saying that the only obstacle to  a political solution in El Salvador was our demand for a formula for power  sharing before elections," Samayoa said. "We are removing that obstacle for the  United States. It's their move."  </P> <P> But the Bush Administration did not appear to be ready to make a move Tuesday.  </P> <P> Both the U.S. Embassy here and State Department experts on Central America  recommended that the Administration issue a statement tentatively welcoming the  proposal as a positive step -- but one that the Salvadoran government would  have responsibility for answering. However, in the absence of James A. Baker  III, the secretary of state-designate who has not yet been confirmed by the  Senate, career diplomats temporarily in charge of Central American policy  decided not to say anything of substance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Studying Proposal  </P> <P> "We have seen the proposal and are studying it," State Department spokesman  Charles Redman said.  </P> <P> Diplomats and some Salvadoran officials said that if the United States does not  form a policy quickly, whatever chance the FMLN plan has of evolving into a  peace process will be lost.  </P> <P> "There is no chance of the military accepting this unless the Americans put all  the pressure they can expend," said a Latin American envoy who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> The United States has given El Salvador more than $3 billion in military and  economic aid since the war began and continues to provide the country with more  than half of its annual revenue.  </P> <P> Sources close to the rebels warned that if the offer is not developed into a  positive step toward peace, a war that has killed between 40,000 and 65,000  people -- half of them civilians -- is likely to accelerate.  </P> <P> Freed reported from San Salvador and Miller from Mexico City.  </P></p>

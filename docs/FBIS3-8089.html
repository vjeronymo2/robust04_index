Recalling that the UNPROFOR mandate [in Croatia] was  expiring  at the end of this month, Tudjman said Croatia would not agree  to renew the mandate under present conditions. He emphasized  that UNPROFOR supervision in the protected areas was  insufficient, the best proof of which was the latest incident  involving the downing of Serb aircraft which took off from  protected areas in the Republic of Croatia. Special Envoy  Akashi said the UN secretary general would inform the Security  Council about the implementation of UNPROFOR's mandate in  Croatia by the end of the month.    Speaking about the Croat-Muslim Washington agreement,  President Tudjman said the entire geopolitical situation has  changed as a result of this and international and Croatian  efforts would now be directed towards the solving of the problem  of the reintegration of protected areas into the constitutional  and legal system of the country.    In conclusion, President Tudjman stressed that the problem  no  longer lies in the territorial settlement between the three  nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that a division between East  and West has now surfaced, whose interests have always clashed  in this area, the president's office has announced.</p>

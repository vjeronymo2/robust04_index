			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Renault in strong demand as share-sale lists open The partial privatisation of Renault, the French vehicles group, opens today with institutions demanding 12 times more shares than they have been allocated, the government indicated yesterday. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economics minister, said on French television last night that the bookbuilding process currently under way for the 62m shares to be placed on the market had proved highly successful and showed what 'excellent value' the shares represented. Under the terms of the sale, individual investors will be able to buy up to 60 per cent of the shares to be quoted at FFr165 each, while institutions will take the remainder at FFr176 a share. Both prices are towards the lower end of the range of estimates discussed in the last few weeks, and value the group at about FFr40bn (Dollars 7.8bn). The government will reduce its stake from 79 per cent to about 51 per cent, and Volvo of Sweden, Renault's former partner in an abortive merger last year, will divest the 8 per cent minimum agreed with the French state, from its current holding of 20 per cent. The exercise will increase Renault's capital by FFr2bn. The bookbuilding process among institutions finishes today, and individual investors will be able to apply for shares until November 10. Slightly more than 6m shares have been reserved for current and former Renault employees, who will be able to gain free bonus shares in proportion to the number they buy. Mr Alphandery said he was confident of the success of the sale, and said the price was fair - particularly given that Renault was one of the few European car manufacturers to make a profit last year. In an interview today in Les Echos, a French business newspaper, Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chief executive, says that he sees no reason why the partial flotation should delay full privatisation. His comments are in contrast to earlier assurances from Mr Alphandery that the government had no plans to push for further flotation. Volvo had the option of selling a further 4 per cent of its shares at the price available to institutions, but decided not to do so. 'In our estimation there is scope for a future value increase in Renault,' Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said yesterday. The government confirmed the four 'shareholder partners' which will share 5 per cent of the enlarged capital: Sogepaf (part of Elf Aquitaine), Lagardere Group, Banque Nationale de Paris and Rhone-Poulenc Finance.</p>

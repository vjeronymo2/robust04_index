			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA continues to stress that it is vital for a warning system to be equipped with a standby source of power to continue providing warning to the highway user in cases of primary power loss. FRA will vigorously enforce this provision. If investigation or testing reveals that there is no standby power at a crossing sufficient to enable the system to continue functioning normally, FRA will take appropriate enforcement action. Similarly, if a power interruption results in use of the standby power source to such an extent that power is depleted and the warning system is not operating normally, FRA will take appropriate enforcement action under this section. If primary or standby power is not available for any reason, FRA expects a railroad to provide portable power or provide warning for highway users in accordance with &sect;&sect;234.105 or 234.107. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that a standby source of power be provided of sufficient capacity to operate the warning system during any period of primary power interruption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.217&blank;Flashing Light Units <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule requires that each flashing light unit be positioned and aligned in accordance with installation plans. Several commenters, including the labor/management group, remarked that installation plans typically do not include detailed specifications for the alignment of light units. Labor/management group recommended that the rule be amended to require that light units be ``properly'' positioned and aligned. It is not practical to require a specific distance for the alignment of each flashing light unit because of varying conditions (i.e., road curvature, fixed obstructions, intersections, etc.) at each crossing. Maintainers have been ensuring proper positioning of lights for many years without the benefit of alignment specifications. While a standard based on ``properly positioned and aligned'' is somewhat vague, FRA is adopting the recommended language rule by requiring that each flashing light unit be ``properly'' positioned and aligned. Compliance and enforcement of this section will be based on the good judgment of both maintainers and inspectors. The requirement that the light be visible to a highway user approaching the crossing has been added to this section. This basic requirement is being added to this section in lieu of the focusing requirement contained in the NPRM's proposed &sect;234.253. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule also requires that each flashing light unit be maintained to prevent dust and moisture from entering the interior of the unit. FRA has revised this section to require that reflectors, as well as roundels, be clean and in good condition. The Wisconsin Central Railroad commented that it is impossible to keep dust out of roundels because each light unit is vented. We agree; however, while it may be impossible to keep all dust out of roundels, excessive dust will not be a problem if the roundels and reflectors are cleaned periodically. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the proposed rule requires light units to flash alternately at a rate of 35 to 55 times per minute. The labor/management group commented that the flashing rate is adequately addressed in the MUTCD. It further commented that proper maintenance of the equipment which controls the flash rate is covered appropriately under other sections, including 234.205. The Association of American Railroads Signal Manual, published in 1991 recommends a flash rate of 45 to 65 times per minute for solid state flashers rather than the 35 to 55 times per minute as required by the MUTCD. FRA does not perceive a safety advantage of one standard over the other. Therefore the rule will be revised to require that light units flash alternately at a rate of 35 to 65 times per minute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a) of this section requires that each flashing light unit shall be properly positioned and aligned and visible to a highway user approaching the crossing. Paragraph (b) requires that each flashing light unit be maintained to prevent dust and moisture from entering the interior of the unit. Roundels and reflectors shall be clean and in good condition. Paragraph (c) requires that all light units shall flash alternately. The number of flashes per minute for each light unit shall be 35 minimum and 65 maximum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

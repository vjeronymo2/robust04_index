			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / South African Elections April 26-28: South Africa throbs to an electoral beat - Rap groups, game shows, TV soaps are all being used to educate voters Related, members of the Soweto Mothers' Union shove for a place at the mock polling booth outside Johannesburg's Anglican cathedral. In three weeks, the vast majority of them will enter a real polling station to vote in a general election for the first time, and they want to be ready. Myopic grandmothers crane their necks to glimpse the mock ballot papers being distributed by Ms Lerato Mabitsela of the Matla Voter Education Trust, and strain to hear her patient explanation of how to avoid spoiling the paper. Over and over again, she explains that no, they must not sign the paper, and no, they must not print their address in the box next to the party of their choice. One old woman worries that her mark on the paper is not a perfect X. Ms Lerato reassures her it will do nicely. Over the past few weeks, millions of first-time electors throughout South Africa have received some kind of voter education to prepare them for the April 26-28 poll. Some have attended mock elections held by community and church groups, political parties and businesses. Millions more have been reached by TV and radio, where voter education has taken surprising forms. These have included a prime-time voter education game show, complete with a black master of ceremonies dispensing deep freezes and electric frying pans to those who correctly answer questions such as: 'Where do you go to vote?' and 'If you spoil your paper, do you get another chance?' The same channel carries an election soap opera, featuring a black comedian as the main character in a drama revolving around issues such as democracy and political intimidation. A local rap group, Prophets of the City, has taken their own brand of voter education to black schools, where they rap out the message 'You gotta vote, you gotta vote'. The children are expected to pass the message on to their parents. Travelling concerts and roadshows, some of them funded by an election initiative launched recently by South African business, take the message deep into rural communities. Music cassettes combining a message of tolerance and goodwill with popular music have been distributed to the tens of thousands of minibus taxis which provide the main form of transport for black South Africans. Because there is no central co-ordination of the voter education effort, nobody knows how many people have been reached or how much money has been spent. From overseas, the European Union has contributed R20m (Pounds 2.7m) and the South Africa Free Election Fund, a US business initiative, at least Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m). Foreign voter educators say they believe it is one of the most ambitious such exercises conducted anywhere. The task is daunting: some 70 per cent of South Africa's 22.7m eligible voters have probably never voted before (some may have voted in black local elections, but turnout at these polls was always minuscule). South Africa's voting system is relatively simple: the ballot shows each party's name, logo and the picture of its leader; voters need mark only one box (representatives are then chosen automatically from each party's electoral list). But matters have been complicated by the recent addition of a second ballot for regional parliaments. Most voters have no idea of the purpose of the second paper: some said they would not mark it, as they had been told it was illegal to vote twice. But by far the greatest problem has been political violence, especially in Natal Province where the Inkatha Freedom party is boycotting the election. Voter educators from the rival ANC have been targeted by Inkatha, with several murdered. Natal voter education groups say they have been unable to operate in Inkatha areas since mid-February. They believe the recent imposition of a state of emergency will only spark further resentment in Inkatha areas. But voter educators complain that the ANC, too, is inhibiting their work in Natal. 'We're having problems in ANC areas as well. We're being told that if we're not teaching people to vote ANC, we're not to be doing voter education,' says Ms Carole Baekey of the Community Law Centre in Durban. But Inkatha's name will not appear on the final ballot. No amount of voter education can solve South Africa's real problems, which remain political.</p>

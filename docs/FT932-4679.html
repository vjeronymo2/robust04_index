			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Leigh Interests blames coal side for 33% fall A REDUCED contribution from coal extraction and higher interest charges were blamed by Leigh Interests, the waste management company, for a 33 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended March 31. Profits were down from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 9.5m following a sales reduction from Pounds 118.9m to Pounds 109.2m. Increased investment and acquisitions were responsible for a rise in borrowings from Pounds 38m to Pounds 50m, representing gearing of 72 per cent. Interest charges were up by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 4.2m. Capital expenditure is expected to be cut from Pounds 24m to between Pounds 15 and Pounds 20m. The company continued to invest in a national network of waste collection, disposal and treatment facilities. Mr Malcolm Wood, chairman, said that while the commissioning delays of new plant in the Midlands held back profits in that region, the reduction in volumes of waste in previous periods in the south of England had ended. The mainstream environmental business reported reduced operating profits of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 13.5m) on sales of Pounds 93.7m (Pounds 97.3m). Operating profits from the extraction and processing of coal fell from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 1.3m following the decreased production from the company's reserves, in consequence of the review of the coal industry and delays in granting of consents for new open cast mines. During the year Leigh acquired 120 acres of freehold land at Rugby, which it already occupied on a leasehold basis, for Pounds 3m. Earnings per share fell from 15.5p to 10.3p. The final dividend is maintained at 5.37p making an unchanged 7.83p.</p>

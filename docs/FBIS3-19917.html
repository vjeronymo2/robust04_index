This new "hole" in public finances, which  represents 7.3 percent of GDP, was made known by the Spanish  Government to the European Commission yesterday.    The effects of the economic crisis, lower tax revenues as a  result of the fall in employment and the reduction of business  profits, and greater expenditure to cope with a growing number  of unemployed and the increase in pensioners, largely as a  result of early retirements, partly explain this situation.  However, the sharp increase in expenditure to meet the interest  on and amortization of a public debt which will exceed 33  trillion pesetas this year, and the transfers to the autonomous  communities, must not be forgotten.    Economy Minister Pedro Solbes himself acknowledged this week  that the problem of the public deficit has obsessed him since he  arrived at the ministry in July 1993, and stated that it stood  at 7.2 percent of GDP last year. This "hole" represents a  further move away from the Maastricht terms for attaining  monetary union, which set the maximum public deficit limit at 3  percent of GDP.    According to the figures which the government made known to  the European Commission, the state is chiefly responsible for  this imbalance in public accounts. Thus, out of the total  percentage of the deficit in 1993 (7.3 percent of GDP), the  central administration accounts for 5.8 percent, the social  security administrations 0.3 percent, the autonomous communities  1 percent, and the local authorities 0.2 percent.    The trend in the public deficit over the past few years  makes  clear a drastic deterioration in 1993, since between 1983 and  1990 the gap between the public administrations' revenue and  expenditure ranged between 1 trillion and 2 trillion pesetas.  In 1991 and 1992 it exceeded 2.6 trillion pesetas, and last  year the figure soared to 4.4 trillion pesetas. These  comparative figures also show that that it is the central  administrations' deficit which has soared highest, rising from  3.3 percent of GDP in 1992 to 6.1 percent in 1993, while the  autonomous communities and local authorities keep their debt at  a similar level to last year's -- 1.2 percent of GDP.</p>

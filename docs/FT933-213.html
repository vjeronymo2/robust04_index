			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Devonshire Names to sue over Pounds 154m loss MEMBERS of the loss-making Devonshire underwriting syndicates at the Lloyd's of London insurance market voted yesterday to sue their members' and managing agents for compensation. Losses to date on five syndicates are Pounds 154m, Andrew Jack writes. About 1,500 Names - individuals whose assets underwrite the market - on the Devonshire Names Action Group supported calls for litigation for negligence against their advisers for the 1989 and 1990 underwriting years. The Names have still to decide whether to sue their brokers and auditors. The group said the move was a precaution in case a Lloyd's attempt to settle disputes with loss-making Names out of court was not satisfactory.</p>

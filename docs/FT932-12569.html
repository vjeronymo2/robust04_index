			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Hoover faces surcharges row on 'free' flights HOOVER YESTERDAY faced fresh embarrassment over its troubled 'free flights' promotion when it emerged that it had levied surcharges on people who had qualified for free tickets to US and European destinations, and had later suspended the surcharges after legal advice from the Association of British Travel Agents. Mr Richard Rankin, vice-president of European marketing services, said yesterday that the surcharges - up to about Dollars 24 (Pounds 15) per person - were to cover local airport taxes. Hoover had introduced them recently to reduce the number of people who did not turn up for flights they had booked. Mr Rankin, joint chairman of a task force managing the promotion, said: 'Empty seats make it very inefficient for the sales promotion, and making people pay a small amount in advance means that we reduce the number of no-shows.' Mr Rankin said surcharging had been in operation for about three weeks, and was now suspended. The original application forms for Hoover's 'free flights' - two free tickets to the US or Europe conditional on spending a minimum of Pounds 100 on a Hoover product - made no mention of surcharges. Mr Rankin said the levies were 'a legally identifiable charge' which Hoover's lawyers said could be charged as they 'were not part of the flight costs'. Hoover was talking to Abta and trading standards officers to see if they could be re-imposed. He denied that they were an attempt to recoup some of the promotional costs. Maytag, Hoover's US parent, said last month that it would take a Dollars 30m charge against first-quarter profits - the estimated cost of ensuring that customers who qualify for 'free flights' actually get them. At the same time three senior executives left Hoover and the company said the promotion had caused 'tremendous difficulties'. Hoover UK employees have since been warned by Mr Gerald Kamman, managing director, of probable poor 1993 financial results. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, said disclosure of the surcharges 'calls into question Hoover's good faith. It appears that Hoover's rescue launch last month was more an exercise in public relations.' Abta said yesterday it would like to see Hoover's 'free flights' offer investigated. 'Offers like this can have a backlash on our industry and on behalf of companies not causing consumers trouble.' Hoover said yesterday it had 'conducted a full review of the promotion' and a 'comprehensive' flight schedule had been developed 'to offer flights to all customers entitled to travel'. It added that it had 'committed to purchase' airline seats from 11 airlines on more than 11,000 flights. Mr Rankin said that 10,000 people had flown on both promotions. Travel industry estimates have been as high as 200,000. Maytag results, Page 28</p>

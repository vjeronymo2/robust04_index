			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (7): How to keep the system running - . . . Fault-tolerance THE principle of fault-tolerant computing is blissfully simple. The machine has a doubled-up architecture with a spare processor ready to leap into action the moment the prime processor fails. Fault-tolerant machines will keep on running through power-cuts, courtesy of their own dedicated electricity supply. Financial institutions have made fault-tolerance a standard criteria for critical mid-range computer applications. Two suppliers, Stratus and Tandem, dominate the market. IBM sells Stratus equipment into the financial sector under the System 88 badge. Installing these boxes guarantees continuous running of hardware. But as computer operations have become critical to the financial field so the definition of fault-tolerance has extended into software, networking and the IT department's physical location. Most fault-tolerant applications are in the financial field. This is partly due to the demands of a market impatient for business and unable to afford interruptions. It is also a reminder that fault-tolerant systems cost a good deal more than conventional computers. Henderson Crosthwaite is a private stockbroking firm with 40,000 clients. Its five regional offices are interconnected via a computer network based on a fault-tolerant policy that the company refers to as business continuity. A large Unisys A-series computer in London provides the engine for Henderson Crosthwaite's share-dealing. The software that logs these transactions is a Unisys Remote Database (RDB). This does more than handle the London-end of the business. It constantly updates a smaller A-series processor at the firm's Worcester office. If the main computer in London is out of operation for any reason, Henderson Crosthwaite will still be providing a service for its clients - 'RDB is a mirrored database, Worcester monitors and tracks all the deals and all our offices are party to that capability via the network,' says Peter Firth, a consultant at Henderson Crosthwaite. He admits that the smaller processor at Worcester would offer a slower service, but at least the company would still be in business. This fail-safe approach is not cheap, the extra processor at Worcester will cost the company over Pounds 300,000. The applications come on top of that, and RDB is being installed as part of a much larger programme including hardware that will total Pounds 2.5m. But stockbroking clients do not expect to lose money because of a systems failure. The share-dealing business demands a far-sighted approach to technology. Computer networks are the main arteries of the City of London. Business transactions are utterly dependent on a steady flow of orders and confirmations. But the data lines are vulnerable to a variety of potential faults. City Networks supplies wide-area networking systems, including hardware and specialist software, that allow moneybrokers to communicate with banks. The company claims that its products process 95 per cent of the broker confirmations in the City. To achieve that degree of market acceptance, City Networks must offer a product that is seen to be totally reliable. Neil Coles, business manager at City Networks, explains that the BT X25 lines used to transmit parcels of computer data have an excellent track record. BT provides its own automatic re-routing facility in the event of a technical glitch. But this doesn't excuse him from contemplating everything that might go wrong - 'if the line develops a fault, our messages will queue up. So the data is preserved. We make sure there are multiple routes for the data, so if one local BT station goes down, the message is switched via another one. At a larger level, we're looking at alternative distribution mechanisms.' City Networks will shortly introduce a fall-back data service using telephone connection in the event of the client being unable to work from his normal site. It is a measure of last resort, but Mr Coles has no intention of being caught out. NOT SO CHEAP As with fault-tolerant hardware, such a degree of back-up does not come cheap. To use the company's Auto-Confs system costs Pounds 6,500 plus Pounds 3,500 for annual rental and support. That money represents an indispensable insurance. And the users are spared the costs associated with dedicated fault-tolerant processors. City Networks configures its systems around PCs, distributing the information through th ese comparatively cheap terminals. A PC network can be set up to reconfigure if one box fails, offering a high degree of resilience. The most dramatic aspect of fault-tolerance is provided by specialist companies offering an emergency location for computing operations. It is also the most expensive. AST Trans-Act opened a business recovery facility in central London in November last year. Since then, five City of London institutions have signed up to use its stand-by computing facility in the event of a widescale disaster. Clearly spurred on by the devastating terrorist bomb at St Mary Axe, they will spend a total of Pounds 3.5m on the service over the next five years. AST's plans allow space for just one more customer. AST offers a 180-position dealing room available 24 hours a day. Financial workstations sit in an eerily empty room. The installation is fortified against blast and its permanent staff take security very seriously. AST insists that its City clients are all 800 metres apart. The distances represent double the distance used by police to cordon off a suspect bomb. Companies signing up with AST store copies of their software and updates of transactions in a secure vault at the site. The idea is to cope with the worst possible scenario. The devastating blast at the World Trade Center in New York, earlier this year, served to reinforce the message that fault-tolerance is no longer a luxury. AST is already planning to spend Pounds 1m on a second facility. In all its aspects, fault-tolerance is here to stay. The price may be high, but if an institution relies on computer data it cannot afford to ignore the issue.</p>

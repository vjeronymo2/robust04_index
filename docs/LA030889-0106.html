			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FARMERS ACCUSED OF MISUSING $10 MILLION IN DELTA DISASTER AID  </P> <P> State and federal auditors have charged that Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta  farmers misused upward of $10 million in disaster aid to save their sinking  islands from floods and are preparing a demand that it be repaid.  </P> <P> Auditors charged that there were instances of double-billing, charges for  material that apparently was not delivered and widespread overcharges for rock  and sand that was used to bolster island levees in the delta.  </P> <P> "I think there is a fiduciary duty that needs to be exercised. I don't think it  was," said Charles F. Wynne, a state Office of Emergency Services official who  is overseeing the matter.  </P> <P> Only a few thousand people live on 60 major islands, scattered among 700 miles  of rivers and sloughs in the delta. The islands are used for farming. But they  also are an important part of California's water system, especially as it  serves Southern California. The islands hold back saltwater intrusion from San  Francisco Bay, thereby allowing state and federal officials to pump fresh water  south.  </P> <P> When islands fail, saltwater intrudes into the environmentally sensitive delta,  habitat to many species of fish, birds and other animals. To hold the brackish  water back from the delta, fresh water that could be used for farming and  drinking must be released from reservoirs upstream.  </P> <P> Delta levees often fail in high water. To save their islands, farmers say they  must act quickly, first by placing sandbags along their levees and then laying  down large rocks as a more permanent barrier. But in order to get paid by  disaster assistance agencies, the farmers must act through their reclamation  districts, which are required to maintain records of how assistance funds are  spent.  </P> <P> Wynne is scheduled to begin a series of meetings today in which he will go  island-by-island to determine exactly how much money each reclamation district  must repay.  </P> <P> In an interview, Wynne characterized the districts' record-keeping as a "mess."  When district officials did produce records, the documentation was  insufficient, he said.  </P> <P> He noted that since some work was done, some money should be paid. But he also  estimated that as much as 25% of the $42.6 million spent on fighting severe  flooding in 1983 could end up being disallowed and may have to be repaid.  </P> <P> "A 25% cutoff in the claims would be akin to a disaster," said Dante Nomellini,  a Stockton attorney for several districts. "If that is the net result, the one  thing that will have been learned will be that the biggest disaster is disaster  assistance."  </P> <P> Some farmer-run reclamation districts could be forced into bankruptcy if they  must repay the Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, Nomellini said. Nomellini raised the possibility that if  there are floods this year, the financially strapped districts will be unable  to respond.  </P> <P> The potential size of the claim for reimbursement has concerned bankers, who  have lent money to the districts. Some districts have had to renegotiate their  debt repayments.  </P> <P> "The financial integrity of reclamation districts is at stake," said Doug  Eberhardt, executive vice president of the Bank of Stockton, which is holding  $10.2 million worth of warrants from various districts.  </P> <P> If the districts are forced to repay the money and go into bankruptcy, the  state or federal government could be forced to take over the islands in order  to save them and ensure that fresh water continues to flow to Southern  California and San Joaquin Valley farmers.  </P> <P> The financial effects are only one of the districts' problems.  </P> <P> The Federal Emergency Management Agency's inspector general has opened a "much  more in-depth" investigation of disaster assistance in the delta to determine  whether there were violations that could result in criminal, civil or  administrative actions, said F. Gerry McGrath, assistant inspector general.  </P> <P> Wynne characterized his role as that of a mediator between the districts and  state and federal auditors, whose reports issued during the past year and a  half have recommended that state and federal disaster agencies pay almost none  of the $42.6 million in costs claimed by the districts for the 1983 floods.  </P> <P> Federal Emergency Management Agency audits obtained by The Times show it  recommended payment of only $754,000 out of the $15.3 million being sought by  three reclamation districts for the 1983 flood.  </P> <P> The state controller, which audited several other districts for the 1983 flood,  concluded that $25.8 million of the $27.3 million in claimed expenses should be  disallowed.  </P> <P> Although the investigation focuses on the 1983 flooding, the same approach most  likely will apply to flood costs in 1986, when several delta islands again were  flooded. In all, state and federal agencies have spent $120 million to fight  delta floods during the 1980s.  </P> <P> An audit by the Federal Emergency Management Agency showed that Rindge Tract,  one of the farming islands, billed the state and federal government for the  same work -- more than $870,234 for rock, levee widening and dredging.  </P> <P> In another instance, a reclamation district estimated the cost of repairing  erosion damage at from $160,000 to $223,000. By the time the work was done, the  cost skyrocketed to $2.5 million.  </P> <P> Federal auditors noted that when the districts paid for rock out of their own  money, the price was anywhere from $11.85 to $14.50 per ton. When the Federal  Emergency Management Agency paid for the rock, the price was as much as $20 a  ton. Commonly, thousands of tons of rock are needed to fix a failing levee.  </P> <P> Nomellini insisted that instances of double-billing were mistakes. He  maintained that the districts will prove to the state and federal governments  that there was virtually no overcharging and called audits a "hatchet job."  </P> <P> He said documentation for the 1983 flood is better than it was in previous  floods and blamed changes in the state and federal standards for many of the  problems.  </P> <P> "If the same standards for review (in past years) had been applied, then these  claims would get an A-plus-plus rating," he said. " . . . All of a sudden what  was historically found to be acceptable was rejected in total."  </P></p>

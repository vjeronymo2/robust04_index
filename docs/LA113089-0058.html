			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: REVISE BARS TO TRIM FAT  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: Enclosed is a favorite family breakfast-brunch recipe that I feel  guilty about making because it is so rich. Can you limit the butter and the  eggs in this one?  </P> <P>  -- JUDITH, Waukesha, Wis.  </P> <P> CHERRY BRUNCH BARS  </P> <P> 1 cup butter  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups sugar  </P> <P> 4 eggs  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 3 cups flour  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 1 (21-ounce) can cherry pie filling  </P> <P> Cream butter and sugar, gradually adding eggs and vanilla. Combine flour, salt  and baking powder and add to creamed mixture.  </P> <P> Place 2/3 batter in bottom of greased jelly-roll pan. Spread cherry pie filling  over batter. With spoon, drop remaining batter over top.  </P> <P> Bake at 350 degrees 30 minutes. Makes about 15 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Drizzle with icing, if desired.  </P> <P> DEAR JUDITH: At first, I wasn't sure if I could revise this recipe successfully  or not. The major problem was the difference in texture between your recipe and  my attempts at revision.  </P> <P> However, after many tries, I managed to create brunch bars that have about a  third less calories, half the fat and only one-sixth the cholesterol of your  bars.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> LIGHT CHERRY BRUNCH BARS  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons cornstarch  </P> <P> 1/3 cup water  </P> <P> 1 (16-ounce) can tart pie cherries, packed in water  </P> <P> 1 1/3 cups sugar  </P> <P> 5 egg whites  </P> <P> 1/2 cup corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 1/2 cup buttermilk  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 3 cups unbleached flour  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Dissolve cornstarch in water. Drain liquid from cherries into saucepan. Add 1/3  cup sugar and stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Add cherries and  cornstarch mixture and stir until thickened.  </P> <P> Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Set aside. Cream margarine and  remaining 1 cup sugar in another bowl. Gradually add egg and buttermilk, then  vanilla.  </P> <P> Combine flour, baking powder and salt and add to creamed mixture. Fold in  beaten egg whites.  </P> <P> Spread 2/3 batter in bottom of jelly-roll pan sprayed with non-stick vegetable  coating. Spread with cherry mixture and drop spoonfuls of remaining batter on  top. Bake at 350 degrees 30 minutes. Makes about 15 servings.  </P> <P> Each serving contains approximately:  </P> <P> Original Recipe:  </P> <P> Calories: 317  </P> <P> Cholesterol: 90 mg  </P> <P> Fat: 14 gm  </P> <P> Sodium: 227 mg  </P> <P> Revised Recipe:  </P> <P> Calories: 240  </P> <P> Cholesterol: 15 mg  </P> <P> Fat: 7 gm  </P> <P> Sodium: 198 mg  </P></p>

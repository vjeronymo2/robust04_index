			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD closed around the day's lows on the London bullion market. The recent failure of two attempts to breach resistance around Dollars 343 a troy ounce prompted a test of the downside. The market failed to derive much support from the continued weakness of the dollar. Comex gold futures were lower at midday on selling linked to the market's weak technical position and general lack of investor demand. London COCOA, supported by a firmer New York market, edged back into the plus column in the afternoon in a mild correction to Tuesday's sharp fall, while robusta COFFEE also extended gains as New York's December arabica contract broke through key resistance at 55.70 cents a lb in early trading. The New York gains were on technically driven fund and commission house buying, but analysts said coffee's downtrend was still intact. On the LME, most BASE METALS, apart from nickel, spent the day in narrow trading ranges. Bargain hunting purchases on dips, particularly due to the weaker dollar, were met by hedge selling on rallies. But the pace of trading was slow and markets were thin. NICKEL broke below the bottom end of its recent trading range.</p>

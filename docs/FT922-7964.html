			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Home video games lift Nintendo to record sales NINTENDO, the Japanese video game maker led by Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi who is leading a consortium to buy the US baseball team Seattle Mariners, saw record sales for the fiscal year ended March, due to strong sales of its home video games in the US and Europe. Non-consolidated sales at Nintendo rose 12.5 per cent to Y507.5bn (Dollars 3.89bn), thanks to firm domestic business. Operating profit rose 1.9 per cent to Y140.3bn due to the stronger yen. However, the pre-tax profit rose 11.3 per cent thanks to a 74 per cent rise in interest income. After-tax profits grew 20.8 per cent to Y85.3bn. Exports were affected by the sluggish US economy and currency movements, and grew 1.1 per cent to Y316bn. Nintendo's annual dividend was raised to Y60 per share, from the previous year's Y50. The company expects stronger sales in the US following price cuts for the Super NES, its game hardware which uses a 16-bit processor. The planned introduction of a new product which enables users to paint pictures and compose music, is also expected to contribute to an earnings increase. Nintendo also expects to introduce Super NES into the European market this year. For the year to March 1993, Nintendo forecasts a 6.2 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y166bn on a 6.4 per cent rise in sales to Y540bn. The company plans Y10bn in capital spending, including a construction of a distribution centre in Kyoto, Japan.</p>

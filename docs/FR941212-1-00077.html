Section 919 requires the Secretary of HUD to issue ``rules defining what are `significant facilities and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons' required under section 807(b)(2) of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term `housing for older persons' in such section.'' The Department intends to issue a second proposed rule concerning implementation of section 919.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This withdrawal is made on December 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Sara Pratt, Director, Office of Investigations, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, room 5204, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500, telephone (202) 708&hyph;0836 (not a toll-free number).

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Right Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19) exempts ``housing for older persons'' from the prohibitions against discrimination because of familial status. The purpose of the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of familial status and the ``housing for older persons'' exemption is to protect families with children from discrimination in housing without unfairly limiting housing choices for elderly persons (see 134 Cong. Rec. S 19722 (Aug. 1, 1988) statement of Senator Karnes).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 23, 1989 (54 FR 3232), HUD published a final rule implementing the Fair Housing Act. This rule included regulations governing housing for older persons. The ``housing for older persons'' regulations implement, among other things, section 807(b)(2)(C) of the Fair Housing Act, which exempts housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit that satisfies certain criteria. These regulations are codified in 24 CFR part 100, subpart E.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Congress mandated that, in determining whether housing qualifies as housing for persons 55 years of age or older, the Secretary develop regulations which require at least the following factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons, or if the provision of such facilities is not practicable, that such housing is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The publication of, and adherence to, policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992 (the 1992 Act)), requires the Secretary of HUD to issue rules further defining what are ``significant facilities and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons'' required under section 807(b)(2) of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term ``housing for older persons.'' On July 7, 1994 (59 FR 34902), the Department published a proposed rule that would define the significant facilities and services requirements governing ``55 or over housing,'' as required by section 919. The July 7, 1994 proposed rule provided for a public comment period that extended through November 30, 1994. In addition to the July 7, 1994 proposed rule, the Department held five public meetings on the proposed rule across the country. The meetings took place in Fontana, CA; Tampa, FL; Phoenix, AZ; Washington, DC; and Spokane, WA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the written comments received on the proposed rule, and the comments received at the five public meetings, the Department intends to propose significant changes to the July 7, 1994 proposed rule. As a result of the significant changes to the July 7, 1994 proposed rule, the Department intends to issue a second proposed rule, and not proceed to final rulemaking on the July 7, 1994 proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the basis of the public comments received on the July 7, 1994 proposed rule, the proposals to be made in the second proposed rule include: (1) Providing for a simple self-certification process so that a senior community can feel secure that it is a senior community; (2) clarifying that expensive facilities and services such as medical facilities and congregate dining are not required; and (3) providing greater weight to services provided by the residents and homeowners themselves, and recognizing that sense of community and self-help that is an essential part of senior citizen living. The second proposed rule, which is anticipated to be issued in the first quarter of calendar year 1995, will address these issues in greater detail, and solicit public comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Roberta Achtenberg,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30457 Filed 12&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;28&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

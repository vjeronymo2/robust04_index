			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Australian Government says it will take firm and  prompt action against any former Australian spies who now speak  out in public. The foreign minister, Gareth Evans, gave the  warning when releasing the terms of reference for an inquiry  into its overseas spy service, ASIS [Australian Security  Intelligence Service].    The inquiry follows a television documentary last week, in  which two former ASIS agents claimed the secret intelligence  service had harmed Australia's interests in Asia and the Middle  East. But Senator Evans said purported revelations by former  ASIS officers had the potential to compromise national security.  He said that now that a judicial inquiry into ASIS had been set  up, further public comment by former Australian spies should  cease.    Senator Evans gave this response to opposition claims that  he  was threatening former ASIS personnel:    [Begin Evans recording] Might I simply say that the  government has of course very serious and onerous  responsibilities in the protection of national security, the  protection of the national interest in this respect. We will  carry out those responsibilities with full consciousness of the  gravity of the issues that are involved. And it's just really  again unfortunate the opposition should choose to trivialize to  score points about something which is obviously an example of  the government properly exercising the various very serious  responsibilities we do have.

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Taking stock: how to find the right broker - Philip Coggan on the choices you face if you want to invest in shares THE PUBLIC image of stockbrokers has often been poor. Either they are seen as the haughty pin-striped types, who will not let you through the door unless you are a millionaire; or they are portrayed as spivs on the lines of Private Walker in Dad's Army, trading on wild rumours or inside information. These stereotypes are nowadays fundamentally unfair. The harsh laws of economics have made more and more brokers willing to welcome clients of modest means, and using some of the cheap and cheerful telephone dealing services is no more daunting than ordering theatre tickets by phone. So investors who are looking for an alternative to the building society should not be frightened of approaching a broker. But how do you find the right one for you? First decide what type of service you need. In essence, there are three types of stockbroking service. Execution-only brokers will buy and sell shares on your behalf, but will not offer advice on which stocks to select. Advisory brokers will trade for you but will also discuss the wisdom of your decisions, and suggest their own trades. In addition, they may help with tax planning or portfolio construction. Both the above types of service earn their corn by the commissions they charge every time you deal. Discretionary brokers assume command of your portfolio and take all the investment decisions. Some still take their reward in the form of commission but more and more are switching to fees, based on a proportion of assets under management. For the client, this has the advantage of creating a coincidence of interest between himself and his broker; if the portfolio does well, the broker's fee rises. It also reduces the threat of 'churning' the portfolio - excessive dealing to earn commission - although this partly depends on whether commissions are charged on top of fees. For the broker, a fee represents a steady source of income. The industry has tended to polarise in recent years between execution-only brokers and the discretionary kind. In part, this is because some brokers found advisory services unprofitable, with a long list of clients who seldom bothered to deal. Another factor is that the dealing commissions of advisory brokers are undercut by the execution-only firms. But Paul Killik of the London-based Killik maintains that clients still appreciate an advisory service. 'It gives the client the chance to kick ideas around with somebody else. They are happy to do that for the cost of an extra 0.4 of a percentage point in commission,' he says. Killik adds: 'Clients may think they are saving a few pounds commission using an execution-only broker but they may get legged over in the market when it comes to the prices at which they deal.' Brian Tora of London-based broker Greig Middleton says it is a great help to be able to bounce ideas off people at the other end of the telephone. 'Advisory brokers can give you greater control of timing, and add a certain perspective to your own research' he argues. Greig Middleton offers a service called Assetcare where commission is reduced and can be offset against fees. It is very hard to judge whether the advice of a broker is value for money. Accordingly, it is just as difficult to choose between one advisory broker and another. All one can rely on are three qualitative rather than quantitative criteria: do you know someone who can recommend a broker? do you feel comfortable with the individual who will be your point of contact with the advisory firm? and are the ancillary services provided by the broker - tax planning etc - of the standard you seek? When it comes to a discretionary service, there is a little more evidence to go on. Few brokers will give performance figures for the 'average client' on the grounds that the needs of their clients differ fundamentally; some want income, some want growth; some are very cautious, others are willing to take substantial risks. But often firms will manage collective funds such as unit or investment trusts, and investors can check their performance records in publications such as our sister magazine, Money Management. The size of the fees (or combination of fees and commissions) being charged is another obvious criterion for assessment. Another factor may be whether the broker will invest your portfolio directly into equities or (normally if your holding is worth less than Pounds 100,000) into unit or investment trusts. There is nothing wrong with the latter course and indeed some brokers, such as City firm Foster &amp; Braithwaite make a speciality out of it. On the other hand, some investors might find it more interesting to own a stake in Marks &amp; Spencer and Glaxo than in the M &amp; G Dividend fund. If you are giving a broker complete discretion over your funds, then you will need a high level of trust in the individual handling your account. But you should also expect a good service in the form of regular valuations, handling of dividend income and your capital gains tax position and so on. Price is the obvious way to compare execution-only services and some details are given in the article on the right. But there are other factors. Some brokers, such as Fidelity's, offer money market accounts in which investors' cash earns interest in between deals. On the other hand, Fidelity's service is nominee-based and many investors might prefer to own the shares in their own names, as occurs at Sharelink. Although there is a tendency to think that those who use execution-only services are 'on their own' in terms of investment decisions, brokers can give factual information or pass on details of what other brokers are recommending. Sharelink, for example, offers an excellent low cost range of information including reports of analysts's recommendations for Pounds 2.95 and company reports for Pounds 4.95. The toll-free telephone lines available from services such as Fidelity may appeal as may those brokers who have phone lines open at weekends, or who can deal in overseas securities (see article on right for US dealing details). In terms of sheer cheapness, the Share Centre (0442-890800) offers a tone-phone service with a minimum commission of just Pounds 8. This service is available only for privatisation shares plus Abbey National and TSB. Finally, if you are only interested in selling individual shares, perhaps acquired through privatisations, you may well find special deals on offer through banks and building societies. The upcoming BT3 offer will involve 150 'share shops', many of which will be seeking to attract new customers by offering special incentives to those who register for the BT offer. The Weekend FT will try to give details of these special offers over the next few weeks.</p>

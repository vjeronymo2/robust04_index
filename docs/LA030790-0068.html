			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE VOTERS SIDE WITH MOBIL  </P> <P> Torrance voters on Tuesday decisively rejected a ballot measure that would have  forced Mobil Oil Corp. to eliminate the use of acutely hazardous hydrofluoric  acid at its local refinery.  </P> <P> The oil company, which mounted a saturation campaign to defeat Measure A,  estimated it would have been forced to spend $100 million to convert to  less-volatile sulfuric acid had the measure passed.  </P> <P> The initiative -- which lost by a 3-1 margin -- would have prohibited the  storage of more than 250 gallons of hydrofluoric acid at the refinery,  effectively banning its use. Mobil, which uses the chemical in a process that  boosts octane in unleaded gas, typically has 29,000 gallons on hand.  </P> <P> Another measure, which would have allowed the city to raise its spending limit  to pay for any lawsuit stemming from passage of Measure A, was also rejected  handily. In addition, three City Council incumbents were easy victors over a  lone challenger.  </P> <P> Election officials said about 25% of the city's 72,000 registered voters cast  ballots.  </P> <P> The vote on Measure A was a political setback for City Councilman Dan Walker,  who had championed it in the face of opposition from his council colleagues.  </P> <P> Refinery manager Wyman Robb said the vote was a clear victory for Mobil. "I  think it's quite clear that the people of Torrance don't perceive (the  refinery's use of hydrofluoric acid) as the big problem that people like Dan  Walker want to make it."  </P> <P> But Mayor Katy Geissert said the vote did not reflect a lack of concern over  refinery safety. "I don't think this should be misread by Mobil Oil to mean  that people are not concerned about the hazardous chemicals (at the refinery),"  she said. "People are very concerned."  </P> <P> Walker, asked why he thought he lost, responded: "A million dollars," a  reference to Mobil's campaign expenditures. Nonetheless, he said, "I am very  much surprised. There was a lot more support in the community just a matter of  a few weeks ago."  </P> <P> Polling in January by supporters indicated that sentiment strongly favored the  measure. Last Friday, Mobil spokesman Tom Collins said company polls showed  supporters still outnumbered opponents, although he said the gap had narrowed  substantially.  </P> <P> Walker proposed the measure last year after a series of explosions, fires and  other accidents had caused three deaths and more than a dozen serious injuries  at the refinery during the preceding two years. Attention was focused on  hydrofluoric acid after a buildup of the chemical caused a massive explosion  and fire at the refinery in November, 1987. No one was killed in that accident.  </P> <P> Mobil put about $600,000 into the campaign against the measure, outspending  supporters by 24 to 1 and dwarfing the previous city election spending record  of $45,000, set by Walker in the 1988 City Council race.  </P> <P> Supporters of the measure reported spending at least $25,000 and Walker also  spent $65,000 in campaign funds to draft the measure and support the signature  campaign.  </P> <P> The measure has drawn the attention of lawmakers in Congress and the California  Legislature, as well as from the South Coast Air Quality Management District,  the oil refining industry and national environmental organizations.  </P> <P> With Mobil setting records for campaign spending and airing its messages on  major radio stations, the campaign also has attracted the interest of national  media.  </P> <P> Supporters of the measure cited industry-sponsored tests that showed a leak of  1,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid could be fatal as far as five miles  downwind. They argued that the refinery's history of accidents showed Mobil  could not adequately protect the public.  </P> <P> Walker claimed that a defeat would cripple efforts elsewhere by legislative and  regulatory officials to eliminate the use of hydrofluoric acid in populated  areas.  </P> <P> Mobil argued that the Torrance refinery has used thehydrofluoric acid for 40  years without any release affecting the public, that it can safely handle any  reasonably foreseeable leak and that switching to sulfuric acid, which is  required in greater quantities, would create a transportation hazard.  </P> <P> The company and the other six members of the seven-member City Council also  said that Walker's primary motivation in sponsoring the measure was political.  </P> <P> Walker's council opponents said they also believe that the bulk use of  hydrofluoric acid should be eliminated at the refinery. But they said the  measure was drawn too narrowly and that a lawsuit the city filed against Mobil  last April offers a better vehicle for controlling all hazardous substances  used by the company.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Janet Rae-Dupree and George Hatch contributed to this  story.  </P> <P> VOTING IN TORRANCE  </P> <P> Precincts Reporting: 58 of 58  </P> <P> </P> <P> Measure A: Shall Measure A be adopted prohibiting the storage or maintenance of  more than 250 gallons of 70% solution of hydrofluoric acid or 1,840 pounds of  hydrogen fluoride; declaring a violation thereof to be a misdemeanor and a  public nuisance, and authorizing the City Council to extend the time for  removing any excess storage or maintenance of hydrofluoric acid, or hydrogen  fluoride?

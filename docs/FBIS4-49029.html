			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv this morning and  discussed the continuation of Israel-Arab peace negotiations  with focus on Syrian track.    Rabin emphasized the importance of secret talks in peace  talks and criticized Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for refusing  to give favorable response. He also blamed Syria for Hezbollah  attacks in South Lebanon.    To start the talks, Rabin and Christopher had a 15-minute  private meeting and then were jointed by Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres, U.S. Special Coordinator for the Middle East  Peace Talks Dennis Ross and other senior officials from both  sides.    Rabin said that Syria has made the maximum territorial  demand, but not given the slightest hint of confidence-building  measures, which can prove to Israeli public that Syria desires  for peace.    There are two major problems on the way to peace, namely,  attacks by Hezbollah in Lebanon instigated or tolerated by Syria  and Palestinian terrorism in the (occupied) territories, Rabin  said.    In the attacks in South Lebanon, Rabin disclosed, Hezbollah  has deliberately targeted Christian villages, shooting at  Christian villages, and shooting from inside the villages which  are not situated in the "security zone."    He noted that to allow Hezbollah to open fire from inside  the  villages is a violation of the understanding reached between  Israel and Syria after the "operation of accountability" last  year because it means that they can use the villagers as a human  shield against Israeli retaliation.    On Syria's refusal to conduct secret talks, Rabin said it is  difficult to work with someone who says he wants peace but  refuses to talk face to face.    Christopher listened without a comment. But one of the U.S.  diplomats said America's diplomatic activity is not a substitute  for direct talks between the parties and this is clear to the  Syrians.    At Rabin's suggestion, the Israeli and U.S. officials split  into three working groups on Syria, Jordan and Lebanon on  detailed discussions.    Later today, the entire party will reconvene and the working  groups will report on their deliberations.    According to Minister of Environment Yosi Sarid, who  attended  the meeting, Rabin did not make any hint that he will propose  complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for full  peace with Syria at this stage.    However, Sarid said, Rabin has declared that he will uproot  the Jewish settlements on the Golan Heights for the sake of  peace and that the depth of withdrawal will be according to the  depth of peace. By combining the two very important statements,  people can come to their own conclusion.</p>

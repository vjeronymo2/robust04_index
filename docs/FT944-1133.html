			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Gatt chief to stay as WTO caretaker Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday agreed to stay on as caretaker head of the World Trade Organisation until March 15 to allow more time for the selection of his successor. Mr Sutherland had previously announced his intention to leave before January 1 when the WTO starts work. He is staying on as caretaker so that trading powers can break the deadlock between three official candidates seeking the post. The candidates for director-general of the WTO are Mr Renato Ruggiero, former Italian trade minister, Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who left office as Mexican president earlier this month, and Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade and industry minister. But with the contest in a stalemate arising from a three-way regional split, some officials are already considering the possibility of new candidates emerging with a better chance of securing the required consensus. Although Mr Kim has run a good campaign, winning support from Japan and Australia as well as the bulk of Asia, diplomats acknowledge that he has no chance of winning without the US or the European Union on his side. The assumption in Geneva is that Washington and Brussels eventually will cut a deal broadly acceptable to other WTO members - but for the moment neither is interested in bargaining. Mr Ruggiero, the European Union candidate, already has the backing of more than half Gatt's 125 members. However, they are concentrated in Europe and among poor developing nations with close aid and trade links to the EU. Brussels is hoping that Mr Kim's supporters will turn to Mr Ruggiero once their man bows out - but Mr Kim has said he will stay in the race to the end. Meanwhile Mr Salinas, with the US, Canada and the whole of Latin America in support, has barely begun his campaign. Washington was unwilling to lobby actively on his behalf before the US Senate vote which ratified the WTO agreement on December 1. Another factor claimed in Mr Ruggiero's favour - the decision to give the top job at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris to a Canadian - is discounted by Mr Salinas' supporters. 'There's no reason why North Americans should not hold both jobs,' says one. 'Europe did so for 40 years.' Mr Sutherland, whose contract ends next June, has said repeatedly he is not a candidate for the WTO post. Mr Philip Burdon of New Zealand, who did not run this year, has indicated he might be available if none of the three declared runners attracted sufficient support. By late yesterday, 71 countries had ratified the WTO agreement and the Uruguay Round trade accords, Gatt officials said.</p>

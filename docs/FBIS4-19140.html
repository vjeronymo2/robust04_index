			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["uhl" report: "Eastern Allowance for All Small </F> Enterprises"]    [Text] Bonn, 12 Apr -- The so-called higher investment  allowance of 20 percent for east German companies of the  producing industry and the crafts will expire at the end of the  year, according to a decision made by the coalition's financial  politicians. At the same time, as early as 1 July 1994 a  "largely budget-neutral" follow-up regulation is to be  introduced, which will also include west German and foreign  companies. According to this new regulation, all small and  medium-sized companies in the producing industry and crafts get  a "higher allowance" of 10 percent for investment in the new  laender. However, they must not employ more than 250 people.  The subsidized investment volume is being raised to a maximum  of 10 million German marks [DM] per company and business year.  For the 20-percent allowance the subsidized investment volume  is only DM1 million.</p>

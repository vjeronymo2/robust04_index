			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A STEAMY NIGHT WHEN ACTOR'S GANG STAGES NOISY BENEFIT  </P> <P> A good cause and loud music lured hundreds of people to 2nd Coming on Friday  night for a sweaty benefit for the Actors' Gang, the 8-year-old Los Angeles  theater ensemble led by actor Tim Robbins.  </P> <P> A low ebb in the club scene (or a wave of philanthropy?) may explain the  around-the-block lines and valet parking that was full by 10:30. Once inside,  the only way to move was like toothpaste through a tube -- but what an  interesting way to meet people.  </P> <P> Evaporating body fluids were replaced with Coronas, selling briskly at $4 a  pop. Oxygen was another rare commodity as clubbers greedily hoarded window  space.  </P> <P> Beefy actor John Cusack acted as Gang spokesman as he faced the "Entertainment  Tonight" cameras, wearing a bandanna and a big black hat on his head.  </P> <P> Weaving through the throngs were other young Hollywood-ites: Dylan McDermott  and Julia Roberts, Hart Bochner, Rae Dawn Chong, Rebecca DeMornay, Alex Winter,  Billy Baldwin; singer-musicians Tom Waits, Flea and members of Trulio  Disgracias; designer Rachel London and a smattering of agents and studio execs.  </P> <P> Actors' Gang producer Patti McGuire figured the profits from the event the  old-fashioned way: "There are 1,000 people, and they paid $20, so that's  $20,000!"  </P> <P> As the club loaded up, getting past the bouncer-doorman became more and more  difficult. Would-be guests had to resort to using their wits, as with the woman  who stood behind the ropes and shrieked, "I'm with CAA! I'm with CAA!!"  JEANNINE STEIN  </P></p>

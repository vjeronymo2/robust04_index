The two presidents  essentially discussed economic problems, according to Mario  Carrera, spokesman for the Federal Department of Finance (DFF).    Bern and Tashkent said they wanted to strengthen their  relations, the DFF spokesman added. Switzerland and Uzbekistan  signed two agreements last year, one relating to economic  cooperation and the other to investment protection. The Uzbek  president expressed the wish that cooperation between the two  countries should not stop there.    Mr. Karimov, who reminded Mr. Stich of his country's major  economic potential, stressed the positive role played by the big  Swiss banks in Uzbekistan, Mr. Carrera added. The two  presidents deemed it necessary to continue the economic reforms  in the framework set out by the IMF. Uzbekistan is a member of  the voting group headed by Switzerland within the Bretton Woods  institutions.    Mr. Stich and Mr. Karimov also discussed the general  political situation in Central Asia, particularly the case of  Tajikistan. Following this short meeting with the president of  the Confederation, the Uzbek president is due to go to Davos to  participate in the economic forum.</p>

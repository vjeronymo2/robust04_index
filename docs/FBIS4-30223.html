			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Indonesian Research and  Technology Minister Bacharuddin J. Habibie on Wednesday [22  June] said he has a "clean and clear" conscience on his role in  the Indonesian Government's controversial purchase of 39  warships and a related clampdown on the country's media.    "I always can sleep because I have a very clean and clear  conscience," Habibie told reporters at a press conference held  on the last day of a visit to Japan that began June 12.    The minister's remarks followed a government decision  Tuesday  to immediately revoke the licenses of three leading magazines --  DETIK, EDITOR and TEMPO -- for failing to heed previous warnings  not to step out of line.    Habibie, a close protege of President Suharto and potential  successor, refuted remarks attributed to him that an article in  TEMPO about the warship purchase left him unable to sleep for a  full day and made him determined to make the magazine "sleep"  for the rest of its life.    "What a fantasy," he said. "That remark I have never given  and I sleep very well any time if I need to sleep."    The government's purchase of warships used by the former  East  Germany has been widely criticized as the warships are outdated.  Finance Minister Mar'ie muhammad approved only part of the 1.1  billion dollars sought by Habibie for the purchase and local  refit of the ships.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Eurobond debt issuance at a record INCREASED borrowing by European governments boosted the amount of new debt issued in the Eurobond market to a record Dollars 35.7bn (Pounds 23.6bn) in January. The US corporate debt market also had its busiest month ever, with a total of Dollars 36.9bn, made up largely of refinancings, according to figures from Securities Data. While most European governments have finished replenishing their currency reserves after last autumn's foreign exchange debacle, they still face mounting budget deficits. Sovereign borrowers accounted for more than Dollars 8bn of total Eurobond issues in January, as their increased funding needs forced them to seek funds outside their domestic bond markets. Volume the previous January totalled Dollars 34.7bn, of which less than Dollars 5bn was made up of government debt, according to IFR Securities Data. 'European countries are under pressure to bring down debt levels to meet criteria for European monetary union, but with weaker economic growth and a shrinking tax base, this is not going to be an easy task,' said Mr Jim Pelgrift, executive director of Morgan Stanley International. The slowdown in most of the world's economies and the prospect of low inflation is likely to provide favourable conditions for bond markets. 'Every market one looks at, there is potential for a rally,' according to Mr Tom Skwarek, managing director of capial markets at JP Morgan. The economic slowdown has discouraged European companies from tapping the market, since they do not need to borrow to invest. In the US, companies have been taking advantage of lower interest rates to lock in fixed-rate financing, as the economy emerges from recession. Volume in January just topped last January's Dollars 36.9bn record. International bonds, Page 21</p>

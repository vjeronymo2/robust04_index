			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft chief to spell out future strategy Metallgesellschaft, the troubled Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial group which came to the brink of collapse last month, will give the first full account of its future strategy this week following its DM3.4bn (Dollars 1.98bn) rescue package - and the first detailed explanation of the events which led to near disaster. Tomorrow, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the troubleshooter appointed as chief executive in December last year, will hold his first press conference since he took over from the sacked Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch. Having kept his silence until now, but for a few sentences uttered for the benefit of the television cameras and a handful of short press releases, he will outline his plans for the group, which has 58,000 employees working at 258 subsidiaries. He has already said there will be massive redundancies and that numerous subsidiaries will be sold - details will emerge tomorrow. On Thursday, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who is also chairman of Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board, will preside over an extraordinary shareholders' meeting. There are formal legal reasons for the meeting following the departure of Mr Schimmelbusch and other boardroom colleagues, but the supervisory board is expected to seize the opportunity to defend its own conduct throughout the affair. While tomorrow's press conference is expected to focus on Metallgesellschaft's future, the annual meeting on Thursday will concentrate on the past. Mr Schmitz is likely to face a grilling from aggrieved shareholders anxious to know how it was that the supervisory board - consisting of some of the most distinguished names in German business - could have failed to prevent the near catastrophe. The crisis was triggered by MG Corp, Metallgesellschaft's US trading subsidiary, whose activities in the oil futures markets are expected to give rise to a DM1.5bn loss in the current financial year. Critics will argue at the meeting that beyond the immediate causes of Metallgesellschaft's problems there is evidence of a 'system failure' reflecting the close relations between big German banks and the company. 'If they didn't know what was going on, they failed in their duty to supervise,' said the chief economist of a foreign bank in Frankfurt. 'If they did know, there was a cover-up and that is equally bad. 'The problem is that the members of German supervisory boards are self-selecting; they are members of a club,' the economist continued. 'Shareholders are formally supposed to control the supervisory boards via the way they vote at annual meetings. But this does not work because the banks own big stakes themselves and can vote large stakes on behalf of other shareholders who lodge their shares for custody at the banks. 'Criticism has tended to be dismissed until now but the Metallgesellschaft case shows that there is a weakness which threatens the fabric of the German economy,' he concluded. Mr Schmitz has been praised by fellow board members for the energetic way he has led the supervisory board at Metallgesellschaft since he took over as chairman last April. He is likely to argue on Thursday that he was entitled be kept informed by the management board but that he was not kept in the picture.</p>

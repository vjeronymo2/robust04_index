			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "U.S. Equipment Idle at Russian </F> Missile Range"]    [Text] The racks visible in this photograph are on the  third floor of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces' State Test  Range located in the town of Mirnyy, Arkhangelsk Oblast. It is  equipment made by the U.S. firm of "Metrum-97" [name as  transliterated] for reproducing telemetry data. More precisely,  it is a masgnetic tape player for decoding the flight parameters  of strategic missiles developed and launched on test flights by  the United States.    It was supplied here last year under a bilateral agreement  between the countries, when the second Strategic Arms Reduction  Treaty (START II) was signed. Similar Russian-made equipment --  in six rather than two racks -- has been set up on U.S. soil  near Washington by our officers.    It was assumed that when the two states' parliaments  ratified  the treaty, the countries would, as a mark of the trust between  them, exchange telemetry and other information on the  performance of their new and old strategic missiles, their  behavior in flight, and other important information, which would  allow the generals, politicians, and missile designers to take a  calm and very respectful view of both sides' scientific and  technical developments and to monitor them with greater  confidence.    They even exchanged as a goodwill gesture reels of magnetic  tape recordings of previous test telemetry. The Americans gave  us information on their ground-launched missile, while we gave  them information on our sea-launched missile. Once again, they  sent us one spool, while we sent them several.    This is not a question of excessive generosity. It is simply  that the Americans take the information on their missiles'  behavior in flight from a single satellite, while our testers  have to take the information from nine measuring stations sited  along the country's northern seaboard. From Mirnyy to  Kamchatka. There are stations in Naryan-Mar, Taymyr, Yakutsk,  and even on Novaya    The information is sent back by military couriers. This is  when aircraft are flying and reindeer are not roaming the  tundra. [sentence as published]    Because of this the countries set the timetable for the  exchange of telemetry at 50 days. Less than that would be  impossible. Otherwise, there might be suspicions of dishonesty.  It would then have to be proved that there was no way out from  Novaya Zemlya. That would be no justification in  military-diplomatic circles -- especially as delivery of  magnetic tapes is subsequently provided for by diplomatic pouch.    But, so far, there is nothing to deliver. Apart from the  so-called demonstration reels, the high contracting parties have  not exchanged anything else. Our parliament -- neither the old  one nor the new one -- has not ratified START II.    A whole telemetry exchange department has been set up at the  Russian test range. Colonel Aleksandr Vasilyev, its deputy  chief, agreed to be photographed alongside the U.S. equipment  for this newspaper. He says that they are not wasting time but  are preparing to do serious work on the transatlantic missile  information. In principle, they are already ready to do so.    So the ball is now in the State Duma's court.</p>

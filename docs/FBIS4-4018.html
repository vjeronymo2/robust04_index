			<p>BFN     [Text] Alma-ata [Almaty], April 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese  Premier Li Peng, addressing a press conference here this  afternoon, stated that a complete nuclear test ban should be  established through negotiations.    Asked about China's attitude towards such a policy, Li said  that while China is a nuclear country, its nuclear weapons take  up only a very small portion of the world's total.    "China has initiated the proposition of not using nuclear  weapons first and not resorting to threats with nuclear  weapons," he noted.    He pointed out that the Chinese Government always stands for  a complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear  weapons, and for the realization of a complete nuclear test ban  in such a context.    Towards that aim, he said: "the Chinese Government holds  that  it is of positive significance to reach a pact on a complete  nuclear test ban through negotiations."    He added that China has stated clearly that it would work  towards reaching such a treaty in 1996.    "At the moment, China is positively participating in  negotiations on a complete nuclear test ban of the Geneva  Disarmament Conference," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Recently appointed Supreme Court Justice Eleodoro  Ortiz has voiced his opposition to a possible law on divorce.    The new justice was a member of the Court of Appeals in  Concepcion. President Eduardo Frei telephoned Judge Ortiz to  tell him of his appointment as Supreme Court justice. Judge  Eleodoro Ortiz has been on the bench since 1969, when he was  nominated as appellate judge in Concepcion under President  Eduardo Frei Montalva.    He believes the streamlining of judicial processes merits  urgent consideration and that judges should be vested with the  power of expeditiously passing sentence in less serious crimes.  He believes the jurisdiction of military justice ought to be  restricted and that the best guarantee for human rights is to  facilitate access to the law by the widest sectors. With regard  to a possible law on divorce, he categorically asserted:    [Begin Ortiz recording] The current system has come under  fire because nullity suits are said to be a farce. Nothing will  prevent this very farce from continuing unabated with the  passing of a law on divorce. [end recording]    The new Supreme Court justice declined to comment on the  mushrooming of schools of law in the country.</p>

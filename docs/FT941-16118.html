			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Life houses told to decide whether to support PIA Life insurance companies should make up their minds about whether to support the planned body to regulate retail financial services on the basis of its prospectus, the Association of British Insurers signalled yesterday. Following a discussion of the Personal Investment Authority at one of the ABI board's regular meetings, the association did not support the stance taken on Monday by Standard Life, one of the UK's leading insurers, that the composition of the board was in itself enough to withdraw support from the plans. The association's position is in line with what it has previously said, but its re-statement still helps to redress some of the damage done by Standard Life to the momentum behind the new organisation. Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, resigned as a director of the PIA and his company withdrew its support from the organisation, saying statutory regulation would be preferable to current plans. He argued that the PIA's decision that only nine of its 19 directors should be active in the industry meant that this could not be self-regulation. Support for the PIA has come from the Scottish life industry although it is rather unenthusiastic. The eight largest Scottish life offices met informally on Monday and a majority decided not to withdraw support from the PIA. While a number of life companies expressed concern about aspects of the plans for the PIA, they decided that these were not sufficient to withdraw their earlier backing of the planned authority. Mr Mike Ross, managing director of Scottish Widows, the second-largest Scottish life insurer, said yesterday that while he accepted in principle the argument made by Mr Stretton, he believed it was too fine a point on which to withdraw support. It is likely that some of the public-interest directors will be former practitioners. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, is still braced for further opposition from some life companies. The PIA is expected to publish its prospectus, on the basis of which it will apply for recognition from the SIB, around the middle of next month. Editorial Comment, Page 25</p>

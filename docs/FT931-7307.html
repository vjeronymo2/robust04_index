			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems in Maastricht amendment threat WESTMINSTER skirmishing over the Maastricht treaty took a further twist last night as Liberal Democrat MPs indicated that they were likely to join with the Labour party in a fresh attempt at forcing the insertion of the social chapter into the treaty. The latest procedural device discovered by the opposition parties centres on an amendment tabled by Mr Calum Macdonald, Labour MP for Western Isles. Heightening the possibility of the government being defeated over the issue, Conservative Euro-sceptic MPs also indicated that they may back Mr Macdonald's amendment - if it is selected for debate - in the hope that will it prevent the government ratifying the treaty. 'It's a real wrecker this one, it appears,' said one Euro-sceptic. However, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argue that if the amendment is passed the government could still ratify the treaty by bowing to the will of parliament and inserting the social chapter. Today Mr George Robertson, the party's European spokesman, will press Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker who presides over the bill's committee stage, for a full debate on the social chapter itself when MPs resume the Maastricht bill's committee stage. Mr Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, said the government was making a 'complete mess' of the debate over the social chapter. 'We hold to our determination to see the Maastricht treaty ratified and the social chapter included,' he said. Labour has said it will not back wrecking amendments - but has also made re-inserting the social chapter as its top priority. It won a small victory on Monday by securing a debate on the government's legal advice Meanwhile, Tory Euro-sceptics have been encouraged by the succession of legal and procedural disputes that have engulfed the government. Mr Macdonald's amendment, which is unlikely to be voted on for several weeks, would remove Maastricht's social protocol - which includes Britain's 'opt-out' - from the part of the Maastricht bill that increases the powers of the European parliament.</p>

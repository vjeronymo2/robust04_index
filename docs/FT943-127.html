			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais goes to the people Credit Lyonnais, the embattled French banking group, is pleading directly with its customers and staff in an effort win back their support after months of negative publicity. The bank, which reported losses of FFr4.5bn (Dollars 850m) earlier this week, yesterday launched a strongly-worded campaign with advertisements in all 66 regional French papers and most of the national press. The full-page advertisements describe the company's position and prospects at length, with the first one headlined: 'Here are the bad results that everyone has been waiting for'. A further four will follow over the next few days. In an even more unusual move, Credit Lyonnais's final advert next Tuesday will announce operation 'open-door evening' next month, when its 2,200 French branches will open until 9pm to answer questions about its financial state from anxious customers. Asked whether it could justify spending the FFr15m-FFr20m that the campaign is costing on top of the large losses, it said: 'People had been hearing about Credit Lyonnais for some months. We felt it was necessary to do something rather strong rather than keeping silent.' The bank admitted that the campaign was focused as much on its own 38,000 embattled employees as on the roughly 6m account holders with the bank. They have been questioning their commitment to the bank after the FFr6.9bn losses reported in March and a scathing parliamentary inquiry published over the summer. 'Demoralisation would not be a good word, but it is clear that there has been pressure on the network since March which is hard for everyone,' it said. However, the bank claimed that it had not experienced any loss of depositors since news of its troubles began to emerge. 'The message is that we don't want clients to forget that we are professionals, that we have nothing to hide and that there are many things we can still be proud of,' the bank said.

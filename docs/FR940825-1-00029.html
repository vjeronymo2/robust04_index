This action is taken at the request of Public Interest Corporation, licensee of television station WTMV(TV), channel 32, Lakeland, Florida and it taken to test the proposal for market hyphenation through the record established based on comments filed by interested parties. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments are due on or before September 14, 1994 and reply comments are due on or before October 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  William H.

The full text of this decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20554, and may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, (202) 857&hyph;3800, 1919 M Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20554. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Synopsis of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Commission, in response to a Petition for Rule Making filed by the petitioner, proposed to amend &sect;76.51 of the Rules to add the community of Lakeland to the Tampa-St.Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida television market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In evaluating past requests for hyphenation of a market, the Commission has considered the following factors as relevant to its examination: (1) the distance between the existing designated communities and the community proposed to be added to the designation; (2) whether cable carriage, if afforded to the subject station, would extend to areas beyond its Grade B signal coverage area; (3) the presence of a clear showing of a particularized need by the station requesting the change of market designation; and (4) an indication of benefit to the public from the proposed change.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each of these factors helps the Commission to evaluate individual market conditions consistent ``with the underlying competitive purpose of the market hyphenation rule to delineate areas where stations can and do, both actually and logically, compete.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Based on the facts presented, the Commission believes that a sufficient case for redesignation of the subject market has been set forth so that this proposal should be tested through the rule making process, including the comments of interested parties. It appears from the information before us that the television stations licensed to Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater, and Lakeland do compete for audiences and advertisers throughout much of the proposed combined market area, and that sufficient evidence has been presented tending to demonstrate commonality between the proposed communities to be added to the market designation and the market as a whole. Moreover, the petitioners' proposal appears to be consistent with the Commission's policies regarding redesignation of a hyphenated television market. Accordingly, comment is requested on the proposed addition of Lakeland to the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida television market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The Commission certifies that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this rulemaking proceeding because if the proposed rule amendment is promulgated, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by &sect;601 (3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A few cable television system operators will be affected by the proposed rule amendment. The Secretary shall send a copy of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice of Proposed Rule Making, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in &sect;&sect;1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, interested parties may file comments on or before September 14, 1994, and reply comments on or before October 14, 1994. All relevant and timely comments will be considered before final action is taken in this proceeding. To file formally in this proceeding, participants must file an original and four copies of all comments, reply comments, and supporting comments. If participants want each Commissioner to receive a personal copy of their comments, an original plus nine copies must be filed.

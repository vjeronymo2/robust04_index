			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Bundesbank more upbeat THE Bundesbank yesterday tried to ease pressure on the D-Mark with an upbeat assessment of German economic prospects. There were also some favourable indicators in the key factors influencing the bank's monetary policy, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the central bank's vice-president, told bankers in Munster. But he tempered his optimism with a warning that if the government came up with wrong or unconvincing solutions to the country's deficit difficulties, the currency might suffer from 'over-reactions' in money markets. The economic situation was serious, but there was evidence that the pace of decline was over-stated, he said. 'Free fall' was out of the question. Although output fell 3 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, there were now signs the situation was stabilising, he claimed. Industrial production had not fallen further, and foreign orders had risen. Meanwhile, growth in the M3 money supply measure was 'rather flatter' than a little while ago, and there were signs that inflation would slacken as the year continued, he said. Nevertheless, the bank had to assess these developments carefully, and proceed cautiously with further monetary relaxation. Money supply must remain the dominant factor in its deliberations, Mr Tietmeyer added. Mr Tietmeyer made plain that the key to resolving Germany's dilemma lay outside the Bundesbank. 'The limited recent weakening of the D-Mark should be read as an indication of the need for convincing solutions to Germany's home-made problems.'</p>

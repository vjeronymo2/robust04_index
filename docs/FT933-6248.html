			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Small doesn't have to be risky - Unit trusts Scheherazade Daneshkhu profiles a fund which has profited from minimising the hazards in a volatile sector THINK smaller companies, think risk. This is the thought process which James Findlay, manager of Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's US Smaller Companies trust, is keen to dispel, since his strategy is to minimise investment risk in what is seen as a volatile sector. That strategy seems to have paid off and the fund has an impressive record. It is top of the North American sector over the seven years and five years to August 1, and is the second highest-performing fund in that sector over three and two years, according to the Hardwick Stafford Wright Stats Pack. When it was launched in 1983, as the F &amp; C American fund, it was not confined to smaller companies. Findlay, who has managed it since 1986, says the decision was made to concentrate on smaller companies after a time when corporate re-structuring, brand name exploitation and a weak dollar - which had helped larger companies to outperform - appeared to be ending. The fund's name was changed in 1986 when it had only Pounds 1m under management. Now, it has Pounds 80m. In 1987, when stock markets collapsed, the fund lost 30 to 40 per cent of its value - not unusual at the time and better than many smaller companies' funds, but a situation which Findlay would not care to see repeated. 'Until then,' he says, 'I had been doing much the same as everyone else by investing in new issues, technology stocks and restaurants. But, after the crash, I decided to formulate a strategy to create a vehicle to invest in the US with a lower volatility ratio than most of the other funds.' Part of this strategy is to adopt a longer investment horizon by trying to double the share price in two to three years instead of adopting the shorter term time horizon followed by most other smaller company funds. The share price must be cheap relative to earnings, cash flow or asset value, but Findlay will not invest unless a company is well managed. Most smaller companies' funds seek out firms in rapidly growing sectors of the economy but, unusually, Findlay tends to avoid those involved in technology because he believes their performance is too unpredictable and volatile. The down-side of this lower-risk strategy is that the fund misses out on high-growth periods, such as 1991 when the US bio-technology sector was the star performer. Still, Findlay says he is prepared to accept this as the price for reduced volatility. 'Most people like to invest in a cure for cancer, but these companies tend to be expensive and have a high risk profile,' he says. 'The primary goal for me is not to lose any money in an individual investment, so I try to find understandable businesses with predictable earnings.' He tends to avoid defence stocks and restaurants for the same reasons. 'In a bad year, my objective is to try not to go down a lot because of the effect on compounding. At the end of the day, the compounded rate of return is what matters to investors.' This means that the list of companies in which the fund invests is decidedly unglamorous. 'You could fall asleep looking at it,' Findlay admits. The largest holding, accounting for 4 per cent, is in Tejas Gas, an unregulated pipelines company which sells their use to gas companies. Findlay likes it because it earns money each time gas goes through the lines. 'I try to have companies with a lot of recurring revenues,' he says. 'Tejas has no capital investment to make, so earnings are free to be investing in buying more pipelines. I never invest in companies which have to sell equity capital in order to grow.' Magma Power, another favourite, is also an energy company which produces electricity through geo-thermal sources. 'It is a very stable business and I have made three times my money in the four years I have held it.' Oakwood Homes, which specialises in making prefabricated dwellings, has also produced good returns. 'One in four homes in the US is built in a factory and earnings are growing very rapidly as the housing market recovers,' says Findlay. One disappointment, however, is Pulitzer Publishing, which has fallen 15 per cent in value since it was bought earlier this year. Findlay thinks it will recover, There are 60-80 companies in the fund, but the term 'smaller companies' is relative in the US since Findlay will choose stocks with a market value anywhere between Dollars 100m-1bn. The average initial market capitalisation of his companies is Dollars 400m. The US market offers around 1,500 stocks from which to choose and Findlay says he relies on industry contacts rather than brokers to find the ones he wants. He tries to make use of market inefficiencies in his search. What of the currency risk? Findlay admits he has not been active at hedging the fund, which did not seem necessary when the dollar was cheap in 1987. 'We have got a better system now so that, if the dollar is over-valued, we will think of hedging.' Although this is a smaller companies' fund, Findlay's aim is to beat both the Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of smaller companies, and the S &amp; P 500, which follows the performance of the largest stocks. This requires tight discipline, and Findlay says he sometimes has to force himself to sell a stock he likes once he thinks it is over-valued. But he stresses: 'The performance of this fund has come by controlling risk, even in a terrible market like 1990.' Charges. The fund has a 5 per cent initial levy and a 1.5 per cent annual. The present bid/offer spread is about 6.5 per cent. Because the fund has more than 50 per cent of its assets outside the EC, it qualifies for a Pep allowance of only Pounds 1,500 instead of the full Pounds 6,000. Hypo F &amp; C does not have a specific Pep attached to it.</p>

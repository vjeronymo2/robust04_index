As a result, it posted a turnover of more than 457  billion dong. The food catering service alone generated nearly  83 billion dong and contributed more than 10 billion dong to the  state budget. The total volume of this sector's trading  activities accounts for more than 50 percent of all trading  activities in the market. Of this figure, retail services  account for 23 percent and wholesale services account for the  remainder. This sector's corporations, enterprises, and stores  have invested more than 50 billion dong to carry out capital  construction projects, build mini-hotels, and modernize  equipment in order to improve their performance.</p>

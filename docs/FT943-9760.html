			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Static six months at Sembawang Singapore's Sembawang Corporation, one of the island republic's biggest companies whose activities are mainly centred on the shipbuilding and repair business, has reported flat earnings for the first six months, reflecting continued lacklustre performance in the worldwide shipping industry. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 improved by 0.4 per cent to SDollars 63.6m (USDollars 42m) though turnover was up by 42 per cent to SDollars 502m from SDollars 359m previously. Earnings per share declined 9 per cent to 18.9 Singapore cents. Sembawang has been making efforts to diversify operations out of Singapore in recent years, though profits from these ventures are not likely to flow through for some time. Late last year a unit of the group signed a joint venture contract with the authorities in Zhejiang province in China to develop a SDollars 1.9bn power plant. Sembawang said the plant would be the first of a series it would help develop in China. Projects that Sembawang is currently involved in include a SDollars 350m contract for an offshore drilling and production facility in Indonesia and a SDollars 200m contract to convert a Netherlands-owned bulk carrier into the world's largest pipe-laying vessel. Sembawang said that its latest results included a SDollars 23.6m gain from the disposal of some long-term investments. It said the group expected to maintain its present performance in the second half of the year.</p>

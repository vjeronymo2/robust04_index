			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow surges to record high on program buying Wall Street AFTER falling in early trading on futures-related activity, US stocks rebounded strongly on computer program buying to end at an all-time high, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 55.64 ahead at 3,500.03, comfortably eclipsing the previous record of 3,482.31 set last week. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 7.25 at 447.57, while the American SE composite rose 1.70 to a record 429.92 and the Nasdaq composite climbed 9.65 to 690.43. New York SE trading volume jumped to 342.4m shares, the third highest of the year. Share prices fell sharply in the first few hours of trading in the wake of another rise in bond yields, which on Tuesday broke through the 7 per cent barrier for the first time in more than a month. Although inflationary fears were again behind the fall in bond prices, news of stronger than expected imports in the April merchandise trade report also contributed to the selling of longer-dated Treasuries. The decline in stock prices was exacerbated by activity in the futures market, where the S &amp; P 500 stock index futures contract fell through a technical support level, triggering selling in both the futures and the underlying cash markets. Stock and bond prices turned sharply around in the afternoon after gold prices, which had risen steeply in the morning, suddenly retreated. The recent surge in gold has undermined the attractiveness of bonds and stocks, so the drop in gold prices yesterday was welcomed by both debt and equity investors, and helped to trigger some late computer program buying which lifted stocks to new highs. Gold shares lost some of their lustre as profit-takers moved in. Newmont Mining retreated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 3/8 , Battle Mountain Gold Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 on 5.4m shares traded and Home-stake Mining Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 16 3/4 . Motor issues also came under early selling pressure. Ford fell sharply for the second consecutive day, dropping Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 1/8 as it was further undermined by news that brokerage house Merrill Lynch had lowered its intermediate-term rating on the stock. The two other big motor stocks, however, rebounded with the market. Chrysler ended Dollars 1 1/4 up at Dollars 43 3/4 and General Motors Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 39 3/4 . Hewlett-Packard, which posted surprisingly strong quarterly earnings on Tuesday, climbed a further Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 87 3/4 in volume of 2m shares. On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft forged ahead Dollars 4 to Dollars 92 1/2 in volume of 5.6m shares after two broking firms upgraded the stock. Canada TORONTO finished mixed to lower in extremely active trading after a drop in gold shares. The TSE 300 index shed 15.6 to 3,811.3 and declines led rises by 348 to 346 after volume of 83.4m shares valued at CDollars 683.1m. The golds index fell 5.93 per cent as the New York spot gold bullion price lost USDollars 1.50 an ounce. Details of the Ontario budget came after the market close.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Jin Xin, director-  general of the State Administration of Taxation (SAT),  emphasized here today that the new taxation system, which went  into effect at the beginning of this year, will not damage the  interests of overseas-funded enterprises.    According to him, the tax reform will not change the income  tax law concerning foreign investment enterprises effective as  of July 1991, with all the incentives maintained.    Foreign investment enterprises set up in special economic  zones, coastal opening-up districts and the Pudong new area in  Shanghai, will still enjoy an unchanged 15 percent preferential  income tax rate, Jin Xin said. He added that for domestic  enterprises, a single flat rate of 33 percent is being  implemented.    However, as he disclosed, the nationally unified value added  tax, excise tax and business tax will be levied on enterprises  with foreign investment and foreign enterprises as of January 1,  1994, as was decided at the 5th Session of the Standing  Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC).    He said this was to satisfy the requirements of a socialist  market economy, to equalize tax burden, as has also been the  request of the enterprises with foreign investment and foreign  enterprises.    Jin vowed that to keep the foreign tax policy successive and  stable, the tax reform has followed an important policy  principle for foreign investment enterprises, namely, the  redesigning of tax rates would neither increase nor decrease the  aggregate tax burden.    To favor the smooth transition from the old to the new  taxation system, the NPC Standing Committee has approved that  for foreign- funded enterprises licensed before December 31,  1993, any tax burden increase resulting from the tax reform is  to be refunded to the enterprises as approved by the tax  authorities.    According to him, this preferential treatment will be  limited  within the time period of the contract, with a maximum period of  five years. But, any foreign-invested enterprises approved  after January 1, 1994, will be subject to the new tax regime.    Jin Xin concluded that the measure will allow foreign  enterprises a five-year period to transmit management mechanisms  and raise economic benefits, in order to exercise fair  competition with domestic enterprises after five years.    He emphasized that this measure has once again demonstrated  China's determination to open up to the outside world at an  accelerating pace.</p>

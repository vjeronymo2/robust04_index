			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- A seminar on "For the  ultimate solution of the rural question under the banner of the  socialist rural theses", a letter sent by the great leader  President Kim Il-song to the national agricultural conference,  took place at the theory and practice centre of Kimilsongism in  Zimbabwe.    Speakers at the seminar said the letter is a guideline  indicating the most correct way of solving the rural question,  an inspiring banner giving confidence of victory to the world's  revolutionary people who turned out for socialism and the  building of a new society, and an encyclopaedia on the solution  of the rural question.    Noting that the rural question has always stood out as a  difficult problem, they stressed that it is only Korea that has  successfully solved the rural question.    Seminars on the letter also took place at the Bulgaria-Korea  Friendship Association, the group for the study of the chuche  idea of Marien Ngouabi University of the Congo, the group for  the study of the chuche idea of African students studying in  Mali and at the group for the study of the chuche idea of the  Ojota Middle School in Lagos State, Nigeria.</p>

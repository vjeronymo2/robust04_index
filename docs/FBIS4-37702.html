			<p>BFN     [Text] Saudi security agencies have put out a contract on  the opposition figure Shaykh Usamah Bin-Ladin. They assigned  the job to an assassination group, led by a hit man from an Arab  country.    The London-based Committee for the Defense of (Saudi)  Legitimate Rights said that Saudi Arabia, which has paid a huge  sum to this gang, is apparently trying to stay away from the  assassination attempt for domestic reasons connected with tribal  vendettas and external reasons connected with the image of Saudi  Arabia abroad.    In a related development, Usamah's mother was surprised when  a police officer prevented her from boarding a plane that was  about to take off, even though she had completed airport  formalities on her way to be treated abroad from an incurable  disease.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 2 Jan (AFP) --  Members of the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) remain in  the towns of Ocosingo, and they apparently also remain in the  towns of Altamirano, Chanal, and Las Margaritas, after suddenly  leaving San Cristobal de las Casas, it was reported on Sunday by  media sources.    The guerrilla members, it was confirmed by TIEMPO newspaper  in San Cristobal, burned the municipal palace in Ocosingo early  this morning and continued to hold their positions in the town  as of 0730 (1330 GMT).    The San Cristobal Municipal Police said the EZLN members  left  the city, the second most important one in the Mexican state of  Chiapas, and painted graffiti on the wall to announce they were  en route to the town of Rancho Nuevo. A local journalist,  however, noted that the announcement was actually "black humor,"  because the 31st Military Zone is located in Rancho Nuevo and  the guerrilla members "will not walk into the wolf's lair."    The EZLN members' graffiti indicated they will continue  along  their way "to Tuxtla Gutierrez (capital of Chiapas) and there  will be no rest." Other graffiti read: "We do not want NAFTA.  We want freedom and a legitimate government."    The authorities have yet to issue a report on the situation  which prevails in Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Chanal, and  Altamirano, or to indicate if troops are pursuing the guerrilla  forces which left San Cristobal and whose whereabouts are  unknown.    According to different reports, the toll of the EZLN's  arrival is six dead -- three in Ocosingo and three in Las  Margaritas.    Chiapas, on the Guatemalan border, is located 700 km south  of  Mexico City, and it is one of the most backward and poorest  states in the country and has a predominantly Indian population.</p>

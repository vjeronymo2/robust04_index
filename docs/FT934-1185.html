			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Treasury to repay Ecu5bn loan ahead of its final maturity The Treasury is to repay, ahead of its final maturity, an Ecu5bn seven-year revolving bank credit that was arranged in September last year to help support the pound against severe foreign exchange pressure, Tracy Corrigan writes. The move reflects the recovery in the level of the UK's foreign-exchange reserves since the events surrounding Black Wednesday last year. Tranches of the credit, which is currently fully drawn, will be repaid successively over the next four months, at respective roll-over dates. The repayment will come from foreign currency resources. Some Ecu3.5bn will be financed from forward purchases of foreign exchange set aside for the purpose; the rest will be drawn from foreign-exchange reserves. Foreign-exchange and gold reserves stood at Dollars 43.6bn at the end of November, and are expected to rise further in 1994 with issues under the three-year Ecu Treasury note programme.</p>

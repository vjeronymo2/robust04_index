			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES still grows The Business Expansion Scheme continues to expand in spite of its planned abolition at the year's end. No schemes with a non-recourse loan facility, which allows exit after six months, are available. And many intermediaries are having difficulty investing in these schemes before they are fully subscribed - funds are allocated on a first-come first-served basis, so many cheques sent to sponsors are being returned. There is also a risk that novice investors could be rushed into an inferior deal. The easiest way around this is to use one of the larger intermediaries. Biggest in the field are Allenbridge Group and BESt Investment, both based in London. The three schemes launched this week are ingenious. All invest in residential property: Peppa is a unique investment which combines a personal equity plan with a BES. It involves a listing on the Luxembourg stock exchange. The underlying investment is split into two. Eighty per cent goes into a Luxembourg-listed BES company which will purchase a portfolio of residential rental properties from Wimpey homes, the housebuilding group. Wimpey has undertaken to make up any shortfall, compared with the purchase price, after five years. There is no set limit on the profit potential for the BES companies. However, there is no independent bank guarantee. The BES element attracts tax relief for the investor in the standard way so that a Pounds 1,000 investment will cost only Pounds 750 for a basic rate taxpayer and Pounds 600 for a top rate payer. The remaining 20 per cent of the portfolio will go into a Pep managed by Abtrust which will invest in a portfolio of blue chip shares and gilts. Investors can use their full Pounds 9,000 annual Pep allowance, if they wish, since the plan qualifies for both single company and general Pep status. At the end of the five years, the Luxembourg listing will provide investors with a ready made exit route from the BES; the BES shares can also be transferred into the Pep. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and maximum is Pounds 45,000. Cavendish Gleeson Guaranteed, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson, has a buy-back guarantee after five years from the MJ Gleeson Group, which has been underwritten by Lloyds Bank. After five years it will pay 115p for ever Pounds 1 share bought now. There is no early exit option, and total capacity is only Pounds 5m. Cavendish Growth, also sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson, will buy properties from the Household Mortgage Corporation. HMC has covenanted to buy back the properties at the end of the five-year BES qualification period at Pounds 1.18 for every Pounds 1 share. Total capacity is Pounds 15m. Minimum investment in both schemes is Pounds 1,000.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER AIDE DESCRIBES POINDEXTER'S MISTRUST OF CONGRESS MEMBERS;  </P> <P> IRAN-CONTRA: THE TRIAL TESTIMONY COMES AS THE PROSECUTION BEGINS TO WRAP UP ITS  CASE AGAINST THE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER.  </P> <P> Former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, on trial in federal court  on charges of obstructing and lying to Congress during the Iran-Contra affair,  was described by a former aide Friday as a bureaucrat who did not trust  congressmen and did not like to deal with them.  </P> <P> "Adm. Poindexter was skeptical of the Congress," testified Ronald Sable, the  official on Poindexter's staff who handled the National Security Council's  relations with Congress. "He had not had anything to do with them, and that  remained his preference. He would just as soon not deal with them. He indicated  he did not trust them."  </P> <P> Under cross examination, the witness acknowledged, as defense attorney Richard  Beckler put it, that Sable "had to tug him (Poindexter) along and get him a  little bit more interested in Congress." But this did not soften the image very  much of a security official in the White House who did not believe Congress  ought to pry into his secrets.  </P> <P> The description came as the prosecution began wrapping up its case. Prosecutor  Dan K. Webb said he plans to conclude Monday, with final witnesses called to  supply a few final touches.  </P> <P> The members of the jury, who listened to a hesitant and leaden Oliver L. North  testify for four straight days at the start of the trial, received a different,  far more kinetic picture of North from Sable. North organized both the sale of  arms to Iran and the diversion of profits from these sales to the Contras  fighting in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Sable described North as "someone who, when he wanted to get something done,  would get it done but might not care about how he did it."  </P> <P> "I once told Ollie," Sable went on, "if we wanted to get to the other side of a  wall, you would get there first but you might not check to see if there is a  door."  </P> <P> In reply to questions from defense attorney Beckler, Sable also described North  as someone "who occasionally misled me." As one instance, a vital part of the  case against Poindexter, Sable cited North's meeting with members of the House  Intelligence Committee in the White House Situation Room in August, 1986. Sable  and Robert Pearson, then deputy general counsel of the National Security  Council, attended the meeting.  </P> <P> Pearson, who also testified Friday, said North told the congressmen at the  meeting that, while he had met with leaders of the Contras in Central America,  he had nothing to do with arming them -- an act prohibited by Congress. "All  that he did," Pearson quoted North as telling the congressmen, "was for the  purpose of gathering information for the benefit of the President of the United  States in carrying out foreign policy."  </P> <P> The meeting has been brought up repeatedly at the trial because North testified  that he lied to the congressmen at the request of Poindexter.  </P> <P> The congressmen accepted North's account without challenging it. In fact, they  were so seduced by North's false tale that they quashed a proposed resolution  for an investigation into the activities of North. North seemed confident at  the meeting, both Sable and Pearson testified, and Poindexter appeared pleased  with the results.  </P> <P> Beckler drew many details from Pearson about the setting for North's lies.  Pearson said that the congressmen and officials had sat around the walls of the  room and around a table in the center of the White House Situation Room and  that North had occupied the seat usually reserved for the President.  </P> <P> Judge Harold H. Greene smiled at Beckler's accumulation of these details and  then remarked: "I take it Oliver North did not issue any proclamations while he  was sitting in the President's chair."  </P></p>

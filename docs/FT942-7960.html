			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Banks to press government on bid policy: Lloyds' offer for C&amp;G may spark calls for clarification of building society takeovers Some leading British banks are likely to press the government not to block agreed cash offers for other building societies if the Lloyds Bank Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester survives the legal challenge which begins in the High Court tomorrow. Banks which have expressed an interest in acquiring societies believe it would be unfair if the Lloyds deal was allowed to go ahead and ministers then changed the law to prevent a similar cash bid in future, where both organisations wanted to proceed. C&amp;G and the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, are seeking clarification from the courts about whether the transaction is allowed by the 1986 legislation governing societies. The court judgment is expected later this week. Approval for the transaction could spark other bids for societies, leading to a restructuring of the UK's financial services industry. The commission has issued guidance casting doubt on whether a third party can make payments to a society's members, and whether relatively new members are entitled to a share of the cash. But Lloyds and C&amp;G are confident of the legality of the offer, which would give individuals borrowing and investing in the society cash payments of up to Pounds 10,000 for each account. The Building Societies Association has already said that if the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal proceeds, it will call on the government to change the law to prevent offers of cash to members of less than two years' standing. However, potential bidders for societies say that the impact on future takeovers and mergers between societies and other organisations should be seen as part of the current Treasury review of the 1986 act, which was set up as part of the government's deregulation initiative. Mr John Fry, group services director at Abbey National, said it would be inequitable if the government reinstated the two-year restriction and did not at the same time look at other aspects of the legislation, such as lowering the high levels of member support needed for a merger, and increasing the accountability of a society's board to its members. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which has expressed interest in making an offer for a society, said it would be 'very unusual and unfair' if the restriction was reinstated after Lloyds had benefited. Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB chief executive, thought the government was unlikely to reinforce the two-year restriction if the courts ruled that it did not apply in the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal. 'If the deal goes ahead, I think it would be extremely difficult for other such alliances not to go ahead, albeit in a slightly different form,' he said. He added that the deal should encourage societies, as it offered a new approach to mergers in which both partners retained their identities and high levels of autonomy.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Pentland Assuming the deal to acquire Adidas goes through without a hitch, yesterday's interim results from Pentland are largely of historical interest. The company is currently between sports shoe brands, having disposed of its Reebok holding, and the Pounds 14m interest income earned in the half year is a freak result. To value the shares now investors must decide what sort of a fist Pentland can make of Adidas. Clearly one of the tricks which Pentland turned at Reebok can be repeated with Adidas. Pentland has plenty of experience buying sports shoes cheaply in the far east, and so should be able comfortably to improve on Adidas's poor sourcing record. There may also be efficiency gains to be had in the European operation which will further help margins. That may push Adidas margins up from just 1 per cent at present to nearer the mid-teens Nike and Reebok have managed, even though industry margins may come down as the market matures. It is less certain that the other part of the Reebok success story can be so easily reproduced. Reebok triumphed in the 1980s by capturing that vital but elusive quality for the youth fashion market, street credibility. To match that Pentland's marketing and advertising strategy must reverse Adidas's flabby brand image. It will also require money, and while some sponsorship deals may be dropped in favour of direct advertising, it would be surprising if Adidas's total marketing budget did not rise. If it works, the rewards will be substantial. But investors should remember that fashion has always been a high risk game.</p>

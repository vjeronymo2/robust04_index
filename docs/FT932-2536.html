			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM hints at move on Thorp THE prime minister yesterday strengthened expectations that the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield will be allowed to start commercial operations. Mr Major underlined the plant's value in employment and earning foreign currency. Thorp would support about 3,000 jobs, and had contracts worth Pounds 9bn, he said. But Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said that since the decision to build the plant, the economic prospects had collapsed and the threshold of safe nuclear emissions had been reduced.

The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said Monday  that the change was occasioned by both popular and scholarly  opinions, collected at public hearings and academic forums,  urging the government to rename the historic event.    On April 19, 1960, students across the country rose up  against the reputedly dictatorial and corrupt government of  President Syngman Rhee, accused of rigging the presidential  election on March 15, and succeeded in ousting Rhee.    The first South Korean president announced his resignation  on  April 26 and sought refuge in Hawaii on May 30.    The event, however, was allegedly played down by the  following governments of Presidents Pak Chong-hui, Chon Tu-hwan  and No Tae-u.    The government will consult with related ministries before  putting the revision to the regular session of the National  Assembly this September, seeking to change the event's title as  stated in laws on the privileges of patriots and veterans,  according to the ministry.    Meanwhile, the Education Ministry is looking into  designating  the event, whose title currently differs from textbook to  textbook in middle and high schools, as "the April 19  revolution," ministry officials said.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> LIST DIDN'T COVER ALL EXCEPTIONAL SCHOLARS  </P> <P> On Aug. 30, Nuestro Tiempo published a list of "Exceptional Scholars" of  Hispanic heritage from the Los Angeles and Orange counties. I was disappointed  to find that Benjamin Franklin High School in Highland Park was completely  omitted from this list.  </P> <P> There are many 1990 graduates of Franklin High School who can be considered  "Exceptional Scholars." To name a few, Beatriz Guerra will be attending Yale  University in the fall. Federico Ramirez will be attending Stanford University.  Carmen E. Ramon will be attending Occidental College. Marta Rivas and Vanessa  Soto will be attending UC Berkeley. Giselle Arteaga will be attending Pomona  College in the fall. These are only a few of the students who are "Exceptional  Scholars."  </P> <P> Veronica Jeanette Salas  </P> <P> Franklin High 1990 graduate  </P> <P> Freshman at UCLA, fall of 1990  </P> <P> EDITOR'S NOTE: The students listed were selected by the Youth Opportunities  Foundation from applications submitted by students. For information on next  year's program, graduating seniors should write to: YOF, Box 45762, Los  Angeles, CA. 90045.  </P></p>

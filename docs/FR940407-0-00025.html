			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under those definitions, OSM and Utah are required to regulate certain mine roads, based, in part, on the extent and effect of mining-related use of the road (see 56 FR at 58847&hyph;49 (1991); 55 FR 13773, 13775 (1990); 53 FR 54190, 54192 (1988)). Nothing in SMCRA or the Utah program provides for a blanket exemption of mine roads from regulation. To the contrary, jurisdiction over mine roads must be made on a case-by-case basis (see 56 FR at 58848 (1991); 55 FR 13773, 13775 (1990); 53 FR 54190, 54193 (1988)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By granting a blanket exemption to existing, unpermitted mine roads without any consideration given to the amount of their mining-related use, paragraph II.1. of the September 4, 1992, agreement would have exempted roads which, under SMCRA and the Utah program, OSM and Utah are required to regulate. Thus, paragraph II.1. is contrary to SMCRA and the Utah program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the enforcement of paragraph II.1. of the September 4, 1992, agreement offends an essential purpose of SMCRA and the Utah program (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mississippi Valley <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 364 U.S. at 563). One of SMCRA's essential purposes is ``to protect the environment and ensure the reclamation of mined areas'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Daniel Brothers Coal Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 2 IBSMA 45, 49 (1980); see also section 102(a) of SMCRA). Also, as U.C.A. 40&hyph;10&hyph;2(3) indicates, one of the purposes of the Utah program is to ``[a]ssure that surface coal mining operations are conducted so as to protect the environment.'' Given the significant environmental harm that can result from unregulated mine access and haul roads, these statutory purposes cannot be fully met by an agreement, such as paragraph II.1., to grant an unauthorized regulatory exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons given above, paragraph II.1. of the September 4, 1992, agreement is contrary to SMCRA and the Utah program, and because its enforcement would offend an essential purpose of these laws it is unenforceable. Accordingly, paragraph II.1. must not be applied by OSM or Utah to any permitting or enforcement decisions in Utah. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph II.2. of the September 4, 1992, agreement, Utah agreed to ``apply the Utah statute and rules existing on the date of permit approval'' to any permit applications pending on September 4, 1992, and to any future permit applications. In the aforementioned letter to Utah dated May 19, 1993, OSM stated that this provision is valid as long as (1) the phrase ``Utah statutes and rules'' is interpreted to mean the approved Utah State program; (2) any application of the Utah statute and rules to a permitting decision is consistent with the Department of the Interior's actions in approving or not approving such statutes and rules (see,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 56 FR 58846, November 22, 1991); and (3) the provision is not interpreted to prevent Utah or OSM from taking action subsequent to permit approval, where appropriate under the approved program (e.g., requiring a permit revision to reflect changes in applicable law). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, the Federal regulations and the Utah program must not be modified to include the specific terms of paragraphs II.1. and II.2. of the September 4, 1992, agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Basis for Submission of Utah's Proposed Amendment and the Effect of OSM's Invalidation of Provision II.1. of the September 4, 1992, Agreement on Utah's Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that OSM's May 19, 1993, letter, which notified Utah that a portion of the September 4, 1993, agreement between Utah and OSM was contrary to law and therefore not binding on OSM, constitutes an abrupt reversal of position and abdication of the agreement that forms the basis for the amendment addressed in this notice. Notwithstanding OSM's action on the agreement, the commenter requested that OSM approve the amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the commenter's inference that the agreement was the sole reason that Utah submitted the amendment to OSM. When OSM and Utah drafted the agreement, they ensured that the required amendments of the Director's decision in the November 22, 1991,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be satisfied by Utah complying with provisions I.2. b., c., and d. of the agreement. Therefore, when Utah submitted proposed definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area,'' it did so not only in accordance with provisions I.2. b., c., and d. of the agreement, but also in response to required program amendments at 30 CFR 944.16 (n) and (o) that OSM placed on the Utah program in the November 22, 1991, notice. Had OSM and Utah not entered into the agreement, Utah still would have had to submit proposed definitions to satisfy the required amendments at 30 CFR 944.16 (n) and (o). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM also disagrees with the commenter's assertion that OSM's approval of the amendment would be inconsistent with OSM's notification to Utah that a part of the agreement was contrary to law and not binding on OSM. The agreement consisted of two parts. The first part (provision I) addressed actions by Utah (1) to withdraw with prejudice its lawsuit on certain roads violations that OSM issued in Utah (provision I.1.) and (2) to withdraw a policy statement and revise its definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area'' in a manner consistent with the corresponding Federal definitions at 30 CFR 701.5 and 761.5 (provisions I.2. a., b., c., and d.). The second part (provision II.) addressed the implementation of the Federal and State statutes and regulations with respect to (1) existing roads that were not, as of September 4, 1992, previously determined to be part of an existing surface coal mining operation and required to be permitted (provision II.1.) and (2) permit applications pending Utah's approval or disapproval as of September 4, 1992 (provision II.2.). While OSM by its May 19, 1993, letter notified Utah that provision II.1. of the September 4, 1993, agreement between Utah and OSM was not binding on OSM, provisions I.1., I.2. a., b., c., and d., and II.2. remained in effect. Therefore, contrary to the commenter's statement, OSM could approve the amendment as long as Utah's proposed definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area,'' which are the subject of provisions I.2. a., b., c., and d., of the agreement, were not inconsistent with the corresponding Federal definitions at 30 CFR 701.5 and 761.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

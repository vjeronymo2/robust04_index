			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pacer Dollars 1.14m in the red DELAYS on a US Navy contract led Pacer Systems, the USM-traded defence electronics company based in Massachusetts, to report a pre-tax loss. Losses for the year to end-December totalled Dollars 1.14m (Pounds 640,000). compared with Dollars 1.56m profit last time. Mr John Rennie, chairman, said Pacer lost Dollars 3m on a fixed price US navy contract for an acoustic signal generator, a device which can be used to simulate underwater acoustics or as part of an anti-submarine system. Due for delivery last year, the first device was not supplied until earlier this month. Turnover slipped 10 per cent to Dollars 25.2m (Dollars 27.9m). This was due to lower sales of the company's flight simulators and air data systems, chiefly used on helicopters such as the Apache. Losses per share totalled 13 cents (earnings 8 cents). But Mr Rennie said the company's prospects remained favourable and the directors have proposed a same-again final dividend of 3.5 cents, making an unchanged total of 6.5 cents.</p>

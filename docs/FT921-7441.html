			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / F Usher advances to Pounds 0.59m FRANK USHER, the USM-quoted textile and clothing group, stemmed the downturn in profitability in the six months to November 30 and is restoring its interim dividend to 2p. The improved profitability was partly the result of tighter control of overheads and stocks. Turnover fell to Pounds 7.61m (Pounds 8.19m) but the pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 585,000. That compared with Pounds 505,000 last time and with Pounds 270,000 in the preceding six months. Mr Christopher Norland, chairman, said the main effect of recession in the UK was felt in trading with boutiques, whereas sales to stores groups and exports were satisfactory. Based on orders for the spring/summer 1992 collections, he looked forward to a return in the second half to levels of profitability experienced prior to last year's downturn in profits - from Pounds 1.39m to Pounds 775,000. That was seen as 'a considerable achievement against the background of the clothing industry' and justified restoring the interim dividend to 2p, after last year's cut to 1.5p. Earnings per share were 5.7p (4.7p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- Two morning  Persian-language dailies here Wednesday [12 January]  editorialized on the recent 6 + 2 meeting in Damascus with one  interpreting Syria's participation as a blow to its political  dignity and the other stressing that regional security can be  safeguarded only by the Persian Gulf littoral states.    Commenting on the failure of the meeting, held early this  week, to achieve a result, the daily `ABRAR' said that the  Syrians accepted to attend the 6 + 2 due to their expanded  disputes with Baghdad regime.    The paper draw the attention of the Syrian statemen to the  fact that since the U.S. looks at 6 + 2 as a `club' for those  favoring the compromise trend in the Middle East, Syria's  particiaption in such a group might be interpreted as a blow to  the political dignity of an independent progressive country.    If the U.S. will be able to join Damascus to Tel Aviv there  would be no problem, otherwise, said the paper in conlusion,  Syria would have no place among the other seven countries.    Commenting on the same subject `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' referred  to the role that Egypt played in the meeting and said Cairo did  not waste any attempt to sow seeds of suspicion over the future  of Iran's cooperation with regional countries.    "It has always tried to frustrate any proper effort for  regional cooperation by creating a state of pessimism and  concern among the regional states."    As far as Iran is concerned, added the daily, the Islamic  republic has never interfered in internal affairs or  decision-making of its arab or other neighboring countries and  would never do so in future.    However, the article noted, Cairo was looking for its own  interests in the "troubled waters of the Persian Gulf" and in  creating tension in Iran's relations with the Persian Gulf  Cooperation Council (P)GCC.    The article pointed to the fact that Egypt, due to its  severe  security crisis and lack of public support, was not able to help  the (P)GCC to maintain regional security and stability.    Time has proven that regional security should be only  maintained by the region's littoral states and any attempt to  neglect such a concrete reality would only ruin "golden  opportunities" for preserving regional security and might, it  concluded.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Steak losses at Pounds 137,000 Aberdeen Steak Houses Group, the restaurant operator, reduced pre-tax losses for the six months to June 30 from Pounds 197,000 to Pounds 137,000. After a good start to the year, a combination of hot weather, the World Cup and the beginning of the rail strikes in May and June reduced turnover and profitability to below expected levels, directors stated. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 6.16m to Pounds 6.76m. As turnover is traditionally seasonal, the company said it was 'hopeful' of the year-end outcome. Losses per share came out at 1.2p (1.8p).</p>

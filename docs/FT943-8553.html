			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / German mobile phone licence blocked A German court prevented the federal government from awarding the first in-flight mobile telephone licence to Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned telecommunications monopoly. The decision, late on Monday, will be seen as a setback for the government, which is believed to be trying to help maximise Deutsche Telekom's market position ahead of its partial privatisation, scheduled for early 1996. It followed an injunction filed last week by Mercury, the British-based telephone network, and Mannesmann, the German engineering conglomerate, in which both had questioned the internal procedures used by the postal ministry to award licences. The ministry had awarded the licence last June to DeTeMobil, the mobile telephone division of Deutsche Telekom, which pledged to invest more than DM15m (Pounds 6.26m) in establishing a country-wide in-flight mobile telephone system. An official at the postal ministry said the award was made on the basis of a points system, with DeTeMobil scoring higher than Mercury or Mannesmann, the only other bidders. Under German legislation the government is allowed to award licences through a lottery system when two or more bids are considered equal. But in the case of DeTeMobil, no lottery had taken place even though the Cologne Administrative Court yesterday said it considered the bids from Mercury and Mannesmann to have been just as competitive as DeTeMobil. Mercury and Mannesmann had filed separate injunctions last week after they had received information that the postal ministry had set out internal guidelines which had not been available to either company when they originally submitted their bids. 'We had not questioned the procedures and terms for applying for the licence when they were issued earlier this year,' a Mercury spokesman said. 'Rather, it was how the decision was taken internally (in the postal ministry) once the evaluations had been made which we questioned.' He said Mercury had been granted permission by the postal ministry to see those guidelines two weeks ago, and nearly six weeks after DeTeMobil had been awarded the licence. The decision by the court means that the government must either decide to delay issuing the licences, review the entire procedure for awards, or else challenge the court's decision. However, a Mercury spokesman said: 'It is very likely that a lottery will be held because the scoring of the three companies was so close.' Meanwhile, Mercury claims to have successfully completed trials for providing ground support for an in-flight mobile telephone network for Lufthansa, Germany's national airline.</p>

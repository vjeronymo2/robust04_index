			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  BILL AIMS AT ASSAULTS AGAINST TEACHERS  </P> <P> Attacks against two San Fernando Valley teachers this month prompted a bill  introduced Friday in Sacramento that would increase penalties for assaults on  classroom teachers and would require districts such as Los Angeles to spend  more money on school security.  </P> <P> The bill, named the Teacher Protection Act of 1989 by its author Sen. Alan  Robbins (D-Van Nuys), would also require that teachers be warned about students  in their classes who have criminal records.  </P> <P> The bill was introduced because of "a wave of teacher-related violence" in the  Los Angeles Unified School District, Robbins said at a press conference Friday.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, a Sylmar Junior High School English teacher was stabbed  during class by one of her students and a popular Grant High School teacher was  shot and killed in front of his Sherman Oaks home by an unknown assassin.  </P></p>

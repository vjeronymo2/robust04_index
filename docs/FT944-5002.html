			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Technology: Sound of silence / A look at how technicians are making turboprop aircraft quieter by creating noise of their own Travellers on commuter airlines should soon be able to work or snooze more easily after installation of cabin noise reduction systems in turboprop aircraft. The technology applies the theory of active noise cancellation (ANC) to reduce the high levels of cabin noise in propeller-driven aircraft. A vast range of potential applications - from quelling vehicle vibration and taming refrigerator rattle, to muffling machinery - has attracted high-tech start-ups and mainstream manufacturers alike. The ANC theory was developed 60 years ago, but immature technology and prohibitive costs killed early development projects. Now it is finally moving out of the lab and on to its commercial feet. The systems use electronics to detect an unwanted sound and then generate a second sound wave of equal frequency but different phase (where the sound wave's troughs coincide with the peaks instead of each other). The two waves combined tend to cancel each other out, leaving a much reduced sound. While the theory is simple, implementation is not, particularly in real applications where noise is a cocktail of different, changing frequencies. The cabin quieting system developed by Ultra Electronics of the UK took four years of testing before its introduction this year on Saab commuter aircraft. The dominant noise in a turboprop aircraft comes from the spinning propellers vibrating the fuselage, and varies with engine speed. The ANC system, by monitoring the engine speed, knows in advance the main frequency  -the one responsible for the most noise - to cancel. Inside the cabin of the 50-seater Saab 2000, 72 microphones measure the noise at different locations and feed a control unit. Here, powerful digital signal processor (DSP) microchips and patented algorithms generate mirror-image signals which are fed to 36 loudspeakers concealed in the cabin trim. According to Ultra Electronics, the result is a 12 decibel, or 75 per cent, reduction in noise at the main frequency at high speed. Conversation is not affected by the noise reduction because the system reduces sound only at low frequencies, such as that generated by the engine. High frequencies are better suppressed using cheaper passive techniques such as sound-absorbent materials, which function poorly at low frequencies. Saab Aircraft, Saab's aircraft-making division, is the first to fit the cabin quieting system as standard. De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker, and Avions de Transport Regional, the Franco-Italian consortium, plan to follow. The system costs Dollars 70,000-Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 44,000-Pounds 63,800) to install, according to craft size. Like many regional airlines, Crossair, the Swiss regional carrier, liked the lower operating costs of turboprops over jets, but not their noisy reputation. Without ANC, turboprops can generate an intrusive 85dB of noise against 78dB for a jet. (US federal law sets a workplace noise limit of 90dB for an eight-hour working day). Cabin quieting is one of the applications of ANC made feasible by the tumbling cost of DSP microchips. 'The first DSP chips in the 1980s cost Dollars 1,500 but replaced a Dollars 700,000 minicomputer. Today, those chips cost Dollars 2-Dollars 3,' says Steve Dickmann, president of Digisonix, a US pioneer of ANC. The company says it sees its best markets for ANC application in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. Conventional passive silencers cut the noise spectrum or 'white noise' of fans in ducts. But they cut high frequency noise more than low frequencies, leaving a rumble. Digisonix sells a duct silencer that uses ANC to cut more evenly across the frequency spectrum. Each active silencer costs from Dollars 300 to Dollars 3,000 depending on the size of the system. It can also reduce energy costs over conventional passive silencers. These reduce noise by slowing the air flow in ventilator shafts with 'baffles' or obstacles. More powerful fans are needed to propel the air through shafts when baffles are used to cut noise. Active noise reduction eliminates the need for baffles. In one 500,000sq ft building in Florida, Digisonix silencers yield energy savings of Dollars 50,000 a year, according to Dickmann. Domestic appliances and vehicles, which once seemed the most promising areas for ANC, have proved two of the toughest markets. Whirlpool, the US white goods manufacturer, developed a simple system to reduce the worst vibration in a dishwasher. But the company stopped development because it believed the cost was prohibitively high in a price-sensitive sector. 'The home appliances business is very cost-driven,' says Luigi Coglio, head of sound research at the company's development centre in Italy. Electrolux, the Swedish group, tested ANC on all its products. Its market research indicated that customers were willing to pay extra for a quieter cooker hood fan, but not necessarily for a quieter dishwasher. But even for cooker hoods, the market appears limited because of the extra cost - about Dollars 100 on the retail price. Nonetheless, the company believes there is a market at the top of the range, and it will use ANC technology in a new hood to go on the market soon. Three years ago, Nissan unveiled the first production car with ANC. The Bluebird model was sold only in Japan, however, and other car makers that tested ANC felt that the technology was immature or too expensive. 'They believe that noise should be controlled by more conventional means (such as padding or better design),' says Dave Quinn, chief engineer with Lotus Engineering, the research arm of Lotus Cars. 'Tomorrow's models will not be so easy to quieten,' says Quinn. Their lightweight materials and lighter engines cut fuel consumption but are less effective at deadening engine noise. Adding 10kg of padding conflicts with the aim of reducing weight, so carmakers are dusting off ANC plans. Elesa, a joint venture between Fiat-owned components group Magneti Marelli and Noise Cancellation Technologies of the US, claims a bright future for its car cabin silencing product. This works like the aircraft system and shares the car's hi-fi speakers, trimming the production cost to about Dollars 75. The product has been tested on 20 models and clocked up 20,000 km. It cuts cabin noise by around 50 per cent at cruising speeds, the company says. Vittorio Moreggia, general manager, says the system will be adopted by a European car maker in 1996. Elesa has also developed an engine mount to cut cab vibrations and an exhaust silencer. The latter is furthest from production, but tightening legislation on vehicle pass-by noise is kindling interest, particularly from truck makers.</p>

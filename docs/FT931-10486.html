			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Enterprise Oil sells North Sea interests to Japan for Dollars 106m ENTERPRISE Oil, the independent UK oil exploration and production company, has sold interests in three North Sea oilfields to C. Itoh Energy Development, a unit of Japan's Itochu Corporation, the diversified trading house, for Dollars 106m (Pounds 70m) in cash. 'We are essentially looking to maintain the balance between our financial and our physical assets and we will be reinvesting the proceeds from the sale,' said Mr John Walmsley, finance director at Enterprise Oil. Last year, Enterprise raised Pounds 240m as part of a share offering in the US which, combined with yesterday's deal, will reduce the company's debt-to-equity ratio to just over 40 per cent. Mr Simon Flowers, industry analyst at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh, estimates the company should gain Pounds 25m in net profit from the deal. This could increase net income for last year to Pounds 82m or 18.2p a share from a previously-estimated level of 12p to 13p a share. Mr Flowers said the deal made the difference between a covered and uncovered dividend for 1992, but Mr Walmsley rejected this. Enterprise is committed to paying a dividend of 15.75p a share. The assets include Enterprise's interests in Hudson, Hutton and North West Hutton where production is currently around 5,000 barrels a day (b/d) and will rise to 11,000 b/d by the end of the decade. Mr Walmsley said the deal represented 'full value' for the Enterprise assets. He said there was a sign of a selective pick-up in the market for North Sea interests after the dearth of activity in the last year. 'It is a market sharply defined by quality of assets,' he said. Lasmo, another UK exploration and production company last week sold assets for Pounds 126.5m. 'There are not so many cash buyers around as there were in 1988 to 1990, but these deals are encouraging for exploration companies,' said Mr Flowers. CIECO, a newly-formed company which is 20 per cent owned by Japan's Taiyo Oil Corporation, becomes only the second Japanese company to own a producing asset in the North Sea. Lex, Page 18</p>

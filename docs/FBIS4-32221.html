			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 22 June within its  regular 8-minute newscast carries several reports on the  situation in the republic.    A report by the 3rd Corps Press Center, read by an  unidentified correspondent, states that "last night about  midnight, an attack began on the defense lines of (?Zavidovici)  units in the region of (Sjenokos). After a battle lasting one  hour, our fighters repelled a chetnik attempt to break through,  inflicting great losses on them." The report further states  that "the aggressor is now shelling Zavidovici districts with  mortars and howitzers and the actual town of Zavidovici has been  showered with (?cluster) bombs. As a result of the shelling, 19  civilians have been wounded, eight of them seriously, and there  are many children among them. With equal ferocity, the  chetniks pounded the Tesanj defenders' positions this morning.  At unequal intervals they used howitzer and tank shells to  pound (?Tesanj), [name indistinct], Kalosevici, [name  indistinct], Matuzici, and Ularice. More than 30 shells have  fallen on the town of Tesanj alone. Regrouping and the bringing  in of chetnik reinforcements to the Tesanj-Doboj front has been  observed."    Hamiz Deronjic reports that "last night, the strongest  attacks by the Serbian aggressor on defense positions since the  latest truce were carried out on the Brcko front." Deronjic  also says that "during the night, chetnik mortars, together with  antiaircraft machine-guns and antiaircraft artillery were  discharged on (Ljubici) while the central section of Brcko  defense was being pounded by Broving guns, submachine-guns, and  portable rocket launchers." Finally, Deronjic says that "this  morning, the situation at the Brcko front is marked by  provocations and intensive activity by enemy snipers,  particularly along the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line."    Mirza Sadikovic reports from the Bihac region that "last  night and this morning confirmed Karadzic's [word indistinct]  that a Gorazde-type situation could be repeated in the Bihac  region. Namely, the amassing of chetnik forces on the (Veliki)  [name indistinct) Grmusko-Srbljansko Plateau and Grabez line has  continued. About 1,500 enemy soldiers have already arrived on  [words indistinct] with heavy artillery and armored vehicles."</p>

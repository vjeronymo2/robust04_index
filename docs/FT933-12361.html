			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: A diet too rich for the digestion / Analysis of the rapid expansion and demise of Conder Group CASH flow difficulties are hampering the efforts of small companies to beat recession. That is the considered opinion of Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, president of the British Chamber of Commerce, who on BBC's Today programme earlier this week called on larger companies to ease the cash squeeze on their smaller brethren by paying bills on time. As a former chairman of the specialist builder, Conder Group, which went into liquidation just last week, he is particularly well-placed to know about cash flow difficulties. The demise of Conder went largely unremarked in the City. It seemed like just another construction company in a raft of builders to go under. However, for Conder's employees - who held 26 per cent of the company through the staff trust, which eventually forced Mr Stewart-Smith's resignation - the company's failure after 45 years prompted questions over the group's management and corporate advice which still remain unanswered. A report compiled at the beginning of this year by administrative receivers, Price Waterhouse, pinpointed factors behind Conder's demise which many had foreseen four years earlier. Specific reference was made to losses incurred in companies acquired during 1988 and 1989, when Mr Stewart-Smith was chairman. The receivers also stated that the company had been adversely affected by the severe economic downturn. However, observers have claimed that Conder - which once boasted Britain's leading position in steel fabricated buildings  -might have survived recession had it not been for the acquisition binge which drained it of cash and resources. Events at the company in the early 1990s appear to support this view. According to a board memo of September 1992, the seven companies purchased between 1988 and 1990 had cost Conder roughly Pounds 74m in purchase price and subsequent losses. Mr Stewart-Smith, who declined to discuss Conder's demise, joined Conder at the invitation of its former chairman and co-founder, Mr Robin Cole, in June 1987. A former main board director of P&amp;O Steam Navigation and chairman of P&amp;O Cruises, he seemed the ideal candidate to revive the company following its disastrous foray into the Iraqi market. The company's bitter experience there, where it incurred heavy losses in the mid-1980s, was reflected in its share price of about 36p, against a flotation price of about 90p. The City-smart Mr Stewart-Smith could not have been more different from the management which had run Conder for 40 years. He set about polishing up the company's image in the Square Mile by appointing advisers such as Cazenove, Morgan Grenfell and KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock. The board was also streamlined, removing long-serving operational directors in favour of faces more familiar to the City such as Sir John Stanley, a former minister of state for Northern Ireland. Then, in 1988, Conder began a rapid expansion programme, spending almost Pounds 21m on seven acquisitions in two years. Fund managers and analysts warmed to the more dynamic approach and the shares rose to a peak of 228p in 1989, for a market capitalisation of Pounds 94m. Insiders were less enthusiastic about the new strategy, particularly the Pounds 2m purchase of Elemeta, a specialised wall-cladding group with prestigious contracts for London's Broadgate development and America Square. Employees and shareholders warned Mr Stewart-Smith about the potential dangers. Conder, with turnover of about Pounds 130m, was used to smaller contracts than those taken on by the loss-making Elemeta, they said. America Square and Broadgate alone represented almost 20 per cent of Conder's turnover. Yet there was a more basic flaw in the purchase of Elemeta, which only those on the ground at Conder could really appreciate. The cladding deals negotiated by Elemeta were manufacturing contracts. 'What Conder management knew was construction,' says a former employee. Partly due to this lack of knowledge, the prices eventually agreed on the contracts were far too low. Other acquisitions followed, all of which appeared logical individually. However, there were several factors which should have prompted caution. Most purchases were for cash rather than shares. Moreover, the money came from cashflow or borrowings. Conder made no rights issues. In 1990, Conder had sales of roughly Pounds 290m while shareholders' funds had fallen from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 7.6m. Net debt of Pounds 20m left an unhealthy level of gearing. Furthermore, former employees say, some of the cash funding these acquisitions came in part from the positive cash flow arising on contracts. This left little margin for error when the company suffered both a sudden decline in turnover - which drained cash - and delays on Elemeta's contracts. Finally, and perhaps most crucially, Conder did not have the management resources to deal with such rapid growth; nor with the problems presented by the acquisition of several loss-making companies. Mr Pelham, like Mr Stewart-Smith a product of the McKinsey school of management consultants, had about 20 people reporting to him - including some of the managers of the loss-making purchases. Morale within the company rapidly deteriorated. Representatives of the staff trust were unhappy as their relationship with the revamped board became more difficult. Accustomed to an operationally-based management, the staff felt that many of their questions and anxieties were not being being dealt with. The trust was also aware that Conder had been in discussions with bankers from August 1990. This was when the group realised that losses on Elemeta's contracts would hit double figures. The final figure, however, was higher than even they suspected - a total of Pounds 40m over three years, including the acquisition price. Elemeta, the rapid succession of purchases, and the collapse in the construction market had left Conder lurching from month to month. It was then that the group sought to sell some of its businesses to feed its need for cash. After Conder reported losses of Pounds 19m for 1990, against profits Pounds 10.42m in 1989, the staff trust told directors it intended to call for the resignation of Mr Stewart-Smith at the annual meeting in its role as a significant shareholder. Instead, Mr Stewart-Smith agreed to resign as chief executive, and Mr Pelham stepped down before the agm. Mr Alan Lovell, the finance director, took over as acting chief executive in June 1991. There followed a dramatic streamlining which left Conder with 1,100 employees by September 1992, compared with about 3,000 previously. The group sold six businesses and closed down six manufacturing plants in the UK and US. Yet Conder, desperate for cash, still needed to raise about Pounds 15m to continue operating. It soon became apparent, however, that the bulk of investors could ill-afford to subscribe to a rights issue. In addition to the staff trust, individual employees held 9 per cent, while the Conder Conservation Trust, an environmental charity, held 11 per cent. The Cole family held 10 per cent. The only remaining options were to sell a core business or even the whole group. Both of these routes were almost achieved, only to fail at the last minute. By last September, after 25 months of supporting the struggling group, the banks had had enough. Receivers stepped in and, within weeks, Conder's businesses were snapped up. Former employees are still bitter. The demise of one of Britain's leading specialist builders was even harder to comprehend when the final figures were announced. During the last six months of its existence, Conder had returned to profit.</p>

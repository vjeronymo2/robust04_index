			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Serbs Have Not Yet Freed UN </F> Observer"]    [Text] The Hague -- The [Netherlands] Defense Ministry  fears that Major Van Baal, who has been missing since last  Monday [18 April], is being held hostage by the Bosnian Serbs  and will not be handed over to UN Headquarters for the time  being. The Bosnian Serbs are said to have laid down conditions  for the release of this Netherlander UN observer.    The Defense Ministry inferred this from a telephone  conversation with General Bastiaans, head of the UN Military  Observers (UNMO's). The conditions which the UNMO must meet are  not known. The Defense Ministry assumes that Van Baal will  serve as "bargaining chip" for better relations with the UN  troops.</p>

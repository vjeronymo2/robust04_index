			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFICARE MAKES OFFER FOR S.D. HMO  </P> <P> PacifiCare Health Systems, a health-maintenance organization based in Cypress  with more than 500,000 subscribers, announced Thursday it has made a friendly  offer to acquire certain assets of troubled Western Health Plans of San Diego,  which runs the 130,000-subscriber HMO called Greater San Diego Health Plans.  </P> <P> If consummated, the acquisition would make PacifiCare the state's third largest  HMO after Kaiser Permanente with 4 million members and HealthNet which has  about 700,000 members, PacifiCare chief financial officer Wayne Lowell said.  </P> <P> PacifiCare, which made the bid at Western's invitation, would not disclose the  amount it offered to pay for the assets including Western's membership,  provider contracts and contracts with employers. PacifiCare's subscriber base  includes 360,000 members in Southern California with the balance in Oregon,  Texas and Oklahoma.  </P> <P> The two parties will begin negotiating a deal today and thus have not executed  a definitive purchase agreement. But no other offers for Western are currently  on the table, Western's acting president Samuel Westover said Thursday. A sale  of the assets bid for by PacifiCare would mean Western's end as a going  concern, Westover said.  </P> <P> "Western came to us and said 'We'd be interested in selling the company and  here is the range of terms we were thinking would be appropriate'. We worked  with that and responded based on (the specified terms)," Lowell said.  </P> <P> Lowell added that a definitive offer would depend on Western's agreement to a  "restructuring of the delivery system," meaning a significant reduction in the  number of doctors currently providing services to Greater San Diego Health Plan  subscribers. That kind of restructuring could meet with resistance from some  shareholders since the bulk of Western's stock is held by the 1,500 San Diego  physicians who also provide services to the subscribers.  </P> <P> Western Health Plans closed up 18 cents at 69 cents per share in American Stock  Exchange trading while PacifiCare stock was unchanged in over-the-counter  trading at $26.75.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Financial Problems  </P> <P> Similar to many other HMOs in the country, Western has suffered serious  financial problems in recent years, resulting in several management  reshufflings and scaling back of operations. With shareholder equity of  negative $15.8 million as of March 31, Western has been looking for an investor  or buyer for the past year.  </P> <P> Two other acquisition deals involving Western fell through in recent months,  including a $21 million offer from a consortium of hospitals led by Sharp  HealthCare and Scripps Memorial of San Diego, as well as a $15 million offer  from Mercy Hospital of San Diego.  </P> <P> Western, whose subscribers are exclusively San Diego County residents, lost  $20.2 million over a three-year period ending last June 30. For the nine months  ended March 31, Western lost $7.1 million on revenue of $102.4 million. Over  the past year, Western has closed its HMO operations in Riverside County and  Nevada and has also closed a company-operated clinic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Healthy Reputation  </P> <P> PacifiCare, by contrast, is one of the best-managed HMOs in the country, said  Rae Alperstein, a health industry analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards  of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "They have done well at managing their costs and putting in place contracts  with doctors that leave the company at less risk than some other HMOs,"  Alperstein said.  </P> <P> PacifiCare is one of the few HMOs never to have reported a quarterly loss since  going public in 1985 and PacifiCare and FHP of Fountain Valley are industry  leaders in profitability in terms of percentage of revenue, Lowell said. For  the first six months of its fiscal year ended March 31, PacifiCare reported a  profit of $3.2 million on revenue of $284 million.  </P> <P> PacifiCare's acquisition of Western would be a way of increasing its presence  in San Diego, a market it thinks highly of, Lowell said. The company already  has 50,000 members in San Diego County, most of whom are elderly Medicare  subscribers who receive medical services through Secure Horizons, a program  administered at Rees Stealy Medical Group clinics.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer John Charles Tighe contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: Author's first novel wins Whitbread award Swing Hammer Swing], a first novel by the Glaswegian writer Jeff Torrington, was last night voted Whitbread Book of the Year. It describes a Gorbals Christmas in the late 1960s from the viewpoint of a working class family beset with problems. The style is a blend of Glaswegian dialect and Chandleresque movie-speak and is full of gallows humour. The book is published by Secker and Warburg at Pounds 7.99. Torrington, 57, has worked in factories most of his life and had only previously been published in anthologies of short stories. He takes the prize of Pounds 20,500 to add to the Pounds 2,000 he received when he was shortlisted for the Whitbread as the First Novel Award winner. It was a close contest with Victoria Glendinning's biography of Trollope (winner of the Biography Award) which had been the favourite for the prize. The other candidates were Gillian Cross for The Great Elephant Chase (Children's Novel Award); Alisdair Gray, also from Glasgow, for Poor Things (Novel Award); and Tony Harrison's book of poetry The Gaze of the Gorgon. The Duff Cooper Prize does not carry the financial muscle of Whitbread - prize money is just Pounds 500 - but it brings great prestige to the writer of the winning book, to be announced on Monday. For the first time there is a short list. It consists of Linda Colley for Britons: Forging the Nation; Peter Hennessy (Never Again); Paul Johnson (The Birth of the Modern); and Conor Cruise O'Brien (The Great Melody). The other major sponsored arts prize announced yesterday, the Barclays Young Artist Award, has been won by twins, Louise and Jane Wilson, 25, graduates of Goldsmiths' College. They share Pounds 10,000 in what is the leading award for young artists just emerging from post- graduate studies. Another Pounds 10,000 is split between eight short-listed artists, six of them women. The winning entries are on show at the Serpentine Gallery until February 28.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (13): Heavenly spirit - 'Distilling is the ideal work for monks' ONE OF the oddest businesses in Rhone Alpes must be Chartreuse Diffusion, which exists not for pure profit but to support a silent, mountain-bound, religious order. Chartreuse Diffusion's mission is to sell the fragrant green herbal liqueur of that name, and other drinks, bearing the brand of the Chartreux, or Carthusian, monastic order. With sales more or less stable at FFr33m a year, and 48 employees, Chartreuse Diffusion is based in a motley collection of warehouses and cellars in Voiron, an industrial town in the valley beneath the high mountain stronghold of the 11th century monastery of the Chartreux fathers. Majority-owned and controlled by the religious order, it employs lay workers and is run on the fathers' behalf by Mr Jean Marc Roget, a local businessman. Beyond cultivating and preparing the liqueur's 130 ingredient plants in their monastery gardens, the fathers play little part in the daily operations of the business. Two of them descend to the valley at intervals to operate the distillery, which produces 1m bottles a year. The monks receive a special dispensation to speak for business purposes, explains Mr Philip Boyer, who is in charge of external relations. 'The Chartreux rules oblige them to work for a living, unlike the mendicant monastic orders. Distilling is the ideal job for them because it demands so little labour,' Mr Boyer says. Labour-intensive storage, bottling and sales are left to the lay employees. The company sells a steady 48 per cent of its output abroad, relying on its natural mystique to attract custom. Spain is the biggest market outside France, taking 25 per cent of exports, followed by the US with 10 per cent. A recipe for a powerful green health elixir (as with Coca Cola, the recipe is a trade secret) was donated to the Chartreux fathers in 1605 by Marechal d'Estrees, the legendary French field marshal. It took the monks more than 100 years to work out how to make the remedy, 40 per cent volume. Thirty years later, in 1764, the monks produced the milder green liqueur based on the elixir, and this is their main product today. The elixir itself is still available. There is a increase in demand for it in Japan - not as a drink, but as a hair tonic, says Mr Boyer. 'It might seem odd, but there could be some active herbs in the mixture.' The fathers nearly lost what is now their main source of income when Napoleon seized the recipe in 1810, during a general round-up of all secret remedies which might prove useful to the state. He returned the document a few months later, stamped 'refused' - to the fathers' lasting relief. Chartreuse Diffusion's main customers are supermarkets and the hotel catering business. With un-monastic commercial aggressiveness it has to fight its corner against other drinks brands, Mr Boyer says. It also has a traditional direct marketing programme in local ski-resorts, where holidaymakers on their first night are offered 'Green Chaud,' the latest in Chartreuse Diffusion's menu of Chartreuse-based cocktails. 'Green Chaud' consists of hot chocolate plus a dash of the liqueur. The idea of this made the fathers laugh, says Mr Boyer, but it has gone down well with skiers.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOSE TICKET PRICES  </P> <P> In Chuck Philips' "Why Does a $30 Ticket Become a $600 Ticket?" (May 27), Brian  Harlig, president of the California Assn. of Ticket Agencies and owner of Good  Time Tickets, defends the huge markups that brokers take on concert and theater  tickets.  </P> <P> He says, "Regulating free enterprise is a ludicrous idea" and, later: "People  are not being forced to give money to ticket agencies. Nobody is holding a gun  to their head. They pay us because they like the service we provide."  </P> <P> This sounds similar to something Al Capone once said: "We provided a product,  and people liked it."  </P> <P> SPENCER GILL  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

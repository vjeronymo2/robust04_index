Shakhray, the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord  parliamentary faction, also hinted at a press conference that  Aleksandr Shokhin, a member of his party, was appointed  economics minister to replace Yegor Gaydar who had resigned.    "As far as I know the decree about this has not been signed  yet, but this will, evidently, take place today", he said.    Shakhray and Shokhin were both deputy premiers, but most  evidently will lose the status in the new composition of the  government.    On Wednesday a government spokesman said that Oleg Soskovets  will be the first deputy prime minister, while Aleksandr  Zaveryukha, Yuriy Yarov and Anatoliy Chubais will be deputy  premiers.    There are to be two first deputy premiers and three deputy  premiers in the new government, according to a presidential  decision.</p>

According to correspondent  Silva Aleluia, terrible crimes are being committed by the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party  [MPLA-PT], particularly in the Chongoroi and Caimbambo  Districts. The People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of  Angola [FAPLA] have been carying out acts of murder, violating  [words indistinct], and stealing people's goods. At least 223  people have been massacred in these areas since December last  year. Silva Aleluia learned this from Colonel Catu, from the  UNITA Armed Forces Command in the Southeastern Region.</p>

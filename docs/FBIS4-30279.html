			<p>BFN     [Text] Special Branch Police have freed a Pakistani  national, earlier suspected of involvement in a plot to harm the  Nepalese crown prince.    Pakistani Embassy First Secretary Mushtaq Haider Rizvi said  last night that Shakil Ahmad was freed without any charges  lodged against him.    The man was handed over to the embassy on Friday by the  Special Branch which said he was not involved in any plot and  had done nothing wrong.    Mr Rizvi said Ammad was expected to fly home today.    Ahmad was apprehended at the Asian Institute of Technology  [AIT] on Sunday evening after he and his friend, Mohammad Javed,  tried to enter the campus.    Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop quoted Ahmad as telling  investigators he wanted to enter the AIT to use its telephone to  make overseas call.    Javed fled in a pickup truck after AIT security guards asked  to see the pair's passport.    Khlong Luang Police, who apprehended Ahmad, immediately  handed him to the Special Branch for questioning on suspicion  that he and Javed might have been trying to harm Nepalese Crown  Prince Dhirendra Bir Bikram Shah who was taking a short  geography course at the institute at the time.    The Nepalese and Pakistani embassies have denied there was  any plot by Ahmad to harm Crown Prince Shah, who is on an  official visit to Thailand after completing his studies at AIT.</p>

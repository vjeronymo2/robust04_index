			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrovna] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- The Liberal Democratic and  Communist parties of Russia on Friday prevented the State Duma  from approving the Federal Constitutional bill, "On the  Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation" in first  reading. The bill received 247 votes "for", 51 "against", and  another 87 deputies abstained. The bill fell 53 votes short of  the two-thirds approval needed in the 450-member State Duma, the  parliament's lower chamber.    Liberal Democratic representatives said they abstained from  the vote because they believe the regulations concerning the  nomination and confirmation of candidates for positions on the  Constitutional Court need to be changed.    The bill, prepared in accordance with the Constitution,  declares that candidates are to be nominated by the president  and confirmed by the Federation Council, the upper house. The  Liberal Democratic Party would like to see the candidates  subject to nation-wide discussion.    Deputies from the Communist Party voted against the bill,  saying that the price for their support was a series of  important amendments. They think that the Constitutional Court  should have the power to independently raise the most important  issues, that the State Duma should be able to propose court  candidates to the president, that judges should be limited to  ten years of service on the country's highest court, and that  all the court's current judges should be re-elected to the  expanded Constitutional Court.    The Communists' demands would automatically necessitate a  constitutional amendment, since they contradict the basic law,  Deputy Chairman of the Duma Mikhail Mitikov pointed out.    The State Duma committee on legislation and judical-legal  reform has been ordered to continue work on the bill. Committee  Chairman Vladimir Isakov announced that there is no "tragedy" in  the fact that the document, which has already been agreed upon  by all the branches of power and is supported by a majority of  the Duma deputies, will have to be refined some more. He  expressed his assurance that the Duma would be able to reach an  agreement.</p>

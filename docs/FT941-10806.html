			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Lecturers plan one-day strikes Natfhe, the union for further education college lecturers, yesterday decided, following a ballot, to hold one-day strikes over the introduction of new contracts. The decision was attacked by further education colleges, which described the ballot turnout as 'particularly poor'. They said only 58 per cent of union members had taken part and the vote in favour of action had represented less than 40 per cent of the union's total membership.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Apr (MENA)--The Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations resumed today with the objective of implementing  the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The Palestinian side to the talks  is chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat's political adviser, and the Israeli side by General  Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff.    Dr. Sha'th affirmed that the negotiators will discuss during  their meeting today the same subjects they started discussing  yesterday and on which they made no progress.    Palestinian sources have affirmed to MENA that the two sides  are trying to overcome the big obstacles before the  negotiations, especially in the framework of the two committees,  the Security Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee.  Foremost of these issues is legal jurisdiction over the Gaza  Strip and the Jericho area, as well as control over the  crossings and the border points and the release of the  Palestinian detainees who are estimated to be around 10,400  people, according to the statistics of the International Red  Cross.    Palestinian sources clarified that the Palestinian  negotiators insist that all Palestinian detainees should be  released, irrespective of their political affiliation. The  objective is to guarantee that no split takes place inside the  Palestinian ranks. On the other hand, the Israeli side insists  on not releasing any of the Hamas members since some of its  members recently carried out some suicide attacks on Israelis.    The sources said that the Palestinian-Israeli Civilian  Affairs Committee will today discuss the subject of contacts in  the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, in addition to providing  the Palestinian side with a number of wavelengths and  frequencies to be used by the police and other services.    The sources pointed out that in the case where the deep  differences between the two sides continue over many basic  issues, the leaderships of the two sides will have to intervene  to rescue the negotiations from collapse.</p>

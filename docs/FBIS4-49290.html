			<p>BFN     [Text] The Guangdong Public Security Department held a  meeting for secretaries of discipline inspection committees of  public security bureaus of all cities in the province from 26 to  28 April to seriously sum up and exchange recent experiences  among all public security organs in the province to launch an  anticorruption drive and to make arrangements for work in this  respect in the future. Chen Shaoji, a member of the Standing  Committee of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and director  of the provincial public security department, emphasized at the  closing session this afternoon that leading cadres in public  security organs at all levels should take the lead in setting an  example in diligently and honestly carrying out official duties.  Chen Shaoji also urged leading cadres, especially the  number-one men, in public security organs at all levels to  strengthen their sense of democratic supervision and to  consciously accept supervision from all quarters. They should  strengthen their sense of organization and discipline and should  strictly enforce orders and prohibitions so that the combat  effectiveness of public security organs will be expressed among  leading cadres first of all.</p>

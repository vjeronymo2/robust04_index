			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (11): Look for discount at the new 5-stars - Istanbul: signposts for the visitor It may seem a perverse complaint, but older residents of Istanbul moan not at the proliferation of English in hotel and restaurant hoardings, but at the fact that foreign words are now spelled correctly. A disappearing pleasure of Istanbul life is figuring out the names of establishments from a French transliterated into Turkish. Time was, it was komilfo (read 'comme il faut') to take tea and pastries in Markiz (read 'Marquise') before spending a night on the town at the Foliberjer (no prizes). Nowadays, Istanbul sports any number of orthographically correct international chains, from McDonalds to the Mvenpick Hotel, designed to lull the international traveller. There is some good in all this. The danger of a city with Istanbul's history and skyline being turned into the proverbial airport lounge remains remote. The new wave of 5-star hotels and an immediate glut of empty beds means that the executive traveller at least can hold out for a competitive corporate discount. Location, too, is relatively important in a city where the traffic is designed to ensure you are least 20 minutes late for an appointment. A new Holiday Inn near the Ataky Marina is not on top of the airport, but near enough for an early morning flight. The Mvenpick is useful for anyone who needs to be near the new business district in Maslak on the upper road to the Bosphorus. The Hotel Merit Antique is in the historic city. Within the last five years, the Swiss Hotel (best health club), the Ciraan Palace (best Bosphorus views), the Conrad and the Hyatt (tennis court and good summer pool) have opened up in the more traditional commercial centre. The other advantage of the grand hotel is that it provides an acceptable place to entertain. However anxious you may be for an authentic Turkish experience, your opposite number would almost certainly prefer to taken to the new Italian restaurant at the Hyatt or the Japanese restaurant at the Swiss. The dining-room of the Divan Hotel is still rated for Turkish cuisine. If you must see a belly dancer, then the Show Orientale at the Conrad's Manzara is as good a place as any. Istanbul is desperately short of the good small hotel. However, with a little bit of nerve you can actually stay somewhere more exotic and still catch your flight home. Few businessman frequent the Hidiv Kasri (built as the Egyptian Khalif's summer palace) in Ubuklu on the Asian side of city. It is, however, very near the exit of the second Bosphorus bridge. This is in turn makes it convenient both for the TEM peripheral highway to the airport and the industrial suburbs on the Ankara highway. The building itself is a model of art noveau, and is set in a remote garden over the Bosphorus. One day, the hotel's handsome dining-room will get the chef it deserves and be declared the best small hotel, not exactly in Europe, but just outside. Another useful alternative is the Kariye Hotel, on the outskirts of the historic city. This gives it a straightish run to the airport without traversing the city traffic. It is a good base for someone who has a couple of hours to set aside for slightly more adventurous sight seeing. It is next door to St Saviour in Chora, a museum of wonderful Byzantine frescos and mosaics, as well as a short walk from the highly distinctive Mihrimah mosque  -built in the 16th century by the architect Sinan for the daughter of Suleyman the Magnificent. Also nearby are the Theodosian city walls, including the one section that has not yet been destroyed by the current programme of restoration. The Green House (Yesil Konak) is useful for first-time visitors who want to stay in the shadow of the Blue Mosque. It is run by the Turkish Touring Club, which has a policy of converting historical properties like the nearby Aya Sofia Pensions. There are now several private hotels in the same mould. The Ibrahim Pasha Hotel, on the Hippodrome Square, has small rooms, but a pleasant family-like atmosphere. If you've seem the principal sights, then take the walk down past the classical Sokullu Mehmet Pasha Mosque to the 6th century Church of St Sergius and Bachus (also called the 'small' Aya Sofia Mosque). Alternatively, stroll on along the Golden Horn from the wonderfully tiled Rustem Pasha Mosque to the Spice Market to pick up pistachios (even reasonably priced caviar) to take home. A final travel up-date. The Turkish foreign ministry has decided to avenge itself on all those countries that impose visas for Turkish nationals. Until recently, British people had to queue for a visa before joining the line to get their passport stamp. Now they will be joined by Americans and most Europeans as well.</p>

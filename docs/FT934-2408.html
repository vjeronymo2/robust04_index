			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / London utility dividend rises 32% London Electricity yesterday announced an increase in its interim dividend which at 32 per cent was well ahead of any other regional electricity company. London's increase reflects the adoption of a policy to pay a third of the total dividend at the half-way stage. Other electricity distributors tend to aim for 30 per cent. Analysts increased their dividend forecasts for the full year marginally to about 22.2p, after an interim rise from 5.6p to 7.4p. Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said the move to a one-third, two-thirds split in dividend payouts was logical in view of a change in the company's business portfolio. Recently negotiated coal contracts meant the supply business was close to breaking even in the first half of the year. It had reported substantial losses. The withdrawal from retailing and acquisition of BAA's airport distribution network business for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted also affected the balance between the two halves. In the six months to September 30, London made pre-tax profits of Pounds 69.9m, against Pounds 52m, restated to take account of the new coal contracts. Turnover on continuing operations was marginally down from Pounds 584.3m to Pounds 581.6m. Earnings per share rose 36 per cent to 24p from 17.7p. Distribution profits, up from Pounds 53.8m to Pounds 61.6m, were helped by a 1 per cent increase in sales and by cost cuts. Mr Alan Towers, finance director, said lower than expected increases in inflation and one-off payments to customers in the autumn meant there would be no significant increase in distribution revenues for the whole year. Mr Urwin said a 1.8 per cent growth in commercial volumes was the first significant increase for 18 months. Operating costs for the distribution and supply businesses were Pounds 3.7m down at Pounds 112m. London marginally failed to join the regional power companies that have become cash positive at the end of the first half. London has appointed Mr Michael Kersey, chief executive of an Australian subsidiary of AMEC, as energy services director, and Mr Andrew Robertson, assistant secretary of Kingfisher, as company secretary.

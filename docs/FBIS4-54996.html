			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dj. Palcevic: "Brilliant Victory in Gorazde"] </F>   [Text] Uzice -- An interview with Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic, was published in the Labor Day  edition of VESTI in Uzice. Asked by Vitomir Tomic, the news  editor of VESTI, what the next steps of the Srpska republic or  their enemies were, Karadzic answered:    "Our steps will include strengthening our positions and  lines. We shall prepare ourselves for defense. As far as the  steps of our enemies are concerned, they will start an offensive  from a protected area, such as Tuzla or Bihac, or, for example,  an attack against the Serbian corridor. We shall defend  ourselves for a time, and then we shall openly threaten them  with a counteroffensive, as was the case with Gorazde. If we  start a counteroffensive, the international community will mourn  the Muslims. They, on the other hand, will complain and ask the  whole world to save them and create a state for them. The  victory in Gorazde is a brilliant victory for our army and our  people. Based on the Gorazde crisis, in which we showed our  superiority, the world must conclude that quick steps toward  peace have to be taken. It seems to me that the value of this  victory lies in the fact that we succeeded in showing the world  that the Muslims are not able to conquer new territories. If  the United States gets involved, it will become one of the  warring factions, just as it was in the Vietnam war. The world  has to decide whether it is more important to help the Muslims  or to establish peace."    As for the immediate and long-term aims of the Srpska  republic, its leader Karadzic said that the immediate aims were  to defend the borders and obtain recognition, and that the  long-term aim was to become a part of Serbia.    "We do not want to establish a Serbian federation. We think  that a future Serbian state has to be unitary. It should  consist of districts and should never again enter such a  federation as could put its existence at stake. The present  leadership and this generation of the people in the republic of  Srpska has absolutely no inclination toward autonomy. We want  to be Serbia. It can happen that the republic of Srpska is  independent for a time, but it will be in a federation with  Serbia. This only because the international community cannot  accept that Serbia, accused of aggression, has won a war in  which it did not even participate. The international community  does not want to accept "a greater Serbia," as they call it. If  we are forced to live in a federation with Serbia looser than  planned for a year or two, this will not change our long-term  aim in any way.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: UP-CLOSE SHOTS UNCOVER INNER BEAUTY  </P> <P> Photographer Susan Miles doesn't just look at nature, she examines it in fine  detail. She takes an ordinary subject -- flowers -- and moves in close to give  a view that most people just pass by.  </P> <P> Twenty-four of her 11-by-14-inch Cibachrome prints are on exhibit at Rizzoli  International Bookstore &amp; Gallery at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa until  July 23.  </P> <P> Miles, 43, of Laguna Beach, became interested in photography by shooting  pictures of her children. Next, she turned to pictures of neighbors and soon  turned it into a business. Many of her pictures were black-and-white shots of  children in natural settings.  </P> <P> After five years, she put her camera down and she moved with her husband to a  small ranch in Oregon where she wanted to rear her children. They stayed there  for 11 years.  </P> <P> It was after her daughter, Janice, died two years ago of heart disease at the  age of 22 that they decided to move back to Orange County.  </P> <P> "We waited a year (after Janice died), then we decided we needed the change and  the sunshine," she said. "The rain up there is fine if you're not sad.  </P> <P> "It was just a strange thing. My husband took a position down here and we were  wrapping things up with our home up there. I drove down with him. While  driving, I came up with the idea for the photographs and a book with the title,  'The Heart of the Flower.'  </P> <P> "It's going to be a book about the beauty of the flowers we don't see. It went  together with Jan dying of heart disease. At her memorial service the minister  said: 'She wore her beauty inside and out.' That's what we put on her marker at  the cemetery. It was very true of her. It just fit together. It went together."  </P> <P> Miles has been shooting close-ups of flowers for the book since August. She  learned to make Cibachrome prints at Saddleback College under the direction of  teacher Jerry Burchfield. After the Costa Mesa exhibition her work will be  displayed in three galleries in Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> Miles' 11-by-14-inch prints are museum matted and sell for $200. Her pictures  were shot in a variety of places from her garden to local botanical gardens.  The flowers include magnolias, irises, cactus flowers, orchids and nasturtiums.  </P> <P> "I want to capture the inner beauty," Miles said.  </P></p>

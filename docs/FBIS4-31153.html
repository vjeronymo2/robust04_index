			<p>BFN     [Text] At a meeting that lasted one-and-a-half hours,  Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and minister of finance,  presented Michael Deppler, the chairman of the IMF delegation,  with Poland's economic strategy.    Let us recall that the IMF delegation has been in Poland on  a  two-week visit. The aim of the mission is to work out a new  annual agreement with the fund. Following the meeting, Deputy  Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said:    [Begin recording] [Kolodko] We have complete unanimity here  that such a strategy was missing in the past few years, and the  fund will, I believe, accept what we propose. But we would like  to agree on a number of subjects, first and foremost on the  reconstruction of the financial sector, as well as further  progress toward macroeconomic stabilization.    [Correspondent Krystyna Koziol] Sir, as new minister of  finance, will you want to introduce any changes in agreements  that we occasionally sign with the IMF?    [Kolodko] No. At the moment, we want to work out an  agreement; we are hoping that the IMF board will accept them at  the end of July or in early August. It will be the agreement  establishing certain proportions for the nearest period. We  have our own plans, and there is a question whether the fund  shares the same opinion. We have established that essentially  there is a far-reaching convergence of views. Therefore, there  is no need to introduce any changes--just to work out an  agreement the fund will accept. We will generally follow that  line, which has been marked out in the strategy for Poland and  which will be the subject of parliamentary debate on Thursday.    [Koziol] What significance will the conclusion of this new  agreement with the IMF have for Poland?    [Kolodko] First and foremost, it will put our activities in  order. It will also be confirmation by the outside world that  our line of the economic policy that Prime Minister Pawlak's  government, the Democratic Left Alliance, and the Polish Peasant  Party coalition government has been implementing is accepted by  international financial circles. It will also be an extra  encouragement for additional influx of investment from private  sources, which we are keen to obtain because our strategy  envisages that we obtain a maximum of these resources. Finally,  it will have a concrete meaning in the sense that we will obtain  more resources from the IMF, which will help us finance certain  plans, especially those connected with the balancing of our  balance of payments in the coming period.    [Koziol] If I remember correctly, the resources we obtained  came to about $600 million. Will the new agreement--that is, if  we manage to sign it--promise a similar amount?    [Kolodko] No, the amount will be smaller, but we are already  in a different phase. Today, we do not borrow money left,  right, and center. As a result of our policies and strategies,  our economy is on a growth path, and we will borrow money abroad  only when it is really needed. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Special to the JORDAN TIMES, by Ian 'Atallah] </F>   [Text] Amman--The China Council for the Promotion of  International Trade (CCPIT) delegation ended its trip to Jordan  Thursday [3 February] indicating that it was guardedly  optimistic about prospects for enhancing future Sino-Jordanian  trade cooperation.    Delegation head Li Ping told a group of Amman World Trade  Centre members that "frankly speaking, we still don't know very  much about the Jordanian market."    The CCPIT team Thursday visited the Jordan Trade Association  (JTA), The Amman World Trade Centre (AWTC) and the Jordan Export  Development and Commerical Centres Corporation (JEDCO), where it  was addressed by Marwan 'Awad, the secretary-general of the  Ministry of Industry and Trade.    Both the members of the JTA and Mr. Awad emphasised to Mr.  Ping that Jordan wished to see greater equality in the current  trade balance between the two countries.    Although official figures vary, Jordan currently imports  from  China a little over three times in value as it exports there.    "I think that it is our responsibility as well as yours to  bridge the trade gap," Mr. 'Awad told the Chinese team.    In that area, he stated, discussions were underway between  the two countries on how to structure Jordan's repayments of  some $47 million in debts due to China from foreign aid, and  that the loans would be repaid by Jordan partly in commodities.    "Although the amount of commodities involved will be  relatively small, it will give us the chance to introduce some  of our products to the Chinese market."    Mr. Ping stated at the meeting with JTA members, however,  that "an actual balance in bilateral trade may be very difficult  to achieve."    Mr. Ping told the JORDAN TIMES that "the two countries'  economic complementarity is not very large, and Jordanian  products suitable to China are few."    "The key point, and one which we are stressing very heavily  to the Jordanians, is that they need to provide us with detailed  information and specific lists of suitable products which we  could select from. Our attitude is positive," he said, but the  bottom line regarding hard benefits of any imported Jordanian  commodities to china and their price range still had to be  adhered to.    Mr. Ping told the JORDAN TIMES that China's economy was  currently undergoing near-explosive expansion, with last year  seeing a 12 per cent economic growth rate and an overall foreign  trade increase of 18 per cent. "Last year, our total import  value reached $104 billion, a 29 per cent increase over the  previous year, so you see that we are looking for suitable  products with great urgency."    He said that China's current main needs were in the areas of  technology and infrastructure development, specifically in the  areas of air, land and sea transport and transport facilities,  telecommunications and communications network development,  energy technology and raw materials processing technology, and  modernisation of China's agricultural sector.    "All of these are top priorities for China's development.  With regard to these areas, China has great demand for import.  But the key issue is, once again, what products does Jordan  have that are suitable for our market."    At the Amman World Trade Centre, the AWTC's members told Mr.  Ping that one important area for improvement in Sino-Jordanian  commece was in the field of banking communications.    There were no direct routes of correspondence between  Jordanian and Chinese banks, and the banks from both sides had  very limited knowledge of each other, which leads to indirect  and inefficient routing of bank transaction and transfers, long  delays and added costs.    Overall, they told Mr. Ping, this present situation cramps  trade between the two countries greatly.    They suggested the establishment of a comprehensive  communications network between Jordanian and Chinese banks as  well as exchange of information between the two banking  communities.    They also suggested that the Bank of China open a major  branch office sometwhere in the Middle East.    Mr. Ping concurred with the AWTC members, saying that  banking  and its development in China had not kept pace with overall  economic growth, and that foreign banks had only recently begun  to establish branch offices in China, and on a limited scope.    Wang Yuechun, third secretary at the Chinese Embassy  commerical office in Amman, told the JORDAN TIMES that in the  future, China planned to send trade delegations to the West Bank  and Gaza Strip.    He said that China was very interested in assisting in the  rebuilding of the Palestinian economy and that China's motives  in the case were not merely economic, but political as well, as  China had long been in sympathy with the Palestinian people and  "their struggle to regain their rights and dignity."</p>

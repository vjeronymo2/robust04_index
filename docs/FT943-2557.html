			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Police forces may suffer funds blow Several police forces in England could get less money in 1995-96 than they were expecting if proposals outlined last week in a Home Office consultation document are adopted. The proposals would change the formula for allocating government funding between individual forces by taking into account new factors including population density. Among those that would lose out under the new formula are the forces in Surrey and Gloucestershire and the Metropolitan Police. Gainers would include forces in Sussex, Northumberland and Hampshire.</p>

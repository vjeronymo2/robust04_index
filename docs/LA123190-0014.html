			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: 'THE LONG WALK HOME' -- FOUR VIEWS;  </P> <P> MOVIE BRINGS TO LIFE A WORLD OF BIGOTRY IN MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT ERA  </P> <P> It was extremely disheartening to read the well-written but misguided review by  Peter Rainer and commentary by Karl Fleming (Dec. 20) on the excellent new film  "The Long Walk Home."  </P> <P> Both writers objected to what they felt was misguided historical fact. Nowhere  does this movie purport to be based on any specific incident or individual.  Rather, it opts to fictionalize a story that brings to life the pool of  unexhausted bigotry in Montgomery during the 1955 bus boycott.  </P> <P> Fleming actually seems so bitter that the story told in the film is not the one  he personally recalls from his old journalism days at Newsweek that he is  totally unable to grasp what a compelling drama this is to an audience without  his individual experience. If critics wish to judge a movie based entirely on  historical accuracy, they should in all fairness stick to reviewing documentary  forms of filmmaking.  </P> <P> I did not feel that the whites in "The Long Walk Home" were candy-coated or  sympathetic. They were portrayed as scared, narrow-minded and soulless. Even  the character of Mrs. Thompson displayed all of these emotions and behaviors at  times, and in the best of moments she was behaving as any decent human being  should -- nothing more. Rising above others' prejudices does not create a hero,  it simply shows an individual with understanding and compassion.  </P> <P> I hope that The Times' articles do not turn people away from this film. Like  most young Americans, I was reminded by "The Long Walk Home" of a time in our  country's history, shortly before I was born, that I am often negligent in  thinking about.  </P> <P> It is clear to see that as 1991 begins, our laws have given minorities legal  rights, but we as a nation are far from free in enjoying full human rights.  This film is not only about 1955 -- but also about the present. It is a warm,  yet strong, reminder about choices and about responsibility. That is something  to be commended and rewarded and, hopefully, something we want to encourage  others to participate in, not only in the make-believe world of film but in the  reality of our daily existence.  </P></p>

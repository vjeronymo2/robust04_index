			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Funds may create one or more additional classes of shares in the future, the terms of which will differ from the Class A, B, C, and I shares in the following respects: Any such class: (a) May bear different distribution fees and any other costs relating to implementing or amending the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for such class; (b) may bear different service fees; (c) may bear different shareholder servicing fees; <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  (d) may bear different ``Class Expenses,'' that may include any or all of the following expenses: (i) Printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (ii) Commission registration fees incurred by a specific class; (iii) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of shares; (iv) Trustee fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class; and (v) accounting expenses relating to a specific class; (e) may bear a different name or designation; (f) will have exclusive voting rights as to any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan adopted exclusively with respect to such class except as provided in condition 16 below; (g) may have different conversion features; (h) may have different exchange privileges; (i) may be sold under different sales arrangements, including selling only to a particular type of investor; and (j) may bear any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to such class and that shall be approved by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As used herein, the term ``shareholder servicing fees'' means fees and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Funds to their shareholder servicing agent for transfer agency, account maintenance or dividend disbursing functions or for administering dividend reinvestment or systematic investment plans. ``Shareholder servicing fees'' does not refer to ``service fees'' as described in Article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Any distribution arrangement of a Fund, including distribution fees, service fees, and front-end and deferred sales loads, will comply with Article III, section 26, of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. After a shareholder's Class B shares remain outstanding for a period of time, they automatically will convert to Class A shares of the same Fund at the relative net asset values of the two classes and will thereafter not be subject to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of distributions paid upon Class B shares will be treated as Class B shares and will be converted to Class A shares on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  basis with the Class B shares. The Level Load Option differs from the Deferred Option in that the Class C shares would not automatically convert to Class A shares after a specified period of time as would the Class B shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Any other class of Non-Institutional Shares (as defined below) may provide that shares in that class (the ``Purchase Class'') will, after a period of time, automatically convert into another class of shares (the ``Target Class'') on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge provided that, after conversion, the converted shares would be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee, if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and/or service fee to which the Purchase Class shares were subject prior to the conversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Any conversion of shares of one class to shares of another class is subject to the continuing availability of a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel to the effect that the conversion of shares does not constitute a taxable event under federal income tax law. Any such conversion may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is no longer available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Class I shares would be offered for purchase only by the following investors (the ``Institutional Investors''): (a) Tax-exempt retirement plans of KFS and its affiliates, and (b) the following investment advisory clients of KFS and its investment advisory affiliates that invest at least $1 million in a Fund: (1) benefit plans unaffiliated with KFS, such as qualified retirement plans (other than individual retirement accounts and self-directed retirement plans), (2) banks and insurance companies unaffiliated with KFS purchasing for their own accounts, and (3) endowment funds of non-profit organizations unaffiliated with KFS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Future classes may be offered to meet the specific investment needs of non-institutional investors (herein, such future classes together with Class A, B, and C shares are ``Non-Institutional Shares''). Other future classes, in addition to Class I shares, may be offered to meet the specific investment needs of a particular category of Institutional Investor (together with Class I shares, ``Institutional Shares''). Still other future classes may be offered to various market segments or through various types of intermediaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

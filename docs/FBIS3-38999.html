Between one-fourth and one-third of former  CDA voters find Brinkman an unapproachable figure, or are of the  opinion that he is not a good successor to Lubbers.    This finding, to the detriment, of the CDA emerges from an  election poll commissioned by DE VOLKSKRANT and carried out by  the NIPO [National Institute for Polling Public Opinion], in  conjunction with the University of Amsterdam. According to the  poll, as things stand at present, the CDA stands to lose 16  seats in the Lower Chamber. The two-day CDA party election  conference starts in Rotterdam today.    Brinkman's poor standing is apparent from the fact that  one-fifth of faithful CDA voters regard him as the weak link in  the party. Twenty-one percent of those asked cited the fact  that Brinkman is not a good successor to Lubbers as a reason not  to vote for the CDA.    The CDA's supporters rank as the third most dissatisfied  with  their party leader: However, the VVD [People's Party for  Freedom and Democracy] are more unhappy with their leader  Bolkstein, and the Center Democrats [extreme right-wing party]  rate their leader, Janmaat, even less.    On average, there is even greater dissatisfaction with  Brinkman among the former CDA voters than among the electorate  as a whole. Especially older voters (aged 55 and over) cite  Brinkman decidedly more often as a reason not to vote for the  CDA.    As the intended prime minister, too, Brinkman scores lower  among CDA voters than some other politicians. For instance, the  CDA voters have considerably greater confidence in ex-VVD leader  Wiegel as prime minister than they have in Brinkman. [passage  omitted]    Among the doubting CDA voters, D66 [Democrats 66] top  candidate Van Mierlo enjoys just as much, if not greater,  support than Brinkman. Van Mierlo emerges from the poll as the  party leader commanding the greatest confidence among the  electorate. His popularity is a major reason for the major  gains made by the D66. Only Lubbers and Wiegel command greater  confidence as prime minister than the D66 leader.    According to the poll, PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok also  commands considerably greater confidence as prime minister than  Brinkman. The newly appointed foreign minister, Van Thijn,  ranks as virtually neck-and-neck with Kok. The voters judged  him to be much better than the current number two within the  PvdA, Secretary of State Wallage.    Of all the leading politicians, VVD leader Bolkestein  commands the least confidence as prime minister among the  voters. Bolkestein even rates poorly in liberal circles.  One-fifth of VVD supporters consider Bolkestein as a potential  reason not to vote for the VVD. Nearly 90 percent of VVD voters  have confidence in Wiegel as prime minister. In Bolkestein's  case, this figure is less than 60 percent.    The electorate has a rather low opinion of Elco Brinkman.  Forty-seven percent of all voters consider the adjective "sly"  to be fitting in describing him. Only 30 percent of them  consider him to be a "true leader," and only 28 percent claim to  find him "likable." The CDA voters are slightly less damning.  Forty-five percent of them consider Brinkman to be "sly," 65  percent of them regard him as a "true leader," and 57 percent  claim to find him "likable." [passage omitted]</p>

The article envisages a prison term from three to eight  years.    The criminal proceedings were instituted in connection with  a  letter of noted human rights activist and deputy editor-in-chief  of the "New Times" weekly Kronid Lyubarskiy to Prosecutor  General Aleksey Kazannik in which he said that Zhirinovskiy's  book "The Last Leap to the South" contains open appeals to war.    "The author of the book advocates the unleashing of an  aggressive war against countries neighbouring on Russia --  Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan", Lyubarskiy said.    "In connection with received statements and appeals and with  the examination of facts cited there the office of the  prosecutor general instituted criminal proceedings on Wednesday  against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on charges envisaged by Article  712 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation -- the  propaganda of war", the press service of the prosecutor's office  said.    Zhirinovskiy is a member of the State Duma and possesses  immunity, however Lyubarskiy said this cannot free him from  criminal proceedings as the crime was committed before he was  elected. Lyubarskiy recalled that two organisers of the abortive  Soviet 1991 coup who were elected to the new parliament still  face trial and the court refused to drop the criminal  proceedings against them while the prosecutor's office did not  appeal against the court ruling.</p>

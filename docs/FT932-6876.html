			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Chemicals sector pressures RUMOURS that Courtaulds, the chemicals group, was poised to announce a rights issue with its results today depressed the share price in early dealings, but were finding little credence by the close of trading. One analyst had warned earlier this week that a bear raid on Courtaulds 'was not impossible' given the company's net debt of as much as Pounds 400m and impending demands on shareholders from Zeneca and BT. Moreover, the specific nature of yesterday's rights rumours - that Courtaulds would announce a one-for-four cash call to raise Pounds 450m  - pointed to a bear raid and the shares, down 9 at one stage, turned the corner in the afternoon to end 9 ahead at 522p. Courtaulds is expected to announce full year profits of around Pounds 190m today.</p>

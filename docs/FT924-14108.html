			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System Speculation that the Bundesbank will cut official interest rates helped to ease tensions in the exchange rate mechanism grid last week. The French franc, arguably the best barometer of the stability of the grid's core currencies, ended at FFr3.388 against the D-Mark, although it continues to be protected by France's high interest rates. Pressure on the weakest three currencies, the punt, escudo and peseta, remained strong, with all three currencies close to their ERM floors against the D-Mark. Currencies, Page 27; UK fund managers, Page 17; UK gilts, Page 20; The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the narrow band cannot rise more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the system. The Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo operate with 6 per cent fluctuation bands.</p>

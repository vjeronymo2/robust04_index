			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Two economics schools face loss of state funding The National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London Business School face withdrawal of government support for their work in economic modelling under options to be discussed over the next few months. One or both of the groups could find grants for modelling - computer techniques used in forecasting - cut or even eliminated by a government funding consortium that includes the Treasury and Bank of England. At stake could be the survival of top-flight economics research at either establishment. Between them they receive 70 per cent of the cash from the consortium under its current phase of research. The 'big two' supply two of the Treasury's advisory panel of seven 'wise men' - the institute's Mr Andrew Britton and Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasting at London Business School. Two others - Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Professor Wynn Godley of Cambridge University - might gain if the consortium reduced the money going to the big two. Liverpool and Cambridge have both lost their funding from the consortium over the past decade. The discussion centres on whether to concentrate money on a few 'centres of excellence' or to distribute cash more widely to encourage diversity. The institute and the school are the main beneficiaries of a four-year, Pounds 2.6m research programme organised by the consortium. The programme funds only two other establishments - Warwick University, which receives 17 per cent of the cash, and Strathclyde University, which receives 13 per cent. The Economic and Social Research Council, a government funding agency, puts up three-quarters of the cash. The Treasury contributes a fifth and the Bank a twentieth. Under one option likely to be examined early next year, the institute or the school might be excluded from a research programme due to start when the current phase ends in September 1995. A leading academic economist with strong connections with the council said there was 'a general sentiment of opposition' to the institute and the school. 'Unless the consortium comes up with a lot more money they could find their money chopped so that some of the tiddlers can flourish.' Over the next few months officials from the council, Treasury and Bank will discuss the next phase of the programme with academic economists. Next month Professor Gordon Pepper of the City University Business School will produce a report to the Economic and Social Research Council's Research Programmes Board setting out priorities in modelling. The report will also be circulated to the Bank and the Treasury. Prof Pepper said his report would set out a 'powerful case' for expanding economic modelling research. He did not want to spell out out how much extra money he would seek from consortium members. Prof Pepper's view will have to be assessed later in the year by the council and the other consortium members, to see how much money is available in the light of tight public spending constraints. After this will come the job of directing cash to specific research groups. Professor Charlie Bean of the London School of Economics, who is helping Prof Pepper draw up his report, said the discussion about the new phase of modelling posed general questions about funding research with limited money. It was 'conceivable' that either the school or the institute could find its funding cut 'in the cause of promoting diversity'.</p>

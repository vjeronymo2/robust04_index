			<p>CSO     [Text] H. Harmoko, general chairman of the Functional Group  (GOLKAR) DPP [Central Executive Council], declared that GOLKAR  has a strategic plan for victory in the 1997 general election  and for success in the 1998 General Session of the MPR [People's  Consultative Assembly].    "As of today, all GOLKAR echelons have a strategic plan for  victory in the 1997 general election and for success in the 1998  General Session of the MPR, and the plan subsequently will be  the principle and guideline for achieving objectives," Harmoko  declared Wednesday, 30 March, as he closed the GOLKAR DPP  national working conference.    Harmoko explained that people at all echelons of GOLKAR  fully  understand the importance of the strategic plan, because it has  a legal basis, targets, challenges, opportunities, and strategic  points, although it contains only general points on steps that  must be taken.  <H5>  Election Targets </H5>   The subject of GOLKAR preparations for the 1997 general  election took up almost all of the press conference held after  the national working conference adjourned.    In reply to a reporter's question about GOLKAR targets in  the  next election, Harmoko said GOLKAR will try to get as many votes  as possible through honorable means.    GOLKAR will fight to win the most votes, Harmoko continued,  because GOLKAR's guiding principle is the upholding of the state  of the Republic of Indonesia, which is based on Pancasila  [ideology of the Indonesian state] and the 1945 Constitution, on  dynamic national stability, and on a national leadership firmly  held by the New Order.    "GOLKAR cadres have carefully integrated their operations,  positions, and actions for the sake of achieving a threefold  success, namely consolidation, REPELITA VI [Sixth Five-Year  Development Plan], and the 1997 general election," Harmoko  declared.    When asked whether internal and external problems will  affect  the winning of votes, Harmoko responded quickly that any  organization, especially a sociopolitical organization, is sure  to have problems. Nevertheless, Harmoko declared, GOLKAR is  confident that through the programs and positions of GOLKAR  cadres such problems can be resolved and will not affect the  winning of votes. "GOLKAR is optimistic," he added.    With regard to the honorable methods GOLKAR wants to use to  win an election victory and with respect to the negative  comments that have been made about GOLKAR victories, Harmoko  said that general elections are conducted on the basis of the  General Election Law.    "GOLKAR has never deviated from the provisions of the  General  Election Law, and GOLKAR has never acted unfairly. It is very  wrong for anyone to say that GOLKAR wins through dishonorable  means," Harmoko declared.    Harmoko also said that the other election participant  organizations, namely the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party] and  the PPP [Development Unity Party], are not opponents but are  GOLKAR's partners in developing political life.  <H5>  Statement of GOLKAR Position </H5>   An election target is one of the eleven points in GOLKAR's  position statement. The fourth point of the position statement  says that the winning of the most votes in the five general  elections is an expression of public confidence.    This has put GOLKAR in the position of sole majority in  legislative institutions and has developed and strengthened the  political structure and culture on the basis of Pancasila and  the 1945 Constitution.    Other points are GOLKAR's consistent position, the dual  function of ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces], succession, and  maintenance of discipline. Harmoko said that issuance of this  GOLKAR position statement is a new policy and will be made a  tradition for each national working conference.  <H5>  Member Discipline </H5>   With regard to the issue of discipline among GOLKAR cadres,  which has recently surfaced through the quarrel over selecting  regents/chiefs of second-level regions in several regions,  Harmoko said GOLKAR will maintain organizational discipline on  the basis of existing legal provisions, including the taking of  firm action against cadres who deviate from guidelines laid down  by GOLKAR.    "The concept of organizational discipline will be a GOLKAR  priority in the future, because without discipline an  organization will not function but will disintegrate instead,"  Harmoko declared. He added that GOLKAR will act both to persuade  and to educate, except that firm action will be taken toward  recalcitrant cadres.    In reply to a question about cases of bad debts and several  social and legal problems involving some GOLKAR cadres and  executives, Harmoko said that GOLKAR will give "equal treatment"  to cadres in both "superstructure" and "infrastructure."    "Thus, the maintenance of 'clean and strong government' is a  part of upholding law and justice. Therefore, legal action must  be taken against any cadre who acts in an aberrant way," Harmoko  stated.    As for the matter of discipline problems among members of  FKP's [Development Function factions] in first-and second-level  DPRD's [regional legislatures], which produced quarrels over the  selection of regents, Harmoko explained that FKP members are  extensions of GOLKAR and must follow the policies laid down by  the GOLKAR DPP. "Those problems were discussed thoroughly in  this national working conference," he said.    Harmoko explained that after the quarrels over selection of  regents were examined, it turned out that the quarrels were  cases of political "engineering" by people with personal  interests. "After going into the field, the DPP knows precisely  that personal interests were present," Harmoko added.</p>

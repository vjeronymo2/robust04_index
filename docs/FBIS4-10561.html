			<p>CSO     [Text] One of the proposals the Socialist Party (PS) will  present to the other groups included in the Concertacion  tomorrow, Monday, calls for a transition from the present  political system to a semipresidential system.    This idea is included in a document for the guidance of the  legislative debate presented yesterday by Camilo Escalona, the  president of the PS, on the basis of the conclusions reached at  the plenary session of the political commission of that party  last Friday.    Escalona maintained that to ensure the political stability  of  the country, what is needed is to bring about a series of  changes designed, among other things, to establish "the  presidential authority over the Armed Forces; a corrected  proportional electoral system; a national security council with  an advisory, rather than a tutelary, relationship to the  president; and a parliament emanating entirely from the exercise  of popular sovereignty."    With specific regard to the semipresidential system, the  socialists are saying it is the model best suited to the  country, taking the Chilean sociocultural reality into account.    This was made clear by Marcelo Schilling, the vice president  of the PS, who explained that a semipresidential system would  mean retaining for the president certain types of authority,  particularly that pertaining the foreign and defense policies.  The other policies would be left to a prime minister who,  although he would have to enjoy the confidence of and be  appointed by the president, would also require the approval of  the parliament.  <H5>  "Excellent Prospects" </H5>   Camilo Escalona explained that the socialists will propose  initiation of the changes in the political system during the  first six months of Eduardo Frei's government, a period he  termed one "of grace" for the entire administration.    He also said that the proposed changes have the support of  the greater part of the public, which would mean more than 70  percent of the citizenry. They even have the approval of the  more liberal sectors of the opposition.    It is for this reason that Escalona predicted that the  political-legislative positions of the PS will be "very  well-received" by the Concertacion, especially since they are  very close to the program of the government alliance. And in  addition, the PPD [Party for Democracy] has already indicated  that it views them favorably.    In any case, Escalona admitted, the approaches or viewpoints  of each group on the scheduling and timeliness of initiating the  changes, and also the priorities concerning them, might be  debated tomorrow, Monday.  <H5>  The Socialist Proposal </H5>   The following are some of the proposals the socialists  regard  as essential:    --A civic probity law, defining the crime of trafficking in  influence, providing for prosecution of unexplained wealth, and  penalizing corruption of government employees and bribery more  harshly.    --Elimination of the designated senators at the end of their  terms in 1997, as well as the suspension now of their right to  vote on substantial political issues.    --Establishment of a corrected proportional electoral system  and rejection of the formula for expanding the number of  candidates within the framework of the binomial system.    --Establishment of the exclusive confidence of the president  of the Republic as a requirement for the commanders of the Armed  Forces and the forces of law and order.    --Renewed sponsorship of the interpretive law allowing  removal of the obstacle represented by the 1978 Amnesty Law in  the realm of human rights.</p>

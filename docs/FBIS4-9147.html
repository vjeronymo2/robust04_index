			<p>BFN     [Text] The tragedy of Gorazde goes on. Thousands of shells  have been destroying the center of the town while from the  surrounding hills the chetniks are using their snipers and  anti-aircraft weapons to monitor every movement in the town. No  one can tell how many casualties there has been in the town.  From all directions tanks are closing on the town center.  According to as yet unconfirmed reports reaching the UN  Protection Force [UNPROFOR] headquarters in Zagreb, Serb tanks  are moving in the direction of part of the town which contains a  munitions factory currently in Muslim hands.</p>

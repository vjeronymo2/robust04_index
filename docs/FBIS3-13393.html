			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 11 Mar (MENA)--Press reports published here  today said that the Palestinian leadership is seriously thinking  of officially announcing the break-off of negotiations with  Israel.    These reports included a statement by an informed  Palestinian  source in Tunis which says that this development in the  Palestinian stand comes in the wake of the failure of all  political and diplomatic efforts and moves led by the PLO since  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre at all levels to make Israel  respond to the Palestinian demands to disarm the settlers in the  occupied territories and to provide an international presence to  protect the Palestinians living under the occupation.    The Palestinian source added that the Palestinian leadership  is following with concern the premeditated U.S. prevarication  aiming to thwart a Security Council resolution on the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, especially in light of the  insinuations by a number of officials in the U.S. Mission at the  United Nations on the possibility of delaying the Security  Council debate on the issue until further notice.    This source revealed that the Palestinian leadership has  received demands from Palestine National Council members and a  number of national figures in the occupied territories demanding  the breaking off of negotiations.    The Tunisian newspaper AL-SABAH today cited a prominent  Palestinian source as saying that the Palestinian leadership is  still continuing diplomatic efforts in an attempt to break the  deadlock in the negotiations. This source did not rule out the  possibility that the coming few days could be decisive for  either speeding up the peace process or closing this file for  good.    The same paper also cites informed Palestinian sources as  saying that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat refrained from  following up on the telephone call he received from Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin the day before yesterday lest any  talk could be construed as a return to the peace negotiations,  which were halted as a result of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    The sources added that 'Arafat explained this position as  insistence on the official and popular Palestinian stand of  waiting for a clear resolution from the Security Council that  condemns the massacre and its perpetrators, sends international  observers to the occupied territories, demands the disarming of  the settlers and the removal of the settlements, and ensures  security.    They added that the PLO command also wants to know the  results of the official Israeli investigation and the identity  of those responsible for not providing protection for the  worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    Regarding the several contacts held recently between the  Palestinian leadership and Russian envoys, the Palestinian  source said that Russia now has new and positive stands on the  issue of peace in the Middle East and these stands stem from the  restoration of the Russian political leadership's  self-confidence resulting from defusing the armed conflict  between Serbia and NATO over Bosnia. The source noted that  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit Tunis in the  next 48 hours to continue the consultations and efforts on the  Middle East. It said that Russia supports the Palestinian  demands and the Palestinian side agrees to the Russian proposal  to hold a second international conference on the Middle East,  which will be a new Madrid conference. The source expressed the  belief that Russia has made a strong and influential return to  the Middle East on the basis of a new concept of its relations  with the countries of the region.    It said that the PLO will hold meetings at the Executive  Committee, expanded leadership, and possibly the Central Council  levels in the next few days to assess the situation.</p>

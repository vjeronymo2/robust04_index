			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / New Hoover chief makes cost cutting top priority THE new head of Hoover said yesterday that his top priority was to cut the company's operating losses, after admitting that worsening problems in its free flights promotion scheme had led him to take up the job earlier than planned. 'My real mission here is to look after the profitability of the business,' Mr Gerald Kamman, managing director of Hoover UK and president of Hoover Europe, said. 'We are concerned about the operating profitability of the company.' Mr Kamman, who arrived in Britain from the US on Monday, said this concern was the principal reason for his appointment, though his predecessor would probably not have been dismissed had the free flights scheme not gone so badly wrong. One of his first actions had been to summon Hoover's 75 top UK managers and European sales subsidiaries to a meeting, at which he told them the company must improve its efficiency. He planned to review Hoover's management structure and did not know whether he would replace the company's vice-president of marketing and the director of marketing services, who also left the company this week. He had not yet decided how to tackle Hoover's losses, which partly reflected operating cost problems. He would not say whether the measures to be taken would include redundancies. Last year Hoover Europe lost Dollars 67.1m, after a Dollars 55m restructuring charge, on sales of Dollars 501.9m. Mr Kamman said Maytag, the US domestic appliance manufacturer which owns Hoover, had brought forward his appointment after it became clear that the costs of the company's free flights programme far exceeded earlier estimates. He had not realised the full extent of the difficulties until his arrival. However, he insisted that the Dollars 30m after-tax charge against earnings, announced by Maytag on Tuesday, would fully cover the cost of meeting Hoover's obligations to customers under the programme. 'I'm hopeful that when it's over, we will have a few quid in the bank,' Mr Kamman said. 'We erred intentionally on the high side when calculating the cost.' He declined to say how many purchasers of Hoover products had applied for free flights or how many applications had been satisfied. 'Some of the redemption rates are not even known. Some certificates are not due in for several weeks,' he said. 'We are honourable people and the Hoover name stands for integrity.' Hoover last night said that its news release about the departure of Mr Michael Gilbey, director of marketing services, could have been read as suggesting he was dismissed. It added: 'In fact, Mr Gilbey was made redundant as a result of a restructuring of Hoover's marketing departments.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KANKAI special reporting team: "The `Left-Wing </F> Faction' of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, a Tragedy of  the Coalition Ruling Camp's Largest Party"]    [Text] In the face of an unprecedented crisis feared to  bring about even its collapse, the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] made a new start by electing the new executive  leadership, including Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and General  Secretary Wataru Kubo at its party convention in late September.  The convention approved, among others, promotion of an election  system combining proportional representation and small electoral  districts, and the party thus appears to have settled pending  issues for the time being. However, the seeds of dissention are  continuously smoldering because the new executive lineup was  formed on the initiative of the left-wing faction and all  election-related posts are occupied by a group assuming a  cautious position toward the combined formula on the election  system. The SDPJ is the largest party in the ruling camp, but  neither the group promoting the combined formula nor the group  using prudence shown clear visions for the survival of the  party. As a result, the introversive logic--which retains traces  of the "1955 system" [the two-party system formed in 1955 with  creation of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the SDPJ]--is  going unchallenged within the party . The fear that, with its  increasing left-wing tinge, the SDPJ might be a "powder keg" in  the Hosokawa coalition government is becoming a reality, though  this fear was noted at the outset.    A very difficult problem was put forward at the SDPJ  convention in late September which was held to elect the new  executive leadership.    The problem was: The SDPJ suffered a historical crushing  defeat in the July general election. Nevertheless, it achieved  the long-cherished desire to overthrow the LDP and participated  in the coalition government. However, the people's support only  keeps falling sharply, and they do not appreciate us at all. We  have agreed to the introduction of the combination of  proportional representation and small electoral districts which  might become our own grave in the future. Now, how can the SDPJ  restore the people's support and survive? Show the way.    This is like asking one to find a way to carry out a funeral  and a wedding at the same place at the same time and to satisfy  all of the attendants.    This is a difficult and strange demand, judging from common  sense exercised in the political world thus far.    Accordingly, the way to resolve this problem cannot be found  unless an approach totally different from the conventional one  is used. The problem will prove to be utterly unsolvable as long  as the party uses the kind of Diet-steering arithmetic prevalent  under the 1955 system--an arithmetic in which "one plus one"  makes three or one. However, the answer given in the recent  party convention represented a solution reached by the use of  the "1955 arithmetic" in whatever way we may look at it.  <H5>  Still Competent To Make Leftward Bounce </H5>   In the election of the chairman, Mr. Kubo, regarded as the  most likely winner, hurriedly withdrew his candidacy as a result  of a closed-door adjustment. Mr. Murayama, who is rather plain  as the face of the party, declared his candidacy. Setting aside  a character sketch, it was hard to understand why the chairman  should be Murayama, not Kubo. However, there was clear logic  within the SDPJ in this connection.    The election to decide Chairman Sadao Yamahana's successor  after he expressed his desire to resign was intended not only to  clarify responsibility for the defeat in the general election.  It was an intraparty struggle for leadership waged by inquiring  into causes for the defeat, that is, by discussing the rights  and wrongs of the past policy line, and of deciding what policy  line should be taken now. During the era when the SDPJ was an  opposition party, the party's left-wing faction rapped the  executive leadership, reasoning that "the party has invited the  people's criticism because it inched close to the line of the  LDP." As a result, the party followed the course of leaning to  the left. It made the so-called "leftward bounce."    In the recent party convention, because of the  aforementioned  complicated setup, the logic of the leftward bounce--a  perception under the 1955 system, that is, Japan's cold war  structure--prevailed although the party found it hard to draw a  straight monolithic conclusion as in the past.    The interest of the mass media and the people in the  chairman's election was concentrated on what distance the SDPJ  would maintain with the Hosokawa coalition government and how it  would handle the combination of proportional representation and  small electoral districts; however, SDPJ members were looking at  the candidates Kubo and Murayama from a different perspective.    The two persons did not differ in the basic position that  they would work to maintain the coalition government and promote  the combination of proportional representation and small  electoral districts. But Mr. Murayama's emphasis on respect for  "intraparty democracy" drew attention.    He merely told the simple, taken-for-granted truth that  important decisions should unfailingly be made through  discussions at appointed organs. However, this remark assumes a  deeper meaning when viewed in the light of the SDPJ's actual  condition. Deciding things through organs means that party  organizations should make full arguments in a proper order and  finally await the conclusion at the party convention. This means  that matters to be decided should unfailingly be referred to  local organizations for discussion and that the party cannot  ignore the intentions of the local organizations, which hold 80  percent of party members and a majority of deputies to the party  convention.    In view of the actual situation in which most local party  members are leftist activists, organizational discussions are  tantamount to letting arguments go through a leftist filter at  all stages, and so it also means that policies cannot pass  unless they are acceptable to the left-wing faction.    In the past as well, many reform plans backed down from  original drafts in the process of debate and were finally torn  to pieces through alterations. The real substance of attaching  importance to intraparty democracy is synonymous with revival  and maintenance of the leftist-wing faction.    The reason why the members looked to intraparty democracy  was  the issue of the combination of proportional representation and  small electoral districts. The SDPJ at its 1991 convention  decided to oppose the combination formula, saying that "its  introduction will not be permitted." Changing this decision  requires the approval of the party convention or the Central  Committee. However, the Yamahana executive leadership did not  take these proceedings at all.    The local organizations, actual election-performing forces,  had a strong sense of crisis from the feeling that the SDPJ  would be dead and buried under the combination formula. In the  eyes of the local organizations, this was why the party made the  decision against the formula through debate, but Chairman Sadao  Yamahana changed the decision arbitrarily without any  consultations. They felt that this was critical and that  something should be done to curb it.    It was not only the combination formula. Those local forces  also could not overlook the issue of another condition for the  sharing in the government--"succeeding the policies held up  until now (under the LDP government) regarding fundamental  national policies such as diplomacy and defense." They feared  that if this position were pursued as intended, they could not  carry out struggles against bases and atomic bombs which had  formed the centerpiece of activities by local organizations.  They felt that such a development might lead to the collapse of  the party organization itself and that, therefore, the decision  on the condition was a matter of life or death for the party.    However, the decision was also made arbitrarily by the  executive leadership. In his candidacy announcement, Mr.  Murayama said: "What the SDPJ should do now is to rally the most  excellent traditions, talents, and qualities of the SDPJ and its  members and take a new look at the `mind' of the SDPJ" (SHAKAI  SHIMPO)." He then added that "the first step toward this end is  the thorough implementation of intraparty democracy." In these  remarks, he expressed local fears on behalf of the local members.    The election of the chairman came to an end in an instant.  On  9 September, the date for the candidacy application in the  election, 25 chief secretaries of prefectural headquarters  across the nation assembled in a hotel in Tokyo and decided to  support Murayama. It is said that 10 additional persons  expressed the desire to join in the move although they did not  attend the meeting. This number shows how strong the local voice  was. No one could be his match under these circumstances. Upon  hearing this development, Mr. Kubo gave up his candidacy.    The Murayama executive leadership was thus formed on the  basis of misgivings by local organizations. All the more because  of this, he is hog-tied by local pressures. Mr. Yamahana was  compelled to take responsibility for his arbitrariness, but the  coalition government became possible because he pushed his way  in this arbitrary manner. Conversely, it will be structurally  impossible to expect the Murayama executive leadership to follow  the same position in the future.  <H5>  Prepared To Accept Split? It Is To Make Final Choice </H5>   The person who called for the meeting of 25 chief  secretaries  which played a determining role in deciding the next chairman  was former Vice Chairman Masahiro Yamamoto, a leftist big wheel  who, though living in retirement, had covert influence with  local organizations and the party headquarters. He was the prop  of the "Society for Building a New SDPJ," a power base for Mr.  Yamahana's rise, seceded from the society in opposition to the  combination formula and became the motive power for Chairman  Murayama.    On the evening of that day, the 25 persons assembled at the  official residence of the lower house speaker and met Speaker  Takako Doi. Ms. Doi reportedly expressed the hope that they  would promote their position in consultations with Mr. Yamamoto  in the future. And in the election of the chairman, the Murayama  camp was joined by former General Secretary Tsuruo Yamaguchi, a  member of the rightist Suiyokai and former Diet Administration  Committee Chairman Shun Oide. The two are close to Ms. Doi as  members of the force for constitutional protection and have held  strong anti-Tanabe (former Chairman Makoto Tanabe) feelings.    In this context, it may be said that the Murayama system is  in substance "Doi's new party" which has been formed around Ms.  Doi, joined by local activists, left-wing lawmakers, and some  rightist members, and rallying the force for protection of the  Constitution. This is clear from a passage in Mr. Murayama's  candidacy announcement that "it is naturally an important part  of our job to create an impressive and vigorous Diet easy to  understand for citizens in support of Ms. Takako Doi, who,  bearing the most excellent SDPJ traditions upon her shoulder,  was inaugurated as the House of Representatives speaker."    Ms. Doi appears to have firmed up her determination to  restore the SDPJ as a party for protection of the Constitution  amid the SDPJ's crushing defeat and establishment of the non-LDP  coalition regime on the initiative of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. This is also the  determination to block the two-conservative party doctrine.    The general outline was shown when Mr. Yamahana asked Ms.  Doi  to take office as speaker of the House of Representatives. In  the process of consultations between the two persons from late  July to August, it became clear that Ms. Doi's concrete goals  were to shift the chairmanship to the hand of the left-wing  faction, to strengthen the SDPJ's subjectivity, and to realize  the combination formula in such a way as to enable the tripolar  system, not the two major party system. The Murayama system  should thus be looked upon as deep-rooted. It is, in fact,  impossible to solidify, as in the past, the ties between leftist  and rightist factions under the anti-LDP banner alone now that  reorganization of the political world has become a reality with  the LDP divided and with the SDPJ sending six cabinet members to  the regime, though it was possible when there was a powerful  enemy called the LDP in ahe 1955 system. If one is discontented  with the Murayama line, one has no option but to secede from the  party. Although the "non-conservative liberals" (Rengo Chairman  Akira Yamagishi, etc.) equally adopt a tripolar plan, the  policies they uphold are contradictory to the demands of the  local organizations and also conflict with the line of  protecting the Constitution.    If the SDPJ aims to promote a coalition government with a  conservative force no matter which of the two systems [the two  major party system and the tripolar system] it chooses, it  cannot help diluting its own unique fundamental policies and  movement. It may insist on a coalition government retaining the  SDPJ's subjectivity, but this is simply a castle in the air in  view of its current competence. The SDPJ has now come to its  final fork in the road.  <H5>  Between Political Regime and Subjectivity </H5>   One branch of the road is the two major forces system and  the  other is the tripolar system.    Mr. Tanabe of the reformist faction views that the political  world will shift along a moderate multiparty system under two  big political forces for the time being. On the basis of this  view, he stresses that "in responding to the reorganization of  the political world, we should be ready to participate in it  actively, not passively, and to this end we should have the  determination to even readily "disband the party" if the people  request it and conditions are mature for it." According to Mr.  Tanabe, a party is "nothing but a means and tool for changing  politics in compliance with the people's desires," and he argues  that "we cannot stick to the tool and consequently choose the  way for getting isolated from the people and `existing only in  name and being virtually dead.'" Do not be hung up on the banner  or the party--this is what his stand calls for.    This doctrine that the party members should even be ready to  disband their party is the path that the local organizations,  the left-wing faction, and Ms. Doi are most alert to. This  alertness is represented by the argument of former Chairman  Masatsugu Ishibashi who belonged to the force for constitutional  protection. Mr. Ishibashi asserts: "There is not a shred of  persuasiveness in the excuses that it cannot be helped for the  party to make sacrifices in order to realize the change of  regime and vitalize parliamentary democracy. This is all the  truer when we think that the SDPJ's weakening and collapse link  immediately to revision of the Constitution." The point of his  argument is that the party should be kept alive with its banner  upheld persistently.    This is by contrast a "survival strategy." Mr. Tanabe's  assertion is attended with the danger of the party collapse.  However, in view of the public opinion trends Mr. Ishibashi's  line also cannot completely dispel doubts about how long the  line could stay persuasive in the future for expanding the  SDPJ's power.    This is a difficult choice, but the SDPJ has now been driven  to a point where it cannot but choose either of the two paths.  It may be said that this time the party has opted for the latter  path by choosing Chairman Murayama.    Yet the party must abide by the agreement on establishment  of  the coalition government now that it has actually participated  in the government and is adopting the motto of maintaining the  coalition government. In such a case, "succeeding the previous  regime's policies" will unavoidably become a heavier burden for  the Murayama executive leadership which attaches importance to  local forces. As to the estrangement between the SDPJ's inherent  fundamental policies and the succession of the previous regime's  policies, Mr. Yamahana could not give any indications except  saying that "efforts will be made to fill up the gap."    Specifically, the party should address the following issues:  the measure to cope with post-Cambodia PKO (UN peacekeeping  operations), a revision of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law so  as to enable the dispatch of SDF aircraft overseas to rescue  Japanese nationals, the income tax reduction which has become  the largest political task, and the consumption tax increase to  provide a revenue replacement for the income tax reduction. It  is also pressed hard to strictly observe the distribution of  fixed seats (250 seats in the small electoral districts and 250  seats in proportional representation) with regard to the  combination of proportional representation and small electoral  districts. The combination formula sustained restrictions  through a resolution at the party convention. Especially, the  PKO and consumption tax issues represent a line from which the  party cannot budge an inch because the former is the symbol of  Constitutional protection and the latter, that of Ms. Doi.    If the SDPJ gives priority to its intraparty position, the  coalition government now enjoying unprecedented support will  become an absurd being, and the party will be deserted by the  people as a criminal responsible for it. On the other hand, if  it prizes the maintenance of regime, the party's subjectivity  cannot but recede. Mr. Yamahana solved this dilemma through  arbitrary action, but it is hard to foresee how Mr. Murayama who  barred this method on his own will tide over the situation.  <H5>  Barrier Is 1993 Declaration </H5>   The new executive leadership's campaign policy is to be  decided at the party convention to be resumed in January next  year. The largest point of contention at the convention is how  to deal with the "1993 declaration." The declaration, a  realistic line giving a second look at almost all fundamental  party policies, touched off a strong opposition among the local  organizations from the outset when it was originally drafted.  Delegates of chief secretaries across the nation even warned  (then) Secretary General Hirotake Akamatsu that "if we are not  consulted with beforehand, we will totally revise it at the  party convention."    The declaration is, in outline, similar to the  party-founding  declaration of the Japan New Party, and the reformist faction  expected the declaration, if adopted, to open the way for the  formation of a new liberal party joined by the SDPJ even if  represented by its conservative force.    However, in view of the trend shown in the election of  Chairman Murayama, the fate of the 1993 declaration is already  as perilous as a light exposed to wind. Mr. Ishibashi criticizes  this declaration bitterly, saying: "Except for views on the  Japan-U.S. security arrangement and on the SDF, it makes little  difference from the new declaration I worked out. However, it  has its characteristics which are the excessive considerations  for others' positions and the use of all sorts of flowery  words." It is unlikely that the 1993 declaration will  materialize.    Attaching importance to intraparty democracy reflects local  voices, and at the same time means bringing out the color of the  left-wing faction. Moreover, the present reorganization of the  political world is so quick in speed that a party cannot catch  up with it by the SDPJ-type organizational decisionmaking. In  consideration of these two elements, it is believed that the  SDPJ will deepen its isolation within the Hosokawa coalition  government which has begun to show a strongly conservative face  and that such deepening isolation will make the voice of the  left-wing faction louder and louder. Such is the phenomenon  expected to take place.    At length, the party will assume the image of a center-left  political party upholding constitutional protection as its  slogan. In the Rengo chairman election which was held  concurrently with the election of the SDPJ chairman, trade  unions with a strong leftist tinge originating from the former  Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions of Japan] rebelled half  openly against the Yamagishi coalition line. The center-left  faction is thus clarifying its range of influence.    With the 1995 upper house election in mind, the Murayama  executive leadership will not change its major policy of  maintaining the Hosokawa coalition government; however, after  the election it will unavoidably get poised toward establishing  an SDPJ-centered coalition government.    On the other hand, there is a persistent view that, on the  supposition of the SDPJ dropping out of the Hosokawa coalition,  Mr. Ozawa has begun working to form a new force which has  Shinseito, Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party as its  centerpiece and absorbs part of the LDP. In such a case, one  cannot rule out the possibility that the SDPJ's  reformist-rightist faction whose foothold has become narrower  will join in the force.    When things develop this way, the bold choice of the  Hosokawa  government in consideration of the SDPJ's allergy to Mr. Ozawa  will no longer be meaningful, and a clearly Shinseito-centered  government will be produced. The SDPJ's swing toward the left  will create a momentum to rock the foundation of the Hosokawa  government.    Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone once carved his way  into the labor world which was the base of support for  opposition parties, saying that "I will expand the left wing of  the LDP." New conservative parties such as Shinseito, Sakigake  [Harbinger], and the Japan New Party have now plucked the fruit  of his endeavors, and they are now further closing in on the  citadel of the SDPJ. If the SDPJ upholds its subjectivity, it  will accelerate the birth of a regime which the SDPJ does not  want. One thing that is certain in this cynical reality is that  fire is set to a blasting fuse attached to the SDPJ.</p>

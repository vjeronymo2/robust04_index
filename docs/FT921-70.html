			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: First-time voters could make lasting impression - Almost 3m young people will take part in their first election on April 9. Catherine Milton explains why their votes could prove decisive MIKE HOOPER, 20, plans to ignore his first opportunity to vote. No candidate in marginal Exeter deserves his support, he says. 'Anyone who thinks they should run the country is not exactly the person you want running the country.' He is single, lives with his parents and has been unemployed for most of the last four years, though he is prepared to move. He does not know which way his parents vote. 'We don't talk about it.' Mike is in many ways a typical first-time voter (FTV); he is single, unemployed and mobile, and is one of a substantial minority who will not vote - 65 per cent of FTVs voted in 1987, as opposed to 85 per cent of all people of working age. There are almost 3m FTVs, about 7 per cent of the electorate, and politicians regularly do embarrassing things in the quest for their votes. John Major recorded a nine-minute cassette which splices politics with pop and sent it to 150,000 young people who turned 18 last year. Neil Kinnock rocked around on a 1984 video by singer Tracey Ullman. Politicians go to such lengths for two reasons. First, the way people vote in their first few elections is often the way they vote for the rest of their lives. Second, the low average turn-out of FTVs means that successful appeals could have a marked effect. Historically FTVs, and young voters generally, favour the Labour party. Daniel Cray, 19, studying for A-levels at Exeter College, intends to vote Labour. 'I come from a Labour background and I am left-wing. I want to get the Tories out.' His voting intentions fit a pattern confirmed by Dr Andy Brown, a visiting fellow at Harvard university, in his thesis Patterns of First-Time Voting in Great Britain, to be published later this year. Dr Brown says all FTVs are influenced by their parents, but that influence is most enduring on children of Labour parents. It is a significant reason for Labour's advantage among young voters. 'You are only talking about a small number of voters compared with the population as a whole,' he says. 'But that small number can also sway an election result - especially if the election is tight. Given the relative advantage that they give to Labour, it could prove very important.' In 1983 FTV support for Labour fell to 33 per cent from 40 per cent in 1979, while the Tories attracted 44 per cent. Labour climbed back to 39 per cent in 1987, one point ahead of the Tories. At this election, opposition parties may benefit from increased disaffection among young voters because of a recent rapid rise in unemployment, particularly among young men. Among 18-to-24-year-olds, Labour enjoyed a lead of 10 percentage points in 1991 - 46 per cent to 36 per cent - according to Mori, the polling organisation. But this natural advantage disappears when voters reach their mid 20s The political centre has suffered since the mid 1970s, when the then Liberal party had a high-profile youth organisation. In 1974, 27 per cent of FTVs supported the Liberals, against 42 per cent for Labour and 24 per cent for the Conservatives. The Tories have been the main gainers from the slump to 10 per cent in Liberal Democrat support last year. The political volatility of the small group makes it an important target for all parties. Just under two-fifths of FTVs switched parties during the last campaign. In Exeter, a three-way marginal, the views of even 100 young people could be a factor. Tom Nestor Smith, 21, a politics student at Exeter university, is trying to get the manifestos to help him make decide: 'I have been affected by the enterprise philosophy. If you are better at your job than someone else then you deserve to be paid more.' Tom, who describes his background as farming gentry, will not be voting Labour: 'Kinnock is very unappealing. His appearance in that Tracey Ullman video was just sad. Paddy Ashdown has a lot of charisma, and the Tories don't do enough to help those who can't help themselves,' he said. Mori's figures for February show that young people are six percentage points more concerned about pollution and the environment than the people generally (11 per cent against 7 per cent) and seven points more concerned about the poll tax (16 per cent against 9 per cent). On other issues - education, nuclear weapons, inflation and Europe - young people's views are broadly similar to those of most people. However, in 1987 nearly two-fifths of FTVs felt that the outcome of the election was irrelevant, compared with some 22 per cent of the working-age population. Nicky Tuckett, 18, an Exeter shop assistant, may vote if she feels like it, but does not believe any party does enough for young people. In common with thousands of others, she has few specific demands - apart, that is, from youth clubs. 'They say it's always kids who do car crime. What do they expect? There's nowhere else for them to go.' She wants a clear manifesto commitment to the provision of more youth clubs.</p>

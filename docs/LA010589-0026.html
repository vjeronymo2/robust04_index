			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER CHARGED UNDER FELONY DRUNK LAW  </P> <P> Felony drunk-driving charges were filed Wednesday against a Pacoima man  authorities believe is the first person in the San Fernando Valley prosecuted  under a new state law that makes repeat drunk driving a felony offense.  </P> <P> Jose Escobar Cisneros, 59, has had four drunk-driving convictions since 1982,  said Head Deputy Dist. Atty. Billy D. Webb of the San Fernando district  attorney's office.  </P> <P> Cisneros pleaded not guilty in San Fernando Municipal Court to one count of  felony driving under the influence of alcohol and one misdemeanor count of  driving with a revoked or suspended license.  </P> <P> He was arrested Jan. 3 at Pierce Street and San Fernando Road. Tests showed he  had a blood-alcohol count of 0.35%, Webb said. The legal limit is 0.10%.  </P> <P> Under a law that took effect Sunday, drunk-driving defendants who have three or  more convictions can be charged with a felony. Before Jan. 1, repeat offenses  were charged as misdemeanors.  </P> <P> If convicted, Cisneros faces a maximum sentence of 3 years in state prison.  Under the previous law, the maximum sentence was 2 years in County Jail.  Cisneros was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail.  </P></p>

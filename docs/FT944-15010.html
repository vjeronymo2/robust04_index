			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Paying the price Europe's banks have lost their struggle against legislation which is intended to ensure quick and cheap transfers of cash across borders. Given that a quarter of a Ecu100 payment can be expected to disappear in charges, and small businesses face considerable uncertainty over how long a payment will take, it is hard to feel too much sympathy for them. The service has been performed so badly for so long mainly because banks had little incentive to do better. Cross-border payments were a marginal and barely profitable activity, accounting for a tiny proportion of a bank's transfers of cash. The business also had perverse incentives: the longer a bank delayed the transfer of cash, the more money it gained in interest. In the past two years banks have woken up to the fact that they could be missing a trick. As the European market becomes a reality for small companies, banks have realised that they can attract customers by providing efficient transfers. A company making many transfers to another country may value such efficiency above many other kinds. Yet competition has been painfully slow to raise standards among the mass of banks. A study carried out by the European Commission shows that charges are high and services opaque. It would have been preferable for banks to implement the voluntary charter proposed by Ms Christiane Scrivener, the consumer affairs commissioner, but there was also a case for Commission action. The proposed directive does not appear excessively harsh in most respects. It is feasible for banks to clear cash into an account within six days; it is also reasonable to require them to provide clear information about charges and transfer times. The Commission has avoided any move to set levels of charges, which may well remain high until the business becomes less marginal. In one respect, the directive is too prescriptive. It says that banks should be banned from double-charging, or levying a charge on the receiver of the money as well as the sender. It is reasonable to prevent banks doing this when a customer has clearly instructed them not to do so: to do otherwise is close to fraud. But there may be cases where customers are happy to split charges, and many small banks rely on being able to charge for receiving payments. Given the efforts of larger banks to improve services, it seems unlikely that they will be perturbed by the directive. Banking groups argue it creates an uncertain legal background for their business in the next few years. But any large bank investing in a project that does not meet the Commission's minimum standards might as well abandon it as uncompetitive anyway.</p>

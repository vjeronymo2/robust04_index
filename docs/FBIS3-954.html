The debt department represents about 50 percent of the  estimated expenditures in the new budget, the same source added.    According to Minister Delegate of Finance Enrique King Somo,  in a telephone conversation with AFP today from Libreville, the  state's current expenses amount to 14.94 billion CFA francs and  the debt department's to 14.46 billion.    As for the receipts, the budget estimates show that the  state's receipts amount to 15.63 billion CFA francs, the  minister added. The budget deficit should therefore amount to  about 14 billion CFA francs.    This budget, which has more than doubled compared with the  previous exercise following the devaluation of the CFA franc by  50 percent, provides for a 14-percent salary increase for civil  servants, the Equatorial Guinean radio said.    The average monthly salary in Equatorial Guinea amounts to  14,000 CFA francs.    The new budget should be submitted for approval to the  National Assembly before it is implemented, the radio added.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The workers of Hermanos Diaz Oil Refinery are  working at full speed to repair the damages caused by a fire at  the refinery in Santiago de Cuba. The quick response of the  workers prevented the fire from expanding to other areas. The  fire took place at the catalytic converter plant.    [Begin Chief Engineer Ramon Rodriguez recording] The fire  was  caused by a leak in a soldering joint of the oxygen tower,  which, once released, ignited and expanded because the tower  continued to provide fuel for the fire. The fire spread to  nearby equipment, particularly the sewers of the catalytic  converter plant.    We believe this fire was not of large or medium magnitude,  but of small magnitude. We expect to repair the damage in seven  days, focusing on repairing the mechanical and electronic  equipment of the butane processing chute. [end recording]    Chief Engineer Ramon Rodriguez affirmed that the damage  caused by the fire is minimal because the workers are trained to  handle such contingencies.</p>

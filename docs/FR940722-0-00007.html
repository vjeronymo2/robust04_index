			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, these regulations include amendments to parts 607, 614, 615 (subpart E), and 620 of the regulations. These changes, as more fully described below, are conforming and clarifying changes to provisions containing references to existing capital regulations that are now covered by various provisions of new &sect;&sect;615.5201 and 615.5210(d), (e), and (f). The FCA has determined that the notice and comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (c) do not apply in this situation. Notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary because the amendments are not substantive in nature and do not impose new requirements. Therefore, there is no reason to solicit public comments on them. Accordingly, the FCA finds that good cause exists to promulgate final amendments to these provisions without notice and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conforming changes have been made to the capital regulation references in &sect;614.4351(a) to account primarily for the renumbering of paragraphs. The references to revised paragraph (e) (2), (3), and (4) of &sect;615.5210, replace the reference to paragraph (d)(2) of that section in the existing regulations. While the methodology in amended &sect;614.4351(a) for computing an institution's lending limit base will be somewhat different, and in some cases more complicated, because of the amendments to the capital regulations, the effect will be the same. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  To facilitate institutions' understanding and interpretation of the lending limit calculation, the language describing the calculation has been clarified regarding the sequence of the adjustments and regarding which institution will count the investment in question in its lending limit base. We note, in this connection, that the ``investment'' includes any equities that are purchased as well as equities that are allocated in a distribution of earnings on participations. The FCA is considering how the calculation might be simplified and will publish for comment any proposed substantive changes that may be appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In other words, the revised &sect;614.4351(a) will continue to require that an investment held to capitalize a loan participation interest sold to another institution will be included in the lending limit base of the institution that holds the investment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , the institution that sold the participation interest).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to regulation &sect;614.4710(a)(1)(i), instead of the current reference by citation to the capital regulations relating to the elimination of certain investments for the purpose of calculating a limit on bankers acceptances for a bank for cooperatives, the actual referenced language has been inserted as an aid to the reader.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, the conforming amendments in &sect;&sect;607.2, 615.5131(t), and 620.1(j) have been made to reflect the renumbering of existing capital provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

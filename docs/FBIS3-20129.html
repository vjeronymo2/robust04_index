			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 27 (AFP) -- French voters cast ballots  Sunday [27 March] in second-round local elections expected to  confirm a slight recovery by the beleaguered Socialists as well  as a consolidation by the ruling center-right coalition.    In the first round last Sunday, the two parties in Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur's coalition and their allies garnered  44.59 percent of the votes, the same score as in March 1993  general elections in which they trounced the then-ruling  Socialist Party.    The Socialists made a respectable showing last weekend,  taking more than 22 percent of the votes compared to 17.59 in  the disastrous legislative election.    Up for grabs in the second round run-offs were 1,372  councillors' posts in France's 95 departments.    Only about a third of the races had clear-cut winners in the  first round.    The election is also Balladur's first national-level test  since he came to power a year ago. He is widely believed to  have presidential aspirations. President Francois Mitterrand's  term ends in May of next year.    Turnout as of 5:00 p.m. [1500 GMT] was about 48 percent,  down  slightly from last Sunday, the Interior Ministry said.    Polls closed at 6:00 p.m. [1600 GMT] in most areas, except  in  large cities, where they were to remain open an extra two hours.    The voting comes after a week of angry and sometimes violent  demonstrations by students opposed to a government plan to fight  record unemployment by letting businesses pay young people a  lower minimum wage.    Political analysts said the effect of the demonstrations at  the ballot box was hard to predict.    The occasional outbursts of violence by the students might  translate into support for the government and its efforts to  fight crime, the analysts said. But at the same time, the  students' opposition to the government employment plan might be  reflected in the electorate as a whole, the analysts added.    In any case the election is not expected to cause any major  shift in the balance of power on the local level.    Right-wing parties currently control 75 of the country's 95  departments, compared to 12 for the socialists, six for their  left-wing allies and two for the communists.</p>

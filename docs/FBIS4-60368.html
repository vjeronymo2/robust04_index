			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interviews with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Likud </F> Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu by Sayyid 'Abd-al-'Ati, in Tel Aviv  and Jerusalem, respectively; dates not given]    [Excerpt] ['Abd-al-'Ati] My first interview was with  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at a Foreign Ministry  building in Tel Aviv. Mr. Peres, how do you see the future of  peace in the region following the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho?    [Peres] There is no doubt that wars have slowed economic  development in the region. It is in our interest to have an  economic revival in the region. We are focusing on economic  development. It is also important for us that the conditions of  the Palestinians improve because a well-off neighbor will  certainly be more stable. We are helping the Palestinians as  much as we can. This does not mean we have withdrawn militarily  from the land to come back and occupy it economically.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] What was your feeling when you saw the  transfer of authority to the Palestinians? And what will be the  fate of the rest of the occupied land?    [Peres] This is the first time the Palestinian people have  lived on their land and been in control. I do not know what the  future will bring. We must continue the negotiations without  delay. These negotiations should not remain confined to the  extension of self-rule to other areas, as was the case in  Washington. They should also deal with the transfer of  authority in the areas of education, health, social affairs, and  taxation. I think it is wrong to believe that we can control  the Palestinian presence in Nabulus, Hebron, and Ramallah,  situated respectively in the north, south, and middle of the  West Bank.    What matters now is that we are relieved of the burden of  Gaza. When I hear of the sense of relief among our soldiers who  were dispatched to face the rock-throwers there, I say: Our  soldiers have been brave but thank God it is over.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] Israel insists that Jerusalem will remain its  eternal capital and the Arabs counter that with their own claim.  How do you see this issue being resolved?    [Peres] Jerusalem does not represent a problem for us now.  It is unified from the political side and divided from the  religious side. There is full freedom of access to all Jewish,  Christian, and Islamic holy places. Religious shrines must be  respected and we protect and guard them.    We have signed an agreement with the Vatican by which Israel  will protect Christian shrines. We are ready to sign a similar  agreement with the Islamic world. Jerusalem was never an Arab  capital. The Jewish people have never had any capital but  Jerusalem (!!) [punctuation as published]    ['Abd-al-'Ati] Why has there been no progress on the Syrian  track?    [Peres] The Syrians are very hardline. President Hafiz  al-Asad does not want to do what President al-Sadat did. We do  not know how long al-Asad wants to wait. Seventeen years ago  the problem was simple and Syria would have achieved a better  deal. But it seems that President al-Asad wants to take his  time. All this time is being wasted. But I believe Syria will  ultimately follow in Egypt's footsteps and begin open  negotiations with Israel.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] Israel talks a lot about peace guarantees and  security arrangements but it does not trust the Arabs. Still,  Egypt is an Arab country and for the past 17 years there has  been no violation of the Camp David Accords. Why is Israel,  then, afraid of peace with Syria?    [Peres] Yes, Egypt is committed to peace with Israel and is  even playing a major role in the region to narrow differences.  The question is: Why is Syria not following Egypt's example?  The problem with the Syrians is that they want to get to where  Egypt is without following the same path.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] How does Israel feel about Islamic violence  in Egypt? What is your view of the future of peace between  Egypt and Israel?    [Peres] Evidently the emergence of Islamic extremism  threatens all the peoples of the region. The situation in Iran  shows that Islamic extremism has solved nothing. I believe the  extremists and fundamentalists entertain the illusion that they  can solve their countries' problems if they assume power.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] The Dayr al-Sultan issue [a church in  Jerusalem at the center of a dispute between Egyptian and  Eritrean Copts] is one of the pending issues between Egypt and  Israel. Why didn't the Israeli authorities intercede to solve  it when an Israeli judicial verdict was handed down to give Dayr  al-Sultan to the Egyptian Copts?    [Peres] The problem is not between us and Egypt but between  Egyptian and Eritrean Copts.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] The Israelis seized the keys of the church  and  handed it to the Eritreans. There is a judicial verdict in  favor of the Egyptian Copts.    [Peres] A ministerial committee will discuss the problem and  decide.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] Next I met Benyamin Netanyahu, the Likud  leader and successor to Yitzhaq Shamir, in a suite in the  Holiday Inn in Jerusalem. I asked: The voting in the Knesset  on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement demonstrated strong opposition by  the Likud Bloc. Why are you opposed to peace?    [Netanyahu] The Likud is opposed to the Declaration of  Principles agreement known as the Gaza-Jericho Agreement but is  not opposed to peace. The Likud signed the peace agreement with  President al-Sadat at Camp David in 1977. And the Likud started  the peace process with the Arab countries concerned at the  Madrid Conference. So what is said about us is untrue.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] Then why do you reject Israeli withdrawal  from  the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area?    [Netanyahu] No Israeli withdrawal should take place before  confidence is built between the Palestinians and Israelis. This  also applies to the Golan. I do not trust the security  arrangements being worked out with the Arabs. I will give you  an example: Iraqi President Saddam Husayn used to embrace the  amir of Kuwait and repeatedly declared that he would not enter  or occupy Kuwait. What did Saddam Husayn do afterward? He  occupied Kuwait. So how can I believe any talk about peace  between us and the Arabs unless we build confidence and bridges  between our peoples. They will merely be speeches full of air.  A genuine peace is one that is built through confidence between  the peoples. Naturally, the Arabs and Jews need time to build  this confidence.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] In your view, what is the future of peace in  the region after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho?    [Netanyahu] There are many questions that should not be  asked  now, not before we give peace a try. We are waiting to judge  the Palestinians. We want to build confidence between the  peoples first and then discuss the peace process and what might  happen.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] Does this mean that if the Likud assumes  power, it may revoke the agreement signed between the  Palestinians and the Labor Party led by Rabin?    [Netanyahu] This is untrue. The Israeli people agreed on  this accord. We are discussing building confidence and the  Palestinians should comply with the agreement.    ['Abd-al-'Ati] The Israelis insist that Jerusalem is their  eternal capital and the Arabs also insist that Jerusalem is the  capital of the Palestinian state and that they will not cede  Jerusalem. Your comment?    [Netanyahu] Jerusalem is Israel's eternal capital and there  will be no going back. We will not even accept partitioning the  city. Let us give peace a chance, for there is a long way to go  and there are other issues before the negotiating committees.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Jakovcic, leader of the Istrian </F> Democratic Assembly, by Ingrid Steiner; place and date not  given: "Every Time New Borders Were Drawn Here, a Desert  Remained Behind"]    [Text] [Steiner] What would autonomy mean for Istria?    [Jakovcic] It would mean more financial independence for us  and more powers at the provincial level. At the moment Croatia  is a super-centralized state, all power is in President  Tudjman's hands. We are not even permitted to manage the tourism  advertisements for Istria. We also do not have any influence on  the top echelons of our companies. In no case, however, would  autonomy mean separation from Croatia. We want full solidarity  with the Republic of Croatia.    [Steiner] Thus, changes of the borders are out of the  question?    [Jakovcic] Every time new borders were drawn in our region,  this ended in a drama. We do not want any new tragedies. The  national borders between Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia are to  remain as they are. However, it is not logical that Istria is  cut in two halves so sharply and that the authorities are  managing the border checks so painstakingly. The border should  be overcome but not changed.    [Steiner] Must Istria again fear territorial claims by  Italy's extreme right?    [Jakovcic] Istria is not Italian. Romans, Slavs, and  Teutons always met here. And today, too, Italians, Croats,  Serbs, and Albanians live here together. Even though the Croats  are the majority, we support our minorities absolutely. We have  learned our lessons from history: from the expulsion of the  Croats by the Italian fascists, from the expulsion of the  Italians from communist Yugoslavia. What remained behind always  were civilizational deserts.    [Steiner] What is Istria's attitude toward a return of the  expelled Italians?    [Jakovcic] If Croatia wants to join Europe, a solution must  be found so that the Italians can buy back their former land.  This problem must be dealt with pragmatically and must not be  politicized. We know that the people who lived here want to  return. But we do not want to accept new tragedies.</p>

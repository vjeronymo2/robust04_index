			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HELMETS CAN ALSO PROTECT BICYCLISTS FROM INJURIES  </P> <P> This is in regard of the controversy over helmets being required for  motorcyclists. There is much evidence that proves that the helmet can save the  rider from serious injury. I am sure that people who ride motorcycles are well  aware of the dangers and preventive measures.  </P> <P> These riders that refuse to wear (helmets) want their freedom from the burden.  It is obvious they do not mind if they fall and crack their head open. So why  should we?  </P> <P> There is really no point to press the issue forward if there is so much  resistance. It does not make sense why someone would want to make such a big  deal over it if they do not even ride bikes.  </P> <P> STEVEN KIKAWA  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

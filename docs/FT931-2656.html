			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar faces legal threat TRAFALGAR HOUSE may be sued for failing to pay the second instalment to Davy Corporation shareholders following its controversial takeover of the stricken contractor. Two former institutional shareholders in Davy have threatened legal action unless they receive compensation from Trafalgar, the construction, engineering and shipping group. Bear Stearns, the US securities House, and Gruss Partners, the US investment company, believe Trafalgar's offer document for Davy, acquired in June 1991, was misleading. Yesterday they sent a letter, through their solicitor, Goodman Derrick, to Mr Alan Clements, Trafalgar's chairman, asking for compensation to avoid litigation. Trafalgar said: 'There is no substance to the claims and we will resist them with the utmost vigour. The issues raised in the letter have previously been considered by the Takeover Panel, which ruled in Trafalgar's favour.'

The second instalment depended on it drawing upon an Pounds 118m letter of credit from Midland &amp; Scottish Resources, which was operating the Ocean Emerald Rig, in the North Sea. Trafalgar was unable to draw upon the credit and therefore did not pay the second instalment, totalling Pounds 54m. Trafalgar believes it was let down by MSR, which was unable to obtain a so-called section 10, ship mortgage guarantee, from the Department of Trade and Industry. However, Goodman Derrick's letter says: 'It seems to us - and to leading Counsel - that it must have been well-known to all those concerned on behalf of Trafalgar House that at the time of the offer document, it was far from a formality to expect the section 10 certificate to be forthcoming from the DTI. 'By referring only to the need for contraction completion . . . our clients were misled into believing that the only conditions which had to be complied with related to completion of the contract and its related formalities.' Bear Stearns and Gruss Partners believe they lost Pounds 1.4m and Pounds 471,000 respectively - the difference between the price received for the shares, 50p, and the highest market figure in the relevant period, which was 91p. Mr Barry Cohen, senior managing director of Bear Stearns, said: 'There are a lot of disgruntled former Davy institutional shareholders.'</p>

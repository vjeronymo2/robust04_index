According the embassy statement made public today,  information published recently in the Lithuanian mass  information media might create an impression that Sweden was  stopping its entire assistance to the Ignalina nuclear power  station because of legal problems with Belarus. This is not  true.    According to the statement by the Swedish Embassy, the  Swedish Government has allocated about 120 million Swedish  kroner to finance 20 various projects linked with the Ignalina  nuclear power station. Nineteen of these projects are not  influenced by the fact that Belarus has so far failed to sign  the Vienna convention on responsibility for nuclear accidents  and pass corresponding laws. The project influenced by the  Belarusian stance is valued at about 10 million Swedish kroner.  The Swedish Embassy hopes that Belarus will eliminate legal  obstacles and this project, important to the reactor, will be  soon fulfilled.</p>

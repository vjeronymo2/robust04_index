			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Major gives his strongest hint of Budget tax cuts: Tory MPs say PM 'boxed in' to April poll THE CLEAREST signal yet that the government will use a tax-cutting Budget to pave the way for an April 9 election was given by Mr John Major yesterday. Despite the sharpest increase in the current account deficit for a year, senior ministers privately insisted that the gloomy economic outlook would not disrupt plans for an April poll. They also stressed that the government would not be deflected by opinion polls running against it. Backbenchers were told to steady their nerves in case opinion polls, due this weekend, show Labour improving on the most recent findings. The parties have been running neck and neck but the most recent opinion poll gave Labour a three-point lead over the Conservatives. There was ill-disguised annoyance at speculation that Mr Major might want to reconsider his options in the light of recent poll results and poor economic indicators, reinforced yesterday by the Pounds 1.1bn January visible trade deficit. Dismissing reports of a rethink as 'absolute rubbish', one senior Tory cabinet minister said: 'We are not going to take decisions on the basis of two poll results and a couple of nervous backbenchers.' While no final decision has yet been taken, most Conservative MPs conceded that the government is now firmly 'boxed in' to an April 9 ballot. Any postponement would allow Labour to claim that the Tories knew they could not win and would provoke irritation among the electorate, one MP said. It was also increasingly clear that uncertainty over the political outlook was reinforcing the economic downturn by delaying companies' investment decisions. Few Tory MPs appear to believe that there is much to be gained by holding out until the very end of the parliament in June in the hope of better economic conditions. In a rowdy Commons, Mr Major employed the clearest language so far to make clear his backing for a tax-cutting Budget. When Mr Neil Kinnock insisted that Conservative planned to cut taxes, raise expenditure and balance the budget were 'dishonest and absurd', the prime minister rounded on his opponent. 'It is quite staggering how terrified you and your party are of tax cuts,' he told the Labour leader, adding later that Labour would cripple industry with a national minimum wage and 'substantial tax increases'. Mr Major was equally combative with Mr Paddy Ashdown when the Liberal Democrat leader challenged him to justify tax cuts instead of increasing public investment. The prime minister said that, in the past, Liberals had 'trusted people with their own money and believed they could make their own decisions'. No clear confirmation of the April 9 election date need emerge until two days after the March 10 Budget, when it is widely assumed the prime minister will go to Buckingham Palace to seek a dissolution. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, is thought likely to proceed with a conventional business statement next Thursday, outlining normal procedures to follow the Budget. Strenuous efforts are under way to complete the passage of three bills through parliament. Next Wednesday, the Local Government Finance Bill that replaces the poll tax with the council tax will be completed. Business managers also hope to finalise legislation setting up a commission to review the structure of local government and a bill that takes further and higher education colleges out of the control of local authorities.

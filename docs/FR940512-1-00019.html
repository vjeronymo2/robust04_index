This proposal would require a revision to the Flap Control Unit input wiring. This proposal is prompted by reports of disconnection of the Landing Gear Module electrical connectors, which can result in the loss of the primary, secondary, and alternate control of the flaps. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the possibility of an all-flaps-up landing due to the loss of control of all flap operations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by June 13, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;61&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Boeing advises that, if the Landing Gear Module connectors become disconnected, all Flap Control Unit (FCU) modes of flap operation (primary, secondary, and alternate control of flaps) could be lost. There has been one occurrence of a partial disconnection of these connectors during a flight test of one airplane, which resulted in some of the flaps failing to extend. In another incident, there was a partial disconnection of these connectors on one in-service airplane that occurred while the airplane was on the ground; this situation prevented the airplane from being dispatched.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disconnection of the subject connectors could result in the loss of all three modes of flap operation. If this were to occur, the pilot would be unable to change the position of the leading and trailing edge flaps. This condition, if not corrected, could result in an all-flaps-up (flaps retracted) landing and consequent high landing speeds that could cause the airplane to run off the runway before being able to stop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;27A2346, dated April 28, 1994, that describes procedures for revising the FCU input wiring by moving two of the three FCU inputs from the ``Alt-Arm'' switch to the Alternate Flap relays. This will keep the FCU's in the Primary Hydraulic/Pneumatic operation mode if the Landing Gear Module connectors become disconnected, and would allow the pilot to maintain primary and secondary control of the flaps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require revising the FCU input wiring. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

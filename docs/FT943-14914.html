			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Traders brace themselves for a rush of new issues Traders are bracing themselves for a rush of new issues this week, despite continuing nervousness in the world's government bond markets. To start the week, Italy's Dollars 4bn offering of floating-rate notes in dollars, D-Marks and yen was officially launched, and is due to be priced today. The Dollars 1.5bn portion denominated in US dollars will have a discounted margin of 11 to 13 basis points over Libor, while the D-Mark tranche, totalling DM1.25bn, will be priced to give a discounted margin of 12 to 14 basis points over Libor. The smaller size and more generous indicated pricing of the D-Mark portion reflects the weaker demand for D-Mark FRNs following last week's large offering by Portugal. In order to entice investors, the first coupon will be set over six-month rather than three-month D-Mark Libor, because many investors expect rates to fall within six months. However, dealers said there is still some way to go before the issue is fully placed. The yen tranche, the largest of the three at Y175bn, will be priced at 8 to 10 basis points over Libor. The larger size and tighter pricing of the yen tranche reflects the strength of demand, mainly from Japan where investors still have a lot of cash to invest in the market, according to one of the lead managers. That tranche has already been exhausted, dealers said. 'The easiest sales were into Japan, which is not surprising given the current strength of the yen,' said one trader. All three tranches will pay  1/16 point over Libor, but their issue prices will differ. Also in the yen sector, the Kingdom of Spain launched a Y150bn issue of 10-year bonds, priced to yield 25 basis points over the comparable Japanese government bond yield, via Nikko Europe. Dealers said the fixed-rate offering was targeted at a totally different group of investors, so the issue did not compete for attention with Italy's floating-rate transaction. However, the 10-year maturity of the Spanish deal proved a deterrent for some investors, given the recent bond market volatility. In addition, there is some concern about the volume of paper in the yen sector. As well as a spate of smaller offerings last week and yesterday, Credit Foncier de France is expected to launch a Y75bn to Y100bn deal, also maturing in 10 years, later this week. However, dealers said the Japanese are still keen buyers of yen assets at the right price. The yield spread on the Spain issue widened by one basis point to 26 basis points, according to lead manager Nikko. Still to come in the dollar sector are global offerings of Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn for Finland today and Dollars 1.5bn for Freddie Mac, the US agency, by Wednesday. Dealers said sales of these transactions are likely to be skewed towards the US as European investors could be discouraged by the continued weakness of the dollar.</p>

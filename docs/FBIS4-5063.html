			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor  Yasushi Mieno told business leaders Wednesday [6 April] he sees  bright signs in corporate sentiment and such is reflected in the  real economy, a business leader said.    Mieno pointed to a slight increase in exports against the  backdrop of a strong U.S. economy and progress in reducing  corporate inventories and corporate restructuring, according to  Kenji Kawakatsu, vice chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren). Kawakatsu cited Mieno as saying that  was clearly not the picture a year ago.    But Mieno reportedly added he will continue to watch those  bright signs to determine whether they will lead to a  full-fledged economic recovery.    Mieno also said the strength of the yen in currency markets  continues to put pressure on the economy and stressed the  importance of private business vigor to ensure economic  recovery, according to Kawakatsu.</p>

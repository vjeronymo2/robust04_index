			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / European business backs Bush by narrow margin BUSINESS leaders in the EC have given President George Bush a narrow endorsement, with 40 per cent saying he would be better for European business than either of his rivals for the White House, Our Foreign Staff writes. An opinion poll of more than 1,400 business leaders in seven Community countries put him five points ahead of Mr Bill Clinton. Mr Ross Perot was backed by only 1 per cent, although he did re-enter the race after interviewing had begun. The poll was conducted by Harris Research for the UPS Europe Business Monitor. The preference for Mr Bush was strongest in the UK, with 69 per cent indicating that he was the candidate who would do business in Europe the most good, or anyway the least harm. However, Mr Clinton was the favourite in four countries - France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands (the last two were accorded a smaller weighting in the poll). Germany backed the incumbent, by a 14-point margin. Respondents in Spain found nothing to choose between the two men.</p>

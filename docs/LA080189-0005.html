			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. STRATEGY FOR NUCLEAR RESPONSE  </P> <P> I want to thank Toth for his chilling three-part series. Coupled with the  (Northrop) ad on Page 7 for the stealth bomber, it made quite an impression on  me. I am in disbelief. I really believed that the era of the Evil Empire of the  Soviet Union was over. Obviously, I have been in a dream world. The scenes of  President Reagan and President Gorbachev signing the nuclear missile reduction  agreement, the words of President Bush about moving toward de-escalation of  tension are vivid but apparently illusory.  </P> <P> We must as citizens of this planet speak out. The leadership of this country  needs desperately to hear from us. Please write or phone your representatives  and let them know how you feel about the $305-billion defense budget.  </P> <P> FLORENCE HORGAN  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Prof. Katsumi Kaneko et al. of the Chiba University  Department of Physical Science have found out that, by cladding  activated carbon fibers with magnesium oxide or magnesium  hydroxide, absorption of methane gas can be increased 1.5 times.  These results tie in to a solution for the problem of methane  tanks taking up space in compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles,  which are drawing attention as low pollution vehicles.    Prof. Kaneko et al. focused on the phenomenon of gasses  being  compressed on solid surfaces when the gas molecules are absorbed  and used this on methane. Normally, porous absorbents that have  many microscopic holes can absorb large volumes of gas molecules  through the physical strength of the solid surface. However,  since at room temperature methane is in a super-critical state  that differs from normal gasses or liquids, it is a ``dry''  molecule is not absorbed easily by solid surfaces.    On the other hand, numerical computations have predicted  that  absorbents that have pores of the size of two methane molecules  absorb methane comparatively easily. This is because methane  molecules are efficiently affected by the physical strength from  the surface of the holes they face, and an absorbent with hole  diameters of about eight angstroms (8/10,000,000) into which two  methane molecules just fit is necessary.    However, Kaneko et al. saw that just considering the size of  the pores was not enough and also approached the problem from  another direction. They found that if magnesium oxide or  magnesium hydroxide is dispersed on the surface of activated  carbon fibers, these materials change the properties of methane  molecules and make absorption by the solid surface easier. In  addition, they found that the amount of the increase in  absorption varies with the type of absorbent, the type of metal  oxide or hydroxide dispersed and the pressure of the methane.    Kaneko et al. see that ``there are possibilities for use of  absorbents with dispersed metal oxides or hydroxides in fuel  tanks for automobiles.'' From here on, they will aim at  development of methane absorbents on a level that can replace  methane tanks in automobiles.</p>

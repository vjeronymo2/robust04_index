			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> KAREEM TAKES ON FILM PROJECT  </P> <P> Less than a year after retiring from basketball, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has  bounced back into the public eye with an executive producer berth on the motion  picture "Recruiting Violations."  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar was tapped for the project on the basis of his basketball  expertise.  </P> <P> The movie centers on the relationship between a white college basketball coach  and a top black recruit who fails to show up on campus.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar will be involved in development of the screenplay and packaging of  the film, said Rob Fried, whose Fried Films is making the movie for Columbia  Pictures.  </P> <P> The former Los Angeles Lakers star won't be appearing in the film.  </P> <P> "I don't foresee that. I just want to do this on the production end and get my  feet wet that way," Abdul-Jabbar said.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar is currently touring with his book "Kareem," and he expresses  mixed feelings on the possibility of a motion picture version of the book.  </P></p>

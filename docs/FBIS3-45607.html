From Beijing to all localities, many newspapers increased the  number of pages in each issue or increased the number of issues  each month. A total of 150 newspapers all over the country took  this action at the same time.    A few years ago, dozens of newspapers simultaneously  increased the number of pages, and the action attracted  extensive attention. Last year, another 130 newspapers joined  the action to increase pages, and this was widely discussed by  people. This time, as of New Year's Day, at least 150  newspapers increased the number of pages or issues. In Beijing  alone, 46 newspaper joined this round of expansion, which is the  third such round.    In the new year, RENMIN RIBAO will be expanded to 12 pages  each day, GONGREN RIBAO has expanded its Sunday issue to eight  pages, FAZHI SHIBAO has been expanded to eight pages from four,  BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO was changed into a daily, BEIJING WANBAO  expanded to 16 pages, JINRONG SHIBAO expanded from four pages to  eight pages, SHENZHEN SHANGBAO expanded to 12 pages, and  CHANGJIANG RIBAO expanded to 12 pages after becoming an 8-page  daily last year....    What has prompted the newspapers to increase their pages?  Market competition caused such changes.    At the end of 1991, a total of 1,543 newspapers were openly  published. At the end of 1993, this had increased to 2,030.  That is, a new newspaper was published every one and a half  days last year. As education in China remains rather backward,  there are still a considerable number of illiterates, and the  number of newspaper readers is still limited, there are in fact  too many newspapers in mainland China. This inevitably  intensifies competition among the newspapers. As a result,  competition exists in terms of quality, price, distribution,  personnel, advertising, and business operations. By means of  increasing pages, newspapers may offer more information and  carry more advertisements. So this has become the major means  of competition to attract readers. Therefore, newspapers have  now become thicker with each issue, and some weeklies have  become dailies. There is more substantial content, and the  layouts have also become more attractive.    While increasing the number of pages and issues, many  newspapers also complete printing and distribution earlier, and  they have diversified their distribution channels in order to  occupy a larger share of the market and to bring more  convenience to their readers. More and more newspapers now bear  responsibility for their own profits and losses, do not rely on  government financial support, and do not depend on institutional  subscribers using public funds to subscribe to newspapers. At  present, more than 700 newspapers in the whole country have  adopted laser composition and printing technology, and the  newspaper advertising business is also developing rapidly. Last  year, more than 10 newspapers earned over 100 million yuan in  advertising income.    The newspaper management organ in the CPC Central Propaganda  Department has pointed out some noticeable problems amid the  rapid development of the press: Some newspapers have tried to  seek a greater "market effect" by publishing "weekend editions"  and increasing the number of pages, but they did not consider  the social effects of publishing pictures and stories which were  vulgar and in bad taste in order to attract readers. Some  newspapers even reprinted materials from the overseas press in  violation of the state's relevant regulations, thus causing a  disorderly situation in the press. The concerned authorities  have noticed these problems.    Of course, the increase in newspaper pages has inevitably  led  to higher prices. One year ago, 400 yuan a year could be used  to subscribe to four to five newspapers, but the same amount can  now be used to subscribe to only two newspapers. This year,  newspaper prices will increase by 100 percent in the most  extreme cases. Some experts predict that overall newspaper  circulation will decrease sharply.</p>

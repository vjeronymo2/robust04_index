			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: Paramount in Dollars 400m purchase PARAMOUNT Commun ications, the New York based entertainment and publishing group, yesterday announced a significant diversification, paying Dollars 400m for a series of regional US theme parks. The acquisitions of Kings Entertainment Company, owner of three big parks, and of Kings Island, a theme park near Cincinnati that was owned by American Financial Corporation, represent the biggest diversification move since Paramount registered a gain of more than Dollars 1bn in 1989 when it sold off The Associates, a financial services company. Mr Martin Davis, Paramount's chairman, has been keen to spend some of the proceeds of the financial services sale on an entertainment-related venture. Paramount, which owns Simon and Schuster, the New York publisher, as well as a major Hollywood studio, thus joins the ranks of the Walt Disney Company and MCA/Universal. Unlike these two, whose parks are linked to resort complexes, Paramount's parks draw local and regional customers on day trips. Kings also has a 20 per cent stake in Canada's Wonderland, based near Toronto. This park is also managed by Kings. Combined revenues of the theme parks being acquired are expected to exceed Dollars 250m this year, according to Paramount. A newly formed subsidiary  - Paramount Parks  - will manage the parks under the leadership of Mr Nelson Schwab, who heads the investor group selling Kings Entertainment to Paramount.</p>

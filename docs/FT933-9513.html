			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Fears on ground hit plans in the air NATO OFFICIALS were yesterday engaged in a feverish round of behind-the-scenes negotiations as ambassadors for the 16 alliance members met in Brussels to discuss the logistics of air strikes against Serbs in Bosnia. But with the situation in Sarajevo confused following the partial withdrawal of Serb forces from Mount Bjelasnica, one of the strategic heights around the city, the Canadian, British and French delegations reiterated concern that air strikes could endanger troops on the ground. Another complicating factor emerged when it was revealed French troops had been deployed on Mt Igman, parts of which are still Serb-occupied. After a week of anxious diplomatic discussions, Nato officials yesterday said the alliance had broad agreement on the military structure for the threatened air strikes. The US delegation hailed the agreement as a diplomatic breakthrough, although it fell short of original proposals. An official said: 'This entire initiative is President Clinton's' Later, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned that Nato was ready to take 'forceful action' against Bosnian Serbs. 'The alliance now has in place all the means necessary to take forceful action against the Serbs should they not cease their intolerable behaviour,' he said. Nato officials said the decision was largely the result of intensive bilateral discussions between the US, Canadian, French and British in the days - and hours - up to the meeting. The draft declaration had, they added, been largely drawn up by these four countries. Nevertheless, Nato sources yesterday pointed out that differences remained among the allies in the crucial definition of what type of action would be needed by the Serbs to avert air strikes, and what was necessary for the air strikes to go ahead. 'Everyone says that air strikes should be used as a last resort. The problem lies in agreeing the last resort,' said one Nato official. The military plan proposes a series of graduated options for air strikes and specific targets that might be attacked. However, Nato officials yesterday refused to detail what these were, although they stressed that any response would be proportional and that the targets would only be within Bosnia, but could include targets outside the Sarajevo area. Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: In a statement which suggested more German caution about western military intervention than apparent in recent government pronouncements, Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned that any air strikes must take into account consequences for civilians. Any attempt to end the fighting in former Yugoslavia with military means would unleash a war with catastrophic consequences. But he supported Mr Clinton's proposal for limited air strikes against specific military targets, if backed by the UN Security Council.</p>

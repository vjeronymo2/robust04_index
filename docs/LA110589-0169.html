			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK PRIZE WINNER: HISTORY;  </P> <P> THE LIONS OF JUDAH IN THE JUNGLE OF HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> "Giving chicken soup to Cossacks" is how Lillian Hellman acidly characterized  the reaction, craven in her view, of the movie industry's Jewish moguls to the  machinations of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). One by  one these wizened tycoons -- whose brutality, calculated risk-taking and sheer  shamelessness were already, by the early 1950s, the stuff of legend --  capitulated without even token resistance to an anti-Communist campaign with  anti-Semitic overtones that, as Neal Gabler shows, eerily substantiated fears  that had accompanied them ever since they transformed their empire of  back-street nickelodeons into Hollywood.  </P> <P> Hollywood was created by a remarkably homogeneous group of Central and Eastern  European Jewish men. Their desire to remake themselves, extinguish their pasts  and transcend the hostilities of the old world and the more subtle ones of the  new fueled their all-but-insatiable ambitions to rule, to patronize and to  assimilate. Hollywood, their magic kingdom, was created, Gabler tells us, to  provide an imaginary, and tragically tenuous, haven in what they never ceased  to feel was a heartless world.  </P> <P> Readers of Yiddish and Hebrew literature of the late 19th and early 20th  Centuries already will be familiar with figures resembling Paramount's Adolph  Zukor or Columbia's Harry Cohn: men whose reactions to the poverty,  marginality, and impenetrable intergroup resentments of Eastern Europe would  make them into victims, and then monsters of retribution and resentment.  Victims are by no means inevitably saintly, the "grandfather" of Yiddish  literature, Mendele Mochor Seforim, knew well, and catastrophe unleashed  unsavory, sometimes truly hateful passions. A considerably more sanitized  version of the East European Jewish past was eventually, and quite  successfully, promulgated in America, and Gabler's admirable book illuminates,  among many other things, an otherwise neglected feature of European Jewry's  desperate, fearful transmutations of the last century.  </P> <P> A nasty, mutually antagonistic coterie of "furriers" is how they were  frequently called by their (often justifiably) resentful actors, writers,  technicians and bankers who saw their rise from the prototypically Jewish  trades to the incomparably glamorous movie industry to be jarring, even  inexplicable. Yet at the time when these would-be moguls, some prescient and  others just uncannily lucky, first embarked on their careers -- typically  haphazardly, as one of various ways to make a buck in an unfamiliar, often  hostile turn-of-the-century America -- the movies they promoted were but brief,  low-status entertainments for working men and women.  </P> <P> It was they who transformed the primitive moving pictures, the products of very  recent technical advances by Edison and others, into America's most popular  entertainment form by the early 1920s. Nickelodeons were replaced by movie  palaces, (sufficiently opulent to satisfy the escapist needs of the working  class and to capture the respectable middle class) short flicks expanded into  features, their obscure players made into stars, and eventually, by the late  1920s, their visual pleasures enhanced immeasurably by sound.  </P> <P> The men responsible for all this had no special technical expertise, little  literacy, typically a spotty command of English, and not much money or  prestige. Indeed, had they come from the right side of the tracks they probably  never would have found their way into the dives that featured the first penny  movies that they so dramatically transformed. What they did have, by virtue of  their experience in the clothing trade, was a practiced sense of what  constituted popular taste, a willingness, even a hunger, to take chances, keen  merchandising skills, and an ability to mediate and shape the preferences of  disparate groups. In their first few years in the movie business they lost big  sums and moved from good addresses to dismal ones without losing face, friends  or confidence. (This would change when they reached the top.) And they entered  the industry (a term they coined and preferred) with an insatiable, restless  need to win, an abiding sense that a poor man was a broken man and that they  could only make their way in a Gentile world by bringing it to their feet.  Their heirs, not surprisingly, lacked their combativeness and their talent;  these were the products of unhappy pasts so different from those spent in the  considerably more benign California climate to which these moguls moved once  they began to produce, merchandise and distribute their increasingly lucrative  and prestigious films.  </P> <P> They moved to Los Angeles because the weather allowed shooting movies  throughout the year. In what is one of the book's best sections, Gabler  describes the content of their daily lives. Never since Fitzgerald's "The Last  Tycoon" has this feverish, grittily competitive, strangely cloistered  ("Suddenly Stahr could think of no place . . . Where did people meet?"), and  irredeemably exhausting routine -- one in which even leisure time was spent in  endless hours of competition involving gambling, horse racing and womanizing --  been told as fully and convincingly. Their family lives were publicly pristine  but, in fact, typically vacuous, authoritarian and distant; their friendships  were usually based far more on utility than sentiment. Adolph Zukor relaxed,  and then only rarely, among Hungarian-born Jews like himself, and he was sure  to limit his intimate circle to men without clout or influence who consequently  could gain nothing professionally from the relationship.  </P> <P> As one Los Angeles producer recalled: "There used to be a kind of floating  Jewish population. We'd go to Palm Springs. We'd go to Coronado. We'd go to  Pebble Beach and Arrowhead Springs and Arrowhead Lake . . . They'd go down on  Saturday afternoon and come home on Sunday night, and they'd stay overnight and  play cards. . . . They never discussed anything. They just played cards."  </P> <P> In their movies -- which they influenced, Gaber suggests, more than their  directors did -- they projected images of an America that were wholesomely  domestic (Louis Mayer's forte) or stylish, continental, witty -- a congenial  place where people like themselves would be treated as full, honored members  and which did not exist beyond their vaulted studio sound rooms. Ethnicity they  eschewed, except for the Warners, who proved an exception to most of these  rules. Jews as film characters they believed were unsaleable; as actors they  were rendered virtually unrecognizable until HUAC publicized their original  names. (Julius Garfinkle was made by Hollywood executives into John Garfield,  Emmanuel G. Goldenberg into Edward G. Robinson.)  </P> <P> When Garfield protested his new name, which he pointed out was the name of a  President, and countered, "You wouldn't name a goddam actor Abraham Lincoln,  would you?" he was told, "No, kid, we wouldn't, because Abe is a name that most  people would say is Jewish and we wouldn't want people to get the wrong idea.")  </P> <P> Accusations that this was a Jewish-dominated industry (by 1936, 53 of the 85  producers in the United States were Jews) were, the moguls hoped, muted by  their efforts to ensure that neither their movies nor their lives retained any  of the residual influence of their European past, which they attempted to  expunge ferociously. They voted Republican when nearly all Jews were Democrats;  they loathed Roosevelt when Jews elsewhere worshipped him; their comments about  the suffering of Jews (even during the horrors of World War II) testified to a  fatal combination of repression and insensitivity, though in this instance  again Harry Warner stood out as unusually humane and responsive.  </P> <P> They understood, as Carey McWilliams wrote in the late 1940s, that "Jews have  been excluded from participation in the basic industries of the country, the  industries that exercise a decisive control over the entire economy. . . .  Generally speaking, the businesses in which Jews are concentrated are those in  which a large risk-factor is involved; businesses peripheral to the economy . .  . businesses which have traditionally carried a certain social stigma, such,  for example, as the amusement industry and the liquor industry." Never did the  moguls cease to fear that they would be robbed of what they spent a lifetime  building, by virtue of the ramblings of xenophobic ministers, hostile members  of congress, the plots of east-coast Gentile bankers, envious west-coast  competitors, or the Communist activities of their hapless writers.  </P> <P> A source of solace and inspiration, oddly enough, was their rabbi, Edgar Magnin  of Wilshire Boulevard Temple -- a man superbly suited for his role as spiritual  mentor to an insecure but relentless elite who sought the assurances of a rabbi  as long as he substantiated their rather base inclinations. Magnin was  charismatic, dogmatic and a source of endlessly facile, often crass, homespun  wisdom.  </P> <P> He was as shrewd as any of his powerful Hollywood congregants and the scion of  Central European Jews (in fact very rich ones) whose status was immeasurably  greater than that of the Eastern ones who had spawned the moguls.  </P> <P> He was no less preoccupied than they with the need to assimilate and, except  when it came to the espousal of virulently xenophobic patriotism, he avoided  discussion of values, social issues or even personal ethics. Magnin, a good  example of how the People of the Book have produced even rabbis who are wholly  unbookish, enabled his elite to believe that their deracinated, assimilationist  and bullish way of life was precisely what America expected of them.  </P> <P> How these men worked out their existential dilemmas in their movies is at the  core of Gabler's book, and his observations on this score are speculative,  probably inevitably so. They were, as he demonstrates, drawn to the movies by  chance but they remained, he says, in part because of the way in which this  medium helped resolve (or so it seemed) tensions that they never managed to  overcome intheir own lives. Speaking of "The Jazz Singer," that historic  milestone which launched movies with sound, Gabler suggests that this movie in  particular but film in general provided the moguls with a way to navigate  between tortuously conflicting demands: "The movies, after all, are a world of  possibility where anything can happen, and of all the themes in 'The Jazz  Singer,' this might have been the most important and the most telling for  theHollywood Jews. The movies can redefine us. The movies can make us new. The  movies can make us whole. And this is precisely how the Hollywood Jews would  use them."  </P> <P> Our story ends unhappily. In the end, they were left with precious little:  divested of their Jewish wives, their Jewish pasts, having discharged many of  their Jewish writers and executives during the hateful McCarthy years,  friendless in a milieu (shaped largely by them) where status was made and  squandered within the span of minutes, and lost in a raw and empty city devoid  of anything resembling the urban cultures they had known in their youth. Once  their companies were gobbled up by Coca Cola or Warner Communications, or taken  from them in corporate maneuvers, they came to resemble, rather uncannily and  despite their wealth, that faded mogul Schwartz in Fitzgerald's novel whose  suicide at the book's beginning prefigures the tragedy that eventually  envelopes its protagonist Monroe Stahr. Once rich, now poor, and consequently  desperate, Schwartz was "obviously a man to whom something had happened.  Meeting him was like encountering a friend who had been in a fist fight or  collision, and got flattened. You stare at your friend and say, 'What happened  to you?' And he answers something unintelligible through broken teeth and  swollen lips. He can't even tell you about it."  </P> <P> They created a universe of abiding images. And even if Coca Cola came to  control much of what they built, their classic works were colorized in a  flourish of rapaciousness of the sort familiar to the movies' creators, and  eventually Hollywood was made into a far more complex place than their  feudal-like domain, their legacy nonetheless remains potent. It is jarring to  speculate that the images of America that most animated Ronald Reagan, as his  biographers have amply demonstrated, were drawn more readily from the  assimilationist fantasies of Louis Mayer and others than they were from  anything even vaguely resembling American reality. Dorothy, Auntie Em, Andy  Hardy were more real to him, and remain more real to many others, than do the  main streets and alleys of America's cities. What can better attest to the  potency of these tycoons?  </P> <P> The most potent image that this reader was left with upon closing this  excellent book, and one not suggested by Gabler himself, was of  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's roaring lion, the ferocious symbol of the biggest of the  studios. Can this lion, growling at Mayer's audiences before each and every  screening, have been inspired, however unconsciously, by the lion of Judah,  among the best-known symbols of a culture that shunned representative art? Be  that as it may, Gabler's book provides a new and provocative gloss on our most  important, certainly our most pervasive, art form, and its study of the wages  of 20th-Century American Jewish assimilation is subtle, wise, and humane. This  original book is popular history at its best.  </P> <P> </P> <P> History Nominees  </P> <P> A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and American in Vietam by Neil Sheehan  (Random House)  </P> <P> Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-1963 by Taylor Branch  (Simon &amp; Schuster)  </P> <P> An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood by Neal Gabler (Crown  Books)  </P> <P> Highbrow / Lowbrow The Emergence of Cultural Hierarchy in America by Lawrence  W.

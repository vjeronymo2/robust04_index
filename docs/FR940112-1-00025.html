			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated both in the NOPR and above, the Commission intends to conduct a field test of the Form 1 software with volunteer respondents and, to the extent needed, modifications will be made. This field testing will be in addition to testing by the Commission's staff. In order to allow sufficient time for development and testing, the Commission concludes that the most prudent course at the present time is to defer implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the NOPR only addressed the adoption of an electronic filing requirement and the effective date for that requirement (and a delegation of authority). It did not address the specifics of the electronic filing, its development and implementation. The Commission believes that the details of such development and implementation are best done at the staff level in the first instance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not specifically solicited in the NOPR, many of the commenters nevertheless made recommendations on features they would like to see included in the software, or that they felt needed to be included in the software. We anticipate that many of the recommendations will, in fact, be included in the initial version of the software. There are others which appear to be worthwhile features which are not contemplated for the initial version software, although they may be considered and included in future updates. We believe that other recommendations are without merit in that they are at odds with the intent of the Form 1 as a whole (i.e., uniform reporting), or the purpose of electronic filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is presently anticipated that the following features suggested by commenters will be incorporated in the initial software program:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Edit checking within pages and across pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Supplemental or continuation page feature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Use of data base structure in ASCII format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Compatibility with different types of printers, including laser printers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Footnote references on schedules by line items and written columns, including headings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. View screen option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Menu driven screens, including a help function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Support function to provide assistance to users when implementing the new software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. LAN compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain additional features suggested by commenters are not considered feasible for incorporation in the initial software, but may merit consideration in future software updates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These features include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Submission by modem rather than diskette.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Electronic dissemination capability to others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Incorporation of filings on a ``bulletin board'' accessible to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Providing a diskette to update Form 1 schedules without reissue of the entire software package each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The soldiers are expected to arrive in the Croat seaside  city  of Split Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday, after recovering  equipment from a Dutch navy frigate, they are to head to  Lukavac, where their battalion is based, and then on to  Srebrenica and Zepa, in eastern Bosnia.    The Defense Ministry spokesman said the 280 soldiers will  bring up to 1,100 the number of Dutch soldiers deployed in  Bosnia. An additional 150 are expected there by the end of the  month, he added. Additional Dutch soldiers are deployed in  ex-Yugoslavia and on air bases in Italy from where they enforce  the UN no-flight ban over Bosnia. Dutch troops are also  deployed along the Danube to enforce a trade embargo against  Serbia.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Philips to buy rest of Super Club MINORITY shareholders in Super Club, the loss-making Belgian video rental chain, agreed yesterday to sell the company to its biggest shareholder, the Philips electronics group of the Netherlands. Philips, which holds 51 per cent of Super Club's shares, offered earlier this month to pay BFr150 (Dollars 4.40) in cash for each of the 8.4m shares which it does not already own. Shareholders were also offered the choice of receiving warrants on Philips shares worth about BFr225 each. A majority of 98 per cent of shareholders accepted Philips' terms at a meeting of Super Club's holding company in Geneva. The vote brings to an end a dispute between Philips and several key minority shareholders about the value of Super Club's shares. The Dutch company wanted 100 per cent control of the heavily loss-making Belgian group to carry out a thorough restructuring programme. At their peak in 1990, Super Club's unlisted shares were worth more than BFr5,000 each on the Belgian over-the-counter market. The shares plummeted after a swift expansion programme landed the company in debt. Philips took majority control last year after a series of bail-out operations. Philips' increasing involvement in the Belgian company had come as a surprise because of Philips' own financial difficulties, but Philips management has defended the investment, saying the video-rental business complemented the company's production of VCRs.</p>

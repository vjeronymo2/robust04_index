			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIATHLETES TAKE DRUG TEST THAT THEY INITIATED  </P> <P> The first out-of-competition drug test for triathletes was given Wednesday at  San Diego State University.  </P> <P> The test was administered by the Triathlon Federation of the U.S.A. (TRIFED).  The program was developed by members of the International Federation of Elite  Triathletes (IFET).  </P> <P> "We're tired of being painted with the same brush as track and field athletes  and football players," said Scott Zagarino, executive director of IFET.  </P> <P> Registered letters were sent to 30 triathletes last week, ordering them to  appear at the SDSU Student Health Service Wednesday afternoon. If an athlete  signed for the letter and failed to appear, he was subject to suspension from  triathlon competition for two years -- the same penalty as there is for using  an illegal substance.

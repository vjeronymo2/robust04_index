			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DREXEL NAMED IN $516-MILLION LAWSUIT BY FDIC ON DALLAS S&amp;L  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the agency that insures deposits at  commercial banks, said today that it brought a $516-million lawsuit against  Drexel Burnham Lambert, E. F. Hutton and others related to the failure of a  Texas bank.  </P> <P> The suit stems from an alleged fraud scheme that the FDIC claims led to the  demise of the Guaranty Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Dallas, the  sixth-largest thrift in Texas.  </P> <P> Drexel, the once-powerful brokerage and investment bank whose parent company  filed for bankruptcy Tuesday, was a major underwriter of junk bonds.  </P> <P> Financially troubled E. F. Hutton was acquired in early 1988 by Shearson  Lehman. Shearson also is named in the suit, the FDIC said.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Dallas, seeks $129.2 million in  actual damages and $387.6 million in punitive damages from Drexel, Hutton,  Shearson and others.  </P></p>

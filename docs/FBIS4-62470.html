			<p>BFN     [Text] The talks in Moscow on the Karabakh settlement have  ended in failure. The signing of that protocol was actually  thwarted by the Armenian side, which demanded that the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh be defined and that, in parallel, troops from  the seized Azerbaijani territories be withdrawn.    Unfortunately, the Armenian mission in Moscow also confirmed  that the talks have ended in nothing. It blamed everything on  the Azerbaijani delegation, which allegedly refused to sign the  document.</p>

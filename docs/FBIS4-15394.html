			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russia's Choice parliamentary group approved at  its Thursday meeting the proposal made by Boris Fedorov, the  leader of the unregistered group December 12 Union, that the two  groups start closer cooperation on most important issues on the  agenda of the lower house.    Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar also told his supporters  that the December 12 Union was short of members to be registered  officially. It had 29 while 35 were needed for official  registration. The Russia's Choice adopted a decision saying  that it would not punish its members who voluntarily join the  December 12 Union.    Gleb Yakunin called for a closer bloc between the two  groups.  Gaydar supported the idea and said that he would help the  setting up of a club of democratic deputies. Gaydar also said  that he had called on Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of another  pro-democracy faction, to work closer together and that Fedorov  had done the same.</p>

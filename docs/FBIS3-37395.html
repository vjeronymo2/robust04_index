			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 31 (521) by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Leader of the Belarusian Parliament Mechyslaw Hryb  has given a negative response to the indefinite strike called by  the country's independent trade unions on Tuesday [15 February].    Speaking in Minsk, he described the situation as compounded  and called for political issues to be resolved through dialogue  but not pressure or violence.    Hryb is sure that the strike was not initiated on the ground  but from on high -- "the republican strike committee and  opposition People's Front which are in pursuit of their own  political goals having nothing to do with the interests of  ordinary workers." The strike organizers demand the resignation  of the government and dissolution of parliament.    The Belarusian leader says the strike "may delay the signing  of a monetary union with Russia."    He also said that in the emerging situation, "the law  enforcement bodies would act "within the legal framework and  check any illegal action."    For his part, Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich told Interfax  that "the strike committee is trying to disorganize the national  economy by capitalizing on economic hardships".    He described as groundless committee claims of calling for  widespread stoppages. The Prime Minister said a large part of  the factories came to a standstill for economic reasons long  before the strike was called.    Interfax correspondents in Minsk say that a crowd of about  2,000 people gathered in front of the Government House in  Independence Square at 12:00 Moscow Time, but all approaches to  the House itself are blocked by police units. Our  correspondents who inspected nearby streets say they found no  military hardware there.    The police are having to put up with the protesters'  violation of the government ban on any mass action, except on  state occasions, in Independence Square, a senior police  official told Interfax on condition of anonymity. He said the  police did not intervene to avoid "fuelling tension."    The demonstrators demand the government resign before the  parliament convenes on February 22 or face an indefinite strike.    The protesters have decided to stage a march to the  parliament building to hand in a petition demanding the  dissolution of parliament.    It is still unclear how many people are involved in the  general strike though preliminary reports from the regions say  the committee's call failed to drum up widespread support on the  ground.    In the meantime, messages of support to the strikers have  come from independent trade unions of Russia and Ukraine and  Russia's independent mineworkers unions, committee spokesman  Aleksandr Lysenko told Interfax.</p>

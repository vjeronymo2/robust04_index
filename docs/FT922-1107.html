			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Building society complaints soar COMPLAINTS to the building societies ombudsman more than doubled over the past year, according to the scheme's annual report. There were 9,525 complaints and inquiries to the ombudsman in the year to March 31 - six times the figure for 1987-88, the first year of the ombudsman scheme. Mr Stephen Edell, the first ombudsman, said a third ombudsman, Mr Brian Murphy, was appointed last month to help with the 'flood of complaints'. Mr Edell said he did not know why numbers had risen so quickly, but he said increased publicity as well as the recession might help account for part of the rise. The sharpest rise in complaints related to interest rates on investments, but the main factor in the rise was failure by building societies to alert customers to changes and replacements to accounts. Mr Edell said the onus was on individuals to look after their investments, and that there would be no pressure to force societies to inform account-holders in writing of changes to their accounts. Complaints relating to mortgage repossessions increased by 171 per cent over the year. However, Mr Edell said there were few cases in which action could be taken because the ombudsman lacks the power to stop repossessions and cannot deal with cases being handled by the courts. The most common complaint on repossessions was that properties had been sold too cheaply by building societies. Complaints about insurance more than doubled, mainly as a result of the fees customers are charged to take out insurance other than as a package. Mr Edell said most awards made were of hundreds of pounds or in the low thousands. He made formal decisions in 392 cases, of which 19 were resolved wholly in the complainant's favour.

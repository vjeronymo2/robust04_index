			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Spanish inflation rate falls to 6.2% SPAIN'S consumer price index was static in June, providing a welcome respite for the country's hard-pressed economic managers, who are busy preparing a series of tough measures to clamp down on public spending. Last month's pause in inflation draws annualised inflation down from 6.5 per cent to 6.2 per cent. The annual figure has risen as high as 6.9 per cent this year, after ending 1991 at 5.5 per cent. Nevertheless, the Finance Ministry said yesterday it was still concerned that the underlying rate of inflation - which excludes energy and processed foods prices - had fallen only slightly, to an annualised 6.7 per cent in June. The June figures, however, lend weight to the government's arguments that it is, indeed, capable of slowing inflation despite the fast growth in prices in the early part of the year. These were due partly to the imposition of new value added tax charges in January. Figures published late last week also show that unemployment dropped in June to 14.5 per cent, the lowest for a year. Nevertheless the government is likely to adopt measures before the end of this month to combat a 55 per cent increase in the public-sector deficit in the first five months of the year and a rise of more than 65 per cent in the current account deficit. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, seems likely to bring forward a VAT increase from 13 per cent to 15 per cent planned for next year and to raise taxes withheld on income, as well as to make sweeping cuts in public spending budgets not already committed for 1992. He is then likely to produce a tight 1993 budget in the autumn.</p>

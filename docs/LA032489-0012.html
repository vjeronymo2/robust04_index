			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Rival gangs squared off at a funeral service for a slain teen-ager in San  Francisco's Hunters Point district, but police were able to intervene and  prevent violence. The confrontation occurred between the Swampy Desert gang  from the Sunnydale housing project and the rival Hunters Point gang. The groups  come from housing projects located about two miles apart and police believe  they are involved in a turf battle for control of the lucrative crack cocaine  trade. Police said they were able to get between the gangs and break up a  hostile situation that occurred just after the funeral of Edric Carr, a member  of the Swampy Desert gang who was also known as Peter Lee. Carr was shot and  killed March 14 as he sat in a friend's car in Hunters Point. He was buried at  Colma cemetery, his gang cap resting on top of his casket and with a sign  reading, "Pete, Rest In Peace."  </P></p>

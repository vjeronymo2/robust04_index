Survival rates of 40 to  83.4% prevailed in mice infected intramuscularly with 8-10  LD[.sup]50[/] viral dose and treated per os or  intramuscularly with 0.01 or 0.05 mg/kg/day of reserpine (24 h  before infection and for 1-2 days thereafter, or 30-60 min after  infection and for 3-4 days thereafter). Analogous studies on  rabbits yielded 100% survival vs. 33.3% for  placebo controls.  Reserpine treatment was also seen to prolong the incubation  period two-fold. These observations indicate that reserpine may  be a promising agent for use in combined therapy of rabies in  conjunction with vaccines. Tables 2; references 10: 8 Russian, 2  Western.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Opening of tunnel rail link may be delayed until 2002 THE Pounds 2.6bn Channel tunnel rail link is to suffer a further delay as a result of the public spending squeeze and a decision announced yesterday to involve private sector companies from the outset. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced plans to bring the private sector into the project before legislation goes through parliament despite fears that this would delay completion by up to 12 months until at least 2002. Involvement of private sector companies at a very early stage will allow them to influence the design of the project. But it goes against advice from Union Railways, the company which has been developing the link, which wanted political uncertainties out of the way before involving the private sector. Trafalgar House, the construction group, said it welcomed the chance to become involved in the project at an early stage, although the way in which risk was shared between the public and private sectors would determine private sector interest. The company has revived its Eurorail subsidiary, a joint venture with BICC and General Electric Company, to look at this and other rail projects. In an attempt to improve the appeal of the project, the government said it would include European Passenger Services, the company that will operate international trains between London Waterloo, Paris and Brussels, in the project. This would give it a stream of revenue during construction. Companies which want to join a consortium to build the link will be invited in January to pre-qualify, and the tender documents will be sent out in the spring. Hill Samuel, the merchant bank which is advising the government, had met 'a great deal of interest', Mr MacGregor said. The timetable announced by him yesterday indicates a further slippage in the legislative and construction programme. A final decision on the route will not be taken until early next year - December had earlier been suggested as the deadline - and work preparing a hybrid bill will take at least until the autumn of 1994, and possibly into 1995. Getting the bill through parliament is expected to take 18 months and construction work is then expected to take another five years. Sir Keith Speed, a former minister whose Ashford constituency is affected by the rail link, said: 'I am frankly appalled. The last think we want after six years of bumbling from the Department of Transport is further delay.' Private companies will be asked to bid for the amount of government money they require, although the government is limited by the Channel tunnel legislation to helping to finance parts of the project which contribute to domestic rail services.</p>

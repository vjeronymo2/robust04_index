			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Montedison refinancing approved Montedison, the Italian industrial group controlled by the debt-ridden Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, yesterday got the green light from shareholders for an ambitious recapitalisation. Approval for the scheme, part of the wider rescue package for the entire Ferruzzi group, followed Tuesday's go-ahead from Ferfin shareholders for its own financial restructuring. The plan for Montedison, which controls the Montecatini chemicals group as well as Edison (energy) and Eridania Beghin-Say (sugar) envisages raising L5,172bn (Dollars 3bn) by a mixture of new shares and warrants. Montedison's board also gained approval to raise a further (nominal) L1,000bn in new shares and L500bn in bonds over the next 18 months. Mr Guido Rossi, chairman, said Montedison expected to raise about L3,629bn over the next five years from disposals, which would also reduce its debt burden by about L150bn. He gave no indication as to when the group might finalise 'Project Sophia', its ambitious joint venture in polyethelenes and polypropelenes with Shell. The new company due to be formed would be the world's leading supplier of such materials.</p>

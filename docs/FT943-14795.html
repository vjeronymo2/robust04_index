			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Council shake-up plans defy Gummer view The Local Government Commission for England yesterday repeated its recommendation that most of County Durham should keep a two-tier structure of local government, in spite of the refusal from Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, to accept this proposal when it was first made last year. Mr Gummer said he expected all-purpose unitary authorities, combining the functions of both district and county councils, to emerge from the review. The commission's refusal to alter its position is seen to signal its independence from the government. Its recommendation, following a second review of opinion in the area, is that Darlington should have unitary status, with the rest of the county covered by the county council and seven districts. Lead commissioners Mrs Ann Levick and Mr David Ansbro denied that the commission was challenging Mr Gummer and his enthusiasm for unitary authorities. Mrs Levick said: 'We are required to find out what local people want. It will be seen as an assertion of the commission carrying out its remit, within the terms of the guidance.' The commission, she added, was independent. 'I have broad shoulders. I have no problem with flak.' During the second review the commission received fewer than 100 representations, some of them questioning the need for the second review. This compared with 27,900 after its first review, of which only 12 per cent favoured a unitary district option. Mr Allan Roberts, chief executive of Sedgefield district council, which campaigned for unitary authorities, criticised the decision. He said: 'If the review's just going to be tinkering around with those authorities which are unpopular one has to question whether the whole exercise has been a waste of money.' The two-tier system is an option in both East and West Sussex under proposals published yesterday. The commission's preferred option would see unitary authorities in the east of the county, with two-tiers in the west. Both Brighton and a new authority merging the coastal districts of Hove, Adur and Worthing would become unitaries under all recommendations put forward. The preferred option for the rest of West Sussex is the two-tier system, while for East Sussex the commission suggests merging Eastbourne and Lewes with south Wealden including Uckfield, and Hastings and Rother with the rest of Wealden. The commission believes the plan for West Sussex could save 'up to Pounds 2m' a year and would cost up to Pounds 6m to implement. The unitary plan for East Sussex would be more expensive, costing between Pounds 22m and Pounds 25m to implement, with annual savings of between Pounds 2m and Pounds 7m. As alternatives, the commission suggests East Sussex outside Brighton should remain two-tier, cutting start-up costs to between Pounds 5m and Pounds 7m. West Sussex outside the coastal strip could be split into two unitaries, combining Arun - including Bognor Regis - with Chichester, and Crawley and Horsham with Mid-Sussex. But this option would cost between Pounds 22m and Pounds 24m to set up, with lower annual savings, potentially as little as Pounds 1m.</p>

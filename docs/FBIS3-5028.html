In his speech, P.M. [Prime Minister] Kiet said:    `This visit of yours is the first official one to our  country  ever in history by a head of government of Singapore. It takes  place only five months after the visit to Singapore by  Secretary-General Do Muoi and four months after the second visit  to Vietnam by his excellency Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. This  clearly proves that our friendly and cooperative relationship  has been incessantly growing in an broadening scope and with a  deepening and intensifying nature.    `It gives me great pleasure to note that, since my last  visit  to Singapore in October 1991, in line with the agreements and  arrangements which have been concluded to form a foundation for  the cooperation between our two countries, the volume of two-way  trade and particularly the investment in Vietnam by Singapore  have been increasing considerably. Singapore friends have  shared with us development experience, particularly in the key  area of infrastructure in which Singapore has proven strength  and Vietnam is interested. We greatly appreciate your valuable  ideas and suggestions, and assistance in training Vietnamese  personnel in various fields through the Indochina Assistance  Fund. I strongly believe that, your present visit and the  signing of the avoidance of double taxation agreement will help  further enhance the sound cooperation between our two countries  for the sake of prosperity of our respective countries and of  the region.    `In the recent years, the global and regional situation has  been changing greatly and profoundly. In the panorama of mixed  colours, the striking feature is the shared desire by nations  for a peaceful and secure environment for development, and the  growing trend of regional cooperation. Against this overall  context, the trend of peace, cooperation and development in our  region is all the more highlighted. Nowadays, Southeast Asia is  in the most favourable condition ever since the end of the  Second World War to lay down a foundation for cooperation in the  interest of durable peace and prosperity of the entire region.  Besides most encouraging achievements as a result of the  correct policy of `Doi Moi', in overcoming the socio-economic  crisis, in developing the economy and maintaining political  stability, Vietnam has recorded new successes in pursuing the  foreign policy of independence, sovereignty and openness in the  direction diversification and multilateralization. Our primary  interest is to further expand and strengthen cooperation with  the countries in the region, both bilaterally and  multilaterally. We stand ready to be hand in hand with the  Southeast Asian peoples to proceed towards a future of peace,  independence, prosperity and development.    `It is my firm conviction that your visit will not only  strengthen further the relations of friendship and cooperation  between our two countries, but also contribute to peace,  cooperation and development in Southeast Asia.    Prime Minister Kiet went on:    `We are indeed very satisfied with the results of the  exchanges of views we have had today. Mutual understanding and  confidence between us have been enhanced, areas of cooperation  broadened and promise brilliant prospect. Your visit will  therefore certainly mark a new development in the  Vietnam-Singapore cooperation'.    In his turn, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said `Your  excellency's visit to Singapore in October 1991 opened a new  chapter in our bilateral relationship. Since then, our  relations have strengthened rapidly, with several exchange  visits of top leaders.    The Indochina Assistance Fund has been used to fund  technical  assistance programmes for your country. Singapore has also  established the infrastructure task force to help Vietnam in its  development. We are pleased to share our development experience  with you and to help Vietnam plan and build its infrastructure.    `Singapore is now Vietnam's largest trading partner and  eighth largest investor. The Singapore private sector has  demonstrated its confidence in Vietnam through its increasing  investments. I hope that my visit here will pave the way for  more trade and Singapore investments in Vietnam'.    P.M. Goh Chok Tong continued: `Vietnam now has some  experience working with foreign investors. It has already  achieved good economic growth rates in the last two years. You  are blessed with abundant natural resources and a hardworking,  intelligent workforce. If Vietnam presses on with its `Doi Moi'  and makes foreign investors feel welcome, it can be another  dynamic east Asian economy.    `We welcome your accession to the treaty of amity and  cooperation in Southeast Asia.    Your foreign minister is now a regular participant at the  annual ASEAN ministerial meetings.    Vietnam is also one of the charter-members of the ASEAN  regional forum [ARF], which will meet again soon to discuss  regional political and security cooperation issues.    We hope that through both ASEAN and the ARF, our  relationship  will not only broaden but also deepen.    Together, we can work to safeguard Southeast Asia's  security'.</p>

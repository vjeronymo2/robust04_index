			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The strike by over 350 unionized workers at  Kalulushi Municipal Council entered its second day today, with  Mayor Moses Mumba vowing the council will not succumb to  workers' demands. Speaking to ZNBC [Zambia National Broadcasting  Corporation] in Kalulushi today, Mr. Mumba said it was  unacceptable for the workers to expect the council to award them  1,000 kwacha transport allowance when their homes are less than  a kilometer from their work place. Mr. Mumba said the council  has already awarded the workers the 5 percent allowance, an  indication of the council's commitment to the welfare of  workers. Meanwhile, garbage is pilling up in the town as  workers continue with the strike.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Savings from recycling 'low' Recycling aluminium cans and glass bottles can save energy and help the environment - provided people do not make too many trips in their cars to the bottle bank, according to a report published yesterday. However, recycling is ranked low for its energy saving potential in a list of household energy efficiency measures identified by the report. The report was commissioned by Nuclear Electric, the generator, from the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment at University College London. It concludes that if households adopted all of the 12 energy saving measures which it identifies, then Britain would cut emissions of carbon by 8m tonnes a year. Carbon dioxide is one of the main gases implicated in global warming. Under the climate change convention agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, Britain has agreed to cut carbon emissions by 10m tonnes a year. More than a quarter of households are deterred from making improvements to energy efficiency by cost, according to two Gallup polls carried out for the centre. Only 56 per cent of respondents in the surveys had loft insulation, a much lower figure than several government estimates. Although recycling is 'one of the most well-known energy saving measures', the report says, it scores lower than insulating cavity walls and lofts, draught-proofing or putting reflective foil behind radiators. Moreover, while Britain imports much coloured glass in wine and beer bottles, this cannot be recycled into the clear glass required by most UK manufacturers, the report points out. The National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors has been lukewarm about the environmental and commercial benefits of recycling glass, because of the transport costs and the lack of demand. It has been more enthusiastic about recycling aluminium cans on the grounds that it saves valuable raw materials as well as energy. The Consumer and the Environment. CSERGE. 071 380 7874.</p>

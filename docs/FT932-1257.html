			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged BTP in line with forecasts at Pounds 20.5m BTP, the specialist chemical company which in April bought most of the assets of the ailing MTM, made profits of Pounds 20.5m pre-tax last year, in line with forecasts made at the time of its rights issue to fund the deal. Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, said the current year had begun well. The challenge was now to sort out the loss-making parts of the acquired MTM assets and to raise the profitability of the rest of the group to the level achieved by BTP. Pre-tax profits in the year to end-March rose from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 20.5m on sales up 19 per cent at Pounds 208.8m. Earnings per share fell from 14.81p to 14.13p, following the issue of shares at the start of the financial year, and the group is recommending a final dividend of 6.05p (5.75p), giv-ing a total of 9.3p, up 5 per cent. Gearing at the year-end was 2 per cent. The MTM acquisition cost Pounds 100m, only Pounds 72.2m of which was raised via the rights issue. As a result, gearing is currently about 25 per cent, a level at which it is likely to stay. BTP's acquisition of most of MTM's assets was well received. From a level of 239p before the deal was announced, the share price has risen to close yesterday up 2p at 259p. Some Pounds 1.34m was charged to operating profit for bad debts, closure costs and the write-off of obsolescent plant during the year. Mr Buckley said that investment in new biocide technology and the enlargement of process chemical capacity combined with the commissioning of plant in Australia and the relocation of the Italian business augured well for a year of progress in existing businesses.</p>

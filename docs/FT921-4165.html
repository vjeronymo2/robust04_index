			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: ICI in Pounds 50m venture to make CFC replacement ICI is to invest Pounds 25m in a joint venture in Japan to make ozone-friendly refrigerants. Its partner is Teijin, the Osaka-based fibres and chemicals company. The venture will build a Pounds 50m plant at Mihara, near Hiroshima, the site of an existing collaboration between the two companies to make agricultural products. Teijin will be responsible for the production of the material, Klea 134a. ICI, which developed it, will market it for use in refrigerators and air conditioning units. 'We are the first with plants in Europe, North America and Asia to make CFC replacements,' said ICI Fluorochemicals yesterday. Klea 134a is designed to replace chlorofluorocarbons, which are blamed for damaging the atmosphere's ozone layer. The new factory will serve Asian-Pacific markets and will have an initial capacity of 5,000 tons a year when it comes on stream in 1993. ICI said it was in talks with vehicle makers in the region on supplying the chemical for air conditioning systems. Possible customers include vehicle manufacturers in China and Australia. The market for CFC replacements is growing rapidly as governments respond to the environmental dangers by insisting that alternatives are used. General Motors is to use Klea 134a from an ICI plant in Louisiana in its cars and truck air conditioning systems. ICI's first Klea 134a plant, in Runcorn, Cheshire, opened in 1990.</p>

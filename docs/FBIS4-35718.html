			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (INA) -- [Iraqi] Foreign Minister  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf met here today with Lal Bhatia, the  Indian minister of state for external affairs.    The foreign minister briefed his Indian counterpart on the  positive stands that prevailed at the recent UN Security Council  discussions concerning the lifting of the embargo clamped on  Iraq, and on the majority that called for taking measures to  lift the embargo as long as Iraq has implemented Resolution 687.    The talks dealt with relations between Iraq and India, means  of promoting them, and coordination between them. The two  ministers stressed the importance of reactivating the Nonaligned  Movement's role in international relations, of maintaining the  spirit and essence of the movement's principles, and of  reinforcing economic relations among its member states.    Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf also met with  Cypriot Foreign Minister Alexandros Mikhailidhis.    The foreign minister explained the positive stands at the  recent UN Security Council discussions, which have clearly shown  that Iraq has implemented all the UN Security Council  resolutions, and that what remains is a resolution to lift the  embargo imposed on Iraq without delay.    An INA correspondent in Cairo reported that the foreign  minister explained to the Indian and Cypriot ministers that the  Iraqi people, under the leadership of President Saddam Husayn,  are determined to foil the embargo and the chapters of  aggression. He also briefed them on the Iraqi people's efforts  to reconstruct what was destroyed by the aggressors.    Dr. Nabil Najm, Iraq's permanent representative to the Arab  League, attended the two meetings.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 LATINO RIVALS FOR SUPERVISOR SQUARE OFF;  </P> <P> ELECTION: THE CANDIDATES TAPE A TV DEBATE. DEMOCRATS MOLINA AND TORRES ATTACK  REPUBLICAN FLORES.  </P> <P> Three Latinos battling to become a Los Angeles County supervisor met face to  face for the first time Thursday in a spirited exchange at a TV studio, with  Democrats Art Torres and Gloria Molina uniting to attack Republican Sarah  Flores in the nonpartisan race.  </P> <P> "I see the opposition as Sarah Flores," said Molina at a taping of "News  Conference" at KNBC-TV's studio in Burbank.  </P> <P> Molina, a Los Angeles city councilwoman, contended that Flores' election would  preserve a conservative majority on the county board and would continue  policies that are contrary to Latino interests.  </P> <P> Flores, a soft-spoken former aide to retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum,  complained that the board suffers enough from partisan infighting. She promised  to bring a more cooperative spirit to the board.  </P> <P> But Molina said, "County government needs major reform. . . . You don't need  somebody who is status quo." She added that what the county does not need is a  "get-along kind of person."  </P> <P> The debate grew so heated at times that all three candidates were speaking  simultaneously.  </P> <P> Flores, Molina and Torres are among a large field of candidates expected to run  in a special Jan. 22 election in the new court-drawn 1st District. Rep. Matthew  Martinez (D-Monterey Park) also is a candidate, and there are several  lesser-known hopefuls.  </P> <P> The new district boundaries -- designed to help the first Latino in this  century win a seat on the board -- were approved by U.S. District Judge David  V. Kenyon who ruled that the boundaries drawn by the all-Anglo board diluted  the voting power of the county's 3 million Latinos.  </P> <P> During the half-hour show, Flores contended that she is the best qualified to  be supervisor by virtue of her 34 years of county service. "I have more  experience when it comes to county government."  </P> <P> But Torres interrupted, "It's going to take more than that."  </P> <P> "Unless you know the people in Sacramento . . . you can do all the talking you  want," Torres said. "You're going to need somebody more than a field  representative."  </P> <P> Flores, in turn, blamed Torres and Molina, a former assemblywoman, for the  county's budget problems. County officials have blamed cuts in services on  reductions in state funding.  </P> <P> Flores pointed out that the board includes two former assemblymen -- Mike  Antonovich and Pete Schabarum -- "and it didn't do any good" in helping the  county obtain more money from Sacramento.  </P> <P> Molina joined Torres in attacking Flores for receiving support from  conservative supervisors Antonovich and Deane Dana, who have voted to spend $5  million fighting the historic voting rights lawsuit.  </P> <P> "If I were there, that would not have happened," Flores said, referring to the  legal bills.  </P> <P> "So you're going to ask Schabarum, Dana and Antonovich to take back that money  and give it to health services," Torres shot back. "Yes or no? You're going to  tell them I will not accept your endorsement unless you give that money back to  health care. . . . Tell them, Sarah."  </P> <P> Flores did not respond. Instead, she asked Torres, "Why weren't you there,  Art?" during the court hearing on the redistricting lawsuit.  </P> <P> Molina accused Flores of opposing the voting rights suit. Flores, however,  countered that she did not oppose the lawsuit, but favored a different remedy  -- her November runoff against Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien in the old 1st  District. The runoff was canceled by the federal judge.  </P> <P> The spirited debate took on a humorous note when Torres, observing Flores'  political consultant, Ron Smith, waving from behind a TV camera to get his  candidate's attention, said, "Sarah, your promoters are telling you to smile  more."  </P> <P> The show will air at 2:30 p.m. Sunday on Channel 4.  </P></p>

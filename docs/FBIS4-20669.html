			<p>High   Speed Network   <F P=102> 94P60170A Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Mar 94 p 3--FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94P60170A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT)  will establish an experimental high capacity hookup among  research institutes using a high speed network that carries 60  times more communications channels than present lines. MPT's  Communications Research Laboratory (CRL), NTT, KDD, and Japanese  computer manufacturers will be connected, while MPT will seek  participation from overseas research institutions. This is an  effort to compete against the United States which is promoting  the National Research Education Network (NREN) program that  links universities and research institutes throughout the United  States. Both Japan and the United States are developing  strategies with which to enter the multimedia era by  establishing communications networks among research institutes  as the core of their program.    This network incorporates the latest ATM (asynchronous  transfer mode) switchboard which can control a large volume  optical fiber network capable of carrying information at a  maximum volume of 10 gigabits per second. Current NTT serviced  communications lines have a maximum capacity of 150 megabits per  second. The latest network's capacity is said to improve upon  this by 66 times.    MPT's CRL, Communications Network Research Institute  (Musashino City, Tokyo), KDD Research Institute (Kamifukuoka  City, Saitama Prefecture), NHK's Broadcasting Technical Research  Institute (Setagaya-ku, Tokyo), and the International  Telecommunications Basic Technology Research Institute (ATR,  Kyoto) representing a third sector, are to be connected. They  are expected to be joined in the future by the research  institutes of computer manufacturers, including NEC, Fujitsu,  and IBM Japan.    The MPT has named this experiment the "Global Gigabit  Network" (G Net), and plans to expand participation to include  overseas research organizations using an overseas high speed  network which KDD shares with AT&amp;T.    The G Net will focus on technical experiments concerning the  operation and maintenance of networks, and development of new  methods using supercomputers and databases owned by other  facilities. The new methods will cover a wide area of  communications including TV conferences through vivid images,  and remote medical applications through which medical images  will be transferred over long distances for diagnosis. They also  plan to include environmental research to analyze air pollution  and meteorological phenomenon on a global scale.    The MPT will spend &yen;488 million, a sum approved in the  third FY93 supplementary budget, to facilitate computers and  communication equipment at CRL. NTT will provide free of charge  large volume optical fibers, while each research organization  will arrange for their own equipment needs. Meanwhile, the  participating organizations will form a liaison committee. The  new network is scheduled to be ready by March 1995.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Optimists and pessimists clash on wages: David Goodhart presents opposing views in the debate on curbing income rises BRITAIN may be on the way to breaking the back of long-standing wage inflation. Many analysts remain sceptical, but evidence from the Confederation of British Industry pay databank encourages that conclusion. The CBI points to a third consecutive quarter with manufacturing settlements steady at 4.3 per cent while manufacturing productivity is growing at 3.2 per cent and inflation is 3.9 per cent and falling. It says: 'This is welcome evidence that pay behaviour is settling into a non-inflationary pattern.' Productivity in the service sector is scarcely improving at all, but pay settlements - led by the troubled finance sector - have tumbled, averaging 4.3 per cent for the first half of the year. The CBI's optimism is supported by some city analysts. Greenwell Montagu predicts that pay settlements will continue falling to 2.5 per cent by the end of next year and that growth in average earnings, which slipped below 7 per cent last month, will reach 4.6 per cent by then. Optimists say present settlement figures look even better from the perspective of company pay bills. Many companies, especially in manufacturing, are continuing to shed staff, so an average 4.3 per cent pay rise can mean a com-pany's pay bill is static or even falling. There is a remarkable amount of 'bunching' around the 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent level in the public and private sectors, but there is evidence to support the CBI's view that, at least in variations around that norm, pay is increasingly driven by business factors. The two clearest examples are chemicals and construction. The construction industry's difficulties are reflected in an average 2.5 per cent pay rise. The chemical industry has been more buoyant, with several companies agreeing 6 per cent or more in the first six months of this year. Industrial Relations Services, the research group, says pay freezes continue to affect a small but significant number of companies and are at about the same level as last year. Freezes have been concentrated in sectors such as retailing and in the parts of larger companies that have met hard times, such as British Steel's strip products division. The CBI's statistics, with the exception of those on productivity, are generally accepted by most other pay analysts. The organisation's conclusions are more controversial. Pay experts say the inflation rate remains central to pay bargaining. Ms Angela Wright of IRS says: 'We may be breaking with the idea of inflation-plus, but inflation remains a benchmark and we are still far off an inflation-minus approach.' Pessimists suggest that three consecutive quarters of rises at 4.3 per cent looks suspiciously like a floor for settlements. If that is the case, then the figure for national average earnings might not fall below 6 per cent for a very long time. The pessimists' most telling point is that the European exchange rate mechanism makes any favourable comparison with pay trends in the recession of the early 1980s irrelevant. It is true that in the early 1980s, with inflation similar to today's, the settlement floor was higher - about 5 per cent. But then the pound was about to embark on a long period of devaluation which cancelled out much of the effect of British wage inflation in international trade. Devaluation is ruled out by ERM membership. Wage increases must now be as low as or lower than those of Britain's main competitors. Good, albeit cyclical, productivity figures are keeping down increases in unit labour costs in UK manufacturing to a respectable level of just over 1 per cent. But unless Britain can maintain faster productivity growth across the economy than its European competitors, higher wage inflation will feed into lower profits and lost competitiveness. Thanks to the pressures created by German reunification, growth in German average earnings may briefly rise to 6 per cent - but Germany's underlying wages growth is far lower than the UK's, where average earnings are rising at 6.5 per cent. Average earnings growth in France is 4 per cent and in the US 2 per cent. Britain still appears a long way off those figures.</p>

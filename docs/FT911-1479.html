			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: 'Cyrano' without a heart / David Bintley's new ballet for the Royal Ballet is historical flummery WHATEVER ELSE David Bintley's new Cyrano may not be, it is consistent. Consistent in its determination to tickle a rib and jerk a tear, in its eager pursuit of the lowest common denominator in score, design and dance. It offers spectacle akin to Hollywood costume drama, with the quaintness and pish-tushery, the plumed hats and swordsmanship, dear to fans of the Three Musketeers. It has jokes, crowd scenes, thin choreography, and a constant buzz of small dramatic roles being played to the hilt. Its relationship with ballet as a serious art is tenuous. The first performance of Cyrano took place on Thursday night. It is in three acts and follows the narrative of Rostand's play; it deploys a large cast, and defies comprehension as anything other than a display of historical costume. It is best, first, to forget Rostand. His Cyrano is about the intoxication of words, the torrential images, the verbal conceits and caprices, with which his hero greets life and love, and provides a carapace for his deepest feelings. To convert this into movement presupposes a treatment less tightly wedded to Rostand's narrative than Bintley has chosen. His Cyrano the versifier and Cyrano the swordsman must mime speech or battle dutifully, while encased in the trappings of period dress and predictable steps. And without the magic of language, we are left with a melodrama whose picaresque elements may be intriguing to produce, but do not encourage Bintley in the creation of dance incident of any extended interest. What we see is historical flummery. Hayden Griffin has designed scenery and costumes that are accurate, careful, and claustrophobic - for part of the evening the stage looks too small for the action and the seething hordes in boots and hats and swirling cloaks. What we hear in Wilfred Joseph's score is eclectic writing that is like a patchwork of influences from pastiche Prokofiev to feeblest Erich Korngold. It is music as sound-track, and though it may be obedient to Bintley's dramatic scheme, it encourages no expansiveness of drama or feeling: the central moments of the narrative - the balcony scene; Cyrano's last meeting with Roxane - are cheated. But Cyrano de Bergerac as a drama has been cheated throughout. Bintley has opted for spectacle, for flashy effects - a brawl in the theatre; the siege of Arras - and has found no way to touch the heart of the play, which is Cyrano's heart. Amid the industrious to-ing and fro-ing of the cast - and all Rostand's characters are there, busily making their mark - the central tragedy of Cyrano, Roxane and Christian is diminished since, as I have suggested, the play's concern with words is not to be translated into dance. The justification for the enterprise is, nevertheless, Stephen Jefferies' incarnation of Cyrano. From his earliest appearances, nearly 20 years ago, Jefferies showed himself one of those rare beings who are entirely at home on stage, able to convey, with superlative precision and clarity, the most fleeting emotions. In his greatest roles - I think especially of his Rudolf in Mayerling - his performances were touched with genius. As Cyrano, he is a marvel. The part may be limited, but Jefferies' playing knows no horizons, no constraints. Passion, humour, sensibility, lightning shifts between sorrow and manic energy, are part of a reading as complete and compelling as any I have seen in the play. He even convinces us that Cyrano is a poet - which the ballet no-where does. In the speech when Cyrano pretends to have fallen from the moon (embellished with exquisite vulgarity by musical quotes from the Moonlight sonata, and other lunar tunes) Jefferies is a consummate droll. In those tightrope moments when Cyrano nearly - ah, so nearly - declares himself to Roxane, Jefferies is sublime in sensitivity and controlled feeling. It is a glorious performance. Among the other principals, Lesley Collier is an intelligent if rather mature Roxane; Bruce Sansom an agreeable Christian, though the role looks papery. The rest of the cast play and dance for all they are worth - and they are worth a ballet better than this.</p>

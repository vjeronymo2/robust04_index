			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BLOOM'S GRACIOUS EVENING WITH THE BARD'S WOMEN  </P> <P> Claire Bloom read Shakespeare Thursday night at Ambassador Auditorium,  beautifully but not intimately.  </P> <P> The evening was called "Then Let Men Know: A Portrait of Shakespeare's Women."  Dressed in a simple black grown, Bloom presented excerpts from six plays, each  focusing on a woman whom Bloom seemed to admire -- Viola in "Twelfth Night" for  her ability to laugh at herself, Katharine of Aragon in "Henry VIII" for her  refusal to be broken, Volumnia in "Coriolanus" for the magnificence of her  scorn, Juliet in "Romeo and Juliet" for the magnificence of her resolve.  </P> <P> As one expects from English actors, the words came first -- their shape, their  music, the silences between them. But without losing herself in a scene, Bloom  did more than read it. She acted it: the men's parts too. And everything she  touched was well observed. Her women were no less women for being ladies.  </P> <P> Juliet seemed to have earned Bloom's special respect, for conquering her fears  in the tomb in such a soldierly fashion. What men were to "know," one gathered  from this recital, was what strong stuff women were made of.  </P> <P> To an American listener, the evening had a distance about it. Bloom gave us  some background notes, but there was no clue as to why she preferred these  particular scenes over others -- why "Twelfth Night" appealed to her more than  "As You You Like It," for instance, which also has fun with the idea of a girl  masquerading as a boy.  </P> <P> You didn't want chitchat. In an age of fake intimacy, the distance was even  refreshing: that of an instrumentalist who wants to be judged solely on her  performance.  </P> <P> But an actress isn't merely an instrumentalist. In an assignment of this sort,  she has something in common with a lecturer. A good one always takes personal  notice of the audience. We would have enjoyed meeting Claire Bloom Thursday  night, as well as Juliet and Viola.  </P> <P> Samm-Art Williams' "Woman From the Town" at the Inner City Cultural Center  starts from the same place as Friedrich Duerrenmatt's "The Visit": A wealthy  woman returns to the little town that scorned her.  </P> <P> But while the heroine of "The Visit" is out for revenge, Williams' heroine may  be disposed toward mercy. Actually, she ought to thank the town. If it hadn't  cast her out, she never would have made big bucks up north.  </P> <P> Still, she and her fatherless baby went through hell. So she will let the  townspeople squirm for awhile as they start to realize who is buying up all the  real estate.  </P> <P> A promising beginning. But "Woman From the Town" doesn't come together at ICCC.  We're not sure at the end whether we've seen the story of a clever woman  carrying through a well-laid scheme to save a town and yet put its inhabitants  in their place, or the story of a woman who had to change her agenda when she  fell in a love with a place that she thought she hated.  </P> <P> What's needed is not more big speeches about the need to be true to "the land."  Maybe we need more little speeches, evincing real small-town behavior. Williams  has a talent for these, when he exercises it -- for example, the moment where  the heroine's nephew agrees with her that he's all grown up now: "I've been in  the Marines and everything." That's how people talk at home. But when the lines  get programmatic, the play goes dead.  </P> <P> There's something stiff about the production too. In a play about  relationships, director Adeleane Hunter tends to let each actor stay in her own  frame, doing her own number -- Donnice Wilson as the sophisticated heroine,  Robyn Hastings as her self-assured daughter, Roxie Roker as her resentful  sister, etc. Ensemble acting needs more overlap, especially in a family play.  The easiest performance, if not the showiest one, comes from Eugene Lee as the  nephew, one of those country boys who smile and smile, and end up owning the  farm.  </P> <P>  Plays at 1303 S.

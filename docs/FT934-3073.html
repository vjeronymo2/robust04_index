			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Less scary body scanners Traditional medical body scanners have often proved terrifying for small children, as the patient has to be transported into a tunnel. Patients wired up to life support systems, the obese and the claustrophobic have also had problems. A breakthrough in magnet technology has now enabled Siemens to develop a magnetic resonance imaging scanner which is open at the sides, removing many of the problems. The Magnetom Open uses a 'C'-shaped magnet which curves over the patient's body rather than a circular magnet. Developments in the gradient coils, which create the smaller magnetic fields, and the radio frequency equipment which transmits the information, have also contributed to the open shape of the scanner.

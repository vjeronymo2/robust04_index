			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt has  warned against a weakening of the multilateral international  trading system. He is concerned that the United States "wants  to force trade concessions by means of one-sided sanctions,"  Rexrodt said in Munich on Friday [29 April] at the annual  meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Germany. The  multilateral trading system is the "indispensable umbrella, also  for regional associations."    Rexrodt was optimistic that economic relations between  Europe  and the United States will be further expanded in 1994. He said  he is thinking of multilateral agreements in the fields of  steel, civil aviation, and financial services. Also, a  multilateral agreement on restricting subsidies to the  shipbuilding industry should be concluded in the near future.  Rexrodt thinks that eastern Germany could be particularly  important in the expansion of German-U.S. trade relations. This  mainly has to do with East European markets being "right on our  doorstep."    According to Rexrodt, there are over 1,400 U.S. companies  represented in Germany at the moment, 275 of them in the new  laender. They have created or preserved 50,000 jobs there and  invested more than 8 billion German marks.</p>

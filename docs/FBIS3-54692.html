It will be worse,  much worse. Civil war is the only thing we will not have.  There will be no dictatorship. Everyone is bracing themselves  for a dictatorship, claiming that Zhirinovskiy will come to  power now and there will be a dictatorship. No, he will not  come to power, do you understand this? Zhirinovskiy will not  rule, there will be a coalition. In the future, strange as it  may sound, this coalition will acquire a civilized form. In  1995, I do not see Zhirinovskiy having such a huge effect on  politics any more.    [Unidentified correspondent] Will Pavel Globa's forecast  regarding Vladimir Zhirinovskiy come true? We will see. Some  of his predictions are already coming true, as it appears. The  year of 1993, which had apparently brought Vladimir Volfovich  Zhirinovskiy a triumphant election victory, prepared for him  some unpleasant surprises as well. Zhirinovskiy's foreign tour  was not exactly strewn with roses. The Bulgarian authorities,  in simple terms, forced the leader of the Russian Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] out of the country, and the German  Government straightforwardly refused him a visa. [Video shows  Zhirinovskiy speaking to an unidentified correspondent in an  office sitting under an emblem showing an eagle holding in his  beak a banner with the slogan: Freedom, LDP, Law, and hovering,  in burning sun rays, above a big white schematic map that  includes Alaska, all of the former Soviet Union, Finland, and  extending some way westward into Europe, with Russia written on  it in capital letters]    [Zhirinovskiy] This is normal political life -- politics do  not exist without it. To grant a visa or not to grant a visa,  to welcome or not to welcome. It all depends on who has arrived  in the country. All Bulgarians are unhappy with their life, and  in me they have seen the opportunity of another president  appearing in Bulgaria, of a new political leadership. This  provoked hatred and anger from the local political elite who are  in power in Bulgaria today -- these werewolves, chameleons,  former communists like Zhelu Zhelev and his team.    [Unidentified correspondent] What about Germany? In  principle, is the refusal to grant a visa connected with  Bulgaria in any way?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, it is all connected. When Germans saw  the Bulgarian people warming up to me in such a way -- thousands  of people chanting Russia, Russia -- they were afraid that if I  cross the border into Germany, I will agitate German public  opinion in favor of other forces, not those who are in power in  Germany. They had already refused me a visa in September, so  this is not the first time.    They refused me a visa in September when I was going to a  convention of the German People's Union, so I picketed the  German consulate. Two hours later, the consul phones me here  and says: God forbid, Vladimir Volfovich, please remove the  pickets, we are issuing your visas. So the visas were issued  and I went there. Same thing now: The collegium of Germany's  Foreign Ministry is having a meeting to figure out what to do.  We have refused him, right, but what if he becomes president in  the spring? Relations between Russia and Germany will be much  worse. Germany is in a state as it is, with Turks and other  problems. That is politics for you.    I was in Europe, and what a shame. All the brothels are full  of Russian women. What have we brought up our daughters for?  All brothels, bars, night clubs and discos -- anywhere where  one jumps into bed for shillings, francs, or marks -- Russian  girls are there. This is a shame!    [Unidentified correspondent] But here in Moscow as well...    [Zhirinovskiy interrupting] I agree, but that is in our  motherland. At least the girl will come back home after work.  Over there, a girl works as if in a zoo. They come to the zoo  to watch, let us say, a lion or a kangaroo. Same here: She is  sitting there, half naked, and turns over 50 clients a day.  That is different: It is one thing to go to bed here, once a  week, if one is short of money for a dress, for instance, and  another thing to work day in, day out. An Austrian, or a German  or French girl will not work every day. There are Thais,  Filipinos, Argentinians -- and Russians. Rich, isn't it? This  is a monstrous, revolting thing -- in two and a half years, to  turn the country into a dustbin, into a latrine -- and to push  the young ones into prostitution. It is time to smash all this  as quickly as we can.</p>

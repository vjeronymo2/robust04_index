			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by State President F.W. de Klerk from National </F> Party headquarters in Johannesburg -- live; italicized passages  in Afrikaans]    [Text] [De Klerk] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.    I would like to start out not by dealing with the specific  issue of the extension of voting time for certain areas, I will  come to that. But I would firstly like to thank all the voters  who have already voted, all those who have taken the rough with  the smooth which went with this election, those who stood  patiently in long queues, those who in some instances went away  because of a failure in the system at certain points, and then  came back again. Thank you for your support, for my party, to  all those who voted for me, and to those who voted for other  parties, thank you for your participation. South Africa needs an  election which is legitimate. South Africa needs an election  which gives a result which will prove that the Government of  National Unity which will come into being as a result of that  election will be a government representing the overwhelming  majority of all South Africans.    This election is an historic occasion, maybe the most  important ever in our history now and in the future. We are  launching our country into a new era. We must ensure that it  succeeds. It is this consideration which motivated the  government to in principle acceed to the request of the IEC  [Independent Electoral Commission] that in certain areas the  opportunity to vote be extended for another day. I would like  to say that the Independent Electoral Commission, on information  available that in some parts of our country there are places  where people haven't been able to vote as yet, and in other  parts of our country, the same areas, the opportunity has only  been opened really because of the delivery of ballot papers at a  very, very late stage. It is, on the basis of their  information, that they recommended that in the following areas  there will tomorrow also be the opportunity for voters to vote.  In the northern Transvaal it will be Venda, Gazankulu and  Lebowa. In the eastern province it will be Ciskei and Transkei,  and in Natal/KwaZulu it will be the area hitherto under  administration of the KwaZulu government known as KwaZulu.    In some instances the information of the National Party is  somewhat in conflict with the finding of the IEC, that they  cannot at this point in time take a decision if we were to close  the voting tonight, that the election in those parts will be  free and fair. However, the law gives the authority to the IEC  to make that finding and we are committed to have a result which  will be and can be declared free and fair. We accept therefore  their authority in this regard, their finding, and we will  cooperate as a party to ensure that also in these areas which I  have mentioned, the further opportunity to voters will be given.    There are, however, two provisos which have been agreed  upon which are important provisos. Firstly, international  monitors which monitored in the rest of the country where the  election will come to an end tonight, will be added to the  monitoring teams throughout these six areas, and therefore, the  level of monitoring will be substantially increased and there  will be more objective monitoring.    Secondly, we have insisted and it has been agreed, that all  the votes cast tomorrow will and should be kept separate so that  in the event of disputes arising it will not become integrated  with the votes cast during the actual period of the election  which was envisaged right from the beginning. In the event of  disputes, therefore, there will be the possibility to evaluate  what happens tomorrow in these areas on a proper and a  scientific basis. I would also like to dispel a rumor which I  hear is still going about and that is that there will be another  public holiday tomorrow. [laughter] I, with great reluctance,  because I knew of the disruption it would have because of the  short notice, acceded to the request of the IEC to declare today  a public holiday. The President's Council, a few years back,  already calculated that a public holiday costs the country 400  million rand. We need to get back to work as a nation. We  cannot lose another day of productivity. We need to create new  wealth to address the problems of our people and we cannot pour  400 million, or whatever, if you take inflation into account  since that calculation was made, down the drain, and therefore,  tomorrow will be a working day. I haven't received any formal  request with regard to it being declared a public holiday, and I  want to be very firm, I'm not prepared to consider -- should I  receive such a request, a declaration of tomorrow as a public  holiday.    I know that this decision, that the election doesn't fully  come to an end at the prescribed time, will come as a shock to  many. I know it is coming as a shock to the organizers and the  workers of many, many parties which have geared themselves,  which have planned all their programs on the basis that the  election would end tonight. I would like to call upon them to  accept this, to be calm, because what is of the greatest  importance is that in the final analysis we must be able to say  that all South Africans who wished to vote and who were prepared  to take trouble to vote, were given the opportunity to vote. If  we don't achieve that, the election result will right from the  beginning be in total jeopardy. The election result will not be  the beginning of real reconciliation. It will be the beginning  of conflict and strife.    However, the National Party is deeply concerned. In many  cases we have received substantiated complaints of malpractices,  of irregularities inside specifically many polling booths, of  the polling boxes not being sealed off properly when they are  full, of ink not being applied properly, on voter's assistance  being rendered not on an impartial basis, but almost in an  intimidatory, in a way in which it amounted to intimidation, or  to partisanship. We have lodged a number of complaints. All  the complaints that we have received at our head office. And I  have just spoken to Judge Kriegler on the telephone and he  assured me that where complaints have been lodged with regard to  irregularities at specific polling booths, the votes at those  polling booths will be kept separate, also during the process of  balancing all the ballot papers until a decision has been taken  whether the complaints are justified or not.    This must be done because the IEC has the authority to  declare where irregularities occurred of a serious nature at a  particular polling booth, to make a decision that that polling  booth's votes won't be part of the final result. That was  inserted in the original legislation to ensure that the whole  electoral process, which has gone so well in most of the places,  won't be put in jeopardy because of irregularities just at,  relatively speaking, a few places. And I have the assurance  that this procedure will be applied so that where complaints  have been lodged, the IEC will be in a position to exercise its  right in that regard, and so that those who made themselves  guilty of irregularities will be punished.    There were also the other negative aspects of administrative  failure, of logistic problems. We even heard of, at lower  levels, IEC appointed representatives showing clear bias. That  is part of the complaints that we received. But the National  Party is not approaching this in a negative sense. Let's deal  with those negative aspects within the framework of the law.  The law provides for certain procedures, we will follow the  procedures, but we want the election to succeed. We want the  overall legitimacy of the election to be established, and we  have constantly, in the days before the election, during the  election, and we will do the same tomorrow, we have constantly  taken a stand of being cooperative, of being constructive in  ensuring that the election succeeds, and that we remain  committed to it. That is what South Africa now needs, and I  call upon all South Africans who feel somewhat disillusioned,  because what they believed to be, or what in actual fact is  irregularities which occurred here and there, to not  withstanding also support me in this stance. We've got to make  this election work for all the people. If we don't get a 100  percent perfect election, let us strive to achieve a 95 percent  one, and let us live with it, because South Africa needs this  election to bring us to the point where we can start working  together in a Government of National Unity in the best interest  of all the people.    Already the election itself has brought a few very positive  trends to the fore. Violence has abated. We almost had no  violence. We had, outside polling booths, no overt  intimidation, whatsoever. I've been to many polling stations,  and everywhere there was an atmosphere so much different from  the atmosphere even a week before, when rallies were still  broken up by opposing parties, when there was a lot of  intimidation, a lot of aggression. It is almost as if, at all  the places I've been, the election breathed an air of  reconciliation and that is what the country needs. Now,  everybody had the right and will continue to have the right to  participate in a full multiparty democracy. Nobody is denied  that right in any way whatsoever, and on that basis, on that  basis that there is no longer a basis for continued conflict,  for continued tension, for keeping alive old hatreds and old  conflicts -- let us unite as a nation, irrespective of our  political differences, around this new transitional constitution  which holds so much security for the individual, which offers  full participation, which is a balanced constitution. Let us  make it work for our people, for our youth, and for future  generations. Thank you very much.    [Unidentified official] Thank you Mr. President. We would  also like to recognize Mrs. Marike de Klerk here tonight.  Welcome here. Questions, ladies and gentlemen. Questions?  Karen Rijnaardt, RAPPORT. Can you just use the microphone  please?    [Rijnaardt] Many fingers are pointing at the  Independent Electoral Commission, over the handling of the  election thus far. What is your comment as party leader?    [De Klerk] I am very critical on many aspects. I think  we must differentiate between the commission itself, and how  some of their decisions were carried out. I think the  commission itself also took certain decisions which they could  have handled differently. I think they could have depended more  on the good experience in the Department of Home affairs. I  think too many inexperienced people were placed in positions  where they had to make decisions without guidance. I have a lot  of criticism for that, but I sympathize also with these people.  I think that the lessons we have learned, now that the  legitimacy of the system has been taken out of the arena and is  no more in dispute, that we take the tasks which should be  undertaken by a government, to be handled by a government.  Independent agents do not have the foundation, the ability, or  the experience, and have a tendency to neglect certain things.  Another example, and I say this without aggression, if we look  at independent agencies, is the new tendency at the SABC  [South African Broadcasting Corporation]. I am deeply  concerned where a public broadcaster, a public broadcaster  actually has ... the chief source of income is through license  fees and where there is a political dispute almost, or a  political struggle, concerning the political role of the SABC --  in which there is so lightly veered away from constitutional  principles as it were, in respect of, for example, languages. I  am concerned and I think we should guard against situations  where people who are not fully accountable, receive too much  public power, if I can put it that way, which makes an impact on  the entire public.    [Official] Second question, yes sir?    [Unidentified correspondent] Won't you [words indistinct]  president if the ANC [words indistinct] first part of the  election and National Party the second [words indistinct] accept  the position of second vice president of your country?    [De Klerk] Well, I'm perfectly willing, and I've said it so  regularly. It is a constitution which I worked for, and I'm  perfectly willing to accept a free and fair election result and  accept whatever position that election result places me in. If  it is to be president, yes. If it is to be executive deputy  president, yes.    [Official] A third question at the back there?    [Correspondent Francis Ndlonga] Yes, Mr. President, I'm  sorry, I'm just [words indistinct]. My name is Francis Ndlonga  from REUTERS News Agency. I just wanted to check with you  whether you have given the approval for extension by one day of  voting in the former homelands?    [De Klerk] I've been consulted but the legislation yet has  to  be submitted to me, because we have to change the law by  proclamation. The legislation I'm still awaiting, the principle  I have accepted with regard to the specific former homelands  that I've mentioned. It does not include all the former  homelands, because in others it went better. It is interesting,  if you analyze, that it is in the homelands where we have the  biggest breakdown of their civil service in the past month and  two, that the problem now is the greatest. But in principle I  have said yes, and I will approve the legislation if I'm happy  with the way in which it is formulated. If I'm not happy I will  go back and we will talk about how it should be formulated. But  you can accept the fact that there will be voting in those six  areas tomorrow as a fact.    [Official] The next question finishes the [words  indistinct].    [Correspondent Michael Penbritten] Now that the election is  virtually over, two questions: One, do you feel a sense of  relief at passing the baton to another politician; two, how well  has the National Party done, do you think?    [De Klerk] I think I must answer the last question first.  Passing the baton for the National Party would mean that we  have, we would have to get less than five percent of the vote,  if you start from that end, which means that we would just be a  party in parliament without representation in the government of  national unity. I'm definitely sure we won't get less than five  percent. To have our leader serve as executive deputy  president, I'm absolutely sure that also that will not be the  case. We will either be the biggest party or the second biggest  party.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly  approved the president's selection of Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok as new prime minister Friday evening.    In a plenary session attended only by ruling Democratic  Liberal Party members and a small number of independents, 170  solons voted for Yi's appointment and 10 others against.    The opposition Democratic Party [DP] boycotted the session,  reasoning that they couldn't accept the floor act only on the  nomination of a new prime minister without dealing with the  issue of witnesses and references with regard to the Sangmudae  scandal.    In a party decision, most of the DP lawmakers stood away  from  the session while a few solons including Cho Hong-kyu and Chang  Ki-uk strode into the hall and urged the speaker to stop taking  the vote.    But, they did not mount any physical harassment.    Prior to the 6:10 P.M. session, the speaker arranged a last-  minute bipartisan floor leaders meeting. However, they failed  to reach any accord.    The ruling party suggested that the issue of whether to  adopt  20 undecided people out of the 50 witnesses and references  produced by the opposition party be discussed later when the  need of their testimonies arises.    The opposition party, on the other hand, wanted that the  issue of the 20 people should be expressly settled forthwith  without any further delay.    With the parliamentary endorsement of Yi Yong-tok's  selection  as new prime minister, the 167th extraordinary session of the  National Assembly, whose legal period had been extended by four  days, came to a close.</p>

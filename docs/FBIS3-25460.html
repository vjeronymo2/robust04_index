At the High  Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], the  transitional constitution commission met at last today at the  People's Palace. The meeting was expected to help in adopting  the group's report. It must be noted here that the points of  disagreement will be submitted to the next plenary session of  the transitional legislative body for debate. According to  certain sources, these two agreements are linked to the  prerogatives of the leaders of the transition and this stalemate  at the transitional constitution commission should mean the  imminent convening of the much awaited HCR-PT plenary session.    Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo Passigna, however, made an  important point. The chairman of the HCR-PT recalled that it is  up to the opposition to name a prime minister. In an interview  published by the newspaper LA REFERENCE PLUS, Monsignor  Monsengwo stated, and I quote: It is not for the political  forces of the conclave to exercise a kind of veto. The problem  here is that people negotiate badly and change their minds  later. I feel that we must follow the decision made by the  troika. According to the Kisangani bishop, under this plan, it  is for the opposition to name a prime minister. The others, that  is to say the political forces of the conclave, grant them this  right on condition that this prime minister forms his government  on the basis of the principle of balance and fairness, unquote.    Another important point is that the next plenary session  will  not directly debate the issue of prime minister, Msgr. Monsengwo  also said. He urged the politicians to make haste so that a  truly responsible and competent government can be set up to  control the catastrophic situation in the country.    Meanwhile, the scramble for the post of transitional prime  minister continues. There is, however, a new situation in the  prospects for the head of the future transitional government.  If the high council is bent on the prime minister's election,  this vote must be in the form of secret ballot in which  everyone, in line with his conscience, will vote for the best  interests of the nation, declared Kibassa-Maliba, who was cited  by LE SOFT newspaper. The paper also quoted the Union for  Democracy and Social Progress leader as saying: Tshisekedi could  present himself against other candidates.    Things could now move more rapidly on the Zairian political  scene in order to end the crisis that has seriously affected the  country for many long months.</p>

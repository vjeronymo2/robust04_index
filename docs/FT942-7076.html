			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Pilkington emerges with advantages Pilkington estimated yesterday that the agreement reached with the US Justice Department may cost it just under Pounds 1m (Dollars 1.5m) a year in lost licensing fees. However, the UK glassmaker said that it might save considerably more in legal fees. A recent legal action in the UK, brought by Pilkington against PPG Industries, the large US glass group, resulted in the British company receiving Pounds 16m, representing 80 per cent of its legal costs, plus Pounds 5m damages. At issue, according to Pilkington, was whether PPG had the right to pass on to a Chinese plant technology developed by the British company which PPG was using under licence in the US. However, the British glassmaker still faces two US civil suits which could end in financial penalties as well as costs, if Pilkington were to lose. A separate anti-trust action is being brought by PPG, and there is an action by ITC, a smaller US glass company with which Pilkington has no licensing agreement. The consent decree announced yesterday is not expected to affect these actions. Sir Robin Nicholson, Pilkington's technology director, said that the accord reached with the Justice Department had the advantage of setting out Pilkington's legal rights to the float glass technology originally developed by the company's president, Sir Alastair Pilkington. It meant that US companies licensed to use pre-1983 technology developed by Pilkington would now be able to sub- license that technology to companies in foreign countries, subject to certain confidentiality agreements, said Sir Robin. Pilkington would retain the rights to later technology which was not subject to licence agreements with US companies. 'The decision has been reached after a two-year investigation by the Justice Department,' Sir Robin said. 'We have got what we wanted, in that we retain a substantial amount of proprietorial knowledge which we can license in the normal way.' Pilkington was only a British glass company of modest size when, in 1959, Sir Alastair invented float glass - reported to be an idea which came to him while he was in the bath. Instead of rolling or drawing glass, he devised a system of floating it on molten tin to produce a product of consistently high quality and thickness, with minimal wastage. Plate glass, which was rolled, by comparison required extensive finishing and polishing, involving waste of up to 20 per cent. Pilkington quickly realised that, in spite of its technological lead, it was not rich enough to build plants or mount legal actions to prevent companies from abusing patents in all the countries which wanted to take advantage of the new process. Instead, it decided to license the technique in agreements running for up to 30 years, from which Pilkington was able to earn substantial fees. At its peak, fee income was running at Pounds 35m-Pounds 45m a year. This has been reduced to about Pounds 10m now. The process developed by Sir Alastair is now used in 30 countries at 174 plants.</p>

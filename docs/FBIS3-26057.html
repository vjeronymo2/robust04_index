According to the figures and conditions published by  related departments, there are many honest officials.    Based on the statistics of 79 units at and above  deputy-bureau levels directly under the Shenzhen city  authorities and 53 enterprises directly under the city's  jurisdiction, 126 leading bodies got a score above 80, and only  six got a score below 79; of the 626 officials in leading posts  of these units, 526 got a score above 80, and only 3 got a score  below 59.    Another figure from a still wider range was that of the  4,635  officials at and above department levels, 339 believed  themselves failing to meet the requirements through  self-examination, accounting for 9.3 percent.    Failing to meet the requirements refers to those officials  who accepted all sorts of gift money, securities (including  "Great Wall" credit cards presented by subordinate units),  imported liqueur, cigarettes, wristwatches and goods in various  categories, and those "officials doing business," namely, those  who worked as part-time board directors, deputy board directors,  general managers and vice managers in enterprises. Should  officials in this category return the money and gifts on their  own, or resign their part-time offices, they would be regarded  as having conducted self-correction. After that, they would  have to sign a letter on the "responsibility system in  anticorruption to insure clean government." Such "letters of  responsibility" varied in contents with different trades, but  will become the criteria for work of officials at various levels  in the days to come.    Since last September, Shenzhen investigated and handled a  number of major cases, with 15 suspects, who were cadres at and  above department levels involved; in addition, 119 economic  criminals involving corruption and bribery were apprehended. A  number of criminals at large were rounded up, with scores of  millions of yuan in illicit money recovered.    It was said the atmosphere of honesty was on the rise.  Government departments have began to treat their guests at the  canteen; enterprises stopped giving gifts and holding banquets  for their opening ceremonies. The number of cadres refusing  gift money and bribes rose by a wide margin.    People here believe that the anticorruption struggle has not  been thoroughly conducted, and the tasks for the struggle  remained arduous.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> INQUIRY CONTINUES IN ALLEGED ASSAULT  </P> <P> U.S. and Soviet navies continued their investigations into allegations that a  U.S. Navy enlisted woman was sexually assaulted aboard one of three Soviet  naval vessels docked in San Diego last week during a goodwill visit. No new  information was available and no deadline has been set for concluding the joint  review of the alleged assault.  </P> <P> "The investigation is ongoing, but we don't anticipate having anything until  Monday at the earliest," Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard said. "We hope to conclude  this as soon as possible, to gather the necessary information as fast as we  can." The Naval Investigative Service's report will be forwarded to the Soviets  for handling under their military legal system, Pritchard said. The Soviet  squadron departed Saturday after a five-day visit.  </P></p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier pension warning Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing and information business, has announced that tax changes on pension schemes announced in March would reduce its 1993 operating profits by Pounds 19m. There would be no cash flow effect on the company's earnings and its contributions holiday could continue for several more years. However, because of the SSAP 24 accounting rule for pension expense, a reduction in the pension scheme surplus would be reflected both in the company's balance sheet and its profit and loss statement. Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief financial officer of Reed Elsevier, said the reduced profits would be more than offset by a recent slight improvement in UK and US trading conditions and the pre-tax profit contribution from the Official Airline Guides acquisition completed in September. The pensions credit added Pounds 28m to operating profits in 1992 but that would fall to Pounds 9m for 1993.</p>

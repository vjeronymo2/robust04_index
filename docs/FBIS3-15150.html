			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The preparation of documents forming the basis of  the merger of the money systems of the Republic of Belarus and  Russia is virtually complete. As BELINFORM was told by  Uladzimir Zamyatalin, the Belarusian prime minister's press  secretary, the political brakes that are hindering the creation  of an economic and ruble union between Belarus and Russia should  probably be looked for not in Moscow, far less in Minsk.    It is not impossible that the process is being influenced by  serious concern at the latest development of the Slav factor on  the part of the trans-Atlantic Sovietologists shocked by the  successful renaissance of Russia's foreign policy actions in  Bosnia. This process, in the opinion of Zamyatalin, is so far  being brilliantly frozen by the nationalist Russophobes in Minsk  and the Russia's Choice people in Moscow. Their latest  alliance, stressed Zamyatalin, is conditioned evidently by one  aim -- not to permit any Slav merger. The integration process  of Russia and Belarus, considers the press secretary, can be  interrupted only artificially, but in that event the material  and moral cost of the inevitable merger of the two peoples will  be considerably higher.</p>

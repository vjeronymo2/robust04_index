			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Government to ease retirement burden on women The government will try to offset some of the adverse effects of raising the state pension age for women by making it easier for home carers to obtain larger pensions when they retire. Women will be able to earn entitlement to benefits while caring for children or the disabled for up to 19 years, three years longer than at present. The State Earnings Related Pension Scheme can also be modified so that women with no more than 20 years of employment who have had caring responsibilities in other years will be eligible for a full Serps pension. The government in addition will enlarge state pension benefits for those who defer the date they begin drawing benefits and allow women who reach retirement age before their husbands to obtain better benefits. The details were contained in a white paper on equalising state pension ages released yesterday by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. On Tuesday Mr Kenneth Clarke announced that women will have to wait until reaching the age of 65 - the same as men - before being eligible to draw state pensions. The change will be phased in gradually from 2010 to 2020. No one currently over the age of 44 will be affected. Tables published yesterday show that the first group of women to be affected are those born in December 1952, who cannot receive state pensions until they are 62 years and eight months. The consultation document notes that companies which pay bridging pensions to men who retire at 60 must also consider paying the same pensions to women or phase the payment out altogether.</p>

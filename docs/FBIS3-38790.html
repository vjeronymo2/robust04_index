IG Metall spokesman Michael Knuth said in  Ingolstadt today that token strikes would focus on the Audi  plant in Ingolstadt as well as further protests in Upper Bavaria  [southern Bavaria] and the town of Bamberg [northern Bavaria].  Staff are planning to leave their places of work and, weather  permitting, demonstrate on the streets. The union is also  planning protest action at BMW on Thursday [10 February].</p>

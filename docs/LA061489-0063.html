The talks, involving the government and  representatives of Hungary's nine largest independent parties and groups, are  expected to last several months. Participants will hammer out ground rules for  Hungary's first free elections in more than 40 years, due by mid-1990, and  debate Hungary's economic and social troubles.  </P></p>

Establishing and preserving balanced relations with our  neighbors is one of the main directions of the Hungarian  Socialist Party's [MSZP] efforts. Promoting historical  conciliation with those neighboring countries with which  Hungary's relations have become tense is the most urgent task,  Laszlo Kovacs, chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs  Committee, member of the MSZP's national committee, and the  MSZP's foreign affairs spokesman said at an expert debate on the  MSZP's foreign policy program organized by the party's Central  and Eastern Europe Section on 10 February. The program states  that it is expedient to sign a basic agreement with Slovakia and  Romania as soon as possible, and work has to begin on placing  Hungarian-Serbian relations on new foundations. We have to  continue to extend our relations with Croatia and Slovenia and,  in the case of Ukraine, further efforts are needed to achieve  practical results after the issue of national minority rights  was settled in an exemplary way in an agreement.    According to the program prepared by Kovacs, guaranteeing  the  country's security is the primary goal of Hungarian foreign  politics; foreign policy also has to ensure that Hungarian  intentions are not viewed with suspicion. From the point of  view of regional stability, the MSZP finds it indispensable that  an effective supervisory mechanism be established within the  framework of the Council of Europe, and that sanctions be  defined that are to be used if the norms defined as conditions  for Council of Europe membership are violated.    It is Hungary's obligation to promote through all suitable  means, and by avoiding measures that are open to  misinterpretation by our neighbors, that the individual and  collective rights of the Hungarian national minority living  beyond the border are constitutionally guaranteed, and that they  prevail in practice. Out of the region's countries not  neighboring Hungary, we have to pay special attention to Russia.  The MSZP considers it essential that NATO plays a role in  establishing the region's stability, and in the MSZP's view,  this stability would be best served by giving identical security  guarantees to all countries in the region, Kovacs emphasized.    It was stated at the debate that, as a matter of fact, after  1990, Hungary's scope for maneuver in the area of foreign  politics has been greatly extended. According to Kovacs, we  also have to see that certain developments have been unfavorable  for the government: Hungary's original advantage has ceased to  exist, and it is also a fact that governments that are unable to  cope with the economic and social problems tend to divert the  dissatisfaction in the direction of some kind of domestic or  foreign "enemy."    Therefore, according to the socialists, Hungarian foreign  policy cannot be one-sidedly made responsible for the increased  tension around the country. However, ambiguous statements, the  expressions of a sense of mission that aggravate the neighbors,  the frequent repetition of historical grievances, and the  occasional emergence of irredentist behavior in the government  parties have all further fueled the tensions -- this is how  Kovacs summed up the Antall- government's foreign policy. In  his view, it was a general mistake to ignore the need for  harmony between the priorities, namely Western integration, the  establishment of adequate relations with the neighbors, and  improving the situation of the national minorities.</p>

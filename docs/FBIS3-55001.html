According to Interfax sources, such  posts will be set up along Groznyy's perimeter and on the  approaches to the city.    This question was discussed during talks between President  Dzhokhar Dudayev and representatives of law-enforcement bodies.  The talks also resulted in the decision to establish  headquarters for coordinating the newly set-up detachments. The  headquarters' work will be controlled by the president, who is  also chairman of the Chechen Security Council.</p>

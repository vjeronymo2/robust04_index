Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Special procedures regarding the entry of market-at-the-close (``MOC'') orders on expiration Fridays were originally adopted in 1986 for quarterly triple expiration of derivative instrument products. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Since November 1988, these procedures have been used for each monthly expiration and apply to the so-called ``pilot stocks'' (the 50 most highly capitalized S&amp;P 500 stocks and any component stocks of the Major Market Index that are not included in this group of 50). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  In April 1992, the Exchange modified the pilot procedures and included additional special procedures for handling MOC orders in all stocks on expiration Fridays. In March 1993, the Exchange extended the expiration Friday auxiliary closing procedures to days on which quarterly index expiration (``QIX'') options expire. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  In September 1993, the Exchange again modified the pilot procedures to change the cut-off time for entry, cancellation or reduction of MOC orders to 3:40 p.m. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Expiration Friday is the trading day, usually the third Friday of the month, when some stock index futures, stock index options and options on stock index futures expire or settle concurrently. Triple expirations are the four times a year during the months of March, June, September, and December when all stock index futures, stock index options, options on stock index futures and individual equity options expire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE auxiliary closing procedures for expiration Fridays were initially approved by the Commission on a pilot basis for a one-year period beginning in November, 1988 and extending through October, 1989. The pilot has since been extended each year between October 1989 through October 1994 on a one-year pilot basis.

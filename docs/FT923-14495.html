			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hanson sells off Beazer division in Pounds 52m deal THE UK contracting division of Beazer, the housebuilding, construction and building materials group, has been sold to its employees and management in a deal worth Pounds 52m. Last year Beazer was rescued by Hanson, the conglomerate, and the sale marks the first large disposal by Hanson since it paid Pounds 351m for Beazer. Hanson earlier this year sold Beazer's Australian construction and property interests for ADollars 34.5m to B&amp;B Asia, a Hong Kong based company controlled by Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the German construction group. The sale of the UK contracting division, to be renamed Kier Group after one of its best known construction subsidiaries, will leave employees and management controlling 90 per cent of the shares. Hanson retains a 10 per cent stake in the new company, which is thought to have generated sales of Pounds 570m in the year to the end of June, including turnover of Pounds 47m from international contracts. This compares with sales of Pounds 600m in the previous 12 months. Under the terms of the deal Keir will pay Pounds 40m, raised through the cash resources of its subsidiaries, to Hanson, which will receive a further Pounds 2m from last year's profits A further Pounds 2.7m has been raised through the issue of ordinary Kier shares of which 45 per cent have been acquired by the company's 73 directors. A further 45 per cent is held in trust on behalf of the company's 3,000 workers. In addition to its 10 per cent equity stake, Hanson has acquired Pounds 9.7m of 5 per cent redeemable preference shares. Mr Colin Busby, chairman and chief executive of Kier, said that the total package valued Kier at Pounds 52m. He said the company, even after the Pounds 40m payment, would have net cash of Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m. Kier, which has an order book currently worth Pounds 376m, will have shareholders funds of Pounds 12.4m. In a separate deal Kier has paid a further Pounds 1m to acquire Dudley Coles, which was previously part of Hanson's ARC division. Hanson said yesterday that it had no plans at the moment to dispose of Beazer's other businesses, which include UK housebuilding and US contracting and building materials interests. It was pleased with the sale of the construction divisions which followed an approach from Keir's directors at the end of last year.</p>

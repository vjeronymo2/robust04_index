			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kirinitsiyanov, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA </F> correspondent: ``Cholera Arrived by Aircraft'']    [Text] When the aircraft came in for a landing with its  lights flashing, the earth became silent in alarm as the  ``ambulance'' flashed its blinkers. Much was known about the  imminent arrival; however, much also remained to be  explained...The main thing was that the city was ready for this  menacing danger.    All of the flight crew and stewardesses of the Kazakh Civil  Aviation Administration had been warned. At the slightest  suspicion (and they had the symptoms listed in a special  administration directive), each was obliged to quickly report to  ``the authorities.'' On this Karachi-Almata flight, several  stewardesses immediately noticed that something was wrong. More  than 50 passengers ``besieged'' the restroom...    Almata's best communicable disease specialists gathered at  the airport. All the necessary analyses were performed there.  The passengers (mainly ``shuttle'' passengers dragging trunks  with imported pieces around the entire world) were agitated by  the delay but agreed to be examined. They rejected the  suggestion of a dangerous disease with dignity. In one voice  they stated that they had eaten tainted chicken. This  ``unfortunate bird of yesterday'' turned out to be fatal for 15  persons. Analyses revealed that cholera was indeed in the city.  Addresses and phone numbers were taken from all of them. But  their thirst for profit turned out to be stronger than their  fear for their relatives and close friends and, ultimately, for  their own lives. Many addresses turned out to be made up. The  flight's passengers were sought through the Department of Visas  and Registration of Foreign Citizens [OVIR], the passport desk,  and their relatives and acquaintances. And only after 3 days  were the ``ones who had broken away'' quarantined. All of the  passengers were hospitalized except for one. The Pavlodarsk  militia is on his trail. The rest are accepting treatment. Just  like their ``contacts'' -- their acquaintances and relatives --  they have been placed in a special isolation unit. And a  hospital with the necessary subdepartments has been set up for  the patients in Almata.    An emergency government commission meets twice daily to  clarify the scale of the problem and take measures to keep the  infection from spreading. The problem is that among the  passengers were many residents of neighboring oblasts. One was  detained in Ufa and another in Omsk.    At first, the physicians tried to act independently. But  when  the ``businessmen'' began refusing hospitalization, they were  forced to seek the militia's assistance. And one patient was  ``caught'' three times. The hospital is now carefully guarded.    At the time, Kazakhstan's government declared a state of  emergency in the republic's capital. It lasted another 10 days  after the last patient was discovered. The city was surrounded  by militia posts, cordons, and barricades. It did not end  without deaths. There were cases where tomatoes that summer  residents had brought from their own garden plots were shaken  out of trunks. The Central Market was closed for 2 days. Street  trade was banned, and questionable soft drinks were dumped.    To a certain degree, the cholera did not develop by  accident.  It developed primarily because Kazakhstan, having declared its  sovereignty, slammed its doors and windows to the world at large  and did not care about what was beyond its threshold -- not just  electronics and pantyhose but also an ``easily accessible''  infection. When setting up economic and cultural ties, the  authorities simply forgot about their main obligation -- to  protect their people's health. There are heaps of rubbish two  steps from the presidential palace.    What is most, if you please, deplorable is that the legal  aspects of the problem have been left absolutely not worked out.  I asked A. Kurmangaliyeva, deputy chief public health physician  of the Republic of Kazakhstan, whether the government intends to  lodge a claim against Pakistan. It turns out that this question  was not even considered.</p>

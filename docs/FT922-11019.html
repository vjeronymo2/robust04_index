			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Rival guerrilla forces fight on despite Kabul ceasefire RIVAL guerrilla groups in Kabul, the Afghan capital, ignored a ceasefire yesterday as they bombarded each other across the city. The forces of Ahmed Shah Masood, commander of the northern based Jamiat-i-Islam and now minister of defence, strengthened their grip on the city but met fierce resistance from the Hezb-i-Islam led by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The Hezb-i-Islam was reported to be bringing up Pushtoon reinforcements from the south - reflecting growing ethnic divisions behind the conflict. As the fighting continued for a third day - uninfluenced by the ceasefire which the Pakistani government said had been signed in Peshawar - a convoy including Mr Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, Afghanistan's president-elect, crossed the Khyber Pass border from Pakistan en route to Kabul, where it was due to arrive last night. It was not clear what role there would be for the new interim government of Mr Mojaddedi, a moderate guerrilla leader who was accompanied by other members of a 50-member government commission set up under an agreement reached by the mujahideen in Peshawar. At the border an emotionally-charged crowd of war-hardened mujahideen wielding Kalashnikov rifles repeatedly shouted 'Allah Akbar' (God is great) as Mr Mojaddedi, a bearded academic, read a prayer of thanks for success in their struggle to return to Afghanistan. In Kabul hundreds of casualties were taken to hospitals and many families evacuated from the southern suburb of Mekroyan which came under heavy bombardment. The situation remained confused, however, as Hezb guerrillas, driven out from one area, regrouped in another. Few shops were open in the capital's largely deserted streets. But there was widespread disgust that 13 years of civil war should end in further conflict. 'What will happen to this country now? We are finished,' said a taxi driver. Near the Charaye Sadama in the centre of the city some of the first prisoners of the conflict were being herded into what Abdur Rahman, a Jamiat commander, called the 'mujahideen' prison. About 100 Hezb guerrillas captured on a ridge were searched and pushed towards the door of a barracks converted into a prison. 'We surrounded them and captured them,' said Abdur Rahman as nearby artillery continued to shell Hezb positions. The new prisoners looked as frightened and uncertain as they might have been if taken by the former communist regime. One was found to have a revolver concealed behind his back. He was roughly slapped around the face by an Uzbek militiaman. 'They will be put on trial,' said Abdur Rahman. Mr Masood and his commanders had still to decide yesterday whether they would risk the heavy bloodshed that could be caused by a frontal attack on the Ministry of the Interior. In the fighting Mr Masood's overall strategy seems to be to hit the Hezb-i-Islam hard while leaving the door open to negotiations. But it will take a long time to heal the wounds caused by the renewed conflict.</p>

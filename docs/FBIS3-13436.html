			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani: "A Big Test"] </F>   [Text] 1. Everything points to the fact that the massacre  of worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque was not a spontaneous  act by a group of "extremists" but the beginning of a series of  steps that the Zionist Government is pursuing with a special  objective in mind. To understand this, it is necessary to find  out what this objective is.    2. We should look at the latest U.S.-Israeli actions in the  region. What has been described as a peace "process" by the  Arabs only contains the word "peace," and it is pursuing  specific objectives.    The first objective is to extinguish the burning flame of  the  intifadah, which has been one of the most dangerous  political-social phenomena for Israel as well as for the United  States and even some of the corrupt regimes in the region, and  is considered to be yet another fruit of the Islamic revival  process.    The second objective is the establishment of full security  on  all of Israel's borders. Like the Camp David Accord with Egypt,  this issue should become the major pivot of all activities and  should concentrate on a peace accord with Syria and the  disarmament of the Hizballah.    The third objective is Israel's entry into the world of  Islam, the consolidation of economic relations with the world of  Islam, and the establishment of a social and political presence  among the Muslims; and naturally the Zionist regime is more  enthusiastic about entering the oil-rich Arab countries of the  Persian Gulf than any other country. The reason for this is not  the existence of petrodollars, but the absence of a native  population and of a precise national identity in these  countries--something that will accelerate and facilitate the  possibility of Israel's entry there.    3. Israel's behavior throughout the talks shows that it is  pursuing these three objectives. Before thinking about a  conditional and limited autonomy for the Palestinians, Israel is  thinking more about extinguishing the flame of the intifadah.  But despite its unconditional surrender to Yasir 'Arafat, all  its other arrangements have been upset because the intifadah is  alive!    Israel's overly enthusiastic approach in consolidating its  relations with the world of Islam and entering its markets is  not a secret, and in this field--as in other fields--U.S.  pressures on the Arabs, especially in the Persian Gulf, can be  seen. But what is the situation like today? In one word, the  U.S.-Israeli plan has been disgracefully defeated because the  oppressed people of Palestine demand their rights and are  extremely alert and experienced in this demand. And moreover,  Islam is emerging again and the intifadah is the Islamic  movement of the Palestinian people. Therefore, when the  Zionists look at a child holding a stone in his hand in the  streets of Hebron, Jerusalem, or Gaza, they multiply this into  several million and what they see is a horrific nightmare. At  no time has resistance against the Zionists been so strong in  the world of Islam, and this is at a time when Israel is not  threatened by any Arab army! Therefore, the pivotal policy of  the Zionists is clear: the only way to preserve the current  Zionist regime is to extinguish the intifadah. But how?    4. In the so-called peace process, Israel tried to fool the  Palestinians by offering a conditional and limited autonomy.  But this plot was foiled in its initial stages. Israel then  chose a second path. It chose to do the same thing that the  Christians did in Andalusia and what the Serbs are now doing in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. I strongly refuse to use the phrase "racial  cleansing" because it is an overt insult to human "power of  speech" since this phrase has nothing to do with either  "cleansing" or "race."    It is actually "barbarianism," which perpetrates a crime in  the garb of Zionism. The Zionists, who have given up hope of  persuading the Palestinians, have decided to resort to force to  wind up matters. They are well aware that if this plan is to  succeed, it should succeed today because tomorrow will be too  late. They also know that they have an immense "opinion-making"  machinery and all of the techniques of this machinery at their  disposal and are using it in a bid to shape the opinion of the  simple-minded people in the world. Also, they know that most of  the Arabic and Islamic governments will be harnessed by the  United States and that they sincerely want Israel to safeguard  them from the great wave of Islamic revival, although they may  pretend that they do not.    Therefore, the conclusion that I draw is:    First of all, the crime perpetrated at the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque  was not a solitary and simple act.    Second, the Zionist Government's plan is to pursue the  objectives of the so-called peace process, and this is only the  beginning of this plan.    Third, there is no doubt that the U.S. Government is fully  aware of this new policy and that the necessary coordination  with the West's propaganda machinery has been made by the  Zionists' tentacles in this network.    The policy of hypocrisy and persuasion that existed in the  first method--that is the process of talks--was thwarted by the  brave Palestinians on their own. But how should the new policy  of massacres and eradication be thwarted? The world of Islam  should not remain only on the sidelines, as it has done in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, and merely issue statements. From the  very beginning, it should impose the legitimacy of its decision,  irrespective of what the UN Security Council does. Yes, the  Muslim ummah is facing a big test.</p>

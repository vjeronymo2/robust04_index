			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Observer: Olympic rumbles Is it a brave display of editorial independence, or injured pride which prompted Time Magazine to publish a special Olympics supplement with its international edition that includes a sharp attack on Juan Antonio Samaranch, the controversial president of the International Olympic Committee? What makes the article on Samaranch special is that Time is one of the 12 chief sponsors of next month's Barcelona Olympics, who have each paid millions of dollars for the privilege of associating their names with the glory of the games. It is unusual for a sponsor to attack the product it has paid bundles of money to endorse. But then Time magazine and its sister publication, Sports Illustrated, were singled out for criticism in the recently published book on the IOC - The Lords of the Rings. Referring to their right to produce earlier special Olympic souvenir issues, the book wondered whether the publishing group had 'tied itself so closely to the Olympic movement that it jeopardised its ability to produce critical journalism?'. Interestingly, Time's sister publication and fellow Olympics sponsor, Sports Illustrated, recently gave 'The Lords of the Rings' an unfriendly review, describing it as 'naive'. The review drew a rebuke from one of the co-authors, who snorted that it was just another example of sports publications ignoring the truth about the IOC.</p>

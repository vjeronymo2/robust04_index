			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Little risk for UK builders THERE WOULD be sadness among British contractors at the collapse of the developers of Canary Wharf, but most have already been paid for the initial phase of the project which has been largely completed. Any problems that could arise would involve money which has been retained by Olympia &amp; York against the possibility of defects emerging in completed buildings. Normally developers would retain 5 per cent of the total cost of a building until it has been completed. After that developers can retain 2 1/2 per cent of the cost as an insurance against defects developing within 12 months. At least two large UK contractors are understood to be owed money by O&amp;Y on this basis. It is not clear what claims companies might have on these outstanding sums should the developers be placed in administrative receivership. If this happened, companies fitting out the large office blocks could also be at risk. This work is done last before the tenants arrive. Unfortunately for O&amp;Y not enough tenants are paying rent to make the scheme viable. Whether companies now fitting out buildings got paid would depend upon whether contracts are with the developers or the tenant. Most are likely to have insisted upon regular progress payments given the state of O&amp;Y's finances. Any loss of revenue would be bad news for builders when the UK construction market is in deep recession and new orders are in short supply. British contractors would be particularly concerned that the government might decide not to go ahead with the Pounds 1.7bn extension to the Jubilee Underground line. O&amp;Y had been expected to provide up to Pounds 400m over 25 years towards the cost of building the extension. The project, which received Royal Assent in February, has attracted widespread interest from British and overseas tunnellers, although London Underground cannot place contracts until the secretary of state for transport gives the go ahead. It has already identified an all-Italian consortium led by Italstrade as likely to win the contract for the 4.3km section between Canary Wharf and Canada Water on the south bank of the Thames. Bidders for other sections include Trafalgar House of the UK, Cogefar of Italy, Spie Batignolles and Dumez of France and Hochtief of Germany. At Canary Wharf only one building, known as B3, is left to be completed  - and work on that is largely finished. There is also a small amount of civil engineering, including improvements to a jetty used by river buses.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Not speaking for all banks on currency speculation Sir, You quote Mr Peter Wood, Barclays' finance director ('Banks defend actions on Pounds deals', October 6), as speaking for all UK clearing banks. This is simply not true. We at the Co-operative Bank did not speculate against the pound using either our own money or that of our customers. We restricted ourselves to dealing for customers with genuine international trading requirements. We believe it is unsound for a British clearing bank to speculate against the British currency and the British economy using deposits provided by its British customers and at the expense of the British taxpayer. Judging by his reported comments Mr Woods is an apologist for some clearing banks now terrified at the prospect of a full-scale inquiry into their foreign exchange dealings over the past few weeks and the possibility of the introduction of a special windfall tax on banks' dealing profits. If the cap fits, Mr Wood, wear it, but do not purport to speak for all clearing banks. Terry Thomas, managing director, The Co-operative Bank, 1 Balloon Street, Manchester M60 4EP</p>

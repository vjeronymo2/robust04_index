			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Class warfare in the people's party: Labour's identity struggle as the modernisers confront the traditionalists The outbreak of public skirmishing over the relevance to Labour of Mr Bill Clinton's US election victory is really a coded debate about the extent to which the party must address the values and prejudices of the middle classes. To many insiders, it might equally be viewed as a struggle for influence over Mr John Smith, the party leader, between Labour's trendily radical middle-class tyros on the right and the old cloth-capped workers, espousing gloom and conservatism, on the left. For the party's few optimists, the row has at least shown that, behind the apparent complacency over Labour's fourth successive election defeat, a debate is under way about what, if anything, can be done to avert a fifth. Yet there is still little evidence that any profound change in the party's public persona is imminent. In BBC interviews yesterday, both Mr Smith and Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, who is frequently cited as the arch Clintonite and party 'moderniser', were falling over themselves to insist that hallowed party theology was not in danger. The party leader made it clear that he regarded tampering with Clause IV - the party constitution's controversial commitment to state ownership - as unnecessary and insisted that Labour's union links were secure. Only a little later, Mr Blair genuflected to the left by stressing that, while there was a case for parties of the left to be tougher on crime (a Clinton bull point), its social context could not be ignored. Despite these assurances, some even on the so-called soft-left, such as Ms Clare Short MP, believe that there is a clandestine 'project' by senior Labour figures to hijack the leadership, abandon the unions and the poor, and jettison core socialist principles. As introverted as ever, Labour is conducting its post-mortem in coded language and nods and winks, thereby adding credence to Mr Nick Raynsford MP's much-quoted claim that the party is 'sleepwalking to oblivion'. There is no doubt, however, that - as Mr John Prescott, the party's transport spokesman, said last week - a battle is under way for the heart and soul of the party between the revisionist modernisers and the so-called consolidators or traditionalists, most vocally represented by Mr Prescott. What is seriously in question is whether it is sufficiently taking into account the views of the voters Labour so desperately needs to attract. For the moment, the modernisers appear to be making the running. While stressing that there is no question of Labour becoming a non-socialist party along the lines of the Democrats, they insist that the Clinton victory brings important lessons about updating the party's identity. Such claims infuriate the traditionalists, who believe that efforts to concoct a new public-relations gloss for the party have served only to alienate its basic appeal. Mr Prescott and others argue that Labour should concentrate on rebuilding its withered working-class grassroots, make the case for a measure of public ownership, and campaign on its convictions about social solidarity and full employment. For the modernisers, this formula amounts to little more than a naive faith that Conservative failures and 'one last heave' - a redoubling of efforts to sell old-fashioned Labourism - will be enough to win power. They argue that a decade of Thatcherism has irrevocably changed society and, more importantly, voters' aspirations. In consequence, they say, Labour must address itself to the mood of individualism by broadening its appeal to embrace the white-collar middle third of society, whose politics centres on self-interest rather than the collective good. Their case was bolstered last week by the leaking of a confidential Labour poll, showing Labour has failed to make any improvement in its appeal since the April election defeat, and that voters in the electorally vital south of the country continue to identify it as 'a party of the past', lacking both credibility and coherence. With boundary changes due by 1995, which are set to award the Conservatives another 20-odd seats to add to their 65-seat advantage over Labour, modernisers like Ms Patricia Hewitt and Mr Philip Gould, two long-time image consultants, say excessive optimism over the party's 20 per cent opinion poll lead is a dangerous chimera. Mr John Smith has so far refused to show his hand on what looks increasingly like an outbreak of class warfare within the people's party. He cannot afford to do so for long. During the next three months, the party leader will probably have to decide crucial questions of great symbolic resonance in the struggle between the two sides. The commission on electoral systems, under Lord Plant, and the national executive's committee on the party's constitutional links with the trade unions are to report shortly. Both committees are deeply divided. In the end, the questions of proportional representation for the Commons and the extent of union influence in the party will have to be resolved by the national executive committee, heavily influenced by Mr Smith's personal preferences. Mr Smith will be hard put to find formulas that satisfy both the modernisers' and traditionalists' camps. Compromise or delay, however, will smack of weakness. Beyond these immediate issues, the Labour leader must plan a more comprehensive route march out of the political wilderness. Aides insist planning is already well under way. But some, such as Mr Frank Field, the maverick Birkenhead MP, feel the pace of change is still far too slow. 'We are staring a fifth election defeat in the face,' he says. 'We should be preparing as if we have already suffered it.' Loyalists, however, argue that the machinery for change is already in place. The Commission on Social Justice, under the chairmanship of Sir Gordon Borrie, the former head of the Office of Fair Trading, will begin work this month, promising a review of all the options on tax and benefits. That will report in 18 months. Committees on constitutional reform, under Mr Blair, and on European policy have been set up with orders to be ready to report to this year's Brighton conference. In the meantime, officials say, Labour will project itself as the party dedicated to success: both that of the nation, reversing Britain's postwar decline, and that of the individual, helping people to do better and achieve more. 'The simple truth is that for too long we have all been starved of success, dependent on a government which aims too low and so achieves little,' Mr Smith wrote recently. 'People want a hand up not a hand out.' Yet is all this nothing more than a continuation of Kinnockism? With ideology on the retreat, the central power struggle is over how to resolve Labour's identity crisis by giving electors a more convincing account of its goals. Those advocating that Labour should adopt Mr Clinton's appeal to what he described as the working middle class, with a message eschewing special interests in favour of the national one, seem to have caught the leader's ear. It is doubtful, however, whether Mr Smith could risk the traditionalists' wrath by endorsing fully a report by Ms Hewitt and Mr Gould which commended the SDP-Liberal Alliance for abandoning all the language of class politics and suggested projecting Labour as 'the non-political party'. A highly principled politician, steeped in Scottish Christian socialist tradition, Mr Smith's instincts are to appeal to the altruism of the electorate and the good sense of the party, not to resort to factionalism and schism. Both may be mistakes. The 1992 election suggested that Britain's voters are more self-interested than enlightened. And if he attempts to keep both Labour's traditionalists and modernisers happy, there is a danger that he will end up alienating both  -as well, for good measure, as the electorate.</p>

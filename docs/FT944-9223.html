			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Investors hope Clarke will open market in UK repos - The Bank of England is set to issue a consultation paper about a gilt repo market When the UK's chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, presents his budget on November 29, gilt market participants hope he will announce the establishment of an open market in the UK for gilt repurchase agreements, or repos. Although the UK has a limited repo and bond lending facility, pressure has been mounting for a system which would enable all market participants freely to borrow and lend government bonds between each other. Government bond markets in other countries, including the US, France and Germany, have well-developed repo facilities. However, although London is the European centre of non-dollar repo business, the sterling sector has yet to see an all-encompassing repo system. This may soon change. The Bank of England has spent the last year in close consultation with gilt market makers (Gemms) about a fully-fledged gilt repo market and is set to issue a consultation paper shortly. Many believe this will coincide with the Budget. The UK has two types of gilt repurchase agreements. First, there are the Bank of England's fortnightly money market repos, under which the Bank lends two- and four-week funds to the market against the security of gilts. This facility is limited to banks with eligible liabilities of more than Pounds 1.5bn, (Dollars 2.46bn), building societies, discount houses and Gemms. Alongside these, the Bank runs a system of stock borrowing and lending via a handful of stock exchange money brokers (SEMBs), accessible only to Gemms. This allows Gemms to finance their bond holdings and go short of stock, and enables investing institutions to lift their investment returns by earning income on the stock they lend. This system has the advantage that the Bank of England can monitor daily the level of stock borrowing. However, many operators complain the system is inflexible and unfair to market participants who are not Gemms. 'An open repo would generalise the stock lending system that exists now, but it would allow everyone to have the same access to the facility, rather than just market makers,' says Mr John Shepperd, at Yamaichi International, one of the 21 Gemms. 'A repo system would put the gilt market on an international standard - the UK is idiosyncratic in not allowing it.' Observers say an open gilt repo market would have several advantages. 'Repos would make the financing of long positions and covering of short positions more efficient, and thus add to the liquidity of the overall market,' says Mr Danny Corrigan, head of repo trading at NatWest Markets. 'In other markets, repos have enhanced liquidity,' he says. Such an increase in liquidity could attract more overseas participants, broadening the range of investors. 'A lot of foreigners would be happier trading gilts if there were a repo market,' says Mr Brian Plaistowe, at Nomura. Many say the increased liquidity arising from a system of open repos could reduce market pricing anomalies, such as between high- and low-coupon stocks. Some say it could lead to a reduction in gilt yields, easing the government's cost of funding. 'Additional liquidity will lead to tighter bid-offer spreads and reduce the funding costs for the Treasury,' says Mr Corrigan. 'If a gilt repo market allows more effective cash management by corporates and financial institutions, this should benefit the economy on a wider view,' adds Mr Ifty Islam, UK economist at Merrill Lynch. Some argue that the establishment of an open repo market would require a change in the taxation of gilts, requiring gross payment of gilt income rather than the current system of paying dividends net of tax. This could result in a loss of tax revenue for the government in the first year because tax payments would be deferred, and the Inland Revenue might find it more difficult to collect all the tax due. Mr Kevin Adams, UK bond strategist at BZW, says a repo market need not necessarily be accompanied by a change in the tax regime. 'It is not clear how big a consideration tax actually is - a large number of gilt investors suffer nil or very low effective tax rates.' Although most observers say the benefits of repos override the disadvantages, the risks should not be ignored. Repo participants face two types of credit risk: security and counterparty risk. The security risk is probably small, given that most such bonds are government securities with low default risk, but operators will have to pay close attention to the credit risk of their counterparties. According to Mr Islam, the Bank of England may be worried that 'by extending the range of institutions that can short gilts beyond the Gemms, over whom they have substantial influence, to others, most notably hedge funds, over whom they have much more limited power, they may lose control of the markets'. There may be concern about the effects of greater participation of leveraged investors on market volatility, he says. Such concerns mean that, if the UK authorities decide to set up a repo market, the Bank may follow a cautious strategy in implementing it.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL SHOWDOWN  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's schizophrenia over the environment and natural  resources is nowhere more apparent right now than in the proposed renewal of  40-year irrigation contracts between the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and  California farmers. The internal struggle represents a major conflict between  the Environmental Protection Agency and Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.'s Department  of the Interior, with the Council on Environmental Quality siding with EPA.  This is viewed by many in the Administration as a critical test case. The issue  has not caught much attention outside of selected California constituencies,  but its outcome could determine the Administration's future course on  environmental matters and Lujan's ability to survive as a politically viable  secretary of interior.  </P> <P> If the Administration follows logic and apparent legal precedent, it will order  a full environmental impact study of the contract renewals and their  considerable effect on California's complex water distribution system. If the  Administration elects to hew to the narrow and tenuous legal claims of the  Department of the Interior, it will reject an environmental study. The question  is whether the Administration will relent now and maintain President Bush's  desire to be a friend of the environment. Or whether it will side with mostly  Republican friends in the agricultural community, give away considerable  environmental credibility, and possibly lose the issue in the courts anyway.  </P> <P> The only reasonable answer is to proceed with the environmental impact report.  This may embarrass Secretary Lujan, but it will not necessarily mean the  farmers will lose any of the water they have been using from the Bureau of  Reclamation's Central Valley Project the past 40 years. For the Administration  to uphold Lujan's defiance of EPA would have the same effect as saying it  believes in the National Environmental Policy Act, the keystone of American  environmental law, only when it chooses to. From that point on, any claim by  Bush that he is a friend of the environment will have quite a hollow ring.  </P> <P> The somewhat unfortunate scapegoat of the affair is the Orange Cove Irrigation  District on the east side of the San Joaquin Valley, the first of some 300  districts to sign water delivery contracts with the Central Valley Project, in  July, 1949. Orange Cove is not typical of the agribusinesses that have been the  principal targets of conservation organizations such as the Natural Resources  Defense Council for receiving subsidized federal irrigation water, sometimes  for growing subsidized crops. Most Orange Cove farms are small family  operations that use water efficiently. Lujan issued a new 40-year contract to  Orange Cove last summer in definance of EPA's decision. The Department of  Interior claims that other federal law requires it to renew the contracts and  that no formal impact study was required. The Council on Environmental Quality,  an arm of the White House that attempts to settle intra-Administration disputes  of this sort, has sided with EPA. Lujan has had the matter under review ever  since and is expected to announce a decision soon.  </P> <P> The EPA position reportedly also has struck a sympathetic chord within the  Justice Department where Richard Stewart is the chief environmental lawyer, a  former Harvard Law professor and former chairman of the board of the  Environmental Defense Fund. Stewart, however, must defend the Department of  Interior against a Natural Resources Defense Council lawsuit that seeks to  force Interior to do the environmental analysis.  </P> <P> While only the one irrigation district is directly involved, the outcome of the  dispute will set a precedent for hundreds of contracts that will be expiring  throughout the West. The Central Valley Project of California alone distributes  some 7 million acre-feet of water a year, or more than seven times as much  water as the city of Los Angeles uses annually.  </P> <P> To ignore the environmental effects of such diversions is to show indifference  to massive alterations in California's water system over the years and to defy  the changing nature of its water needs. The Bush Administration could set  national water policy ahead by years if it approved the environmental studies,  perhaps in a joint venture with California, and used them as the centerpiece  for the reconciliation of a variety of water problems affecting both farmers  and city folk.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRRR-EATHTAKING ANNUAL RITE;  </P> <P> CLUB GOES OFF DEEP END IN COLD OCEAN  </P> <P> Knifing winds and 45-degree temperatures couldn't deter a hearty group of  Walrus Club members Friday from taking their traditional December plunge into  the chilly Pacific.  </P> <P> About 95 otherwise clear-thinking men and women -- clad only in shorts or  swimsuits -- walked, jogged and later jumped into the ocean as part of the  fifth-annual Walrus Run. The teeth-chattering event covered nearly 2 miles,  starting from the Newport Beach Athletic Club and ending in the 58-degree  waters off Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> The brainchild of Rudy Svrcek and a small group of Walrus Club members, the run  has become a quirky holiday tradition.  </P> <P> "It's like a Christmas party for us," said second-year Walrus runner Tina  Bazacas, 35, and a manager at the athletic club. "It's not a fund-raiser or  anything. It's just for fun."  </P> <P> Tim Rhone, a Newport Beach real estate broker and five-year Walrus veteran,  added: "It's a little craziness." He said the best way to prepare is "just get  up, get out of bed and do it."  </P> <P> Five-time veteran Rick Blake, 41, of Newport Beach said just the thought of  hitting the water in such cold weather makes him shiver.  </P> <P> "I think it's crazy," he said. "It's Newport Beach crazy people. That's what it  is. Crazy."  </P> <P> Craig Ryan, the Walrus' unofficial Santa Claus, said the runners are a hearty  group of jokesters.  </P> <P> "They almost threw me in last year," said Ryan, who wore a red Santa suit and  white beard as he greeted runners as they crossed from the sand to the water.  </P> <P> Although some Walrus runners were experienced, others were not. Aiko Kris, a  determined second-year runner, huffed and puffed nearly a mile before accepting  a ride from a van traveling down the First Avenue route.  </P> <P> "I'm always the last guy," said Kris, who is in her 50s.  </P> <P> The Walrus Club accepts new members each year, but participants said it's  sometimes difficult to convince prospects that jumping into the ocean during  winter can be fun.  </P> <P> "I try to get my friends to do it, but they're a little more sane than I am,"  said Tom Van Over, 41, a three-year Walrus veteran. "In December, running into  the water is stupidity."  </P> <P> Knox Brooks of Irvine is a self-proclaimed old-timer in the club. At 60, the  two-time runner said there's only one thing that motivates him to face the cold  beach sands each December: "Pure insanity. It runs in the family."  </P></p>

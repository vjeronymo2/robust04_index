			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Eduard Gonzalez article: "Cosmetic Reorganization of the </F> Government Could Conceal Any Intention You Like"]    [Text] The publication of the Russian president's edict on  the structure of the government has made a bizarre impact --  everybody has started to conjecture who will stay on as vice  premier and who will be stripped of the title. As for the rest,  the structural changes to the executive branch are unanimously  acknowledged to be cosmetic: There were 30 ministries, now  there will be 23; some the committees have been renamed, others  have been transformed, and still others have been abolished. Is  that all?    At first glance it is. But if we take another look, it  becomes obvious that we now have a two-tier executive branch:  The Russian Federation Government and the federal organs of  executive power. This is the "cosmetic" aspect -- there used to  be one tier, now there are two. And what are we to understand  by the government? Is it the executive branch or is it a kind of  special superstructure with the federal organs of executive  power below?    Let us assume that this is so. But who then is in the  government? According to the Constitution, it is the premier,  his deputies, and the federal ministers. At the same time it  has always been thought that the chairman of an intersector  state committee is even higher than a sector minister.  Provision has now been made in the structure for federal  ministries and "other federal organs of executive power." We  may assume that, in accordance with the Constitution, ministers  will be part of the government unless the cabinet decides to  restrict itself to five members. But what will happen to these  "other organs"?    I do not wish to belittle anyone, but I think everyone will  understand that the government will not include the directors of  the Russian Insurance Activity Oversight Service or the Taxation  Police Department. But what will be the position of the  committees for industrial policy or machine building, or the  counterintelligence and employment services? Finally, what  about the Committee for the Management of State Property? I  mean to say that their place among the "other federal organs" is  fixed. But what is their position vis-a-vis the government?    It should be noted that, at this top level of political  leadership, it is normally the case that nothing is ever "just  so." Privatization began two-and-a-half years ago, and an  appropriate law was adopted at the time. Among other things, it  said that the chairman of Goskomimushchestvo [the State  Committee for the Management of State Property] was a member of  the government and an ex officio deputy premier. I cannot  recall anyone rescinding that law, but the law, of course, is  not the main issue -- the matter goes deeper than that. It is  clear that at the time this committee was "elevated" because  privatization had only just gotten under way. But what now?  Maybe it has finished?    The privatization program is supposed to have been adopted  quite recently, so it is continuing. Although it must be  admitted that by no means everybody is enthusiastic about the  way it is developing. Surely it would be better if  Goskomimushchestvo were to forfeit all its influence over the  members of the government -- the federal ministers -- and  through them its influence over regional authorities?    Maybe Goskomimushchestvo has dropped down into the category  of "other federal organs" because it has trodden on too many  people's toes? In that case permit me to ask the central  question: Generally speaking, what kind of government structure  are we discussing? Everyone agrees that we are talking about a  reform government. But privatization is at the heart of the  reforms. Moreover, it is the part of the reforms, which gives  something to people rather than taking it away from them.  Incidentally, it is the only aspect of the reforms that has a  clear, approved, and detailed program for the coming year. What  reforms would the government implement if it were to drop this  program?    My conjectures could be mistaken, however: After all, the  edict says nothing about Goskomimushchestvo's being outside the  government framework. The fact is that anyone can, if he so  desires, interpret the words of the edict in whatever way he  pleases. But in such cases it is usual practice to issue an  interim, trial document, which includes room for maneuver rather  than a totally definitive text. And, depending on the reaction,  the lacunae are then filled in with specifics. The proposed  structure, it should be recognized, could be filled with any  content whatsoever, right up to state sector regulation of the  economy.    It seems that the innovation involving dual subordination of  certain organs belongs in the same experimental category. The  Ministries of Defense, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and  dozens of different services are part of the executive branch  structure, but are also subordinate to the president. There is  supposedly nothing unnatural about this, because the entire  executive branch is subordinate to the president. He manages  his own branch through the government, but how is he going to  handle the elected representatives? He will apparently have to  establish a special apparatus. But this is just another guess.    No, I am still not going to describe the changes in the  government structure as cosmetic -- these changes raise too many  questions. Serious questions to which we have not yet received  any answers. However, there is a rule of thumb: If you want to  find out answers, you first of all have to phrase your questions  in such a way that they lead to the desired result. Or you may  not wish to phrase any questions at all. You can simply wait  for additional information to appear; which apparently will not  be long in coming.</p>

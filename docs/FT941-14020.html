			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Code of bank practice to change after complaints The governing principles of the code of banking practice are likely to be spelt out in a new section of the code when the second edition is published shortly. The expected revision would move the clauses setting out broad commitments about how banks should behave from the introduction to the main body of the code. One of the arguments put forward by organisations such as the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux for a statutory code of banking practice has been that banks have been ignoring the spirit of the voluntary code, and the change appears to be intended to meet that point. At present, the principles say that banks should act fairly and reasonably towards their customers, should try to give customers a good understanding of how their accounts operate and how the banking system works, and should maintain confidence in the security and integrity of banking and card payment systems. The new version is also expected to reflect concerns expressed by the Consumers' Association and others that bank staff serving customers did not know enough about the code, and that bank branches did not carry enough information about it. Changes to the code have been drafted by a joint working party of three trade associations representing banks and building societies - the British Bankers Association, the Association of Payment Clearing Services and the Building Societies Association. The working party received recommendations from an independent review committee headed by Sir George Blunden, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England. The new edition is expected to be published by the associations next month. Other revisions are expected to require banks to introduce pre-notification of charges on personal customers' accounts; and to tighten the wording that requires banks to obtain the consent of customers before giving their personal account details to other companies within the group. Most of the new edition will take effect from March, but there will be a time-lag for the introduction of pre-notification to allow for changes to computer systems.</p>

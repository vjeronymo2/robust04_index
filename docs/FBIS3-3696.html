Comrade Guo Jinlong said: In recent years, guided by the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  vast number of cadres in Tibet have further emancipated their  minds and renewed their mindsets. However, timeworn concepts  and outmoded ideas have not yet been uprooted. Under the new  situation today, arming the minds of party member-cadres with  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  and continuing to emancipate our minds and renew our mindsets  are important and urgent tasks as well as the basic aspects of  the party's ideological construction. He stressed: Party  member-cadres must set examples of study. They must be more  conscientious about the study and be more assiduous in doing  research. Leading cadres must use their own examples to guide  the study of party member-cadres at all levels.    Comrade Guo Jinlong pointed out: To build stronger  grass-roots party organizations in Tibet, we must start with  building up the grass-roots party organizations in the sprawling  agricultural and pastoral areas. We must firmly strengthen our  leadership, throw in more manpower, and spend more time in  improving various party branches and their supporting party  organs in rural areas. Meanwhile, we must make great efforts to  revitalize the weak and listless [ruan ruo huan san] leading  bodies as quickly as possible so that grass-roots party  organizations in agricultural and pastoral areas can be built  into fighting fortresses for launching antiseparatist struggles  and leading the masses to wipe out poverty and become affluent.    Speaking on the need for organizational and personnel  departments to build up themselves, Guo Jinlong forwarded these  three requirements: First, they must thoroughly study Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics so as to thoroughly emancipate their minds and  renew their mindsets. Second they must carry forward the fine  traditions and change their work style. Third, they must firmly  carry out set policies.    Lu Huimin, member of the regional party committee standing  committee and head of the regional party committee organization  department, examined last year's work and elaborated on this  year's projects.</p>

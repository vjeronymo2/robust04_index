			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "Fandango" (1985), directed by Kevin Reynolds, 91 minutes. Rated PG. Critics  panned this, one of Kevin Costner's first movies, because they said it went  nowhere.  </P> <P> But who says a movie has to go anywhere? This tale of five graduating Texas  college students contemplating their futures is poignant and adventurous.  GUILLERMO TORRES  </P></p>

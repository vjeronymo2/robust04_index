			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: UAP buys Provincial Insurance Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group privatised earlier this year, yesterday announced the purchase of Provincial Insurance in the UK as part of its plan to develop its network across the newly-unified European insurance market. The move with Provincial, the privately-held group which is the UK's 15th largest general insurance company, had long been mooted. UAP would not disclose the purchase price of Provincial, but indicated that it was 'notably less' than Pounds 300m (Dollars 474m). It said the final cost would be influenced by stock-market conditions at the time the deal is completed in November. Payment is entirely in cash. Mr Jacques-Henri Gougenheim, general controller of UAP, who co-ordinated the purchase agreement signed yesterday, said there were no plans to lay off staff or to remove the highly respected Provincial name. He said one of the reasons that UAP was attracted to Provincial was its telephone insurance company called Prospero, one of a growing number of companies offering motor and home insurance by telephone direct to the public, cutting out the industry's traditional intermediary, the broker. Provincial reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.8m last year. The deal signals a possible speed-up in cross-border deals by European insurers following the unification of the insurance market over the summer. In June, Commercial Union, the UK's biggest insurer, bought Victoire, France's fifth largest life insurance company, for some Pounds 1.5bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Gao Shangquan Says Hong Kong Land Fund To Be </F> Managed and Used by Special Administrative Region Government  After 1997 Handover"]    [Text] Regarding the recommendation made by the  Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] Economic Subgroup for retaining  the framework of the land fund for another one to three years  after 1997, members of the subgroup believed that some  newspapers had misinterpreted the recommendation, and therefore  they clarified the matter yesterday (5 May).    Gao Shangquan, head of the subgroup representing the Chinese  side said: Some media misinterpreted the economic subgroup's  recommendation as indicating that the Chinese Government is  unwilling to give up the land fund and is going to transfer it  to the mainland for investment. He pointed out that this is not  true.    He made the following four points of clarification:    (1) This land fund is an important financial source for the  Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government. This financial  source does not belong to anybody else or the mainland, but to  the SAR Government. This sum of money is generated by Hong Kong  land resources, after being processed by the people of Hong  Kong. Therefore, it naturally belongs to the SAR Government.    (2) This land fund will be handed to the SAR Government on  the very day of 1 July 1997. This is very definite and well  grounded.    (3) How the SAR Government will manage and use this sum of  money shall be decided by the SAR Government. No one else shall  interfere.    (4) If the SAR Government thinks that retaining the existing  framework of the land fund for the time being is conducive to a  smooth transition, it may consider doing so. The land fund will  be managed by the SAR Government. Besides, he held that this  period of retention should not be too long, but the actual  length of time shall still be decided by the SAR Government.    Fong Wong Kut-man, head of the subgroup representing the  Hong  Kong side, explained that the dominant view within the subgroup  did not suggest merging the land fund with the exchange fund  because there are more restrictions on the exchange fund. If  the SAR government finds it necessary to use this fund to  stabilize the currency, there might be difficulty in withdrawing  this fund. Therefore, the subgroup thinks that if the land fund  can be handled separately, the SAR government will have some  flexibility. This was "purely the good intention" of the  subgroup.    As regards the alternative of putting the fund into the  reserves, Fong Wong Kut-man pointed out: The future SAR  government's financial policies remains anchored to the  principle of a balanced budget, and it is not necessary to  overdraw a large sum on the reserves. Therefore the subgroup  did not think it necessary to put the land fund into the  Treasury.    Furthermore, when asked about the political subgroup's  earlier statement about composing anew the Legislative Council,  Fong Wong Kut-man, who is also member of the political subgroup,  said that the subgroup had always understood "composing" or  "reorganizing" as "re-elections."</p>

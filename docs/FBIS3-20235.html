			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The submarine Le Triomphant was secretly launched in  Cherbourg this weekend. More details now with Herve de Haro  from Cherbourg:    [Haro] Le Triomphant is a high-tech marvel. With a  displacement of 12,640 tons and a length of 138 meters, it is  much larger than its predecessors. It is faster too and should  also be extremely quiet, one of the quietest in the world -- it  could even be called a stealth submarine. Its propeller is  classified top secret and protected from preying eyes and to  make it even more silent.    Le Triomphant is now in its natural element. It will sail in  a few months time for its first sea trials. The first concern  of the DCN [Direction of Navy Shipbuilding] is to monitor all  noise made by the equipment on board the submarine. It will be  recorded and analyzed.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Inflation-beaters - Index Linked IT SEEMED that Britain faced a decade of low inflation. But sterling's effective devaluation means that inflation might return, as the lower pound forces up import prices. How can savers protect themselves? The two obvious investments are index-linked National Savings certificates, and gilts. The former offer a tax-free rate of 4.5 per cent, plus inflation, if held for five years. So, if you assume that inflation will average 5 per cent between now and 1997, the certificates will return a tax-free 9.5 per cent. But if you surrender them within five years, you will not get such a good return. Index-linked gilts are rather more complicated but can offer protection over a longer term - one issue does not mature until 2030. The repayment value is based on the change in the retail price index (RPI) between the time of issue and the date of maturity. (For technical reasons, a date eight months before issue and maturity is used for indexation purposes). Thus, if the RPI rises from 100 to 200 over the life of the gilt, it will be repaid at double its issue price. In addition, a small income is paid very year - normally 2 or 2.5 per cent - which also increases in line with the RPI. Because of these complications, the small investor cannot know for sure what the actual return to maturity on an indexed gilt will be. You can only work out the real (after inflation) return; on long-dated issues, that is now more than 4 per cent. With conventional gilt yields at more than 9 per cent and inflation at 3.6 per cent, it might seem that a fixed-rate gilt offers a better real return. But the bulk of the return from an indexed gilt comes from capital gain, which is tax-free. Buying most conventional gilts means receiving the bulk of the return in taxable income. Higher rate taxpayers might, therefore, find index-linked particularly attractive.</p>

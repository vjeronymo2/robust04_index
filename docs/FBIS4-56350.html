			<p>BFN     [Text] The approval of the accord on proposed measures and  strategies to correct the national financial imbalance was the  most important moment of this special session of the National  Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] held in the presence  and with the active participation of Commander in Chief Fidel  Castro.    The text of the document introduced by ANPP President  Ricardo  Alarcon de Quesada underscores the need to guarantee strict  control of the implementation of the national budget at every  level:    [Begin Alarcon recording] It asks the provincial and  municipal assemblies to systematically audit the implementation  of the budget in every region and promote the measures necessary  to reduce expenses and increase revenues.    It charges the ANPP Standing Commission for Economic  Affairs,  in close cooperation with the Finance and Price Ministry, with  directing the fulfillment of this task.    It highlights the importance of the accords adopted by the  workers assemblies to promote economic efficiency and those  accords that will be further developed through the assemblies,  to be held from this date on, at work centers.    Likewise, it highlights the decisions approved by  cooperative  workers and those to be promoted by the Farmer's Honor and Pride  assemblies, which are about to begin.    It determines that deputies, provincial and municipal  delegates, and People's Councils are to be closely tied to these  processes, and supports them in their contributution to the  development of a powerful, effective, and systematic movement of  the working masses in order to promote, from the base,  collective initiatives to rationally use available resources,  increase labor discipline and morale, adopt possible actions to  increase efficiency, and audit compliance.    Our working people, who honorably confront the current  adversities, have expressed their categorical rejection of the  unscrupulous activities of those who have become wealthy, or  intend to do so, at the expense of the sacrifice of the  majority, and have demanded energetic action against those  manifestations and their perpetrators.    As a result, the ANPP charges the Council of State and  Government with adopting, as quickly as possible, every measure  necessary, including those that might have an exceptional  character, to eradicate those activities in the shortest  possible period and exemplarily sanction the people involved.    The ANPP, likewise, charges the government with adopting  decisions to systematically reduce the subsidies to cover losses  of enterprises and other budgeted expenses, as well as  increasing state budget revenues to significantly reduce the  fiscal deficit.    To attain the stability of funds deposited in the People's  Savings Bank [BPA] in correspondence with decisions affecting  the volume of cash in circulation, while preserving the  integrity of the BAP and savings incentives.    To establish measures promoting adequate control of the  circulation of hard currency in the country, ensuring that the  goals for which this circulation was authorized is fulfilled,  and corresponding with measures adopted to streamline national  finances.    To introduce essential production incentive mechanisms to  promote an increase in the offer of products and services to the  population at appropriate prices to stimulate the streamlining  of national finances.    To study price and tariff increases on selected products and  services taking, into account the feasibility of increasing  prices on consumer items -- basically, nonessential products  such as cigarettes and alcoholic beverages -- and tariffs in  certain service categories such as public food services,  transportation, and electricity, as well as charging for  gratuities.    To gradually implement a new comprehensive tax system,  taking  into account indispensable elements of social justice to protect  the lowest income sectors, stimulate work and production, and  contribute to balancing national finances.    To study the selective introduction of a tax on personal  income, excluding taxes on salary retributions, as well as  increasing other taxes, rates, and contributions to state  revenues.    To also study, in this regard, charging a tax for the use of  aqueduct and water service, as well as having the workers  contribute to the financing of social security.    To examine the feasibility of a change of currency to  complement measures to be implemented at the opportune moment.  Adopting other measures that, within these proposals, in the  opinion of the government, are considered adequate and effective  toward streamlining national finances.    The actions undertaken, and those to be taken in the future,  require the understanding and support of our people. These will  lead us to gradually overcome the current difficulties and will  allow us to preserve the work created with everyone's effort,  assuring for Cuba an even more just and noble future.    We call on everyone today to persevere in the heroic  resistance, to redouble daily efforts, to continue demonstrating  the undefeatable strength of our patriotic and revolutionary  will, to continue fighting united to save our fatherland,  Revolution, and socialism.    National Assembly of the People's Government, 2 May 1994.  [end recording]    Commander in Chief Fidel Castro gave an address following  the  approval of the accord.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOTHESLINES  </P> <P> Q: Is the red tie popularized by Donald Trump the power tie of 1990? I've heard  yellow is more powerful now. -- T.E.J.  </P> <P> A: Many of the Fortune 500 types remain in the black with red ties.  </P> <P> Others keep out of the red in yellow ties, although that color seems to have  slipped in the ratings. And some Wall Streeters are wearing pink ties. Men's  wear designer Bill Robinson, winner of many awards, says the power look of the  '90s is a tie of many colors, but instead of a standard paisley or a foulard,  the new versions offer bolder, larger-scale patterns, such as scrolls, florals  or vegetation prints.  </P> <P> This tie of titans is a little wider than Trump's, says Robinson, averaging  about 3 3/4 inches. And it looks best, he says, with shirts that have longer  collar points. Robinson's woven tapestry-look tie (illustrated here) in navy  with gold scrollwork is $62.50.

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> INJURY SIDELINES SABRES' VAIVE  </P> <P> Buffalo Sabres winger Rick Vaive is likely to miss the team's next two games  because of a rough check administered by Boston's Bob Sweeney.  </P> <P> Sweeney cross-checked Vaive head-first toward the corner boards with 1:47  remaining in overtime during Wednesday night's game, which ended in a 3-3 tie.  </P> <P> Vaive appeared to avoid more serious injury by rolling his head to the side a  second before impact.  </P> <P> After watching replays of the incident Thursday, Vaive said the NHL should  strengthen its rules against back-side checking.  </P> <P> "I'm lucky I didn't break my neck," Vaive said. "Something like that should be  a 10- or a 20-game suspension, cut and dried and that's it."  </P> <P> Sweeney received a minor penalty for the check. Vaive said he was not accusing  Sweeney of malicious intent to injure, but said a back-side check should result  in suspension even if it was accidental.  </P></p>

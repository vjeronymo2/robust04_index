			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (5): New and exciting products - Office Software THE 1990s will bring about the biggest revolution in office software that we have ever seen. The decade is about useability, software that is flexible, interesting to use and designed to meet the real needs of the business. Gone are those boring inflexible systems that operated on different computers, never talking to each other and churning out endless reams of paper which no-one read. We are now seeing the emergence of new and exciting software that will pave the way to fully integrated office solutions of the future. Software has been developed with Europe in mind, providing a standard solution for subsidiary companies across Europe, no matter in which country they operate. The problem is that most of the business software that exists at the moment is of the boring, inflexible type and therefore there will be a transition over the next two or three years as companies realign themselves to the new generation of software being developed. The most important aspect in this realignment is choosing the operating system for the future. It is now accepted that the old proprietary operating systems - that is systems developed by hardware manufacturers to run exclusively on their own hardware platforms - are just about dead and buried. The only exception is IBM with its proprietary mid-range and main-frame systems. The trend today is towards Open Systems; systems that can operate on a variety of hardware platforms, outside the control of any one manufacturer. Open Systems encompasses the multi-user environments of DOS Networks and Unix. There are still many suppliers of DOS Networks and many flavours of Unix, but over the next few years they should align themselves behind the leading suppliers. Novel is starting to dominate the Network environment and Unix International the Unix environment. Many people still have a PC at one end of their desk and a dumb terminal at the other. The future will be the PC alone as the personal entry point to the computer system. Open System Network environments, with their client-server architecture, enable the PC to act as the client linking to a variety of servers configured for Unix, Digital's VMS or IBM's AS/400. But this is not a PC using terminal emulation, this is a PC using its own hard disk to store local programs and only interrupting the server to update the data files located centrally. While the hardware technology for Open Systems Networks exists, very few business and accounting packages have been developed to make use of this client-server technology. In fact there are still very few business and accounting packages that provide a really integrated office solution. Modern offices use word processors, spreadsheets, databases and electronic mail but few developers have tried to integrate these with the business and accounting system, and in many cases these software packages operate on different computer systems that are not even linked together. Users of spreadsheets, word processing and desk-top publishing systems widely accept the use of Windows, but users of business and accounting systems are not taken with this new technology. However, advancements in the design of the modern integrated business system reduces the need for intensive data entry and the Windows environment will become more important. September 1992 has brought with it a large number of launches of new and innovative business and accounting software products. Sage, with its market leading entry-level Sterling product, is launching Sterling+2 which is an advanced design of the existing product, incorporating the advantages of either the Windows environment or the character-based DOS environment - whichever the user prefers. It will be one of the first packages to have one screen that shows all of the information for the quarterly VAT return, and an invoice entry screen that really looks like an invoice. There has been a significant gap in the Unix market for highly functional mid-range business software capable of handling more than 50 users. In that market, Tetra has revamped its market-leading Unix package, Chameleon, as Chameleon 2000 with higher functionality designed around the lnformix Online database engine to cope with larger volumes of transactions. There are too many business packages available with no significant market leaders. In the next few years, as the software market matures, we will start to see packages that can be easily differentiated from the boring run-of-the-mill software that exists today. Fully integrated office products are now arriving on the scene. Exact, the market leader in Holland, is launching its financial package in the UK later this year, which directly links to spreadsheet packages cell-by-cell, giving a high level of on-line financial reporting. We are now seeing packages with direct links to the leading databases with products such as Oracle Financials, Cedardata CFACS, IBM's FMS/R, Prophesy, Miracle Tapestry, and Strata. Some packages are starting to link directly to E-Mail, such as Computer Associates' Masterpiece for the authorisation of invoices and many packages are starting to realise the importance of Executive Information Systems (ElS), providing drill-down/zoom capability and data in a graphical form with packages such as Kerridge, Fairview Control and QSP OLAS. It takes time to find the right software and with more than 800 different business and accounting products available in the UK, it is not a straightforward task. It is easy to find highly functional products that do not integrate with other products. But the future is about a totally integrated office environment that really is user friendly.</p>

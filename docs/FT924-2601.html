			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Widney Widney cut its loss from Pounds 512,000 to Pounds 313,000 in the 53 weeks ended October 3 1992. The underlying trend in improving operating profits was masked by final provisions on old problem contracts inherited at Widney Aish. Without such provisions, operating profits would have surged 80 per cent, directors said. Instead, they were just 19 per cent up at Pounds 510,000, and then had to stand interest charges of Pounds 823,000 (Pounds 941,000). Losses per share were 0.87p (1.24p). Turnover of the group, engaged in the manufacture of vending, water treatment and power transmission equipment, fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 20.2m).</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts rise on hopes for positive Autumn Statement UK GOVERNMENT bond prices rallied across the yield curve yesterday, buoyed by hopes of a cut in the base rate and a bond-positive Autumn Statement on Thursday. The market opened on a strong note, helped by speculation in the weekend press that the next cut in the base rate could be between 1.5 and 2 percentage points. Gilts ended between  1/8 and  1/4 of a point higher on the day in the cash market, after some profit-taking. Volume in the futures market was relatively low at about 19,000 contracts. The Liffe contract opened at 102.04 and reached a high of 102.12, before falling to end the day at 101.31. In the cash market, the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 climbed from 103 23/32 to 104.00 to yield 8.53 per cent, while the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 rose from 105 15/32 to 105 19/32 . The strong rally enabled the Bank of England to sell some of its latest tap stock, the 8 per cent gilt due 2009. The Bank announced Pounds 1bn of the stock for sale on Friday afternoon and dealers estimated that more than half of the stock was sold yesterday. US TREASURY prices were mixed in directionless trading yesterday, with shorter dated securities weaker following the three-year note auction but longer dated bonds steady-to-firmer. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 94 7/32 , yielding 7.743 per cent. The two-year note was lower, however, down 1/8 at 99 7/16 , yielding 5.534 per cent. Trading throughout the day was dominated by manoeuvring before and after the Treasury's sale of Dollars 15.5bn three-year notes. Prices at the short end eased initially as some investors moved out of the three-year in an attempt to nudge the yield higher and to prepare for the new supply. The auction subsequently proved marginally disappointing, with only lacklustre demand for the new paper. The issue was sold at an average yield of 5.17 per cent, and the cautious tone of the sale is likely to keep prices soft ahead of the upcoming 10-year note and 30-year bond auctions. JAPANESE government bond futures rallied strongly as yesterday's large fall in the stock market helped to revive hopes of an interest rate cut. The December futures contract climbed to a high of 107.80, from its opening level of 107.29, with the market performing strongly in the afternoon. The Nikkei stock index ended 452.76 points - or 2.68 per cent - lower than Friday's finish at 16,417.05, on the back of poor corporate results and political worries. The current political preoccupation with the Sagawa Kyubin bribery scandal is delaying the implementation of the supplementary budget, dealers said. They added that if the delays continued, the combination of the worsening economic climate and inability to move on the fiscal front could put pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut the official discount rate. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.73 per cent and reached 4.64 per cent before closing at 4.65 per cent. FRENCH government bonds slipped about a quarter of a point in the afternoon, as some US investors took profits in relatively thin trading. The December bond futures contract on the Matif exchange ended the day at around 110.80, down from 111.04. Longer-dated bonds lost ground, but short-dated issues remained relatively firm, dealers said. GERMAN government bonds ended firmer after trading in a narrow range. The Liffe bund futures contract moved from a low of 91.46 to a high of 91.63, and ended the day at around 91.57. While 10-year bund futures ended firmer, the five-year bund contract edged lower, reflecting some profit-taking after last week's rally in the medium-dated sector. As a result the yield curve flattened slightly.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/42: "EU Supports Payment and </F> Clearing Systems in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus"]    [Text] Assistance to countries of the former USSR under the  TACIS [Technical Assistance to CIS] program took a major step  forward last week with the signing of a contract for nearly ECU2  million to provide expert advice for the modernization of their  payment and clearing systems. The main beneficiary is the  Central Bank of Russia, but substantive assistance is also being  provided for a new institution, the Inter State Bank, and for  the central banks of Ukraine and Belarus. The contractor is a  Spanish-British consortium led by the Sema group of Spain.    Despite initiatives to combat fraud, organize clearing  houses, reduce delays and improve payment security, considerable  problems remain in the payment systems of the NIS [newly  independent states] countries. It can still take several weeks  until a payment is made between, for example, Vladivostok and  St. Petersburg. This inhibits the development of trade both  within the countries as well as between the NIS. In particular,  the lack of a multilateral clearing institution between the NIS  central banks has been seen as a major deficiency and has led to  the setting up of an Inter State Bank to serve this purpose.  These problems are moreover associated with a worrying lack of  transparency on the net position of credits and liabilities  between banks, and between banks and their customers, implying  possible hidden insolvency problems. Meanwhile, private  individuals continue to distrust the banking system.    Not surprisingly therefore, modernization and upgrading of  the NIS payment and clearing systems has been seen as a priority  in designing technical assistance to strengthen the NIS central  banks. The Commission earmarked funds for this purpose as part  of wider efforts to assist the NIS central banks. The  assistance is being delivered in close cooperation with other  donors and NIS central banks. The assistance to the Russian  Central Bank is being coordinated under the aegis of an  international steering committee comprising the Commission, the  IMF, other multilateral financing institutions and cooperating  Western central banks, (Banque de France, Deutsche Bundesbank,  Bank of England, U.S. Federal Reserve) and the OECD.    In more detail, the TACIS assistance aims:    i) To strengthen the capacity of the Central Bank of Russia  to formulate and implement reform policy initiatives by  providing a pool of highly qualified European payment system  experts to the beneficiary institutions;    ii) to provide training and expert assistance during the  start-up phase of the Inter State Bank whose task is to put in  place and manage an efficient interstate payment system among  the NIS; and    iii) to help the central banks of Ukraine and Belarus to  cooperate successfully in making an improved interstate payment  system work. In this regard, assistance to the Central Bank of  Belarus will naturally take account of the recent agreement with  Russia on monetary unification.</p>

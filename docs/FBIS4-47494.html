The operating  principle and the design of the instrument are described and its  principal technical specifications are given. Hardware and  software were developed which ensure the necessary operating  modes and instrument automation, control of the measurement  process and documentation of the results. A key part of the  outfit is an IBM PC-XT personal computer with a universal  controller. Programs ensure proper conditions for photometric  measurement of the sample (changing the angular coordinate and  direction of rotation of the sample relative to its initial  position, supplying values of the accompanying angular  coordinates, interval of change of angle and number of executed  intervals), as well as implementation of the procedure of  collecting and processing of measurement data and ensuring the  proper number of readings to be used in averaging the signals of  the photoreception system for attaining the necessary  reproducibility of the results. The results in the form of  scattering diagrams are represented on a display screen and are  printed out. The results of study of the scattering diagrams of  a rough metallic surface at wavelengths 0.65 and 10.6 m and  MS14 milk glass at scattering angles 64 and 104 are  compared.

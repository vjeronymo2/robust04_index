			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Text of the political statement on the creation of the </F> Russia's Choice Party]    [Text] Russia is living through one of the most dramatic  periods in its history. There is a real threat of a nomenklatura  revanche and of national extremists and undisguised fascists  coming into power.    Russia has no future unless reforms are continued, norms of  a  civil society reinforced, and economic and political stability  ensured.    We can no longer tolerate the fact that the disciplined  forces of reaction and revanche are opposed by a fractured and  amorphous democratic movement. Therefore, we undertake to  build an organized political force--a party of stability, order,  and reforms.    Russia's Choice is for a free society, where human rights  constitute the highest priority and are securely protected;  where authority is limited by law, and the law itself is fair  and is observed unfailingly.    Russia's Choice is a party of stability. Protection of  ownership rights and bringing down inflation are the foremost  conditions for economic growth in our and your country.    Russia's Choice is for a state that is effective but not  burdensome for taxpayers. We are against the omnipotence of  bureaucrats, who reward themselves with wealth and privileges.    Russia's Choice is for a Great Russia, occupying its proper  place in the world community.    Russia's Choice is a party of peace. We intend to resist any  attempts to plunge the country into military adventures. We are  for peace and accord in the Russian society.    We urge everyone who is inspired by these goals and ideas to  join the Russia's Choice Party. An organizational congress will  be held within the next few months.    [Signed] Ye. Gaydar, S.

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / River fish caught up in a Pounds 67m controversy: The opening of a public inquiry into a south Wales barrage The twaite shad is an obscure fish but, together with other migratory species, it will feature prominently at a public inquiry which opens today into a proposal to build a Pounds 67m barrage across the river Usk in Newport, south Wales. The scheme has drawn more than 250 objections from individuals and bodies such as the National Rivers Authority, Brecon Beacons national park and the United Usk Fishermen's Association. They are concerned at the possible effect of the barrage on one of Wales's most renowned rivers. It includes species such as salmon, sewin, eels and the shad, described by the NRA as of 'special conservation interest'. It is the third barrage proposed in south Wales, all with the intention of encouraging the regeneration of surrounding derelict areas by improving their appearance. One across the Tawe at Swansea was completed a year ago. After protracted parliamentary opposition, work is starting on the Cardiff Bay barrage which will create a 500-acre freshwater lake. Newport's barrage is promoted by the borough council and Gwent county council, and would be funded by the two councils. The barrage, with the secondary aims of providing a road crossing and flood protection, has the support of the town's two MPs. Two enabling bills have been withdrawn, the second time because of a 1992 act which allows the parliamentary process to be sidestepped by a public inquiry. The final decision will rest with Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary. If approval is given, construction will start in 1997, with completion in the year 2000. There is optimistic talk of the barrage leading to Pounds 300m of investment and the creation of 5,000 jobs. Newport has already been successful in attracting companies to business parks near the M4 and has hopes of winning more when the second Severn crossing is completed in 1996. But the old docklands area near the town centre remains largely derelict, with decrepit sheds, scrapyards and boarded-up shops. At low tide the banks of the Usk are a dismal spectacle of mud, debris and sewage outlets. 'The town has turned its back on the river,' said Mr Roger Davies, head of urban development for Newport. He argues that the dereliction reinforces the image of a 19th-century industrial town. In contrast, Mr David Jones Powell, a solicitor representing the United Usk Fishermen's Association, regards the barrage as 'a 20th-century folly'. He says the fishermen are not opposed to the regeneration of Newport, but a barrage appears to be a frivolous solution. 'Newport's case seems to be that mudbanks have put off development but that hasn't happened elsewhere.' The anglers' concern that migratory species would be deterred, in spite of the barrage's fish passes, is shared by Powys county council, the Countryside Council for Wales and Brecon Beacons national park. Authorities at the park, which covers about 35 miles of the upper Usk, are also worried about the effect on otters. In its evidence to the inquiry the NRA will say that migratory fish would have to negotiate the barrage and then 11 miles of impounded water. The barrage 'would create an unacceptable risk to the fish stocks and fisheries of the river, particularly in view of their high conservation, sporting and commercial value'. Some anglers believe there is initial evidence that the run of salmon on the Tawe has been lower since Swansea's barrage opened, although the city council says it is too early for firm conclusions and it is unaware of any real problems. The NRA is to publish an interim study of the Tawe's fish stocks. This could influence the Newport inquiry, which is expected to last three months.</p>

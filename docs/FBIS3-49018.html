			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jadranko Prlic, president of the government of the  Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, has sent a letter to the  Government of Croatia in reaction to the conduct of the Muslim  side and the latest developments in central Bosnia.    In his letter Jadranko Prlic notes that at their last  session  the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna  and the government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna  discussed the political and military situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina with special emphasis on the course of  negotiations on the future political system in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The common view is that in the negotiations  so far, the Croat delegation has made most concessions and that  any further concessions to other sides in the negotiations would  not only place the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in an  unequal position toward the two other constituent nations but  would directly threaten its survival.    The Muslim army continues to attack the Croat people,  especially in central Bosnia. At the same time top Muslim  politicians have openly threatened to pursue their territorial  conquest of the centuries-old Croat homes in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In view of the above, the Republic of Croatia is called on  to  reexamine its overall relations with the Republic of Bosnia-  Herzegovina where -- contrary to its constitution -- decisions  are now being made by authorities that are exclusively under  Muslim control.    The letter also contains a request to annul the document by  which the Republic of Croatia recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina, in  view of the fact that since the recognition major changes have  been made in the foundations of constitutionality of  Bosnia-Herzegovina by the fact that the Muslim side has achieved  illegitimate dominance.    In addition, we ask the Republic of Croatia to end its  participation in the talks on the future organization of  Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the Muslim side halts its offensive in  central Bosnia and provides firm guarantees that it will end its  aggression against our people, the president of the government  of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna says in his letter to the  Government of the Republic of Croatia.</p>

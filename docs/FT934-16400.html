			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Denmark sets benchmark with FFr7bn Eurobond offer THE Kingdom of Denmark established a new benchmark in the French franc sector of the international bond market with a FFr7bn offering of six-year Eurobonds. This is Denmark's largest single offering in the French franc sector and equals the record for a French franc Eurobond, set in May by the Republic of Spain. Spain initially raised FFr6bn through an offering of 15-year Eurobonds but swiftly increased the deal by FFr1bn. Lead manager Paribas said Denmark's offering injected badly-needed liquidity into the six-year area of the yield curve since the 8 1/8 per cent French government's OAT due 1999 now traded at around 111.75. The bonds have become difficult to trade because of their significant premium to par. However, Paribas acknowledged that the pricing of Denmark's bonds, at a spread of 15 basis points over the yield on the underlying OAT, was aggressive. The view in the market was that the spread should have been five basis points wider. By late afternoon, the bonds were trading at 98.27, compared with a re-offer price of 98.61, and the spread had widened to 21 basis points, traders said. Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department of Denmark's National Bank, said that the proceeds of the issue would kept in French francs and would be used to refinance the large amount of outstanding commercial paper which was falling due this month. He said that this issue was likely to be Denmark's last large Eurobond issue for some time because of the DKr8bn rise in the country's foreign exchange reserves to DKr68bn in September. 'This is higher than we consider necessary,' he said, adding the reserves would be reduced in order to refinance commercial paper as it fell due. The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) raised CDollars 250m through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. They were priced to yield 23 basis points over the 7 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due 2003. Lead manager SBC said the pricing of the issue was in line with levels in the secondary market for 10-year Canadian dollar paper issued by other triple A-rated borrowers. However, some syndicate managers said that the spread should have been in the high 20s in view of the uncertainty in the market ahead of Canada's general election later this month. SBC said that the bonds were selling well to institutions who were attracted by the differential of 170 basis points between the yields in the Canadian and US bond markets. Mr Stephen Abrahams, head of the IADB's capital markets division, said the proceeds of the issue had been swapped into Swiss francs. He added that the IADB had a further Dollars 1.2bn to raise before the end of the year and was considering an issue in yen, Swiss francs, guilders or dollars. The IADB was also looking closely at the French franc sector where funding rates had become much more competitive, he said. The IADB's funding programme for 1993 is around Dollars 4.5bn and is likely to raise the same amount next year. Elsewhere, Banco Mexicano, a private-sector Mexican bank, is due to make its debut in the Euromarket next week with a five-year issue of between Dollars 125m and Dollars 150m. The issue will be made under the bank's Dollars 350m global MTN programme. Lead manager Chemical said the bonds were likely to be priced to yield between 340 and 360 basis points over underlying US Treasuries.</p>

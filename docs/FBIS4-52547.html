			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Must Not Apply Double Standard to Solution of </F> International Issues: DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman" -- KCNA  headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK  Foreign Ministry answered a question put by KCNA today on the  U.S. efforts to force the Arab countries to lift their economic  sanctions against Israel. "We cannot but raise a question about  such behaviour of the United States," he said.    "Making frequent visits to Mideast countries in late April  and early May, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher put  pressure on Arab countries to withdraw their economic sanctions  against Israel," the spokesman noted, and went on:    "While trying to get economic sanctions lifted on Israel  which is threatening peace in the Middle East with nuclear  weapons, the United States is blaring that "sanctions" will be  taken against the DPRK which has no nuclear weapons in  actuality. This is a reversed logic and the undisguised  application of double standard to the international relations.    "This contradictory act of the United States makes it plain  that the `nuclear issue' over which it is raising a hue and cry  is a fiction invented by it for the sinister political aim of  isolating and stifling the DPRK.    "The United States must not apply a double standard to the  solution of international issues including the nuclear issue.    "The world people will approach with high vigilance the  unjust act of the United States which is trying to impose its  unilateral assertion on others, ignoring the stand of the  parties concerned, styling itself the international police."</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS CAUGHT BY GIANTS  </P> <P> The Dodgers went from one race to another Sunday in one embarrassing step.  </P> <P> No longer fighting for the division championship, they have suddenly found  themselves fighting for second place and self-respect. And they are losing that  fight, as evidenced by an 8-2 loss to the San Francisco Giants that allowed the  Giants to sweep them and their raucous fans to taunt them.  </P> <P> Before 44,235 at Candlestick Park, most of whom were chanting, "Sweep, sweep,  sweep," the Dodgers fell into a tie with the Giants for second place with three  games remaining.  </P> <P> "You battle all season, you work, you struggle, and then suddenly it's over.  I'm sure it's hard for the majority of these guys to go out and keep their  aggressiveness," said catcher Barry Lyons, who provided the only bright spot by  hitting a pinch homer in his second at-bat as a Dodger.  </P> <P> One day after eliminating themselves from the National League West championship  race that was won by the Cincinnati Reds, the Dodgers committed three errors  and Fernando Valenzuela suffered through a potential free agent's nightmare.  </P> <P> Valenzuela gave up eight runs, seven earned, in four innings, ensuring that he  ends the year with one victory in his last six starts with an 8.69 ERA in that  time.  </P> <P> Was it his last start as a Dodger? Nobody will talk about it, but while the  statistics say he will not return to the team, reality says he probably should.  </P> <P> The Dodgers may not like his 13-13 record and 4.59 ERA, and the fact that he  has not been above .500 since 1986. But he pitched 204 innings after pitching  196 2/3 innings last year.  </P> <P> With Orel Hershiser and perhaps Tim Belcher questionable for the start of next  season , they might need those innings.  </P> <P> "He's been going out there every fifth day and has been doing that for years,"  Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "And tell me, how many more guys have won 13  games?"  </P> <P> In the National League, just 11 other pitchers have won 13 games this season.  </P> <P> Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, is offering no hints. He said he will not  outline off-season plans until after the club's organizational meetings in  Arizona Oct. 10-13.  </P> <P> Valenzuela left the clubhouse before the end of the game Sunday and was not  available for comment.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> The Dodgers open the 1991 season April 9 in Atlanta. . . . When Dodger catcher  Barry Lyons met reliever Pat Perry, making his first appearance since June 2,  at the mound during the eighth inning, there was some question as to whether  the two little-used players had been introduced. "No, I know Pat Perry real  well," Lyons said. "I hit my first career homer off him." . . . Despite a sore  right wrist he thought might cause him to miss the final games, Lenny Harris  asked to remain in the lineup and responded with three hits.  </P></p>

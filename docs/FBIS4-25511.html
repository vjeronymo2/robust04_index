			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Tai (3769 1132): "Eternal Feelings, </F> Profound Concern--Record of Wan Li's Conversation with Yan  Hongchang, a Peasant From Xiaogang"]    [Text] Time: The morning of 9 May 1994    Venue: Fengzeyuan, Zhongnanhai    Comrade Yan Hongchang, chairman of the board of directors  and  general manager of the Xiaogang General Agriculture, Industry,  and Commerce Business Company of Fangyang County, Anhui Province  (former deputy leader of the Xiaogang production team who took  the lead in making comprehensive production contracts) and  Comrade Song Fuhao, deputy general manager of the company,  accompanied by Comrade Zhang Guangyou (former chief editor of  NONGMIN RIBAO), visited Comrade Wan Li.    While Comrade Wan Li was happily shaking hands with them,  Comrade Zhang Guangyou asked Comrade Wan Li: "Do you still  remember him? This (pointing at Yan Hongchang) is Yan  Hongchang, former deputy leader of the Xiaogang production team  who took the lead in making comprehensive production contracts  on a household basis in the past."    [Wan] Be seated, be seated!    [Yan] All the peasants in Xiaogang miss you. They have  asked me to pay you a visit! You supported us in making  production contracts on a household basis. At present, we all  have enough to eat and are having a comfortable life. We thank  you from the bottom of our hearts and we all long to see you  again!    (On the afternoon of a certain day in the first lunar month  of 1979, 15 years ago, Yan Hongchang and others held a meeting  with 18 peasant households of the Xiaogang production team and  adopted three "rules" including making comprehensive production  contracts on a household basis. The Xiaogang production team  and Fengyang County, in which the production team was located,  took the lead in rural reform in China. Comrade Wan Li was  secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC Committee in January 1980.  On hearing what had happened, he was deeply moved by the  peasants of Xiaogang. He immediately went to Xiaogang to carry  out an inspection. He made enquiries from door to door and  affirmed the practice of the Xiaogang production team. He said:  "I agree with what you have done. The Prefectural CPC  Committee has given approval for you to have production  contracts for three years, and I will give approval for you to  have production contracts for five years. As long as you can  make greater contributions to the country, retain more funds for  the collectives, and improve the living standard of the commune  members, you will not be regarded as `turning the clock back'  even if you continue with you contracts all your life.")    [Zhang] When I went to Xiaogang the year before last, the  peasants there asked me to take an old hen to you. I told them  it was not necessary because you could easily get one. Besides,  it was inconvenient to carry it.    [Wan] How is the life of the people in Xiaogang?    [Yan] Not bad. Much better than the days you visited them.  They all have enough to eat.    [Wan] Do they all eat flour and rice?    [Yan] They can afford rice and flour now.    [Wan] Can they afford meat?    [Yan] They can buy it whenever they want to.    [Wan] How about clothing?    [Yan] They have enough to wear and are wearing better  clothes.    [Wan] How about their living conditions? Have they all  moved into new houses? How many thatched cottages remain?    [Yan] Eighty percent of the people are living in brick  houses, but there are still a small number of thatched cottages.    [Wan] What is the per-capita income?    [Yan] The per-capita income was over 800 yuan last year.    [Wan] That is still much too little! It would be okay to  have 2,000 yuan. In addition to food and clothing, they should  at least have a purchasing power of 1,000 yuan. Without such a  purchasing power, it is impossible for the market to flourish.  Foreigners say China is a vast market. China's population  mainly consists of peasants. How can this market be vast if the  peasants' purchasing power is poor? We cannot depend on cities  alone. Therefore, I hope you all will become rich and hope all  peasants of the country will become rich, live a comfortable  life, and have much more income.    Do they all have television sets now?    [Yan] Yes, they do.    [Wan] Color ones?    [Yan] All except those of two households are black and white  television sets.    [Wan] Too few. What is the per capita amount of land for  the team?    [Yan] Over three mu.    [Wan] That means that net income per mu is only 200 yuan  strong. They cannot become rich by relying on farming alone.    [Zhang] At present, the income from growing grain is too  little. The cost of growing grain is high, but the price of  grain is low. In some localities, the income from growing a mu  of grain is not so much as the price of one jin of crabs. The  price of one jin of crabs on the market is 150 yuan and that of  a soft-shelled turtle is also 150 yuan. It is impossible to  become rich by relying on farming alone ... .    [Wan] Only if an able-body peasant can grow 50 mu of  grain will it be possible for his income to exceed 10,000 yuan.  It is impossible for an able-body person growing eight to ten  mu of grain to become rich. How many illiterate people are  there in the production team?    [Yan] All children go to school. Quite a lot of grown-ups  are illiterate, about 50 percent. Almost all people over 40 are  illiterate.    [Wan] You must pay attention to training qualified  personnel. Only by properly grasping education can there be an  outlet. The issue of qualified personnel is very important.  You must attach importance to education and to the training of  qualified personnel. In the final analysis, whether or not  production can develop and whether or not the economy can grow  are determined by the quality of the people.    You can establish ties with Shanghai and other developed  areas and send people to work there on contracts that last two  to three years in an organized manner. In this way, you can  earn money and learn technology at the same time and you can  train qualified personnel.    Have you set up some companies? What business do they do?    [Song] We have just started. Our foundation is poor and we  have little to start with. We can only undertake some small  projects first.    [Wan] You cannot earn much this way. Is the burden in your  place heavy?    [Yan] We use minibuses to transport passengers and can earn  more than 20,000 yuan a year. This can offset the amount to be  handed over to the state by all the people of the village.  Therefore, we do not find our burden heavy.    [Wan] What about that of the peasants in other villages?    [Yan] The burden of those without income other than farming  is heavy.    [Wan] What is the annual output value of township and town  enterprises of Fengyang County? Has it reached 500 million  yuan? You may not know.    [Zhang] No, we do not. Fengyang County had a poor  foundation to start with and does not have many channels for  developing industry. The county does not have products that  sell extremely well. Nor does it have industries which can  promote the development of other industries.    [Wan] "Without agriculture, we cannot have stability and  without industry, we cannot become rich!" We must develop  industry and properly run township and town enterprises.  Dingyuan, Fengyang, and Jiashan were all poor counties in the  past. How are they at present?    [Zhang] Dingyuan has a salt mine and Jiashan has a brewery.  Both are large projects. Fengyang has rich quartz deposits. You  mentioned it several times when I accompanied you there in the  past, but nothing has yet been achieved.    [Wan] Fengyang originally had a spectacles plant, isn't that  so? How is it at present? I read from NONGMIN RIBAO that there  is a county in Henan which has quickly become rich by breeding  loaches. There are indeed many ways to become rich. Provide the  peasants with more information. You must look for ways to  become rich on your own initiative.    I favor taking the proper way to develop the economy. You  should carry out good projects. You can have a comfortable life  once the economy is developed. [Yan] The people of Fengyang  and Xiaogang miss you and hope you will visit Fengyang again.  Come to have a look at Xiaogang. Great changes have taken  place.    [Wan] Well, well. I will go once you have properly  fulfilled your tasks.    [Yan] The county government has set up a small decorated  archway at the entry to Xiaogang Village and hopes you will  write an inscription for it.    [Wan] No, I will not! I do not favor formalism. I will not  support flourishes, building temples or tombs, or other similar  things. You should earnestly do a good job in production.    [Song] We understand. When we go back, we will properly  carry out our work and we shall make reports to you again after  we have made achievements.    [Wan] No need to report to me. Seize the time and work  earnestly.    [Yan] Revered Wan, can we have a photo taken as a memento?    [Wan] Well, all right. (Comrade Wan Li straightened out his  clothes and had two photos taken together with three of them.)    Finally, Comrade Wan Li shook hands with Yan Hongchang and  the others and bid them farewell. He saw them off outside the  door and waved to them.</p>

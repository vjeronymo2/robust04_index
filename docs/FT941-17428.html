			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / FT Guide to the Week: Measures that came into effect on January 1 1994 Trading partners: The North American Free Trade Agreement came into force, creating a single market comprising the US, Canada and Mexico. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, the Andean Group, started a customs union. The first of its kind for developing nations, it will be a market of some 100 million people. The European Economic Area, came into being, linking the 12 European Union members and five Nordic and Alpine states in a giant single market. Greek presidency: Greece took over the presidency of the EU from Belgium. One of the most pressing topics on the EU's agenda is enlargement, with a March 1 deadline for completing negotiations for the admission of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria. Emu part two: European Monetary Union started its second and penultimate stage. The European Monetary Institute - the embryo central bank - began its work, with the Belgian Alexandre Lamfalussy (left) as its first president. It is still seeking premises in Frankfurt. Central bankers' banker: The top job at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, vacated by Alexandre Lamfalussy's move to the EMI, has been taken by Andrew Crockett, previously a director at the Bank of England. He has said he will focus on the problems associated with financial derivative instruments. Footloose and duty-free: The value of duty-free gifts travellers within the European Union can bring home doubled to Ecu90 (Dollars 100). For those returning from outside the EU, the allowance has risen to Ecu175 from Ecu45. Alcoholic drinks, tobacco or perfumes are excluded, being subject to volume limits. Duty-free shopping on journeys within the EU is set to end on 30 June 1999. Road hauliers in the European Union will be freer, but slower. Restrictions on cabotage, the right of a haulier from one member state to pick up and deliver a load in another, have been eased. Rules have also come into force requiring new trucks of 12 tonnes gross weight and more to be fitted with speed limiters restricting them to 56mph (90kph). The UK already requires trucks of 7.5 tonnes or more to be limited to 60mph. Germans grit their teeth: Taxation on oil products rose by up to 20 per cent (for petrol) and 13 per cent (for diesel), which means an extra 16 pfennigs on a litre of petrol. Child allowances were cut to DM70 (Dollars 41) per child per month, and are to be means-tested. Unemployment benefit has also been cut, by some 3 percentage points. Pension contributions rose to more than 19 per cent of gross income, to prevent the state pension funds sliding into the red. Trains set: Germany's rail companies, the Bundesbahn in the west and the Reichsbahn in the east, united as Deutsche Bahn. The railways are no longer a statutory body, which paves the way for eventual privatisation, some 10 years down the tracks. The government has agreed to assume the railways' debts, to be paid for by increased oil taxes. Commercial agents: The English Commercial Agents Regulations 1993 came into force, along with equivalent enabling legislative orders for Scotland and Northern Ireland. These implemented the 1986 EC Directive 86/653, giving commercial agents who act for UK principals in countries of the EU (formerly EC) greatly increased rights. These include greater security of contract, compensation for loss of office, and disclosure of confidential information concerning their principals' business. Many British companies took the precaution of sacking their commercial agents in advance of the new regulations. The Irish Republic also brought the directive into force. The other EU states have already implemented it. Lloyd's goes corporate: For the first time in its 300-year history, the Lloyd's of London insurance market (left) is to accept corporate members. Previously, only wealthy individuals, the Names, who have put all their assets at stake in supporting the market have been members. Now, companies, institutions and private investors of more modest means will be able to benefit from limited liability. EIS supersedes BES: The Enterprise Investment Scheme came into being. It replaces the the Business Expansion Scheme, set up in 1983 to encourage investment in trading companies. The BES became an easy tax break for higher earners, raising more than Pounds 3bn. Its successor is designed to be less generous. 500-year malt: Scotland's distillers have decided to designate 1994 the 500th anniversary of malt whisky, on the basis of a document dated 1494, which mentions materials supplied to a certain Friar John Cor 'wherewith to make aquavitae'.</p>

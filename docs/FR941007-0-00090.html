			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment noted that it is unclear whether all incidents resulting in equipment failure or breakdown should be reported or only those failures that may cause a probable discharge. They continued that reporting all incidents of equipment failures may result in an undue burden on shipboard and shoreside response personnel. Further, this comment agrees that the status and the role of all equipment that relates to the incident should be reported in the case of a probable discharge. Reporting requirements placed in &sect;151.26(b)(3)(i)(A) require notification of equipment damage whenever there is a discharge or probable discharge of oil. It is recognized that it is impracticable to lay down a precise definition of a probable discharge which would warrant an obligation to report. Nevertheless, as a general guideline, reports should be made in cases of damage, failure, or breakdown which affect the safety of a ship. In addition, notification should be made in cases of failure or breakdown of machinery or equipment which result in impairment of the safety of navigation. The Coast Guard does not feel the notification requirements place an undue burden on ship operators. These requirements are currently in force under Article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL. Furthermore, the information could be helpful in preventing a possible spill. The Coast Guard agrees that information on the status and role of all equipment in the case of probable discharge would be useful. This information can be placed in the supplemental section of the notification form if desired. However, this information will not be required. Initial notification must not be delayed pending collection of this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Steps to control a discharge. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Seven comments addressed the steps to control a discharge section. Generally, all comments supported this section, but suggested additional requirements be added. One comment was very supportive of the required checklists. This comment also recommends that a new (C), (D), (E), and (F) be added. The comment suggested that these sections address contracting with an approved spill response contractor, procedures for handling oily waste and recovered oil, strategies for protecting the marine environment, and the type of communication system to be used. One comment recommended that this section include five more parts to be compatible with Washington State requirements. Four comments urged the Coast Guard to require prevention measures to be identified in the plan. One of the comments noted that prevention rather than control of an oil spill should be emphasized. Furthermore, one comment requested that leak detection equipment be required. Two comments noted that the scenarios should include procedures for responding to different sizes and types of spills. Another comment questioned whether current regulatory requirements exist to ensure the competency of masters and other key shipboard personnel such as training, prior experience, testing, and licensing. Additionally, one comment suggested that the Coast Guard require an initial or follow-up report identifying where damage stability and longitudinal strength information can be located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulation 26 was intended to require a simple plan. IMO guidelines were designed in part to help reduce error in an emergency situation. Additional requirements would be beyond the scope of this rulemaking. While most of the information suggested by the comments are covered by other plans, this information can be included in the non-mandatory section of the shipboard oil pollution emergency plan at the shipowner's discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National and local coordination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Five comments expressed concerns about national and local coordination. Two comments stated that the requirements in this section should be eliminated unless there was a specific purpose outside the scope of the international regulations. Additionally, one of these comments stated that the requirements are ambiguous. It should be understood that the IMO guidelines, upon which these rules are based, were intentionally designed to be flexible enough to meet the special needs of various ships operating throughout the world.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

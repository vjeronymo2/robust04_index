			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PHOTO TELLS ALL: ZSA ZSA IS 72  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa Gabor's age has been a topic of debate ever since she was arrested in  June for slapping a policeman in Beverly Hills. Her driver's license said she  was 61, but not everyone was buying that figure. During her trial last month,  the media listed her as 62 or 66. Now People magazine has found a former Gabor  schoolmate, Elizabeth Nussbaum of Seattle, who has some documentation from  their days at Madame Subilia's School for Young Ladies in Lausanne,  Switzerland. The birth date under Zsa Zsa's picture is Feb. 6, 1917, which  means she's 72.  </P></p>

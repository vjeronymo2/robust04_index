The EAGA is an original project initiated  by the Philippines and vigorously pursued by President Ramos  during his state visits to Indonesia and Malaysia, two members  of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which have  expressed keen interest, along with Brunei.    The president signed a memorandum circular which set in  motion the policy of increased cooperation among the  participating countries in trade, investments,  telecommunications, and tourism. Executive Secretary Teofisto  Guingona Jr. said that with this circular's issuance, senior  economic officials of the four countries can now proceed with  the signing of a memorandum of understanding to formalize EAGA  establishment and define their participation in the project.    In the memorandum circular, President Ramos ordered the  Departments of Foreign Affairs [DFA]; Trade and Industry;  Transportation and Communications [DOTC]; Tourism; Agriculture  and Environment and Natural Resources; National Economic and  Development Authority; Coordinating Council for Philippine  Assistance Program; and other concerned agencies to identify  strategies and initiate programs to promote EAGA.    The DFA was directed to set specific guidelines for the  exchange of delegations and visits between government agencies  and local government delegations with their counterparts in the  EAGA; coordinate with Congress for the formulation of guidelines  in the exchange of parliamentary delegations; coordinate  activities related to Philippine participation in the EAGA,  particularly those with diplomatic implications. On the other  hand, the DOTC was ordered to, among others, initiate a meeting  of civil aviation and airline officials of the four  participating countries to draw up the basic terms of reference  for the proposed Borneo, Mindanao, Sulawesi transnational air  service system; initiate a meeting of shipping and port  officials of the four countries to study the feasibility of  establishing regular passenger and cargo shipping services in  the EAGA.</p>

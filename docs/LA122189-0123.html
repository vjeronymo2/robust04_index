			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,' PRESIDENT DECLARED  </P> <P> George Bush, accompanied by only a tiny handful of senior advisers, broke away  from a small pre-Christmas brunch at the White House on Sunday to make the  loneliest decision of his presidency: to order a massive military assault on  the regime of Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> As Bush and his aides huddled, U.S. intelligence showed that the likelihood of  capturing Noriega himself was chancy at best and that the loss of American and  Panamanian lives was almost certain. But senior aides said the President did  not hesitate.  </P> <P> "Enough is enough," Bush declared.  </P> <P> The decision, which aides said was highly personal, reflected Bush's  determination not to allow the Noriega regime -- tainted by charges of drug  dealing and increasingly violent acts against Americans -- to remain in power,  regardless of the costs.  </P> <P> From the outset of the highly secret 30-minute meeting, Bush made it clear that  what he wanted was not a "surgical strike" against Noriega personally but a  full-scale attack on the entire Noriega regime and the Panama Defense Forces,  which had kept him in power despite two years of U.S. pressure and plotting.  </P> <P> "The President was saying, 'We don't want to do it piecemeal,' " one official  said. "He didn't have thefull battle plan, but he knew its code name, and he  was ready to go with it, accepting casualties" and nothing less than the full  plan.  </P> <P> Among the small group attending Sunday's meeting were Secretary of State James  A. Baker III, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, National Security Adviser Brent  Scowcroft, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Colin L. Powell and Vice  President Dan Quayle.  </P> <P> The meeting came just at the end of a holiday brunch that Bush and his wife,  Barbara, had hosted for a group of Administration officials and their wives,  including Quayle and Baker.  </P> <P> A Defense Department official said that Bush "had to make a fundamental  decision: Did we want to have enough people needed for such an operation in  place and risk Noriega finding out? Or did we want to risk an operation that  failed because of insufficient troops and equipment? That, too, might have  failed to get Noriega."  </P> <P> There was never any question about which option the President wanted, aides  said.  </P> <P> "We had made up our mind that if there was going to be a military solution, it  had to be one that would succeed -- and we developed one that would," said a  senior official.  </P> <P> One factor in Bush's decision to opt for maximum force instead of a surgical  strike, according to members of Congress who were briefed on the military  operation by Administration officials, was intelligence reports that Noriega  had a 250-member paramilitary unit poised to attack what Sen. John Warner  (R-Va.) described as "a designated segment of Americans in their housing  units."  </P> <P> Such intelligence reports were unconfirmed but had to be taken seriously, Baker  said.  </P> <P> Further, capturing Noriega would have been difficult under the best of  circumstances, a U.S. intelligence official said, because "he has been jumping  around like a Mexican jumping bean. We were aware of several places where he  was yesterday (Tuesday) and made considerable effort to find him. But there  never was any absolute certainty he would be in any particular place."  </P> <P> Bush was described by one top official as "deeply disturbed" by recent events  in Panama, including the killing of a U.S. Marine officer and the abuse of a  U.S. naval officer and his wife last weekend and Noriega's increasingly  bellicose statements, including his declaration of "a state of war" with the  United States last Friday.  </P> <P> "The scuttlebutt I hear is that the sexual abuse of the Navy officer's wife  sent Bush up the wall," former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams  said.  </P> <P> On Saturday night, Panama Defense Forces soldiers had fired on a car carrying  four U.S. military officers, killing one and wounding another. After the  shooting, PDF soldiers also repeatedly beat and kicked a Navy officer and  abused his wife. The Defense Department reported that she was sexually  threatened, slammed against a wall with such force that her head was cut and  was made to stand at the wall with her arms above her head until she collapsed  onto the floor.  </P> <P> Although concern was expressed within the Administration about the possible  loss of life and the potential for Americans to be taken hostage, once Bush  made his decision, officials moved quickly to execute a detailed contingency  plan that had been developed weeks earlier.  </P> <P> The official code name for the operation still has not been disclosed, but  Administration officials have informally dubbed it Operation Just Cause.  </P> <P> Although the basic plan already existed when Cheney took over as defense  secretary earlier this year, it was extensively refined after the failure of a  coup attempt by some PDF rebels last October.  </P> <P> Weeks ago, members of the Senate and House Armed Services committees were told  that a new invasion plan had been adopted and that the Administration was  simply waiting for an opportunity to put it into effect. In fact, some key  members of Congress were surprised last Friday when the Administration failed  to move after the Panamanian legislature declared the country to be in a state  of war with the United States.  </P> <P> Bush's decision, a tightly guarded secret in Washington, was kept from  Republican congressional leaders until about 10 p.m. Tuesday -- about three  hours before the assault.  </P> <P> Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that he had surmised a military  operation might be in the works two days ago, when Bush told him "things were  getting pretty bad down there and that something might have to be done."  </P> <P> Even some senior officials involved in the operation did not learn of the  decision until Monday morning, when they were told but instructed to keep the  matter in utmost secrecy. John H. Sununu, White House chief of staff, learned  of the decision at his regular meeting at 8:15 a.m. Monday with Bush, Quayle  and Scowcroft.  </P> <P> That meeting usually lasts only 30 minutes. On Monday, it lasted about 1 hour  and 15 minutes.  </P> <P> It was Monday morning that Bush and his aides fleshed out decisions on the  details of implementing the contingency plan -- when and where the invasion  would take place.  </P> <P> Outwardly, Bush and other officials who knew of the plan took pains to go about  most of their business as usual so that an atmosphere of crisis would not be  created.  </P> <P> The President called a meeting for 2 p.m. Tuesday, which he billed as a session  to discuss "the use of the military in the war on drugs," said one source, and  it was at that meeting that several senior officials learned for the first time  that the military assault would be launched.  </P> <P> Among those attending Tuesday's meeting were Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, Deputy  National Security Adviser Robert M. Gates and Richard Darman, director of the  Office of Management and Budget.  </P> <P> "Everybody realized it was extremely important that the decision be closely  held," said an official, who added that Quayle did not tell his own chief of  staff, Bill Crystal, until 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bush and his wife hosted a Christmas party at the White House for staff members  Tuesday night, and the President stayed until 9 p.m., about four hours before  the assault began.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Cheney attended a round of holiday parties and social events  Tuesday night and did not return to the Pentagon until about 10 p.m. Just  before midnight, Cheney joined Gen. Powell in the Pentagon's Current Situation  Room, a windowless chamber filled with electronics communications and  computer-generated maps that is used for monitoring military crises.  </P> <P> There, the two remained in contact with the operation through the night, using  an open line to Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the Southern Command's senior officer,  and his operational planning staff.  </P> <P> One senior officer said Powell helped shape some operational decisions by  asking pointed questions of military commanders on the scene but that he left  the Pentagon's original plan largely intact.  </P> <P> "He let Gen. Thurman run the operation," said the officer. "It was a very  controlled, deliberate, calm atmosphere."  </P> <P> About 10 p.m. Tuesday, Bush and Quayle began telephoning congressional leaders  and informing them of the impending attack.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told the President he would support the  operation, but he expressed some "concerns." Foley later emphasized that he was  "informed" and not "consulted" on the invasion plan.  </P> <P> House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) assured the President that  there would be no criticism from Congress. "There have been any number of your  critics out there advocating just this step," Michel told Bush. "So I don't  think you are going to have any criticism, at least not as far as Congress is  concerned."  </P> <P> About 11 p.m., Bush and Quayle began telephoning leaders of other countries.  The President reportedly called Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, among  others.  </P> <P> Quayle telephoned Latin American leaders he has met on recent overseas trips,  according to an official, who said that one Latin American head of state, whom  he declined to identify, told the vice president that Noriega "was asking for  it."  </P> <P> A Quayle aide said that while the vice president found most of the leaders he  telephoned "gratifyingly supportive," several Latin American leaders suggested  that both sides were to blame for problems in Panama.  </P> <P> Baker said that the Administration also had sent a detailed cable Monday to  North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, Japan and other allied countries,  outlining the "facts" of the U.S. case against Noriega.  </P> <P> The cable cited Noriega's declaration of a state of war with the United States,  the killing of the Marine and the abuse of the naval officer and his wife,  Baker said, and characterized those actions as "unacceptable."  </P> <P> Although the cable did not suggest that there would be a U.S. invasion, it did  outline the rationale that has been used by the Administration to justify the  military action.  </P> <P> Meetings of Administration officials, including a special "deputies' committee"  established to handle international crises, continued into Wednesday evening.  </P> <P> That committee, made up of officials directly below the principals, is headed  by Gates, the deputy national security adviser, and includes Undersecretary of  State Robert M. Kimmitt, Undersecretary of Defense Paul G. Wolfowitz and Asst.  Atty. Gen. William P. Barr.  </P> <P> After the 2 p.m. Tuesday meeting at the White House, where the rationale for  the Panama action was spelled out in detail, lawyers reviewed the statements  and prepared additional documents in support of the operation.  </P> <P> Because Noriega has used military force to remain in power and is not  considered popular among Panamanians, some senior officials suggested that by  neutralizing the Panama Defense Forces, the United States was putting pressure  on Noriega to flee the country.  </P> <P> "The question is whether he's going to dig down in a hole or try to get out of  there," one official involved in planning the operation said. "He's been  through a couple of coup attempts, and the Panama Defense Forces consider him a  liability. The danger to him can come from a number of places besides the  United States, so he has a lot of incentives to get away and stay away."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Sara Fritz, Robin Wright, Melissa Healy and Ronald J.  Ostrow contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PANAMA AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Area: 29,208 square miles with 2.2 million people.  </P> <P> Government: The military, always a powerful force, has dominated political life  since an October, 1968, coup. Gen. Omar Torrijos, a populist, ruled the country  almost single-handedly until his death in 1981. His intelligence chief, Gen.  Manuel A. Noriega, won a power struggle and became commander in 1983.  </P> <P> Economy: With a foreign debt of about $4 billion, Panama is one of the most  heavily indebted nations per capita in the world. The United States severed  economic and military aid to Panama in July, 1987.  </P></p>

Despite the fact that the  previous meeting of the delegations was held in September 1993,  Bulovas said that the Russian-Lithuanian negotiations were going  well. The sides agreed that the main volume of work was to be  done at a level of groups of experts. Bulovas said that the  list of issues that were to be discussed at the new round of  talks was not yet finalized. However, he believes that the  discussion is likely to focus on border crossing and travel from  one state to another. These problems were discussed at last  week's meeting of groups of experts.</p>

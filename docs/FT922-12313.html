			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Long petrol queues in Moscow A Muscovite fills his car as long queues formed at petrol stations in Moscow yesterday. Disgruntled drivers paid five times as much to fill their cars with petrol, Reuter reports. As part of President Boris Yeltsin's economic reform programme, the price rose from 5 pence a gallon to 27p. 'It's becoming impossible to drive in this country,' said Mr Konstantin Milyukov, an engineer, sitting in a grimy red Zhiguli sedan in a line of cars blocking a street near the city's Sokolniki Park. Russians, accustomed to hoarding scarce commodities from soap to sugar, have known for weeks that a petrol price rise was on the cards and many have stashed away enough fuel to keep them on the road for weeks. But some were caught unawares by the timing of the price rise.</p>

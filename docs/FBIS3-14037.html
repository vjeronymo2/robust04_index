The two  leaders held in-depth discussions on regional peace and  security, nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia, and other  issues. They also expressed serious concern over the violations  of human rights in Kashmir.    As far as the issue of regional peace and security is  concerned, there is no denying the fact that the Kashmir dispute  has led to Pakistan-India wars in the past, and the issue has  now taken such a serious turn that it may lead to another war  between the two countries. Therefore, for the establishment of  peace in this region, the resolution of the Kashmir problem by  granting their fundamental right to the Kashmiri people is  highly essential. India, however, has never adopted a reasonable  attitude toward any agreement, be it the accord for protecting  minorities or conceding the right of plebiscite to the  Kashmiris, or fulfilling the commitments made to the United  Nations Security Council. India has always presented the facts  in a distorted manner. There have been seven rounds of  secretary-level talks, but every round has ended in a failure.  Pakistan's sincerity is reflected by the fact that it has  approached every round of talks with the hope that India will  adopt a reasonable attitude, but New Delhi's objective,  obviously, has been to buy more time to continue its oppression  and atrocities against the Kashmiris. India has deployed more  troops in occupied Kashmir after the latest round of talks with  Pakistan.    On the nuclear nonproliferation issue, India has never given  any encouraging response. Under these circumstances, it is the  Indian Government's responsibility to change its attitude to  establish real peace about which it has been carrying out hollow  propaganda thus far.  *</p>

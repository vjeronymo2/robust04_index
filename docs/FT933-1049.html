			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Break-up of British Gas no longer vital, regulator says SIR James McKinnon, the director general of Ofgas who is shortly to retire, said yesterday the break-up of British Gas was no longer necessary, provided new competitors were allowed to supply gas to homes. He was speaking as the government announced that he would be succeeded in November by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, a 40-year-old businesswoman. Sir James's forceful demands for the break-up of British Gas are thought to have influenced the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's recent decision to recommend the split of the company into two by 1997, followed by the abolition of the mono-poly. But he said yesterday that it would be sufficient for British Gas's transport and trading divisions to be separated by internal walls, so long as competitors had fair access to the company's pipeline system. The main priority was to abolish its monopoly in the tariff market and design ways for new suppliers to compete within two or three years. Sir James said he had not changed his position. However, his comments are likely to find an echo in the Department of Trade and Industry which must decide whether to accept the MMC's recommendations. Department officials have said they are more intent on abolishing the monopoly than on breaking up British Gas. A decision is likely by December, by which time Ms Spottiswoode will have become the gas industry regulator. A former Treasury economist, she also has experience of running her own business. She is a director of several companies, and has been a tutor at the London Business School's Centre for Enterprise. Colleagues describe her as intelligent and charming but also tough. However, with the monopoly inquiry now complete, she will not have to adopt the stormy tactics used by Sir James to combat British Gas. Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas's chief executive, said: 'We welcome the appointment of Clare Spottiswoode and the opportunity to form a constructive working relationship.'

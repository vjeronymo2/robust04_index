			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Norwegian bank losses revised upwards THE NORWEGIAN Banks Association, a group representing the country's commercial banks, has increased its estimate of members' 1992 composite losses to NKr4bn to NKr5bn from NKr3bn (Dollars 442m). It warned that some banks may also need state cash in 1993. In the past five years, the state has injected an estimated NKr20bn to prop up the ailing commercial bank sector. The association estimated that the commercial banks' combined credit loss in 1992 was NKr8bn to NKr9bn, down from a record NKr15bn in 1991. The banks' non-performing loans in 1992 hit NKr20bn while property acquired by the banks last year due to defaults on loans had a total value of NKr7bn, resulting in an estimated loss of income of NKr3bn. It has also been estimated that the value of domestic commercial and residential property in the past five years has plunged by NKr500bn, resulting in the banks writing-off an estimated NKr60bn on their property portfolios. The association said that high interest rates on deposits had made it more attractive for the banks to raise capital domestically, rather than in international capital markets. London-based financial analyst Fox-Pitt, Kelton warned in a report that Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, was not likely to post earnings until 1995. 'Further large losses anticipated for 1993 could be sufficiently large to wipe out at least some of (DnB's) preference capital. In any case, no meaningful earnings are likely before 1995, by which time dilution from the conversion of government preference stock could be huge,' the analyst said. DnB's ordinary share capital was written down to zero by the government at the end of November, after losses had plunged the bank's capital adequacy below the minimum 8 per cent requirement. The state was therefore forced to provide DnB with NKr1.5bn in new preference capital and a guarantee of NKr600m, boosting its DnB shareholding to an estimated 70 per cent. Norway's 134 savings banks achieved their best performance last year, turning a combined net loss of NKr1.63bn in 1991 into a profit of NKr850m for 1992, according to preliminary figures revealed by the Savings Banks' Association. The sharp improvement in 1992 was helped by reduced credit losses, higher net interest income and lower operating costs. 'The savings banks are on their way out of the (banking) crisis. There is much work left to be done - like reducing further credit losses and improving earnings - before we can say the (savings) banks are completely out of the crisis,' said Mr Hans Halle, an association executive.</p>

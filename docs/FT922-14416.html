			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Letter: Interruption on the line - or a disregard for threat of deflation? Sir, I suspect there must have been an interruption on the line cutting out part of Lord Skidelsky's most enjoyable report of a telephone conversation between Keynes and the British prime minister ('Keynes here, how can I help you?', April 4). How else to explain the total lack of reference to debt deflation or credit problems from Keynes, who in his current position has no doubt been able to augment his own knowledge on this phenomenon with long discussions with Irving Fisher. Surely Keynes will have observed from his daily access to the FT that the collapse of property companies, and many other enterprises, has been turning bank profits negative and wiping out their capital, not just in the UK but in Japan, the US, Canada and elsewhere, including Scandinavia, where Norwegian government payments to support the bankrupt banking system have reached some 4 per cent of gross national product. Keynes will be bitterly aware that a bank without profits cannot raise new capital, that a bank without capital cannot make new loans (especially under the Bank for International Settlements rules), and that an economy cut off from bank finance will deflate in a downward spiral as the resulting contraction of economic activity undermines the soundness of existing loans and wipes out more bank capital. None of this is to deny that the opening up to capitalism of new world regions (not just the former Russian empire mentioned in the phone call, but more immediately south China and Latin America) offers the hope that the 1990s will have more in common with the 1890s than with the 1930s. But if the industrialised world disappears into a debt-inflationary spiral, economic and political reform in the 'new' regions would disappear too. We would be left with the slow-growing, nationalistic, isolationist, militarist regimes in Russia, Latin America and China. The solution is not incomes policy (which never worked) but for central banks worldwide to stop worrying excessively about inflation. They have boxed themselves in with this talk, since bond markets now believe it to such an extent that the immediate reaction to easing of policy in Germany, Japan and the US can be higher long-term yields and thus yet more deflation. Central banks must escape from this box by making clear that inflation is not the danger in an environment of effectively unlimited cheap labour supply from the new regions. The danger is deflation; the cure is lower short-term interest rates presented in a way that does not force up long-term rates. And not lower short-term rates in just some countries, with competitive devaluations inside or outside the ERM. We need lower short-term rates and more money supply globally.

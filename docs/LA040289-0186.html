			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN EDGES CS LOS ANGELES, 11-10;  </P> <P> WEISFUSS' BIG HIT SUCCEEDS WHERE ATTEMPTS AT LITTLE ONES FAIL  </P> <P> Ted Weisfuss was in trouble.  </P> <P> With runners on first and second and nobody out in the bottom of the ninth  inning Saturday, his Cal State Northridge team trailed Cal State Los Angeles by  a run. Weisfuss fouled off a sacrifice bunt attempt that sailed back to the  screen behind home plate at Matador Field.  </P> <P> On the next pitch, Weisfuss popped another bunt attempt directly behind home  plate where only a slow-footed umpire who couldn't get out of the catcher's way  saved an out.  </P> <P> Thus reprieved, Weisfuss ran the count to 3-2 before drilling an Abdom Pinon  fastball into the left-center-field gap for a double that drove in the winning  run in Northridge's dramatic 11-10 California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  victory.  </P> <P> Northridge improved to 15-9-1 overall, 6-6-1 in conference play. Cal State L.  A. dropped to 14-19, 4-7.  </P> <P> "Part of my game is bunting but I didn't do it," said Weisfuss, a senior  utility player who has delivered in the clutch several times this season. "I  just had a bad day at the plate. After I brutalized those first two pitches, I  was just trying to put the ball in play."  </P> <P> Northridge and Cal State L. A. had trouble playing little ball all day but more  than made up for that with the long ball.  </P> <P> Both teams hit four home runs and took advantage of the sunny, breezy  conditions with a performance that evoked memories of just how awesome a  slugfest can become in the launching pad that is Matador Field.  </P> <P> "I've heard about this," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said after his first  encounter with the phenomenon. "I don't like it very much. I'm glad I'm not a  pitcher here."  </P> <P> Northridge pitcher Robert Wheatcroft, however, was fairly happy after pitching  7 1/3 innings in relief of starter Vale Lopez to earn the win and improve to  7-2.  </P> <P> Wheatcroft, a senior, knows all too well about the havoc wreaked by the long  ball.  </P> <P> By surrendering three homers Saturday, including two in the eighth inning -- to  Ed Pimental and Rex De la Nuez -- that allowed Cal State L. A. to increase its  lead to 10-7, Wheatcroft has allowed 14 homers this season and 10 in just 32  1/3 innings of CCAA play.  </P> <P> "I'm a fly-ball pitcher," Wheatcroft joked. "This park can't hold me."  </P> <P> Neither could it contain Northridge designated-hitter Chae-Ho Chong, who hit  his fourth home run of the season, freshman Greg Shockey and senior Anton  Siegl, who hit back-to-back homers in the fourth inning, or sophomore Randy  Thompson.  </P> <P> Northridge trailed, 10-9, when Pinon surrendered a single to Siegl, then walked  pinch-hitter Kevin Ogle to open the bottom of the ninth.  </P> <P> That set the stage for Weisfuss, who drove in Siegl and pinch-runner Fili  Martinez with his line drive into the gap.  </P></p>

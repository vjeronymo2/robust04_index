			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 13 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, in a bid to deflect mounting criticism of UN  operations, said Friday [13 May] that UN member states were to  blame for any confusion in the world body's action in  international crises such as ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda.    "The UN is neutral and and carries out the decisions adopted  by the 15 states (on the Security Council), which include the  five superpowers," he said in an interview on French radio.    The UN chief was in the French capital to discuss the  Bosnian  crisis ahead of an international ministerial conference on the  matter Friday in Geneva.    Paris earlier this week threatened to pull its forces out of  Bosnia -- where they form the largest UN peacekeeping contingent  -- if progress towards a negotiated settlement cannot be  obtained.    The French warning came ahead of the meeting Friday in  Geneva  by foreign ministers from the United States, Russia and five  European Union states including France and Britain to try to  restart the Bosnian peace process.    Butrus-Ghali said the UN could only be "accused of  subjectivity in the sense that it executes" Security Council  decisions.    But he conceded that member states might get "tired" about  military and financial demands if UN peace operations carry on  endlessly.    When asked about the French threat of a force pull-out in  Bosnia, Butrus-Ghali said it was up to the Security Council --  of which France is a permanent member -- to find replacements.    He noted the example of Somalia, where after the departure  of  U.S., German, Belgian and French forces, the UN operation was  handled essentially by African and Asian troops.    "I have no way to prevent a member state from withdrawing  its  forces from a UN military operation," he said.    He also said he regretted huge outstanding financial  commitments to the UN by member states, such as the United  States which he said owes more than a billion dollars.    It was the United Nations' duty "to help member states  either  find peaceful solutions to conflicts, or to serve as an alibi  for states that need the United Nations to excuse their lack of  action."    He stressed the United Nations had been successful in recent  years in El Salvador, Cambodia and South Africa.    Even in Yugoslavia, he said, the United Nations could claim  some successes, such as aid supplied for some two million  refugees and displaced people, heading off the spread of trouble  to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] with a UN deployment and, up to now, having kept the war  inside ex-Yugoslav borders.</p>

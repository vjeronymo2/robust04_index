			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko by </F> Thomas Urban in Shumeyko's office in Moscow; date not given:  "The Communists Are Much More Dangerous Than Zhirinovskiy"]    [Text] [Urban] You were one of the top candidates of  Russia's Choice. Why did your bloc receive fewer votes than  Zhirinovskiy's ultra-rightists?    [Shumeyko] We were only barely defeated. This was mainly  attributable to preparation for the elections. Zhirinovskiy had  set the goal for himself to win in any case. Russia's Choice  failed to do so. Our election bloc did not make any promises,  but instead continued to implement the government program.    [Urban] Most people apparently did not agree to such an  approach.    [Shumeyko] It is a well-known fact that people currently  have to put up with a decreasing living standard. This is an  unavoidable part of this program. An estimated 30 to 40 million  people are affected by it. Under socialism, most people got  used to the fact that everything was settled for them for the  future. It was simply enough to turn up at one's job to get  paid.    [Urban] What, precisely, is different today?    [Shumeyko] The old ideology called Marxism-Leninism was  defective. But it offered the people an orientation in life.  Today we have an ideological pluralism that is also guaranteed  by the Constitution. This means an ideological vacuum.  However, the recent elections have shown that the notion of a  powerful, strong state is alive.    [Urban] It was, above all, Zhirinovskiy who profited from  this fact.    [Shumeyko] Whenever Zhirinovskiy appeared, he treated his  audience like 12-year-old children, whereas others expounded  their position at an academic level. Not everyone saw this.    [Urban] Is Zhirinovskiy dangerous?    [Shumeyko] His popularity is based solely on the way he  talks with his voters. I have known him from two angles. As a  member of the constitutional assembly called by the president he  was silent, not talkative. When he did speak, it was mostly  constructive. The communists are much more dangerous.    [Urban] Doesn't the failure of Russia's Choice mean a move  away from the market economy?    [Shumeyko] According to Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the new  Constitution, the government cannot stop the reform process.  The government will not change its course, which is aimed at  the market economy, but will continue it in accordance with the  Constitution and the Federation Treaty. It agreed on a program  for 1993 to 1995.    [Urban] What will the new government look like?    [Shumeyko] There will probably be structural changes. The  apparatus will be streamlined, and the number of ministries  reduced to 26 or 27; state committees that were independent in  the past will be integrated into the ministries.    [Urban] Will the president continue to pursue his course,  irrespective of the parliament and its majority of communists  and nationalists?    [Shumeyko] The parliament consists of two chambers. The  Federation Council consists of approximately 170 members.  Two-thirds of them are regional administrative chiefs; they are  the people who carry out the president's decrees and push  reforms. However, the Duma with its different majorities can,  under the Constitution, only make decisions in a very limited  number of cases--as opposed to the former Supreme Soviet, which  could deal with everything and decide on everything. This does  not mean, however, that government work has become easier, since  both chambers also have to get along with each other.    [Urban] You are one of the advocates of presidential  democracy as defined by the new constitution. Boris Yeltsin  will be head of state for another two years. What will come  after him?    [Shumeyko] There is currently much talk about a presidential  party. This is not Yeltsin's party, but an association of  people advocating a strong state. This is the first time in  Russia's 1,000-year history that there is a president, and  Yeltsin is the first to hold this office. So the definition of  the office depends on him. The fact that Zhirinovskiy is  mentioned as a possible president shows that the office does not  yet carry the weight and prestige due to it. Everyone must  acknowledge that only someone who has a constructive attitude in  every respect should be the head of state. Therefore, the  development of this office must not be interrupted. Boris  Yeltsin should be at the helm of the state for another term.    [Urban] But he has said that he does not want to and is not  going to continue in office.    [Shumeyko] True. But he is strong enough and in good  health. There is still a long time to go until 1996.    [Urban] How are you going to prevent a nationalist from  becoming president in two years?    [Shumeyko] A president's party must emerge. I see the  people advocating the notion of a strong and powerful state.  The Russian nation, in a historic-philosophical sense, has  always been expansive. Yet Russia has never conquered other  states, only absorbed them. The Bolsheviks took over this  empire. The people here and in the West always saw Russia in  the Soviet Union. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia  lost some of its territory for the first time in history.  Russians became a minority in other states. This is a  psychological shock for the whole nation. Zhirinovskiy's  campaign was focused on this fact, and a presidential party must  also focus on it.    [Urban] What would be the difference, then, to Zhirinovskiy?    [Shumeyko] The democratic grassroots. I hope there will be  a president's party in two years. Then the person will win who  has an idea -- the idea of a democratic Russia led by a  president, but a state in which the people are proud of being  its citizens.    [Urban] Who will be the first to succeed in conveying such  an idea?    [Shumeyko] Perhaps the communists will be strong in this  field, but the fascists will not. Everyone says that  Zhirinovskiy's election success spells the rise of neofascism.  But we must not ignore the fact that elderly people, above all,  were the ones who voted. There is not a single family in our  country that did not lose someone in the war. These people, of  course, did not vote for fascism, but protested against their  current living conditions. They voted for politicians who made  promises.    [Urban] So will Russia in the future bank on its own way and  put the West last?    [Shumeyko] We must differentiate between policy and the  economy. Russia will also seek mutually beneficial economic  cooperation, but it will never neglect its political interests.  There is currently much talk about the Kaliningrad (Koenigsberg)  area. The president has now created the option by decree that  the area become a free economic zone. A small army contingent  that will continue to be deployed there cannot interfere with  this plan. But it means that Kaliningrad is Russian, and Russia  will never leave the area. Russia is a sovereign state and can  deploy its armed forces wherever it likes.</p>

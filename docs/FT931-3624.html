			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Letter: Settlement crucial to protecting profit Sir, I fully concur with your leader ('Taurus done to death', March 12). However, I contend that it contains a flawed argument in respect of settlement. The success of the Stock Exchange's Seaq International dealing service has not been achieved despite the shortcomings of settlement in London, as in almost all cases settlement of these transactions takes place in the domestic location of the particular stock, ie Paris for French stocks, Frankfurt for German stocks. As a settlements manager with more than 20 years' experience in the City I also venture to suggest that if one was to ask the principals of any leading securities house or investment bank whether or not settlements were crucial, the answer in the 1990s would be a resounding yes. Increasing competition and ever-decreasing margins on front-end profitability mean that accurate, prompt and efficient settlement of transactions is the only way of protecting a firm's hard-earned profit.

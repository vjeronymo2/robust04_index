			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Heavy snow fell in Kansas and Colorado and record cold settled over portions of  the Great Lakes states. Temperatures also plunged in Texas, providing relief  from sizzling weather the day before. Snowfall ranged up to 11 inches at  Goodland, Kan., seven inches at Boulder, Colo., four inches at Garden City,  Kan., and three inches in Denver. A snow advisory was posted for western  Kansas, and an advisory for snow and blowing snow in the northern and central  mountains of Colorado. Strong northerly winds blew the cold air into southern  Texas, where temperatures were as much as 40 degrees colder than at the same  time Saturday, when highs were approaching 100 degrees. Flooding continued  along the Red River and some of its tributaries in North Dakota, but cold  weather is expected to slow the snowmelt and the river's rise.  </P></p>

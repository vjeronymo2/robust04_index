			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Marriott takes 3,000 UK rooms MARRIOTT, the large US hotels chain, yesterday announced an expansion of its presence in the UK market through a franchising agreement that will bring 18 Scott's Hotels outlets, with some 3,000 rooms, under the Marriott brand name, writes Martin Dickson in New York. Scott's, a Toronto-based company which has been operating hotels in Britain since 1970, will continue to own and run the hotels which will be converted to the Marriott name. Scott will benefit from access to Marriott's worldwide reservations system. Marriott, which already manages two hotels in the UK, will get reservations fees and the large presence it has long been seeking in the British market. It claimed yesterday that the deal would push it into the UK's top 10 hotel groups ranked by number of rooms. Only 23 of Marriott's near-700 hotels are outside the US, but it is now starting a major international expansion.</p>

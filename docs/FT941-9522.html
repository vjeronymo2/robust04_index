			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Denmark calls for return to narrow ERM Denmark yesterday urged its EU partners to consider a return to the narrow fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism. Mrs Marianne Jelved, Danish finance minister, told ministerial colleagues in Brussels the 30 per cent bands introduced after last August's exchange rate crisis were not in the European Union's interests. But her call for the European Monetary Institute to examine the possibility of tighter bands met a wall of silence. Ministers made clear they intend to stick to last year's decision to avoid a formal return to the pre-August bands of 5.5 per cent and 12 per cent respectively, fearful of provoking the markets to launch another assault on the ERM. The Danish krone, which came under fierce speculative attack last year, has since moved back into the 'hard core' ERM currencies led by the D-Mark. But the Copenhagen government argues that the uncertainty surrounding its position inside the ERM means Danish industry is paying an interest premium of more than 2 per cent. Market observers have suggested that the Danish government seek a bilateral agreement with Germany establishing a tighter link with the D-Mark. But Mrs Jelved ruled this out yesterday as the finance ministers' meeting produced no sign of immediate action on jobs, but included a debate on the unemployment crisis marked by pledges to introduce more labour market flexibility and to maintain budget discipline. The UK, Denmark and the Netherlands joined forces at the meeting, meanwhile, to call for a renewed onslaught on fraud in the EU budget. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, said it was vital for ministers to incorporate more effective safeguards when spending European taxpayers' money. Mrs Jelved said recurring incidents of fraud identified by the annual court of auditors report pointed to 'structural' flaws in the budget process. The attacks triggered a warning from Mr Henning Christophersen, Danish economics commissioner, that member states should not turn the European Commission into a scapegoat. Member states had chief responsibility for tracking down fraud. Most incidents of fraud take place within the common agricultural policy which accounts for around half of the annual Ecu 70bn (Pounds 53bn) budget. But there is no accurate estimate of the extent of fraud, because most remains undiscovered. Ministers also gave broad support for Portugal's revised 'convergence' programme, which sets targets for curbing inflation and budget deficits in preparation for joining a future single European currency. Lisbon's target of achieving a budget deficit below 3 per cent in 1997 would require 'a thorough and vigorous' effort to consolidate its fiscal position, ministers said. Duty free travel allowances will be doubled, and in some cases almost quadrupled, in the European Union from April 1. Ministers formally agreed yesterday to increase the allowances for people travelling within the EU to Ecu90 (Pounds 68) from Ecu45. The tax-free allowance for travellers arriving from outside will rise from Ecu45 to Ecu175. Germany will not apply the increase for travellers on land or sea until the end of 1997.</p>

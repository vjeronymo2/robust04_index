			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Builders make the most of the good times - Indonesia offers rich pickings for property companies IN West Jakarta, a newly-constructed, garish pink shopping and hotel complex rises from the ground like a giant wedding cake. Designed to be visible from the passing toll-road, it is the showcase project of Ciputra Development, a leading Indonesian property company. Indonesia, with a population of 190m, is the largest country among the fast-growing economies of south-east Asia. In common with its neighbours, two decades of economic success have resulted in a growing middle class and a demand for modern retail outlets, offices and housing - and Indonesia's property companies are making the most of the good times. Ciputra Development has announced plans to go public by the end of the year, raising Dollars 120m and valuing the company at about Dollars 500m. Brokers expect the issue to proceed smoothly; the Jakarta stock market has risen more than 60 per cent since December, and property companies have matched the index. The six leading quoted property companies have a combined capitalisation of over Rp3,600bn (Dollars 1.7bn), though much of that is rooted in faith. Companies are rated on future potential, not on the bricks and mortar in place. Modernland Realty, which went public in January and has a current market capitalisation of Rp654bn, has two residential sites totalling 820 hectares in the Jakarta area. At its more up-market Tangerang estate just outside Jakarta, on which development began four years ago, an 18-hole golf course is being constructed to attract potential residents. The first nine holes will not be ready until December but lots beside the course have been selling for Rp1.6bn each, excluding the cost of the house. With most of the land still in the form of paddy-fields, the estate is unlikely to be completed until 2004. Jakarta International Hotel and Development has a similar story in the office sector. Its sole current operation is the Borobodur Hotel in Jakarta and the company's Rp1,600bn market capitalisation is due largely to its undeveloped 41 hectare site in the city's business district. By 1995, this site will be home to the stock exchange and plots have been sold to a state-pension fund and an army-controlled bank. But plans for the 36 remaining hectares are incomplete and development is forecast to take 15 years. Ciputra Development is little different. Its 455 hectare Citra Garden housing project is less than half complete, while its 500 hectare estate in Tangerang and 1,000 hectare housing project in Surabaya, East Java, are still in initial stages. While the number of rival housing projects grows almost monthly, Mr Hugh Obbard, managing director of property consultants First Pacific Davies Indonesia, believes 'the demand for low to middle-cost housing is outstripping supply. The main surprise in the market has been the upper-income housing bracket continuing to perform so well'. The steady lowering of interest rates this year bodes well, he says. Ciputra Development claims two competitive advantages: the geographical spread of its 8.8m sq metre landbank around Java island, home to 60 per cent of Indonesia's population, and the reputation of Mr Ciputra, the company's founder and chairman. While most companies' landbanks are concentrated in Jakarta, Ciputra Development has highlighted other densely-populated urban centres: Surabaya, with a 2.6m population, and Semarang, Central Java's capital with a 1.3m population, where the company is building a 20,500 sq metre shopping and hotel complex. Mr Ciputra has more than 30 years' experience in property and Ciputra Development enjoys a 14 per cent share of Jakarta's housing market. Two other private companies in which Mr Ciputra is a large shareholder - Jaya Group and Metropolitan Group - hold a further 41 per cent share. Mr Harun Hajadi, director of Ciputra Development, says the three companies reduce costs through joint marketing activities, but adds that Mr Ciputra avoids favouring one company to the detriment of the others. Brokers say Mr Ciputra is politically well-connected and packs a punch in Indonesia's golfing world - important for networking government officials. The company forecasts a gross profit of Rp88bn on revenue of Rp242bn this year, rising to a profit of Rp161bn on revenue of Rp503bn in 1994. Brokers expect it to be a blue-chip property stock, but reserve their final endorsement until the issue is priced. The company is unlikely to be offered at a steep discount. Brokers say the anticipated price of Rp5,000 a share would value the company at about 18 times projected 1994 earnings.</p>

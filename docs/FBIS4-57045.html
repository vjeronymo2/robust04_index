			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro is having dinner with  the current Bahia governor and with former Governor Antonio  Carlos Magalhaes. Fidel Castro was returning to Cuba after  attending Nelson Mandela's installation in South Africa, and  decided to make a stopover in Salvador.    Since very early, a strict security regime had been  organized  at the Salvador Air Force base to welcome Cuban President Fidel  Castro. Members of the Air Force and of the Federal Police  cordoned off the landing strip and allowed only members of the  welcoming delegation to enter. President Fidel Castro arrived  at the Air Force base in the middle of the night on board a  Cuban Airline plane that was returning from South Africa, where  he attended Nelson Mandela's installation.    Fidel Castro was welcomed by Bahia Governor Antonio  Imbassahy  and Salvador Mayor Lidice da Matta.    It still has not been reported how long President Castro  will  stay in Salvador, or his agenda for the visit.</p>

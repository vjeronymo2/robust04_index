The decision is a setback to China's attempt to revamp  its currency exchange system. The move came after Beijing  decided the plan to abolish the swap markets at one stroke by  April 1 was unrealistic, said sources. Under the proposal, what  the central bank had dubbed a "national interbank system" was to  have replaced the old-style swap centre system and begun  operating on April 1. However, sources said that the lack of  regulations governing the new system, banking staff's  inexperience in handling foreign exchange transactions and other  technical problems were the major deterrents.    "Banking officials gathered in Beijing in the middle of the  month to be briefed by the central bank on the operation of the  new system. But the officials used the meetings to voice  grievances at the haste in which the system would be  introduced," said one source close to the central bank. "Nobody  seems to quite know how the system will operate, not even  Beijing officials who made the proposal," the source said.    The delay will affect Beijing's attempts to centralise  foreign exchange supply and strengthen its control over foreign  exchange flow.    The abolition of the swap centres, announced by Beijing on  December 29 last year, as part of the official and swap centre  rates unification plan, is the most important reform of China's  foreign exchange system since the establishment of the swap  centres in 1985. The measure to establish the banks as the basis  for the country's foreign exchange system indicates China's  intention to model its system on those of other market  economies, in which banks deal through interbank markets and  intermediating brokers.    Some critics of the plan branded April 1 "the fools' day",  considering that China's interbank system, which barely  resembles those of other market economies, is insufficient to  accommodate the changes. In theory, under the new system,  companies will ask the authorised banks to buy or sell yuan.  The banks in turn will instruct their dealers to execute orders  in the markets. But in practice, the plan is simply to change  their names from foreign exchange adjustment centres to foreign  exchange markets and linking up through a computer network to  form a unified system. Seats in the foreign exchange markets  would only be available to banks, both foreign and Chinese.    It is understood that the central bank's vice-governor Chen  Yuan, will brief foreign banks' personnel in Beijing on the new  foreign bank regulations as well as interbank operations in  handling foreign exchange transactions.    One report by Business China noted that China's 110 swap  centres scattered over the country would not be closing, even if  the swap markets were to be abolished as scheduled on April 1.  In the trial period, only the biggest 18 swap centres would be  linked and the rest would continue to function as old-fashioned  swap centres. As a result, only those within the unified system  will quote one exchange rate while those outside will quote  different ones.    Warburg Securities analyst Allan Ng said that such a  practice  in the transitional period was not very different from the old  system and it might still lead to a black market due to the lack  of a real unified rate throughout the country.    Tsang Shu-ki, senior lecturer at Hong Kong Baptist College,  said mainland banks were understood to be barely prepared for  the new foreign exchange system, despite training courses for  staff over the last two months.</p>

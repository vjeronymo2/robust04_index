			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Resignation blow to engineers' plans for CBI link-up PLANS by the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation to join forces were thrown into doubt yesterday after the surprise announcement that Mr Neil Johnson is to quit as EEF director-general. In a short statement, the federation said Mr Johnson would be leaving towards the end of the year for 'personal reasons'. However, the unexpected departure of Mr Johnson, a driving force behind plans to create the UK's biggest manufacturing lobby group, immediately raised questions about the future of the initiative. Neither organisation appeared to be prepared for Mr Johnson's abrupt decision, although they both expressed the hope that their plans, which were well advanced, could still progress. The two bodies announced in April that they were trying to work together more closely to create stronger and more effective links between industry and government. Yesterday the federation revealed it had been talking in detail to the CBI about merging some of the central activities of both organisations. The EEF said they both remained 'committed to the principle of collaborating to strengthen the representation of manufacturing'. The CBI's ruling council was next week due to approve plans for the link-up between the two bodies, which next year would have combined the majority of core EEF activities with the CBI's national manufacturing council. The issue has now been taken off the agenda. The two bodies had held exploratory discussions in 1991 but these fell through. Relations cooled when the CBI set up the national manufacturing council in early 1992, though the two bodies have since been co-operating. The federation said yesterday that the talks would continue but, because of the complexity of the many issues and interest involved, they may take longer than first expected. The proposal is now being examined by the federation's 14 regional associations, which will have to approve the takeover. But the federation denied that the proposal was being opposed by the associations. The federation said Mr Johnson would 'actively continue' his position as director-general and chief EEF spokesman until he leaves. But his departure is a big blow to the EEF. Mr Johnson, 44, joined the organisation in July last year from Rover Group and has spearheaded its year-long campaign for a national industrial strategy. This week, he strongly criticised the Treasury for being isolated from the real world of manufacturing industry.</p>

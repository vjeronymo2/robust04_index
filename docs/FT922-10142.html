			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Picking a policy WHEN ALL companies offered the same insurance policy at roughly the same price, buying household insurance used to be a lot easier. But the market has become more competitive over the last few years and buyers are now faced with an array of policies offering different levels of cover at different prices. If you live in a certain part of Manchester, for example, brokers will usually give different quotes for your area - and the cover on offer will vary. That makes it difficult to compare policies. 'There can be a 300 per cent variation in price for any given postcode,' says Peter Friend, of Leslie and Godwin, insurance brokers. 'So the need to have more than one quotation is very strong indeed.' Many people may also be dissatisfied with the rise in insurance premiums and may be thinking of trying to obtain a more competitive deal from someone other than their usual insurer. AA Insurance has launched a product service which could help you through the maze. Its computerised insurance service for building and contents, AA Homequote, searches out the best price for the same product from among a panel of insurance companies. There are presently five insurers on the panel - GRE, Commercial Union, Bishopsgate, Minster and Municipal Mutual. General Accident and London &amp; Edinburgh plan to join from June 1 and AA Insurance is hoping to include others. Many building societies have a panel, usually of three to six insurance companies, to underwrite a policy whose price is already determined. This is not the way the AA Homequote policy works. 'The insurers are competing with each other to give the best price depending on individual circumstances,' says AA Insurance. 'Some companies will have had fewer claims in certain postcodes for certain types of properties, while others will have fared better in other areas. Those with the best claims records in those areas will be able to offer the best prices.' If you own, say, a two bedroomed terraced house in Edinburgh, AA Homequote will search out prices ranging from Pounds 72 to Pounds 81 for buildings cover for properties with a market value of up to Pounds 250,000, and Pounds 81 to Pounds 116 for house contents up to Pounds 30,000 under the standard (new for old) cover. It is already common to have panels to provide motor insurance and Friend believes that, 'inevitably, household insurance will have to take the form of panel. But I would say that five or seven companies is not enough - you need about 20 to give a good spread.' Noel Privett of AA Insurance says there should be more insurance companies on the panel by the end of the year. 'It will increase as appropriate. We don't want to go for numbers, we want quality.' The AA Homequote panel gives quotations for AA Insurance's Homesure policy. The problem of comparing like with like is eliminated but customers should first note whether the policy is suitable for their needs. In its last review of house contents insurance, Which?, the Consumers Association's monthly, rated the AA Homesure policy somewhere between average and good. Quotations and cover are given over the phone. If the customer goes to one of AA Insurance's 250 shops, they will be issued with an immediate cover note. AA Homequote. Telephone: 0800-900888, extension 8484. Cornhill Insurance and Blaupunkt, the car radio manufacturer, are so confident of their Keycard radio security system that they are offering to replace - free - stolen Blaupunkt radio models which use this system. The insurance scheme is called 'Double Indemnity.'</p>

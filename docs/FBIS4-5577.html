			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- More than half of South  Korean adults do not think that North Korea will actually  provoke a war against the South, a poll said Monday.    The poll by the state-run Advisory Council on Democratic and  Peaceful Unification showed 54.1 percent of the respondents were  not worried that North Korea would start a war, with 13.8  percent saying it was impossible and 40.3 percent highly  unlikely.    But 45.5 percent of the pollees had a negative opinion: Very  probable (6.8 percent) or relatively probable (38.7 percent).    The advisory council commissioned the Hyundae Research  Institute to survey 1,000 adult men and women across the nation,  selected using the probability proportionate to size sampling  (PTS) method, from March 28 to April 2.    Some 80.3 percent foresaw the need for military preparations  -- very appropriate measures (46.5 percent) or inevitable (33.8  percent) -- as far as deploying Patriot missiles here and  resuming Team Spirit, the joint South Korean-U.S. military  exercise, following the rupture of inter-Korean working-level  talks.    Meanwhile, 58.7 percent of the respondents supported  patience  such as inter-Korean dialogue to resolve the nuclear problem,  while 16 percent said hard-line countermeasures including  military methods should be used.    And 38.8 percent thought the United Nations should urge  North  Korea to allow inspections of its nuclear sites through a  Security Council presidential statement, while 28.8 percent  favored U.N. sanctions.    On the effect of possible U.N. sanctions against North  Korea,  39.6 percent said that "as a result, tension will be heightened  on the Korean peninsula," while 25.3 percent said "North Korea  will eventually accept further inspections."    Meanwhile, 75.6 percent felt that North Korea has already  developed nuclear weapons or will produce them in two or three  years, but only 18.3 percent said Pyongyang seems to have  stopped developing nuclear arms.</p>

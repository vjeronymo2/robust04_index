			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Triplex looks to power for growth TRIPLEX LLOYD, the industrial engineering group, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.08m for the year to last March, a fractional improvement on last time's Pounds 7.07m. Earnings per share were 9.8p, down from 10.9p as the diluting effects of February's 1-for-4 rights issue came into play. As promised then, the final dividend is 4.5p, maintaining the total at 7p. While engineering turnover declined from Pounds 55.4m to Pounds 47.6m and operating profits fell sharply from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 763,000, the power division's turnover rose from Pounds 57.3m to Pounds 69.1m and produced operating profits ahead from Pounds 4.41m to Pounds 5.56m. As operating profits of the automotive division were scarcely changed at Pounds 3.73m, on turnover of Pounds 46.8m (Pounds 42.8m) it meant that the power division, where investment has been concentrated, was the single most important factor in holding up profits. 'We see immediate growth opportunities for our power division both organically and by acquisition,' said Mr Colin Cooke, chairman. COMMENT Triplex Lloyd's immediate future is mixed: bright for the power division, not too bad for automotive, although that depends on winning market share, and dull for general engineering and building products. In fact, with so much investment going into power and a large proportion of profits coming from it, the building products business looks more and more uncomfortable in the group. The shares are not a buy for immediate gain, because profits growth from current heavy investment will not show through strongly until 1995-96. Given the mixed prospects, pre-tax profits for this year may not top Pounds 8.5m and earnings could slip back to about 9p. That would put the shares on a prospective p/e of more than 19, high enough for any but the most patient.</p>

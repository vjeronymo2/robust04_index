			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- The family of Army  Commander Lieutenant General Martin Balza has received death  threats in an anonymous message that demands that the death of  conscript Omar Carrasco not be investigated, as "the Neuquen  case is closed."    Pablo Balza, 23, son of the general, today found on the  windshield of his car a typewritten note in which his father is  threatened with death and which contained details about the  family life of the general's children. [passage omitted]    Military sources state that this is not the first time that  Gen. Balza and his family have received death threats.</p>

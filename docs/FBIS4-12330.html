			<p>BFN     [Text] Dubai, April 7 (AFP) -- It is too early to consider  an end to the Arab trade boycott of Israel because the Middle  East peace process has yet to achieve success, a senior Arab  League official said here Thursday [7 April].    The league's assistant secretary general for political  affairs, 'Adnan 'Imran, told AFP: "It is premature to talk of  lifting the boycott because the reasons which motivated this  legitimate measure have still not disappeared."    And he said those trying to pressurise Arab countries would  do better to "concentrate their efforts on ensuring the success  of the peace process."    The Arab League agreed in Cairo last month to postpone a  debate on whether to ease the trade boycott of Israel, amid  anger over the Hebron mosque massacre in which a Jewish settler  killed 30 Arab worshippers in February.    The decision ignored a US campaign aimed at lifting the  indirect boycott on foreign firms doing business with Israel  following the signing of the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord in  Washington in September.    Oman and Qatar had also pushed for easing the boycott, Arab  diplomats said.    Ministers from the 22 member countries agreed to consider  the  boycott imposed over four decades ago at a session later in the  year.    "We are waiting for the day when the Israeli occupation ends  and that will lead to a lifting of the boycott," according to  'Imran, a Syrian.    Damascus, one of the four Arab parties in the peace  negotiations with Israel, has steadfastly opposed lifting the  boycott until Israel withdraws from all Arab lands captured in  the 1967 war.    'Imran said all Arab countries agreed on the need to bring  peace to the Middle East.    'Imran, who was attending a meeting of the Arab Towns  Organization here, also condemned the recent defence agreement  signed between Israel and France which ended a 30-year freeze on  military cooperation.    "We hope France will revise its policy especially as Arab  states hope to reinforce their friendly relations with this  country."    And he warned Paris should not count on Arab support "if it  aligns itself with Israel, supplying it with the means to bring  war and destruction."    He added that the Arab League was stepping up efforts to  restore Arab solidarity badly shaken by the 1990-1991 Gulf  crisis, when Jordan, Yemen and the PLO were accused of backing  Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait.    Arab-Israeli peace talks suspended since the Hebron massacre  are due to resume at the end of April.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Plan for 999 calls set to be rejected A PLAN to place the 999 emergency service in the hands of a new agency operated by three telephone centres is set to be rejected by Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog. A report by consultants Touche Ross concluded that only 'limited' benefits were to be gained from replacing the existing system by which 999 calls are dealt with at more than 80 centres nationally. The change to a centralised system was recommended by an earlier Oftel review of the 999 service, set up in 1989 to examine its future in the light of there being more than one telecoms operator. All telecoms companies are obliged to provide free emergency calls.</p>

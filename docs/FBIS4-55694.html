			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Gian Franco </F> Svidercoschi; place and date not given: "The Fall of Communism  in the East: A Wasted Opportunity for Europe"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Svidercoschi] Mr. President,  is the "logic of Yalta" really a thing of the past? Even the  pope emphasized during his visit to the Baltic states that "the  great peoples and the small peoples must enjoy the same respect  for their rights."    [Walesa] Once the opposition between the two blocs, with  their symbol, the Berlin Wall, had disappeared, the vision of a  single Europe of free, democratic nations seemed just around the  corner, a foregone conclusion. Sadly, reality has turned out to  be just the opposite. Like the other Central and East European  countries that have regained their freedom and sovereignty,  Poland is experiencing difficulty in asserting its status as a  partner on an equal footing. Our path toward European economic  and security structures looks long and tortuous. European  solidarity is lacking. We are running up against policies  steeped in protectionism, particularly economic protectionism.  It is difficult to get the West to realize that leaving our  countries to their own devices may mean placing the whole of  Europe in jeopardy. It may mean a relapse in the reforms. Nature  abhors a vacuum, hence our campaign to widen the European  security area, which in turn will only become possible with a  gradual entry of the Central and East European countries into  the European structures.    [Svidercoschi] Is there danger of a new bipolarity?    [Walesa] I have been saying for months that attempts to  reestablish the old, bipolar order can now be seen. Indeed,  what other conclusion can we draw, when others want to decide on  our behalf, when Russia can lay down conditions to NATO? A  situation in which the great impose their will on the small is  unacceptable. The rights of all must be respected in the same  way if we really want to talk about freedom and sovereignty.  The highway code is the same for everyone, for large cars and  small ones, but different standards are being applied here  according to individual interests. How can we talk about  equality in the face of so many examples of disparate treatment?  Poland is experiencing this, too, and my admonition to the West  is that it should beware of these shortsighted, selfish  policies. I see that, despite a lot of fine words and  declarations, there are still divisions in Europe, as if Europe  lacked a vision, a concept of how to handle the great victory  that the collapse of communism represented.    [Svidercoschi] Do you fear Russian expansionism?    [Walesa] The free, democratic Poland clearly defined its  foreign policy priorities from the outset, adopting as its  primary goal membership in the European economic and security  structures. Russia is an extremely important neighbor of ours,  and we attach great significance to bilateral relations,  provided they are rooted in the principle of equality and mutual  benefit. Economic cooperation with this enormous market is a  must for us. I do not fear what you call Russian expansionism,  despite the fact that Russia dictated conditions to us for many  years. What is more, had this expansionism continued, it would  not have stopped at a country like ours; it would have gone  further. However, I believe that the policies of a democratic  Russia will not be dominated by the imperialist designs of the  past. It will find its rightful place among the other  democratic countries, respecting the rules of the international  community. We intend to develop every form of cooperation with  a Russia of this type. This is essential for the common Europe.    [Svidercoschi] But it would appear that Western Europe has  not yet realized the urgency of seizing the present historical  and political moment.    [Walesa] As I have already said, my warning to Europe is not  to let this moment slip through its fingers. History will judge  us on this basis. We have never yet had such a chance to build  a single free, democratic Europe, the Europe of the "little  homelands," the Europe that, in its unity, will nevertheless  allow each state and nation to preserve its own identity, the  Europe where no one lays down the law for others, where the  rules of the game are clear, accepted by all of the players and  obeyed to the last.    [Svidercoschi] You once said that the former communists won  in Poland not on the strength of the old ideology but because  they were more active and better skilled in the wielding of  power. Do you still think so?    [Walesa] I confirm what I said when I predicted this trend.  I would add that the victory of the postcommunists is also due  to the fact that our societies have had to bear the weight of  reforms, which many people find hard to stand. The free market  and capitalism have brought a lot of serious problems:  unemployment, uncertainty about the future, and fewer social  safety nets. Not everyone can become a capitalist overnight.  Pockets of poverty have sprung up alongside the rapid rises to  fortune. Many people see the closure of their unproductive  factories, when economic figures supplanted ideology as the  criterion, as unfair. Once upon a time, we all had equal shares  of the poverty, but things have changed now. The rules of the  market economy are paramount.    [Svidercoschi] Have mistakes been made?    [Walesa] In our inexperience, we, too, made mistakes when  we came to power. In any case, the transformations in the  system were quite unprecedented. Perhaps we wanted to make up  for the lost years too fast, sometimes losing sight of the  individual, his anxieties, his fear of the unknown. Anyway, you  cannot change people's mindset overnight, and it is in this  mindset that communism has its stronghold. It takes years for  people to realize the extent to which the future depends on  their own capacity for action, for running things, so the  reaction of people who are disappointed and look back with  longing at their former security, regardless of the poverty,  comes as no surprise. But they will have to get it into their  heads that you never jump into the same river twice, and there  is no going back. This is already evident in Poland, as the  recent wave of strikes has shown. Our chances lie in reforms. I  know they are difficult, but we have to pay this price. We have  to do everything to ensure that the price remains as low as  possible, particularly for the weaker layers of society.    [Svidercoschi] Can Solidarity have exhausted its entire  potential in terms of ideals?    [Walesa] Solidarity, which came into being in 1980, has  ensured a place for itself in history. It was a social movement  that enjoyed an incredible strength and role in Poland and  Europe. But the time for fighting is different from peacetime.  It poses different challenges. Solidarity continues to seek  its identity, whether to take on the role of a political force  or to remain a union defending the interests of the grass roots,  which are now made up mainly of workers in the major factories.  Solidarity has encountered great difficulty in resolving this  dilemma over recent years. As a movement that contributed to  the collapse of the communist system and launched the process of  economic, political, and social reforms, it has often found  itself at a crossroads: Should it act as a protective umbrella  for the various governments that have emanated from it or as an  opposition in the event of government policy diverging from the  interests of the union grass roots?    [Svidercoschi] And what has it decided?    [Walesa] The turning point came with the Solidarity campaign  that culminated in the fall of the government led by Hanna  Suchocka and cleared the way for the postcommunists. Solidarity  is now increasingly opting for a union role, but I believe that  the country's sense of responsibility and the overriding  national interest will prevail over the particularisms of the  union and its leaders. I believe that Solidarity will not  discount what it has fought for, and it will remain moderate and  circumspect in its demands.    [Svidercoschi] Mr. President, you will be attending the  commemorations at Monte Cassino [Italian World War II  battlefield]. What significance does that 50-year-old page in  history have today?    [Walesa] For many Polish soldier-exiles, the journey to  their  homeland, from which they had been forcibly uprooted, ended at  Monte Cassino. Before reaching it, they had crossed half the  world, surviving the concentration camps and prisons of the  "inhuman land." However, their dream of a return to Poland faded  in Italy. All they had left was a last wish engraved in stone:  "Passerby, tell Poland we fell in its loyal service." Poland  has not forgotten, even though there have been those who have  tried to wipe out the memory.    [Svidercoschi] There were the communists in Poland...    [Walesa] Many of those who decided to return were  persecuted,  humiliated by the new power imposed on the Poles. General  Anders, who had led them back to Poland, was stripped of his  citizenship. But people's memories and hearts do not change by  decree. The spirit of a nation cannot be imprisoned, nor can  its freedom be taken away.    [Svidercoschi] They had fought for the freedom of Poland and  Europe.    [Walesa] Although the battle of Monte Cassino did not change  the course of our history, the sacrifice was not made in vain.  It was part of Poland's contribution to the victory of  democracy and freedom over Nazi barbarism. It was a  contribution to the rebuilding of a free, democratic Europe.  Sadly, there was no place for us in this Europe. But, had it  not been for that battle, we would have found it much more  difficult many years later to transform the dream of a free  Poland into reality. We always remember it, and it is our wish  that Europe remember it, too. Our wish is that no one should  ask whether we are entitled to a place in the community of free,  democratic European countries.</p>

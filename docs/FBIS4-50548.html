			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China is expected to  import more than one trillion U.S. dollars worth of goods in the  upcoming years before the end of the century, Chinese Vice  Premier Li Lanqing predicted here today.    He made the projection while addressing the international  conference of "Waves of the Future - ASEAN, Vietnam, and China:  Opportunities for World Business".    More than 800 delegates, mostly high ranking government  leaders, successful businessmen, and policy researchers, from 21  countries and regions around the world are attending the  three-day conference, which started on Tuesday.    "We expect that China's total imports through the years to  the end of the century will top one trillion U.S. dollars," Li  said in his keynote speech.    "Our determination of and confidence in expanding vigorously  trade and economic contacts with the rest of the world are  growing steadily during the course of modernization drive," the  Chinese vice premier added.    In the process of reform and opening-up, he said, China's  external trade and economic cooperation have indicated a good  trend of development since 1978.    The annual growth rate of China's foreign trade over the 15  years averaged 16 percent, higher both than the average growth  rate of China's GDP and that of the world trade in the same  period.    China's foreign trade volume in 1993 stood at 195.8 billion  dollars with exports totaling 91.8 billion dollars and imports,  104 billion dollars, he said, noting that China's position in  world trade moved from the 32nd place in 1978 to the 11th place  in 1993.    Meanwhile, the share of China's exports in the total exports  of the world was 0.75 percent in 1978 and it accounted for 2.5  percent in 1993, he said.</p>

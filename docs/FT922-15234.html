			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Skandia hit by decline in non-life business SKANDIA, the Swedish insurance group, plunged to an operating loss of SKr580m (Dollars 97m) for 1991, compared with an operating profit of SKr554m in the previous year. The group, which has now reported a sharp deterioration in results for two consecutive years, was hit by losses in its international non-life operations and the fall in the real estate market. However, the board proposed holding the dividend at SKr4 per share. Total premium income climbed 17 per cent to SKr29.03bn from SKr 24.85bn. Skandia said developments were favourable in the Nordic region, where operating profit increased from SKr63m to SKr354m last year. Premium income in the Nordic area rose 9 per cent to SKr9.73bn. However, the group suffered a serious decline in its international non-life insurance operations, including reinsurance as well as direct business. The group said a 'considerable share' of the losses stemmed from credit insurance - direct insurance and reinsurance - which is written by its subsidiaries in Norway and the UK. It said it had decided to discontinue its credit insurance activities. The loss on international reinsurance business ballooned from SKr163m to SKr537m last year, on premium income of SKr10.02bn. In addition, losses at its international direct non-life insurance business grew from SKr142m in 1990 to SKr558m last year, on premium income of SKr4.4bn. Skandia said premium income for its international life assurance and financial services division nearly doubled to SKr5.48bn, although this business area showed a loss of SKr104m due to charges arising from new ventures in Germany and Japan. It said talks with Uni Storebrand, the Norwegian insurer, and Hafnia, the Danish insurance company, about a possible link-up were continuing.</p>

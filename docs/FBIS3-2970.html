Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 11 (CNA) -- Vice Economic Affairs  Minister Li Shu-chiu is scheduled to lead a 20-member delegation  to Indonesia in early April to help promote the government's  "southern strategy," the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced  Friday [11 March].    The delegation will be composed of officials from state-run  enterprises such as Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), Taiwan Power  Company [Taipower], Taiwan Sugar Corp. [Taisugar], Taiwan  Fertilizer Co. Ltd., China Steel Corp., BES Engineering Corp.,  and Taiwan Salt Works.    Ministry officials said the CPC will be looking at oil  exploration and oil refinery deals, and Taipower is interested  in investing in both hydro and thermal power generation projects.    In addition, CPC officials will meet with their Indonesian  counterparts on the purchase of low-sulphur crude oil and  liquefied natural gas, while Taipower will offer to help train  Indonesian electricity engineers and managers.    Taisugar, Taiwan Salt, Taiwan Fertilizer, and China Steel  are  looking forward to providing Indonesia with expertise in  sugar-cane planting, salt panning, fertilizer manufacturing, and  steel making, respectively, the officials pointed out.    Moreover, they noted, BES is considering assisting Indonesia  in the planning and construction of industrial parks and  residential districts.    The government's southern strategy has been fueled by  Premier  Lien Chan's vacation trip to Malaysia and Singapore at the  beginning of the year and President Li Teng-hui's unofficial  visit to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand in February.    The strategy encourages Taiwan manufacturers to increase  investment in Vietnam and member countries of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations, which groups the Philippines,  Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Brunei.</p>

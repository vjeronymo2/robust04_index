Many workers returned  home early for fear of being hit by stray bullets lest the  fighting resumes. However, the minister of information and  broadcasting has appealed to workers to carry out their normal  duties and not rely on misleading reports by foreign media.    Following the army feud, property and many residential  houses  in Maseru have been hit by stray bullets. The areas affected  are: (Koadeng, Kwasaneng, Haramehedi, Apatoemi) [word  indistinct] hospital and (Hatsulu).    As the situation continues to reach high proportions, the  prime minister, the Right Honorable Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, has held  meetings with the representative of the Organization of African  Unity, OAU, Mr. Joe Legwaila, church leaders as well as  political leaders, in a bid to seek a solution to the crisis.    The honorable minister of health and social welfare, Dr.  Khauhelo Ralitapole, says 11 civilians have been injured  following the skirmishes between two factions of the Royal  Lesotho Defense Force. She said this today, after inspecting  damage at the National Health Training Center, NHTC, adding that  the amount of damage caused will take the government some time  to repair. Dr. Ralitapole said nurse trainees had been  evacuated last Saturday to the Lesotho Cooperatives Center,  while patients of Botsabelo and Mohlomi had been transferred to  Mofokeng and Queen Elizabeth II hospitals respectively. She  reiterated the prime minister's appeal to the warring factions  to lay down their arms.    Speaking at the same inspection, the director of NHTC, Mrs.  L. (Maguthu) appealed to nurses nearer to these hospitals that  have admitted these patients to go and help. After this  inspection Dr. Ralitapole visited the injured at the Queen  Elizabeth II Hospital.</p>

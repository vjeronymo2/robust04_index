			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Americans and Russians in talks with Bosnia Serbs A US and Russian-led delegation yesterday met Bosnian Serb officials in their mountain headquarters for 'tentative and exploratory' talks aimed at salvaging the peace process. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told the nine-man delegation, which also includes United Nations and European envoys, that UN sanctions on Belgrade must be lifted to make any progress towards an overall settlement, said his spokesman, Mr John Zametica. 'The international community has to decide if it is more important to maintain sanctions or achieve peace,' he said in Pale, the makeshift Serb capital near Sarajevo. The contact group, headed by Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy, and, Mr Aleksei Nikiforov, the Russian representative, held the first face-to-face meeting with Bosnian Serb leaders since their forces complied with a Nato ultimatum on Wednesday to withdraw from a 20km exclusion zone round Gorazde, the embattled Moslem enclave which is designated a UN safe area. The group was due to return to Sarajevo for more talks with the Moslem-led Bosnian government. On Thursday, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, said he would consider a two to three month ceasefire to allow the peace talks to take place. Bosnian Serb leaders were likely to reject the offer. They claim the Bosnian army is preparing to launch an offensive on the northern Serb corridor linking Belgrade with Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia. A senior US official yesterday said Bosnian Serb forces had moved their weapons from Gorazde northwards to the corridor. This heightens fears that Serbs will soon try to widen the corridor. Bosnian and Serbian media yesterday reported fighting around Brcko, at the eastern end of the corridor. Serb leaders have called for a complete cessation of hostilities in a bid to cement their military gains. Their forces control about 70 per cent of the war-ravaged republic. The attempt to revive the peace process also included talks in Norway between Lord Owen, the EU mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy. 'The crisis has created new possibilities,' Mr Stoltenberg said. 'We have a stability and calm in Bosnia for the moment which we have not had for a long time.' Mr Stoltenberg said the only chance for a formal end of the fighting and a peace accord soon was agreement between the US, Russia, France, Germany and Britain and the United Nations, The mediators discussed preparations for a meeting of foreign ministers from the five nations along with the United Nations. Meanwhile, Croatia yesterday accused Serb forces of violating the international agreement to withdraw from a 20km zone along the 1,600km confrontation line in Croatia.</p>

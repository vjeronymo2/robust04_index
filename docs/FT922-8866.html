			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Split over anti-Tory plan: Ashdown offer meets a mixed response from Labour LABOUR's schisms over post-election tactics and trade union links deepened yesterday as reaction to a Liberal Democrat offer to help forge an anti-Tory force varied markedly across the Labour movement. An attempt by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, to trigger a realignment of UK opposition parties provoked a surprisingly positive reaction from supporters of the two main leadership candidates, Mr Bryan Gould and Mr John Smith. But the reception was far frostier from left wingers, including Mrs Margaret Beckett, challenger for deputy leader. Mr Roy Hattersley, outgoing deputy leader, said: 'No party is going to succeed with a blurred message . . . the Labour party's ideological cutting edge has to be sharper, not blunter.' At the same time, a move by Mr Gould to end the trade union leaders' role in the leadership contest, clashed with a warning on London Weekend Television from Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU, that funding of Labour by the unions could be jeopardised if institutional links were broken. Mr Gould said Mr Ashdown's speech was 'interesting,' adding: 'If Labour and the Liberal Democrats can find that they agree on a range of issues, this could help to reduce the Conservative vote.' But he emphasised: 'This should be the opposition parties' priority, rather than re-arranging support between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.' Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman and supporter of Mr John Smith for leader, went out of his way on BBC television to say he did not want to be 'churlish' and that he 'believed in a dialogue of ideas' But he wanted Mr Ashdown to make clear the Liberal Democrats were a left-of-centre party, rather than, 'simply part of the wishy-washy centre who will do a deal with anyone.' Mr Blair rejected Mr Ashdown's specific proposal for a policy forum or forums, saying: 'The moment you start entering into formal pacts or setting up forums then what you get is the belief that the way forward is deals - and it is not.' Mr Ashdown's speech on Saturday was not prescriptive about mechanisms, but signalled a willingness to work with Labour to prevent the entrenchment 'of almost permanent one-party government'. It also rejected electoral deals, but said Labour could not win alone. A Fabian pamphlet today highlights the varying explanations within the Labour movement for its general election defeat. Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool and former campaigns director, said the party looked, 'weak and muddled' by fuelling media interest in electoral reform. Mr Blair in his article calls for Labour to become the 'party that stands up to vested interests,' including in the public sector. In the same pamphlet, Mr Calum Macdonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles, backs working the Liberal Democrats on policy issues and, reinforcing calls for a consensus, the pamphlet's leading article asks, 'is there room in British politics for more than one party to take on the (Tory) party, which has defended vested interest and the status quo with such depressing success for so long?'

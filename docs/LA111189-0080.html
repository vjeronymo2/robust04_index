			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVY JET CRASH CLAIMS 2ND VICTIM;  </P> <P> AVIATION: A PREGNANT MOTHER DIES OF BURNS THE DAY AFTER THE FIGHTER HIT AN  APARTMENT COMPLEX. AND A MAN'S BODY IS EARLIER FOUND IN THE RUBBLE.  </P> <P> A pregnant mother died Friday of burns inflicted when a fighter jet crashed  into a suburban apartment complex. Earlier in the day, searchers found a man's  body in the wreckage of his incinerated apartment.  </P> <P> Navy investigators, meanwhile, continued hunting through the debris for clues  to Thursday evening's crash, but said they did not know what caused the  accident.  </P> <P> Margie Padovani, 28, died of her injuries Friday night, said John Hester, night  administrator at Grady Memorial Hospital, where Padovani had been transferred  with burns over half of her body.  </P> <P> The woman's 5-year-old daughter remained in critical but stable condition at  the hospital, Hester said. The pilot, who ejected just before the jet crashed  in a fireball, also remained in critical condition.  </P> <P> "The worst part was just the sounds -- that little girl screaming," said  resident Tamara Owens.  </P> <P> Resident Bill Barcus, who still had a reddened face and a singed arm Friday  from facing the intense heat in an attempt to reach the burning woman, said: "I  got to within 10 feet of the woman but it was too hot and I didn't have any  shoes on. All I could hear were her screams, but I had to back off. I went back  to get my shoes, but by then somebody had gotten her."  </P> <P> The young man's body was found about 3 p.m. Friday in the apartment that  absorbed the heaviest damage from the crash, Cobb County Medical Examiner  Joseph Burton said.  </P> <P> The man was identified only as a white male in his 20s. Burton said there was  no indication that anyone else was in the apartment, where he said a man lived  alone.  </P> <P> Authorities did not immediately identify the resident or the body. Only one  person was known to be missing prior to discovery of the body, but the search  continued. Four missing people were located earlier.  </P> <P> "Obviously nobody (else) turned up missing, and that leads us to believe there  is no one else in there," said Kathie Barton, Smyrna's director of community  relations.  </P> <P> The body was found in the kitchen of the last apartment in a building along the  easternmost edge of the complex. Smyrna Mayor Max Bacon said he was told the  apartment was incinerated by 4,000-degree temperatures.  </P> <P> About 30 people were left homeless by the fire, and about 50 others who lived  in undamaged portions of the Pine Lake Village Apartment complex had not been  allowed to return to their homes Friday afternoon. Most spent Thursday night at  a nearby motel, which offered free lodging.  </P> <P> Reserve Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn Jr. of Marietta, Ga., the only person aboard  the unarmed A-7E Corsair II attack plane, remained unconscious after brain  surgery, said Kennestone Hospital spokeswoman Laurel Fredlake.  </P> <P> Troy Kraemer, Padovani's fiance, said she was pregnant.  </P> <P> A woman hurt while fleeing her apartment was treated for cracked ribs, and a  military rescue worker broke an ankle, officials said.  </P> <P> Firefighters extinguished the blaze about two hours after the crash.  </P> <P> Fire Chief Larry Williams said the search of the apartment of the man believed  missing was "a military-type operation." Civilian searchers were kept away  through much of the day while Navy investigators looked for clues, and Marine  Reserve guards helped seal off the crash site.  </P> <P> Police officer Frank Durrance said the Navy jet struck the edge of a building  before crashing into a car and coming to rest by a chain link fence about 30  yards away. "You could tell it was a car, but you can't tell that it was a  plane," Durrance said.  </P> <P> Barton said 12 apartments were destroyed and 20 damaged in two buildings. Three  of the 32 units in those buildings were vacant, said Jim Humphrey, maintenance  supervisor for the complex.  </P> <P> The jet crashed 2 1/2 miles short of the runway at Naval Air Station Atlanta,  located at Dobbins Air Force Base, 15 miles northwest of Atlanta. The pilot was  to land there while on a navigational training mission, the Navy said.  </P> <P> Conlyn, 37, has flown Navy aircraft for 15 years on active duty and in the  Reserves. He joined Delta Air Lines in 1980 and is a co-pilot for the  Atlanta-based carrier.  </P></p>

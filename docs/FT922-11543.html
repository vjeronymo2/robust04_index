			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Treasury shuffles the regulation pack: The implications of changing the ministry responsible for policing financial services MOVING ministerial responsibility for the regulation of financial services sounds simple enough. Shifting 50 people and their filing cabinets across Parliament Square from the Department of Trade and Industry to the Treasury is not one of the biggest departmental reshuffles of recent years - but its long-term effects might be far-reaching. The announcement of the switch earlier this month threw a series of questions into the air like a pack of cards. The answers will determine how London's financial markets are regulated and how some of its biggest financial institutions are structured. Will the Bank of England take a more direct role in overseeing the City's investment markets? Will the Securities and Investments Board be left to wither away, or will it be beefed up to become a UK version of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US? Will London move further towards the sort of universal banking culture that already dominates on the Continent? The City has so far been given no clues to the answers - indeed, there is a widespread view that Treasury ministers have yet to think through the implications of the switch, foreshadowed in the Tory manifesto and due to take place at the start of June. Both the Bank of England and the SIB say they have been given no clear idea of what changes are planned, if any. One City regulator commented yesterday: 'It really all boils down to what's in ministers' minds. I'm not sure they are sure themselves yet.' According to another, the Treasury is already discovering that the questions raised by the switch are more complex than it had imagined. Mr Robin Hutton, director of the British Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association, said: 'It's very early days yet, so we're trying to be tolerant.' One of the biggest effects of the move will to be bring together, under the Treasury, two very different methods of overseeing wholesale financial markets. London's short-term money markets, and those for foreign exchange, gilts (government securities) and bullion come under the control of the Bank of England. For those responsibilities the Bank has a loose informal relationship with the Treasury. The Bank's control of the markets is firm but informal. For instance, participants in the money market have to comply with the Bank's non-statutory code of conduct. Repeated failures would result in a firm being struck off the Bank's recognised list, removing its exemption from the Financial Services Act. On the other hand, the wholesale investment markets, such as the stock and bond markets, are governed by a rigid statutory framework with clear formal reporting lines. The SIB, created by the 1986 Financial Services Act, reports directly to ministers. The two different approaches may not last. The Bank already has informal involvement in the operation of the stock and bond markets. Also, investment regulators have been striving for the past three years to reduce the rigidity introduced to wholesale markets by the Financial Services Act, in an effort to rekindle a more traditional informal regulatory style well known to the Bank. The switch of responsibility to the Treasury has now fuelled a strong belief among some regulators that the Bank will eventually become more directly involved in overseeing all London wholesale markets. The Bank might also take on greater responsibility for overseeing London's securities firms. Historically, the UK securities industry has operated under different rules and regulations from the banking industry, a distinction that was not removed after London's Big Bang, when commercial banks were allowed to buy stockbrokers for the first time. The Bank, as 'lead regulator', remains ultimately responsible for brokers owned by banking groups. Also, proposed European legislation on the capital backing needed by broking firms might eventually encourage more banks in London to scrap broking subsidiaries and conduct securities business off their balance sheets. Under former corporate affairs minister Mr John Redwood, the DTI fought hard to prevent European legislation that could undermine the structure of the UK's securities industry, replacing it with a Continental-style universal banking culture. Whether the Treasury will fight as hard has yet to be seen. If the Bank of England's future role is open to question, then so is the SIB's. This investment watchdog has always sat uncomfortably between government and the investment industry, looking to the industry to pay the costs of its upkeep but remaining answerable to ministers. A change of political master could upset that delicate balance - particularly if the Bank of England encroaches further on SIB territory. Much depends on Mr Anthony Nelson, the new economic secretary at the Treasury, who will take on responsibility for financial regulation. He is seen in the City as a fan of the SIB, having personally introduced the amendments to the Financial Services Act, which created the body. One former DTI official involved in the passage of the act commented: 'He kept pushing for more powers to be given to the SIB. He wanted things to be centralised, and was a great critic of the City 'club'.' That aim seems to have lain behind a clause which he tabled which gave SIB the power to make rules directly on behalf of self-regulating organisations if it felt fit. Mr Nelson might be the man to do what a growing number of people are arguing for: to centralise the assorted investigatory powers that currently leave a raft of self-regulating organisations, government officials and police all pursuing the same fraud investigations. The SIB would then come to look far more like the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Under current plans, though, the DTI will remain responsible for carrying out company and insider-dealing investigations. The complex web of regulatory relationships that has grown up in the City is unlikely to be swept away overnight.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank's life arm shows 60% income rise Sales of guaranteed equity plans and bonds helped Royal Scottish Assurance, the life insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, to increase its new premium income by more than 60 per cent in the year to September 30. Mr Ian Kerr, head of marketing, said that the increase was also because of significant growth in the sales force from slightly more than 200 to almost 300 over the year. Royal Scottish's new annual premiums were broadly flat at Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 17.1m), but new single premiums rose by 70 per cent to Pounds 249.5m (Pounds 146.4m). Funds under management grew by 56 per cent from Pounds 272.3m to Pounds 424m. Mr Kerr said the company planned a further, smaller increase in the sales force next year, but other factors might have a depressing effect on the market in gen-eral. The introduction of the new regime requiring sales agents to volunteer more information about the policies they sell and the cost of selling them is thought by many in the industry to have a negative effect on sales volumes. Mr Kerr also said that if interest rates rose next year, as expected, some traditional bank and building society customers would be discouraged from switching to investment products because they were dissatisfied with low savings rates.</p>

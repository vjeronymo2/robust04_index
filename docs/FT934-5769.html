			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Rate changes await Budget Tuesday's base rate cut from 6 to 5.5 per cent triggered a number of mortgage and savings rate changes but most banks and building societies are awaiting the Budget before moving, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Savers are getting nominally low rates for money left on deposit at banks and societies  -many instant access savings accounts at societies pay about 4.5 per cent gross on deposits of Pounds 5,000. If societies do not want to squeeze savers much further, they have two choices: to reduce mortgage rates by less than the full half point; or to squeeze their own margins in a bid to satisfy both savers and householders. Banks have greater flexibility, since they can fund their mortgages through the money markets instead of relying on retail funds. They are competing aggressively for an increased share of the mortgage market. The Nationwide and National &amp; Provincial societies, and the National Westminster bank, all have cut their standard variable rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 7.74 per cent. Existing borrowers at N&amp;P will have to wait until after the Budget before being told when the new rate applies, while those at Nationwide and NatWest will get the reduction from January 1. Nationwide also has launched several new one-year mortgage discounts. The size depends on the amount of deposit borrowers have available. Discounts of between 0.5 and 2 percentage points are available for Nationwide homeowners moving house, and for new borrowers. The obligation for borrowers with a deposit of less than 10 per cent to take out mortgage payment cover is being waived (except for some fixed and capped rates). The society also has waived its mortgage application fee, which covers the valuation for those borrowing up to 95 per cent. Nationwide will pay such borrowers Pounds 250 on completion of the mortgage. Others to have cut their mortgage rate include the Newcastle building society, which has reduced by 0.24 of a point to 7.75 per cent, and Northern Rock, down by 0.34 to 7.65 per cent. Royal Bank of Scotland has passed on the full 0.5 point reduction, taking its rate down to 7.49 per cent, while two centralised lenders, Bank of Ireland and Citibank, are reducing their rates to 7.6 per cent. Existing customers will benefit from December 1 at Bank of Ireland, and from January 1 at Citibank. Centralised lenders are, theoretically, in a good position to lower their rates since, like the banks, they can get funding from the money markets. 'They have the opportunity to be competitive; but since most new business is being done on fixed and discounted mortgages, they may decide to use their additional margins there,' says Ian Darby, of mortgage broker John Charcol. John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS, is surprised that the societies are cutting their mortgage rates by as much as they have because of the pressure on savings rates. He says: 'Societies have to offer relatively high savings rates because of pressure for retail funds from the stock market and the government. If they cut mortgage rates by an average of 0.25 of a point, I think savers' rates will come down by about 0.3 of a point.' The large societies are not revealing their hand until chancellor Kenneth Clarke reveals his in the Budget on Tuesday, but some banks have announced reductions in savers' rates already. NatWest has pruned 0.625 of a percentage point off most of its rates while Barclays has reduced by about 0.25 of a point.</p>

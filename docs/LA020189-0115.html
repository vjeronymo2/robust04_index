			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> COCAINE USE BLAMED IN PLANE CRASH  </P> <P> Federal investigators concluded today that a pilot's use of cocaine contributed  to the crash a year ago of a Colorado commuter plane that killed nine people,  including the pilot.  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board said cocaine use by pilot Stephen  Silver, 36, led to his ineffectively monitoring the aircraft's descent into  Durango. Co-pilot Ralph D. Harvey, 42, who was also killed, was controlling the  plane at the time. Board investigators said it is the first time that cocaine  use by a pilot of a commercial aircraft has been blamed for a crash.  </P></p>

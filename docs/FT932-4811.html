			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Attali to fight his corner on reforms MR Jacques Attali, the beleaguered president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, yesterday demonstrated his continued determination to fight for his position by announcing that the bank's board of directors would meet in the next few days to discuss plans for a structural reorganisation. Speaking to the American Chamber of Commerce in London, in his first public speech since the bank held its annual meeting in April, Mr Attali refused to give any details about his proposals for the reform, or confirm reports that the reorganisation would leave him in overall charge of the bank, insisting that 'there will be no announcement until the board has discussed and decided'. He did concede that 'the bank is growing and needs a better structure' and indicated that restructuring of the organisation, which has grown to 600 people, was imminent. The bank yesterday confirmed that Mr Attali had called the meeting for this week, but denied that this had been in response to reports of an imminent reshuffle or growing pressure on Mr Attali to resign in the wake of controversy over the bank's spending on entertainment and travel. The announcement of the reorganisation comes at a critical time for Mr Attali, with an audit report on the EBRD's spending practices imminent and the US congress nearing a final decision on whether to keep up the US's contributions to the bank's capital. But G7 officials, who have been pushing for the appointment of a new chief executive officer - possibly Mr Ernest Stern, one of the three managing directors of the World Bank - to take over management responsibilities from Mr Attali, seem unlikely to be placated by the impending reorganisation. Mr Attali yesterday refused to confirm reports that Mr Stern, was being considered for a senior role - though he joked that non-Europeans like Mr Stern were unlikely to be ever appointed president, since 'the president of the bank has to be a citizen of one of the countries of the community'. One aspect of any change might be to appoint a new person to act as the bank's chief operating officer, leaving Mr Attali in charge of overall strategy, but divorced from day-to-day administration. In his speech, the French bank chief launched a vigorous defence of the EBRD's record, which, he said, had had a '300 per cent' growth since it was founded two years ago. Since the beginning of the year it had approved Ecu735m (Pounds 580m) in bank loans and equity investments for eastern Europe. Mr Attali yesterday gave no indication of how his proposals for structural changes at the bank would dovetail with the report of the audit committee, which was appointed last month by the EBRD's directors to look into the bank's affairs. At the meeting of the board of governors in April, in the wake of the disclosures of the bank's high spending on entertainment and decorations, Mr Attali promised changes in the role of the budget director, temporarily separating the responsibilities of the budget director from the central board.</p>

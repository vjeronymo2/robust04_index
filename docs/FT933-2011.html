			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Interest charge hits Community Hospitals A RECESSION-hit first half and a Pounds 1.89m rise in annual interest charges cut pre-tax profits at Community Hospitals Group, the private medical care company, to Pounds 6.06m for the year ended June 30, compared with Pounds 6.75m. With profit growth resuming in the second half, the board proposed an increased final dividend of 4.5p (4.1p) giving a total for the year of 6.9p (6.5p). Earnings per share fell to 14.3p (16p). 'We in the last two years have spent Pounds 40m . . . those assets now are beginning to punch their weight. We have started this year ahead of expectations in both divisions and we believe we are now in a period of sustained growth,' said Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive. Turnover rose to Pounds 49.5m (Pounds 42.1m) and operating profits were up to Pounds 7.96m (Pounds 6.84m). 'It was a year of two halves,' Mr Dexter said. 'In the second half turnover rose 17 per cent and operating profits were up 24 per cent compared with the same period last year.' He said the company's 10 hospitals with 450 beds had suffered from recession in the first half as private health insurance, which covers 85 per cent of the company's customers, felt the increase in liquidations and bankruptcies. The cost of two 'major hospital developments' had lifted interest charges while slower-than-expected start-up phases held back revenue. The hospital division contributed Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 5.65m) to operating profits on turnover of Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 36.1m). The company's continuing care division, mainly its 11 private nursing homes with 554 beds, contributed 22 per cent (17 per cent) to operating profits, or Pounds 1.76m, on turnover of Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 6m). The implementation of the Community Care Act in April had caused a 'brief hiatus' but the company had not seen any 'material impact' on its occupancy. The division benefited from the Pounds 4.8m acquisition of three nursing homes in January. The company plans to operate 727 beds by the end of next June and hopes eventually to balance the profits contribution of the two divisions. Interest charges rose to Pounds 1.9m compared with just Pounds 4,000 in the previous year after a rights issue. The higher charge also reflected a fall in capitalised interest to Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 1.6m). Net borrowings rose to Pounds 37m (Pounds 32m) and gearing is 53 per cent (33 per cent).</p>

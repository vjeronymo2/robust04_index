			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Euro-MPs to vote on terms for EU's new entrants European parliament leaders yesterday decided to go ahead with ratification of EU entry terms for Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway on May 4, raising hopes that the newcomers can join the Union in January. The leaders' decision, which had been in doubt this week, came after the parliament made headway in its demands for equal status with the European Commission, ahead of the EU constitutional review in 1996. Leaders of the multinational political groups at the Strasbourg assembly yesterday felt confident they could muster the overall majority of 260 out of 518 MEPs to get the vote through in two weeks' time. Intensive lobbying by Scandinavian and Austrian government and party leaders, and by the European Commission and Council of Ministers, has mollified many Euro-MPs angry at last month's compromise deal on EU voting rights between the UK and its European partners. As the price of its decision to keep enlargement on the January 1 fast-track, the parliament has demanded equal status with the Commission in the 1996 constitutional review, when national voting weights in the Council of Ministers will be reviewed. In another show of muscle-flexing, MEPs are demanding the right to hold US Senate-style confirmation hearings to vet the member states' nominees to the new Commission, due to take office in January. Parliament must be consulted on a successor to Commission President Jacques Delors, expected to be named at the EU summit in Corfu on June 24-25. But it can only approve or reject the president and his fellow commissioners in their entirety. Senior parliament officials say that, just as the threat to delay enlargement was used to frustrate Britain on voting rights, Strasbourg will refuse to put approval of the new Commission on the agenda unless its members appear individually before the parliament's committees. Despite the parliament's attempts to expand its influence, on Wednesday night it botched its first attempt to veto a measure by the Council of Ministers. The MEPs were set to overturn the member states' decision to ban motorcycle engines above 100 brake horse power, but too few attended the vote. Senior officials played down the risk that parliament could be inquorate for May's enlargement vote. 'For a vote like this we have an entirely different way of operating; we pull out all the stops,' insisted Mr Julian Priestley, secretary-general of the 198-strong Socialist Group, Strasbourg's largest bloc.

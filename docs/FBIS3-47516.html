"Our approval is limited to an exchange of letters or a  meeting in a third country to find out if North Korean leaders  are willing to visit Seoul, and does not extend to their actual  visit," an NUB official said.    If Pyongyang shows it is sincere about settling the nuclear  problem, Seoul is said to be willing to seriously consider  allowing North Korean Church leaders to visit the South.    KNCC applied for a permit to contact North Koreans to invite  church leaders from the communist country to attend its general  assembly on Feb. 21 and various religious events.</p>

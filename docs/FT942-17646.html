			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / End to output decline seen in construction Construction output, after declining for three consecutive years, is expected to rise by 1 per cent this year and by a further 2 per cent next year, one of the industry's forecasting bodies is expected to announce today. Construction Forecasting and Research (CFR), which previously provided output estimates for the National Economic Development Office, says new construction orders rose 12 per cent last year, the first annual rise since 1988. It warns, however, that increases in output will be only modest and could easily be upset if private-sector investment fails to compensate for public-spending cuts announced in last November's Budget. Sixty per cent of last year's increase in orders was generated by the public sector. Mrs Jacquie Cannon, CFR director, said that there was little room for complacency even though the industry was beginning to climb out of recession. 'Continued recovery does depend on the private sector's ability to sustain the recovery as public-sector activity tails off,' she said. Construction and building material companies have criticised the government for the slow pace in encouraging private investment in roads and other infrastructure, which they say is essential to offset lower public investment in the mid and late 1990s. CFR said that output next year would still be 10 per cent below the 1990 peak. Competitive pressures resulting in companies taking on contracts with little or no margin for profit were unlikely to ease, with the industry expected to continue to suffer from over-capacity. The forecasting panel includes directors of large construction and building material companies, institutional investors, trade associations and public bodies. It expects private housing to be among the stronger performers in the next two years. The number of new private homes started by builders is expected to rise from 143,000 last year to 160,000 this year, and 170,000 next year. Social housing starts, mainly by housing associations, are expected to fall from 43,000 to 40,000 this year and 36,000 next year, reflecting the squeeze on public spending. Construction of infrastructure after completion of the Channel tunnel is expected to fall by 12 per cent this year and by a further 6 per cent next year.</p>

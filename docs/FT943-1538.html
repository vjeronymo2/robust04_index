			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Industrial Control rises 16% - Growth in controls offset increased losses in specialist engineering Strong growth in the controls division enabled Industrial Control Services, the safety systems, controls and specialist engineering company, to report a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.23m to Pounds 7.22m in the year to May 31. The share price slipped 4p to close at 141p. Mr Peter Hall, chairman and chief executive, said the rises in both profits and group turnover - which expanded to Pounds 85.5m (Pounds 72.9m) - were achieved on the back of strong growth in the controls division, which offset increased losses in specialist engineering and a small decline in safety systems profits. However, he stressed that although the controls and safety systems markets had not, in general, shown growth, the group had adopted a 'one-stop' policy towards its products and markets. For example, an offshore oil or gas rig could use the Bailey ICS joint venture to supply the process control, ICS for the safety system, Brisco for the wellhead and subsea control, and Transmitton for the 'intelligent' computers to oversee all this plant. Most of the growth, Mr Hall said, came from retrofitting and upgrading rather than new projects. Again, the Shell Supply contract for the updating of platforms in the North Sea had performed strongly. Although the Middle and Far East were showing the most growth in the world and contributed about 40 per cent of group sales, the North Sea still chipped in a similar percentage. Profits in controls increased to Pounds 4.97m (Pounds 2.6m), which included a full-year contribution of Pounds 316,000 from Brisco, acquired at the beginning of 1993. Divisional turnover was up at Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 23m). Safety systems made Pounds 5.44m (Pounds 5.55m) on turnover of Pounds 38m (Pounds 39.5m), while specialist engineering incurred losses of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 60,000) on turnover of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 10.3m). These losses, Mr Hall said, were mostly the result of heavy R&amp;D expenses at Sava, which makes security devices for computer installations and which is now seeing Dollars 250,000 of trading per month. Earnings per share rose to 10.64p (9.76p) and a final dividend of 3.5p (3.07p) makes a total of 5p (4.4p).</p>

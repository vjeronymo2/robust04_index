			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent O. Targulyan; from the </F> ``Vesti'' newscast]    [Text] The story of the U.S. vessel, the United States,  which arrived in Sevastopol at the beginning of November, is  starting to develop in an unexpected way. Its present Turkish  bosses are trying to find a town prepared to dismantle and store  300,000 square meters of asbestos roofing. Such work would cost  the United States $125 million. Turkey, following numerous  protests from the ``Greens,'' banned the dismantling within its  territorial waters. A factory in Sevastopol, that would be  prepared to do this for $1 million, is being picketed by  Greenpeace representatives, together with alarmed members of the  public. They are indignant at the intention to bury the  asbestos which is causing cancer and other grave illnesses on  the southern coast of the Crimea. However, the borders of the  CIS are clearly inaccessible to waste products.    The United States now plans to take the asbestos to Russia  and to bury it in the town of Azbest. A practice whereby rich  countries produce waste and the poorer pay for it with their  health and lives through burying, processing, or destroying it  is absolutely immoral, Greenpeace says. We are demanding the  immediate return of this poisonous vessel to its homeland, the  United States.

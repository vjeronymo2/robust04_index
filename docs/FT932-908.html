			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Australia increases tax take THE Australian government has reduced its 1992-93 budget deficit estimate from ADollars 15.9bn (USDollars 10.8bn) to ADollars 15bn because of a higher than expected collection of company tax and an underspending on infrastructure works, writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne. Australian company profits rose 24 per cent during the March 1993 quarter to a near-record ADollars 4.89bn. The increase was due mainly to the shrinking burden of interest costs. But Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said the improved outcome would not affect the ADollars 18bn starting deficit expected in 1993-94. The government has begun looking for savings in next year's budget. Bruce Jacques adds from Sydney: Mr Allan Hawkins, former chief of the collapsed Equiticorp investment group, has been charged by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) with breaches of corporate law. Mr Hawkins is serving a six-year term in Auckland after being jailed in February this year by the High Court of New Zealand on fraud and conspiracy charges. The sentence includes a non-parole period of three years. Equiticorp, founded by Mr Hawkins in 1984, collapsed in 1989 with debts estimated at almost Dollars A4bn.</p>

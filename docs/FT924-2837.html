			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD pared early losses and struggled to hold above Dollars 334 a troy ounce in late trade, aided by a statement from Hungary's central bank that it had sold gold in normal market operations and not from reserves. Gold hit a one-month low fix of Dollars 333.40 on the London bullion market in the morning on talk of central bank sales. Dealers said the market might now benefit from a reduction in selling pressure from Australian and South African producers as it slides below the key R1,000 level and tests the ADollars 480 levels on dollar weakness. London robusta COFFEE finished at fresh 12-month highs, with the market firmly back on an upward track after recent consolidation. Dealers said the scope for further gains in the short term would depend on the extent to which origins stepped up sales following the price rise. COCOA closed just above the day's lows with the market still on the defensive after Monday's weak performance. Chart sentiment has become increasingly bearish in the last couple of days.

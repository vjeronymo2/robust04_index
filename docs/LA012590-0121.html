			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SEEKING BIGGER ROLE, BROWN LEAVES CRESPI FOR SAN FERNANDO  </P> <P> Leonice Brown, the leading rusher for Crespi High last season, cited tension  between himself and Coach Tim Lins and dissatisfaction with his role in the  team's offense as reasons for his decision to transfer to San Fernando.  </P> <P> Brown, a junior who rushed for 1,097 yards last season, has withdrawn from  Crespi and will enroll at San Fernando at the start of the spring semester Feb.  5.  </P> <P> "There was something we didn't see eye to eye on," Brown said. "He's a great  coach, but there was probably some tension there. I don't want to sound  conceited, but, in some games, I thought I could have carried the ball more. I  thought I could have helped the team more. Being young, I guess I wasn't mature  enough."  </P> <P> Lins said that he harbors no ill will toward Brown. "I respect his feelings,"  Lins said. "I wish him the best of luck at San Fernando."  </P> <P> San Fernando Coach Tom Hernandez said Brown should complement returning backs  LaKarlos Townsend and William Taylor in the Tigers' wishbone offense.  </P> <P> "He's going to be a great asset to this team," Hernandez said. "If he was here  last year, it would have made a big difference. We wouldn't be 5-6, I know  that."  </P> <P> Brown had inherited the tailback job at Crespi from Russell White, the state's  all-time leading rusher and Brown's nephew. Brown is the half brother of  Charles White, the Heisman Trophy winner at USC and former San Fernando  standout. SAM FARMER  </P></p>

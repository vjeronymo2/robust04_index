			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Regarding Russian President Boris Yeltsin's request  to participate in the major industrialized nations' summit talks  to be held in Naples, Italy, next July as a regular member, the  Japanese Government has decided to suggest he join in  discussions on political issues only. Japan will present this  plan to the other G-7 countries at a preparatory meeting of  private representatives of G-7 leaders (sherpas), and will start  coordination to this end. This was disclosed by newlyappointed  sherpa Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs.    Hayashi said: "Regarding talks on economic issues, it is  premature to invite Russia as a regular member nation and to  hold G-8 talks. However, concerning talks on political issues,  it is possible to hold G-8 meetings in addition to the regular  G-7 talks."</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NOTE FROM GIRL TOUCHES DOUGLAS  </P> <P> Heavyweight boxing champion James (Buster) Douglas says he was so moved by a  note from a homeless girl that he sought her out and paid her a surprise visit  at school.  </P> <P> "It's something that keeps me in tune to how fortunate I am and the blessings  that I can pass along to someone else," Douglas said of his meeting with  12-year-old Paula Taylor.  </P> <P> While Douglas was visiting the Columbus Boys' Club in late May, Paula had a  handwritten note delivered to him. It asked Douglas to visit the Faith Mission,  where homeless people stay.  </P> <P> "She said that she was homeless and how much she loved me," Douglas said. "She  invited me to come down to the shelter to show people that I do care about  them."  </P> <P> Douglas visited the shelter twice, hoping to meet the girl and her family. But  they had already found a home. So he tracked her down and paid her a surprise  visit at school.  </P> <P> "It was amazing," Paula said."When I would see him on the news, I would never  think in my life that I would ever meet him."  </P> <P> Douglas has tried to help Paula's mother find a job and has bought gifts for  the family and clothing for the girl.  </P></p>

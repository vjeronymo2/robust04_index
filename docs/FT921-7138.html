			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (4): The missing beds  -European Venues ACROSS EUROPE, conference and exhibition venues often suffer from the same fault: insufficient hotel space adjacent to the venues to accommodate the numbers of delegates and visitors. The problem is most acute in Berlin, Vienna, Copenhagen and Birmingham - in spite of the opening last year of a new Hyatt hotel next to the International Convention Centre in the latter city. Even when venue capacity and hotel accommodation is neatly matched - as in the Sorrento Palace conference facility - other problems arise. Sorrento, for example, is served by Naples which cannot easily provide the inter- national direct flight capacity on scheduled services to match the demand for the venue. Other well-planned conference centres which have successfully developed trade fairs - such as Frankfurt and Paris, for example - also suffer from a shortage of hotel space even when the conference centre is free. Finding good convention space can also be difficult when demand is at its peak. The Milan Fiori complex is a useful standby, helped by being on the right side of town for Malpensa airport and with easy access to the orbital road, necessary because there is only one hotel on site. Nice's convention centre, the Acropolis, opened in the early 1980s, is fairly big and can accommodate most sizes of meetings, even if its design leaves much to be desired. Availability of hotels is reasonable and as the Acropolis is in the town, transport is not a problem. Nice is also well supplied with flights out of the UK. The European Federation of Conference Towns says that the most popular target countries for new conventions business are the UK, followed by the US. 'Conferences are a major factor in pan-European communications,' asserts Mr Tuula Lindberg, the Finnish president of the federation. Mr David Tonnison, managing director of the Marketing Organisation, conference organisers, believes that 'the opening of Europe as a single market will fuel a boom in international meetings.' European conference centres, however, will only maximise their occupancy rates if, he argues, 'they build the right mix of meeting rooms in the right place and provide sufficient local bedrooms.' A recent survey carried out by the Official Meeting and Facilities Guide for Europe, published by the Reed Group, found that the availability of hotel and other facilities, ease of transportation, and the distances delegates have to travel were the three most important factors in selecting a meeting destination. The survey, based on 150 corporate meeting planners in Europe, suggested that nine out of every 10 rated food quality, prices and meeting rooms as most important when selecting a conference hotel. The Guide's US version, in a survey of American convention planners, found that the chief worry among Americans when planning a European meeting was over-pricing by the convention centre and hotel, along with the availability of sufficient rooms. Among the minor factors taken into consideration by the US meeting planners, the most significant when choosing a European conference destination was said to be fears about the quality of the drinking water. Figures from the Marketing Organisation suggest that UK meeting planners have become less willing to use continental venues over the past year. Its UK activities rose from 35 per cent in 1990 to 44 per cent last year. At the same time, short-haul conference and incentive trips to continental Europe dropped from 42 to 37 per cent.</p>

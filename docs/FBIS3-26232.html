			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Bai Guoliang] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The renminbi yuan  closed at 8.6960 against the U.S. dollar today in the Shanghai  Foreign Exchange Swap Center, the largest swap center in China.    Trading was heavy today, with 33.63 million U.S. dollars  changing hands.    The amount of dollars traded in the center totaled 467  million dollars in January, averaging 22.24 million dollars on  each trading day -- up 39 percent over the same month in 1993.    Analysts agreed that the renminbi has been stable and  trading  has been brisk since exchange rates were unified at the  beginning of this year.    Altogether, the Shanghai swap center had 21 trading days in  January, with the yuan slipping gradually downward from the  first trading day on January 3, they noted.    The yuan hit bottom at 8.6930 against the dollar, but stood  there for just one day before picking up to 8.6970, which lasted  for 14 trading days.    The yuan dipped again to 8.6960 in the last two trading days  of January, they said.    Overall, the weighted average of renminbi fluctuated in a  narrow range of 0.0059 yuan for the whole month.    According to analysts, the slight fluctuation indicates that  the 8.7000 exchange rate of the yuan against the greenback is a  price acceptable to both buyers and sellers.    Practice shows that the reform of China's foreign exchange  system has been successful since the beginning of the year, to  the welcome of both Chinese and foreign traders, one analyst  noted.    In contrast, he recalled, the yuan stood at 7.7060 against  the dollar on the first trading day of January 1993 and peaked  at 8.3580.    Moreover, the weighted average of the Chinese currency  fluctuated across a broad range of 0.5768 yuan in January 1993.    At that time, the yuan exchange rate registered steep ups  and  downs, while trading was moderate, with an average of 15.95  million dollars changing hands on each trading day, analysts  said.    In the new year, trading peaked at 34.95 million dollars on  January 27, as against 25.62 million dollars in January 1993,  they said.    However, they also warned against over-optimism, saying that  it is still necessary to improve management and step up  macro-economic controls in order to prevent the renminbi  exchange rate from suffering sharp ups and downs.    Now, the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Swap Center has brokers  representing 21 Chinese financial institutions and 22 foreign  institutions.    In all, the center reported trading amounting to 5.29  billion  dollars for all of 1993, up 49 percent over the previous year.</p>

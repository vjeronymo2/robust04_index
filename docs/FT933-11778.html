			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Welsh agency is 53% self-financing FOR THE FIRST time since it was set up by the government in 1975, the Welsh Development Agency has funded more than half its income itself, its annual report shows. Of Pounds 166m in income in the year to the end of March, 53 per cent was self-funded compared with 46 per cent in the previous year. Property sales doubled to nearly Pounds 50m while the government grant was cut by almost Pounds 10m to Pounds 78m. The report makes no mention of the concerns raised by the National Audit Office on the previous year's results, which led to this month's highly critical report by the Commons public accounts committee about aspects of the agency's internal management. The audit office has approved this year's accounts. The agency said that during a tough year for business, it had achieved results which in several areas had been better than forecast. There had been 201 inward investment projects with forecast capital expenditure of almost Pounds 950m.</p>

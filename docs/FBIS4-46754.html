			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mekhlis Suleymenov, deputy of the Republic of </F> Kazakhstan Supreme Council and member of the Kazakh Academy of  Agricultural Sciences: "Why I Withdrew My Candidacy From Three  Nominations"]    [Text] I would not go into explaining my motives for three  times withdrawing my candidacy from nomination to the post of  chairman of several Supreme Council committees had it not been  for T. Kvyatkovskaya's article "Should We Appraise the  Parliament in Tenge Value?" (ASIYA No. 17, 1994). It said the  following: "There is no question that Mekhlis Suleymenov, an  agrarian scientist of international renown, would have been  elected to the chairmanship of the agrarian committee. His  candidacy was proposed by the speaker, and he had support among  both the `right' and the `left.' The most likely explanation for  this decision is that the scientist found it impossible to give  up completely his scientific plans and goals."    This implies that I was offered the post of agrarian  committee chairman but refused. I would not want the public to  see my actions in this light. Therefore, I will discuss it in  more detail.    I arrived in Almaty on the evening of 18 April, that is, the  night before the first session. In the morning I was told that  agrarian deputies had already held a meeting with Deputy Prime  Minister S.V. Kulagin. Among other things, the question of a  candidate for the post of committee chairman was discussed. Only  one name was mentioned--that of the former chairman, Yu.M.  Ilyashenko, who had been elected by the president's list in  Akmolinsk Oblast. Nobody mentioned my name.    On the first day of the Supreme Council's work the agrarian  deputies held their own meeting and discussed the candidacies of  possible contenders for the post of committee chairman. Among  the nominated were Yu.M. Ilyashenko; A.K. Yengaliyev, deputy  head of the West Kazakhstan administration; and K.A. Aubakirov,  deputy head of Zhambylsk administration. Nobody mentioned my  name. Therefore, I suggested myself through self-nomination.    When various deputy groups began to discuss candidates for  committee chairmen, I was approached several times. Deputy N.  offered the following: "We would like to ask you not to compete  for the agrarian committee. We cannot `take' all the  committees--we have to give three or four to Russians. We have  looked it over several times and decided that the agrarian  committee should go to a Russian--Yu.M. Ilyashenko. You, on the  other hand, we see as chairman of the science and education  committee."    Then I was approached by Deputy Sh., who advised me: "Why do  you need the agrarian committee? Your place is at the helm of  the international relations committee. They will not find a  better candidate!"    Then the agrarians came into the room and said: "Do not go  to  other committees under any circumstances; your place is at the  helm of the agrarian committee!" I also learned that the speaker  also was inclined to see me in precisely this committee.    Therefore, when I was nominated for the chairmanship of the  international relations committee, I declined the nomination on  the grounds that I would run for the agrarian committee. It was  a surprise to me that I was nominated for this post by Supreme  Soviet Chairman A. Kekilbayev himself. Yu.M. Ilyashenko and K.A.  Aubakirov were immediately nominated as alternative candidates.  In the course of the discussion neither the "right" nor the  "left" supported me. At the same time, support for my rivals was  as thick as the wall. I was especially upset by two remarks.    Deputy F. Kozlov, who before this actively supported the  candidacy of K. Nagmanov for chairmanship of the industrial  committee by saying: "I am a Russian, but I urge you to vote for  a Kazakh!" this time said: "We have already elected the chairmen  of seven committees, and they are not Russians! Let us finally  heed the appeal of the president, who asked us to take into  account, among other things, the ethnic balance in electing the  Supreme Council leadership!"    Deputy Sh. Murtaza expressed the opinion of a considerable  number of deputies by saying that he sees at the head of this  committee not a scientist but rather a person who grew up in a  Kazakh village and knows all its troubles. Naturally I, with my  "international renown," good English, and so-so Kazakh, did not  fit the description.    After these comments I withdrew my nomination, saying that  given such a heavy discussion I did not consider it possible to  continue to compete.    Later I was also nominated to the leadership of the science  and education committee, where U.A. Dzholdasbekov was a clear  favorite. So I had to give up my claim there as well.    As a result I found myself without a portfolio, which I do  not regret. I was told that I could still be elected because  some deputies say one thing but vote differently. But I decided  not to test fate. Now, though, I sit in an office that is four  times smaller than my director's office. On the other hand,  there are three of us in it. So I do not get bored.</p>

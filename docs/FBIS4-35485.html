			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, addressing the  academic staff and students of Amir Qabir Industrial University  today, stressed the need for better utilization of the  university's resources to meet the country's industrial  requirements. According to a Central News Unit report, the  president today opened the new mining engineering and metallurgy  department building at the university. [passage omitted]    Later, the president answered questions raised by the  students and lecturers. We draw your attention to a report by  our correspondent:    Speaking about relations with Saudi Arabia, the president  said: We are in favor of cooperation with all Islamic countries,  including Saudi Arabia, but we will not retreat from our rights.  The president added: Saudi Arabia has created difficulties and  obstacles for its neighbors, including Iraq, and it is not  acceptable to us that a bigger country of the region is putting  pressure on another country. Nevertheless, we are seeking ways  to resolve the disputes between the two countries, but as yet we  have not achieved any results.    Commenting on Iran's foreign debts, the president said: Our  foreign debt is about $17 billion, $10 billion of which is  scheduled to be repaid by $3 billion annually. He added: We  have rescheduled repayment of our debts to foreign countries  with an interest rate of less than five percent, and we hope  that our country's problem will be solved by the year 2000.    Moving on to the readjustment of subsidy payments for  essential goods, the president said: We are not planning to  implement the plan for readjustment of subsidies without raising  wages.    Speaking about the government's new decision on hard  currency  exchange rates, the president said: This decision was made  after a series of experimental programs, and the objective is to  create a balance between supply and demand.    Referring to the fact that the government is capable of  meeting the country's real needs for hard currency, Mr.  Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed the hope that through cooperation  with the private sector, the decision to ban the sale of hard  currency to importers outside the state banking system would  reach the desired objective.    The president denied rumors that Kish Island is to be given  [vagozari] to Germany in return for Iran's debt to that country.  He said: Iranian capital investment in Germany is more than the  debt Iran owes to Germany.    In reply to a question as to whether foreign satellites  would  halt the export of the revolution, the president said: Our  revolution is an ideological revolution corresponding to human  nature, and has preserved its place among the world Muslims;  this sort of problems will never be capable of undermining the  export of our revolution.    The president described the campaign against narcotics in  the  country as very desirable and said: Even our foes confess to  this fact.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During a meeting with members of the 55th  Anniversary of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] information  caravan, Politburo member Jorge Lezcano, first secretary of the  Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Havana City Province, stated  that 1994 would be a difficult year, but very different from  1993. He went on to say that the experience we have accumulated  and the economic initiatives that are being implemented will  allow us to confront challenges in all senses.    During the meeting, which was held on 13 January, Lezcano  advised that conditions have been established to improve the  transportation situation of the province. Lezcano added that  more than 200 donated buses will arrive and the same number of  so-called bus trains will be built for urban service. He added  that they hope to increase the volumes of agricultural products  with the development of the Basic Cooperative Production Units  [UBPC's] that have been created, and with the harvests of the  people's organically grown gardens, which have already begun  selling vegetables. Lezcano highlighted the improvements in  working conditions at work centers. Such is the case of the Port  of Havana where they have achieved positive results in  comparison with previous periods.    [Begin Lezcano recording] We are not talking about results  that double the productivity of the worker. I do not know by how  much their productivity has multiplied. Just yesterday and the  day before yesterday, at the plenum of the party in Habana Vieja  and Regla, we were analyzing this. The results have been  extraordinary. They have been able to increase the number of  tons per man; they have increased the number of containers per  hour. Havana, for example, had previously produced two  containers per hour. Nowadays, they are speaking of 38  containers. That is truly amazing. Production fluctuation has  considerably decreased. Before, the port had between 5,000 and  6,000 workers, and it was not enough. [word indistinct] was  tremendous. We had to constantly mobilize volunteer workers.  Today, with approximately 3,500, there are people waiting in  line to work at the port.    The other day, someone explained to us the work they did on  the 30th, the 31st, and the 1st. It was like clockwork. During  the last months of 1993, of 40 ships, 38 were dispatched  rapidly. It seems that they have found an interesting formula  with many perspectives. [end recording]    Jorge Lezcano also briefed the professionals of the national  media on the principal accomplishments of 1993, highlighting  achievements in such areas as education, construction, public  health, and tourism. Furthermore, he praised the workers  parliament process, which began on 12 January at the work  centers of Havana City.    [Begin Lezcano recording] This process achieves two  important  things. One is that it considers the opinion of the people. Many  important ideas can be obtained this way. With millions of  people providing their ideas and suggestions, it is possible to  receive ideas that some economists and officials may not have  thought about, on the one hand. On the other hand, it is  possible to see where they coincide. You can see that there will  be greater acceptance of those measures that coincide. People  participating and giving ideas. people recognizing that they are  being consulted on the measures that are going to be  implemented. This involves a very important political factor,  the second aspect: The people understand and support the  measures. When the people participate, they have the capacity  and a higher likelihood of being able to participate in the  implementation of those measures. [end recording]    Lezcano reiterated that 1994 will be a difficult year, but  very different from 1993. He added: We have a greater awareness  of the problems and how to solve them with increased efficiency  and at lower material and human cost.</p>

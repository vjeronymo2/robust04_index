			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Clinton adviser's vintage week: David Gergen emerged triumphant IF it has been a good week for President Bill Clinton it has been a vintage one for David Gergen. The fingerprints of the new presidential adviser were all over just about everything that came out of the White House this week. Gergen rules, imparted by the old master, James Baker, during the prehistoric Reagan ice age, have not yet been filmed by Steven Spielberg nor issued in paperback. But they are known to include: Keep it simple even when it is not: in his press conference on Thursday night, Mr Clinton, who loves the complex, offered, for the first time, a new straightforward formula to describe the hideously complicated and still disputed budget legislation. 'For every Dollars 10 in deficit reduction, Dollars 5, half of it, comes in spending cuts, Dollars 3.75 comes in tax increases on the highest income Americans - the upper 6 per cent - and Dollars 1.25 comes in taxes from the middle class. Families with incomes below Dollars 30,000 are held harmless in this programme.' This will become the new administration litany, unless Congress radically changes the numbers. Borrow good ideas regardless of the source: three economic charts, all in living colour, formed the backdrop to the press conference and were frequently used by the president. So what if Ross Perot has been employing the same technique for a year - or that David Gergen went boating with him in Bermuda three weeks ago? Never go public unprepared: Mr Gergen, who knew only too well what Mr Reagan might say if deprived of his coaching and his 3-by-5 inch cards, put Mr Clinton, normally so self-confident in his mastery of material, through a mock press conference in the White House theatre in the hour before he went on live TV for the real thing. Do not get mad at the press because it is a no-win proposition: Mr Clinton did lose his temper on Monday, perhaps understandably, and he could have gone further. The media is asking itself if it has not been too hard too early and one poll this week found more than four in ten Americans believing he had not been given a fair shake by the fourth estate. But, over a span of 72 hours, he followed through with two formal press conferences and another, with President Sam Nujoma of Namibia, which came to resemble one. In all three he dripped charm, joking with the TV journalist who had so offended him and on Thursday night swapping garish Mickey Mouse ties with a print reporter. 'You have to do your job as you see it,' he said in the most conciliatory tones to the massed media, 'and I'm going to do mine the best I can.' The joint responsibility, he went on earnestly, was to create 'an atmosphere of trust and respect' in which 'I am going to do my best to be honest with you and you're going to be honest with me.' Whether the president - or the media - believes it or not is secondary to the fact that both, for the moment, are going to be on better behaviour and terms.</p>

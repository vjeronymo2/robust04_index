			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / MacGregor admits he intervened in rail pay dispute: Train drivers threaten to hold strike ballot Mr John MacGregor, the trans-port secretary, admitted yesterday he had intervened in the rail dispute to warn Railtrack management not to breach the government's public sector pay bill freeze. His admission, which came as the rail network was paralysed by the 24-hour strike, followed the withdrawal earlier this week of a negotiating 'proposal' by Railtrack to pay its signalling staff a 5.7 per cent rise. Further conflict on the railways was threatened yesterday by the train drivers' union Aslef. Its annual conference threw out a 2.5 per cent pay settlement recommended by its leaders. Delegates warned if it was not increased the drivers would be balloted for strike action. Until Mr MacGregor's remarks on the Railtrack proposal, the government had repeatedly denied allegations that it put pressure on the company to drop the higher offer. Mr MacGregor said he had told Railtrack, the new public sector company responsible for the railway infrastructure, of 'the general government position' on public sector pay within the past few days. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, said Mr MacGregor's comments showed the rail strike was 'entirely the fault of the government'. Although the rail network was at a virtual standstill yesterday, predicted road chaos failed to materialise as thousands of commuters stayed at home. Negotiations are expected during the next few days to try to prevent a second 24-hour stoppage by railway signal staff announced for next Wednesday. Both Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT rail union, said they hoped talks could continue despite further public argument over who was to blame for the dispute. Mr Horton denied that signalling staff had been offered 5.7 per cent and he repudiated a memorandum from his production manager for Railtrack South that said it had. 'That was an internal memorandum from an over-zealous, very junior manager,' he said. The RMT union issued another Railtrack document, Proposal to RMT, handed to the union last week by Mr Chris Leah, the company's main negotiator. It makes clear that Railtrack wants 'to restore the relativities of signalling grades as detailed in the RMT claim of February 9'. It adds: 'This figure which is set at 5.7 per cent will then be cascaded throughout all the signalling grades. This new basic rate will then be the base position for stage two discussions.' The Railtrack 'proposal' emphasised that the signalling staff would have to agree to work flexibly and open up jobs to wider recruitment. What seems to have happened is that Mr Horton and his board decided to overrule Railtrack's negotiators by withdrawing the 5.7 per cent interim pay offer. Instead they decided all the issues raised by the union should be dealt with in one set of negotiations. Few upsets, Page 7</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Observer: Balanced view It says much for the sheer doggedness of the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements that when it comes to debating Europe's monetary and economic union, it's still talking in terms of when, rather than if, it happens. The central bankers' bank was certainly not going to allow the rebellious Danes to disrupt its long-planned discussion of the non-European view of EMU at yesterday's BIS annual meeting. Indeed, scores of central bankers from as far away places as India and Mexico were invited to the closed session. Luckily, Erik Hoffmeyer, chairman of the Committee of European Community Central Bank Governors, was on hand to give his advice. Not only is he attempting to pick up the pieces of EMU after the Danish referendum result, but he is also the governor of the Danish Central Bank. Yesterday the amiable Danish bank chief was doing his best to shrug off any possible discomfort and insisting that the Danish vote had been the result of a fair and proper debate.</p>

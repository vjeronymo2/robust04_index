			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Kanemaru quizzed on 'tax evasion' MR Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced former kingmaker of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party, spent yesterday being questioned by prosecutors in Tokyo's criminal detention centre, after being arrested on Saturday for alleged tax evasion running to several hundred million yen. Mr Kanemaru's arrest came hours after the Diet's lower house passed the 1993 budget, paving the way for the government to draw up further measures to stimulate the flagging economy. The opposition parties had been delaying the budget with calls for an income tax cut and further investigation of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal, which led to Mr Kanemaru's resignation last year. Some political analysts believe the prosecutors' decision to arrest Mr Kanemaru may reflect the government's decision that further action against him was necessary to still the opposition's campaign on the Sagawa scandal. The Tokyo prosecutor's office, widely criticised for failing to interview Mr Kanemaru in person last year over the scandal, also wants to restore its battered public reputation. Mr Kanemaru, who was head of the then-dominant faction within the LDP, resigned last October after being fined Y200,000 (Pounds 1,169), following his admission that he received an illegal political donation of Y500m from the scandal-tainted Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company. Mr Kanemaru, 78, was arrested over allegations that he concealed income of up to Y800m between 1987 and 1989. Mr Masahisa Haibara, his private secretary, is alleged to have concealed income of about Y400m between 1987 and 1991. Leading LDP politicians, including Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said they were dumbfounded by the arrest, which probably owes much to the influence of the recently-appointed justice minister, Mr Masaharu Gotoda, a proponent of political reform. The political impact of the arrest will not be clear for a few days. It may work to the government's benefit by laying to rest the Sagawa scandal, or could once again highlight that financial irregularities are often the foundations for power in Japanese politics. The passage through the parliament's lower house of the Y72,350bn budget for 1993 means it will automatically become law within 30 days. The focus will immediately shift to the government's plans for a further special spending package to stimulate the economy. In August last year, the government announced a Y10,700bn package of public works spending and measures to support the stock market. Leading business organisations, as well as the opposition parties, are pressing for an income tax cut of Y4,000bn-Y5,000bn. But the LDP and the powerful Finance Ministry are as yet opposed, because although a tax cut may generate only a limited rise in consumption, it would require higher government borrowing through issuance of deficit financing bonds. Ministries and lobby groups are likely to put forward a plethora of schemes in the next few weeks. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is drawing up plans for an investment programme in advanced telecommunications networks and computer equipment for schools and universities, to help the ailing electronics industry. The Finance Ministry opposes this plan, which officials regard as a direct subsidy to the industry. Finance Ministry officials want the package to focus on public works spending, housing tax credits and investment incentives for small and medium businesses.</p>

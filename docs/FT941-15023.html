			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Silva may resign as Venezuelan finance minister Venezuelan finance minister Carlos Rafael Silva said yesterday he would resign in protest at the government's temporary suspension of 10 per cent VAT on consumers and accused colleagues of bowing to public pressure, Reuter reports from Caracas. The move comes two weeks before the government is set to hand over power. President-elect Rafael Caldera has said he will scrap the tax.</p>

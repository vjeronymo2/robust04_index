			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CANADIAN REARRESTED TRYING STUNT AT FALLS  </P> <P> A Canadian has been arrested for the second time this month on charges of  attempting to perform a stunt at Niagara Falls.  </P> <P> Peter E. DeBernardi, 43, was arrested Tuesday near the base of the Horseshoe  Falls in Ontario and charged with criminal trespass and attempting to perform a  stunt on park property, said a Niagara parks police spokesman.  </P> <P> Police would not elaborate on DeBernardi's planned stunt. The Buffalo News,  quoting unidentified sources, said DeBernardi had a length of rope with him and  speculated that he might have planned to try repeating a 1988 stunt in which he  rappelled into the gorge at the base of the falls.  </P> <P> DeBernardi and two other men were arrested last week in Niagara Falls, N.Y.  </P></p>

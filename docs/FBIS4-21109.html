Police and those working in the field of drug addiction have  long been reluctant to announce the arrival of crack cocaine in  France due to their fear of generating devastating publicity.  Opting for the ostrich approach, they were convinced that Europe  would not be invaded by the type of cocaine used by the  homeless, accompanied by the ills resulting from immediate  dependency that spread like wildfire in the United States  starting in 1986. Exposing the futility of such an approach, the  first French study of its type is now sounding the alarm,  stating that "the production and use of crack cocaine in France  is a major event on the illegal drug scene." [passage omitted]    Police in France first began to mention crack in 1989,  referring to "pebbles" or "Antillean crack" made, not from  "paste" (cocaine base containing chemical additives), but from  the purified product and theoretically less harmful than  American crack. In June 1993, Paris Police Chief Philippe  Massoni admitted it: "It is true; we are finding crack in the  capital. Don't expect me to tell you where; I don't want it to  spread." (FRANCE SOIR interview) In Marmottan Hospital's annual  report published in February, Dr. Olievenstein observed "an  obvious spread of the crack market." The French study published  today confirms the gravity of the phenomenon.    Completed on behalf of IREP [.sup]1[/] for the Medical and  Psychology Association and directed by Dr. Ingold, the study  immediately confirms that "pebbles" and crack are in fact one  and the same substance. The ambiguity was used as a sales pitch  by dealers, which "certainly made it easier for the product to  enter France initially." From the French Antilles, trafficking  in crack spread to the Parisian region, appearing first of all  in the "squats" located in the 18th and 19th arrondissements  around Line 9 of the Metro between the Republique and Nation  stops. It then progressed to the area near the Ourcq Canal at  Stalingrad and in 1992 and 1993 "spread considerably, with  hundreds of users." By 1993, crack had already been found in 14  departments around the capital. While recognizing the difficulty  of estimating the number of users, the study states that in  Paris "it is reasonable to say that by 1993 they easily exceeded  the thousand figure."    Unlike the majority of the cocaine users, crack addicts are  often from among the hard-core fringe elements of society. In  Paris, "a large part of them--although fewer and fewer--are  Antilleans and Africans. Men clearly comprise the majority and  the women are generally involved in prostitution. It takes about  a month for these individuals to go from the experimental stage  to complete dependency with all its consequences: weight loss,  pallor, exhaustion, confusion." In addition, more and more are  former heroin addicts who have switched and they are sometimes  very young. "Their main drug has changed, even if they continue  to use heroin in order to tolerate `coming down' better."    The IREP study notes "a formidable acceleration in the  social  dropout process" of crack users and points to their essentially  nocturnal way of life. "The stimulating and anxiety-producing  effects of crack are seemingly incompatible with daytime use.  `It's too much speed.'"    While warning of the risk of crack spreading to the suburbs  and larger provincial cities, Ingold pessimistically concludes:  "It is far too late for any kind of an "information" campaign.  Users will have to see for themselves that crack is an  infinitely more destructive drug than heroin or other  substances."  Footnote    1.

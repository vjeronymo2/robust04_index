			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Retailers count cost of expansion - The fall in consumer confidence in Japan QUEUES of customers waiting to buy cheap office workers' uniform blue suits last month at a discount retailer in Ginza, Tokyo's luxury shopping area, exemplified the problems facing Japan's retail industry, which is experiencing the worst fall in consumer confidence this decade. A fall in real income and rising fears of redundancy are hitting household spending, and not only are up-market department stores and high-priced merchandise sales suffering but interim results released in the past week show leading supermarket chains are also feeling the pinch. Most supermarkets blamed the bad summer weather and the economic slump for the fall in profits. However, the supermarkets, which expanded into retailing expensive merchandise during the late 1980s, are also at fault. As consumer tastes turned to more expensive merchandise during the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s, the supermarket chains, looking for fatter profit margins, expanded their product ranges to items such as clothes, electronic goods and furniture. This strategy has backfired amid the current economic slump, and earnings for the six months to August at the leading supermarkets have sagged. The retailers blame sluggish sales of clothing, which became a mainstay product of supermarkets, brought on by the cool summer, but the reality may be that consumers are turning to discount retailers for cheaper household goods and electric appliances. Daiei, Ito-Yokado, and Jusco all saw declines in profits, and are pessimistic on prospects for the full year. Chujitsuya, a supermarket chain based in the Tokyo area which will be absorbed by Daiei next year, posted an interim pre-tax loss of Y1.7bn on a 8.7 per cent fall in sales to Y149.9bn. Up-market department stores continued to be hit by the increasingly cost-conscious consumer. Mitsukoshi, which has business ties with Harrods, posted its first interim pre-tax loss in nine years. Sogo, which released its interim results yesterday, suffered a 71.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y630m on sales down 12.2 per cent to Y126.2bn. Daimaru reported a 23.7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y1.3bn in spite of sales of securities, on a 6.5 per cent decline in sales to Y267.8bn. 'Department stores have had the most to lose from the rising popularity of discount retailers,' says Mr Paul Heaton of *something in here (HP) * Baring Securities in Tokyo. Mr Heaton says consumers have discovered that discount retailers are now offering high quality goods at cheap prices, unlike their previous image of vendors of low quality cheap goods. According to the local Nihon Kogyo Shimbun newspaper, men's clothing discounters are expected to post a 19.9 per cent rise in sales for the current business year, compared with a 6.8 per cent rise at supermarkets and a 7 per cent fall at department stores. Meanwhile, convenience stores continue to enjoy consumer support. Interim pre-tax profits at Seven-Eleven rose 2.6 per cent to Y46.2bn on sales up 7.5 per cent to Y98.6bn. Convenience stores, which are open 24 hours a day, have managed to cater to special needs of consumers. One-third of sales are made between 9pm and 6am. The sector has managed to cultivate a new group of young urban consumers, who stay out at night, and has maintained high profit margins by offering new products. Supermarkets are now trying to offer cheaper goods by developing their own brands, while cutting costs by reducing product ranges and spending less on interior design. Meanwhile, department stores are attempting to compete with the discount retailers by drastically cutting prices. One leading department store recently attracted customers by offering men's silk suits below Y30,000. For the second half of the fiscal year, retailers hope a return of consumer confidence will push up sales. However, analysts point out that even if the economy recovers, profit margins may remain thin as consumers will not easily go back to the luxury-loving ways of the late 1980s.  -----------------------------------------------------------                    JAPANESE SUPERMARKETS                   First-half fiscal 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------                      Sales            Pre-tax profit               Yen (bn)   % change   Yen (bn)    % change  ----------------------------------------------------------- Daiei         1,011.7      +1.2       10.5        -8.4 Ito-Yokado      750.8      +0.1       41.7       -14.8 Seiyu           529.3      -3.3        7.5        +0.7 Jusco           499.1      +3.2       11.7        -2.6  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

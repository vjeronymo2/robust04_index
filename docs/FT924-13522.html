			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Arts: Artists and Admirers - Theatre Alexander Ostrovsky was a 19th century Russian playwright whose early works were banned by the tsarist regime not because they were particularly revolutionary, but because they satirised the bourgeoisie. He was pre-Chekhov, but you can see the marks of Ostrovsky in Chekhov's plays, notably a love of the theatre for its own sake and the suggestion that while all the world's a stage, actors and artists are somehow different from other people. The subtlety lies in showing that the division is not entirely clear-cut. Ostrovsky's prolific output has not been much translated into English because, one is told, his Russian is idiomatic and his satire is local. A tragedy made it to New York around 1900, but the comedies have come only recently. The Royal Shakespeare Company achieved a breakthrough in 1981 with a production of The Forest, starring Alan Howard. Artists and Admirers followed at the Riverside Studios a year later and has now been revived by the RSC, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. As a play, it is almost a draughtsman's illustration of a curate's egg: some parts of it are very good. The principal artist is Negina, a poorly-born but talented actress who is befriended by an equally poor student and, rejecting the student, is launched on her career by a seriously rich landowner. Both student and landowner are admirers and both seem decent enough sort of men: the only difference between them is that one of them has money, and the power and influence that go with it, while the other has not. The stage-manager, once a member of the landed gentry, is an admirer as well. There is one other artist, a drunken tragedian who looks as if he is playing Falstaff and King Lear at the same time and talks to Negina as if she were Ophelia. Shakespearean references abound: Negina's initial entrance has suggested Ophelia long before the tragedian talks about a nunnery. The weakness is that there are one or two other characters who appear to be neither artists nor admirers, but just hangers-on. They include a government official, a boorish prince and the local impresario. Sometimes it is not easy to tell them apart. There is a question about Negina's mother. Is she an admirer or just an old-fashioned mum? The cook, a very small part, is an artist in that she treats the samovar as if it were human while she makes the tea, wonderfully played by Virginia Denham. In the end, there are too many parts for the play and no-one stands out for long. The attempt to introduce pathos into Negina's parting with the student does not work and much of what must once have been satire has been lost with the passage of time. Yet do not overlook the good bits. Denys Hawthorne has some splendid moments as the tragedian. Linda Bassett plays the mother as well as one could imagine: note the change in her accent when the rich landowner first appears. One always sympathises with the straight female lead, for that is what Negina is, in a play made for character acting. Sylvestra le Touzel, a very good character actor herself, does all that can be done with a part that does not develop. Artists and Admirers, however it looked when it was first written, no longer seems a very good play, though it remains an interesting one because it tells us so much about Russian theatre before Chekhov. The latter would have tidied it up a bit, dropped some characters and introduced more feeling. Ostrovsky, incidentally, became a very popular playwright as the tsarist regime relaxed its censorship. He was made President of the Society of Russian Dramatists and Operatic Composers and began to work on the ensemble style of acting which led to Stanislavski. You can see some of that in Ms Lloyd's production and the designs by Anthony Ward. In repertory at The Pit (071) 638 8891</p>

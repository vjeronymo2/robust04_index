			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Barings leaps to Pounds 100m helped by securities side Barings, the closely held UK-based investment bank, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m for 1993, a dramatic improvement over 1992 when they halved to Pounds 21.3m from the year before. The group, whose share capital is owned by a charity established by the Barings family, did not provide details of which activities had contributed most to profits. But Mr Andrew Tuckey, Barings deputy chairman, said that Baring Securities, which had experienced significant losses on Japanese equities in 1992, had recovered strongly in 1993. He also said that the Group had benefited from the enormous surge in interest in investing in emerging markets. Among Baring's core businesses is its role as an agency stockbroker and trader of emerging markets securities with offices in 23 countries. However, emerging markets have fallen somewhat since the start of the current year and Mr Peter Baring, chairman, warned that the improvement in the group's profitability was unlikely to continue at the same pace in 1994. 'During 1993, a number of factors working in our favour helped us produce significantly improved profitability. While it is unlikely they will persist during 1994, the year has started well and I believe we will face no shortage of opportunity,' he said. Barings said that its income from trading activity grew sharply from Pounds 65.3m to Pounds 149m while fees and commissions rose from Pounds 272m to Pounds 377m. Operating expenses also rose sharply to Pounds 469m aginst Pounds 349m. Mr Tuckey said that worldwide, Barings has increased its staff by about 10 per cent but the need to increase bonuses had also contributed to the sharp rise in costs. Mr Baring said: 'It is imperative for us to remunerate competitively if we are to attract and retain good people; this is especially the case for a group like Barings which is operating internationally, often in direct competition with US-owned houses.' A reorganisation which integrated the Baring Securities and Baring Brothers and Co arms of the business into a new investment banking group is paying off, Mr Tuckey said. The costs of that reorganisation, due to be completed this year, were absorbed in the 1993 accounts. Also contributing to profits were the activities of US investment bank Dillon Read in which Barings has a 40 per cent stake. Mr Tuckey said the bank, which specialises in US corporate finance and municipal bond underwriting and trading, had had its most profitable year ever in 1993.</p>

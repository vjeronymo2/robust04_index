			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: GM outlines plan for return to profit MR JOHN SMITH, General Motors' chief executive and president, outlined plans to return the carmaker's troubled North American operations to an after-tax profit in 1994. It aims to increase US sales, taking the group's market share to 33 - 34 per cent from around 31 per cent, and further cut costs. Contributing to the turnround this year have been a Dollars 2bn cut in the cost of materials and a 12 per cent reduction in assembly time to 24 - 25 hours. Also, 1993 US sales are expected to reach 14.1 vehicles, up 7 per cent from last year. In its last quarter, GM's North American operations made a net loss of Dollars 1.12bn, after plant closure costs and other items which resulted in a net charge of Dollars 289m. The company is planning a 5 per cent increase in vehicle sales in the US in 1994, to 14.8m. Even if this target is not met, Mr Smith said GM should make the planned return to net profitability in North America. Mr Gerald Knetchtel, head of North American operations, said next year's targets are not based on further job cuts. The sale of various units and normal attrition would push staff levels down to around 245,000 next year, he said.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Pragmatic outsider on the inside track: The UK Treasury's new boss If Mr John Major were looking for someone to symbolise his ideal of a classless Britain, he would need to go no further than Sir Terence Burns, his new permanent secretary to the Treasury. Sir Terence is nothing like central casting's ideal of a top Whitehall mandarin. Instead he is a courteous, down to earth northerner, who retains more than a trace of a Geordie accent despite working in London for more than 25 years. But to typecast him simply as a northern lad made good would be to ignore the powerful influence that he has had over economic policy making in Britain since first becoming chief economic adviser to the Treasury in 1980. It would also belittle the Treasury's special place in Whitehall as a department where merit makes it to the top. Sir Peter Middleton, the outgoing permanent secretary, was himself an example of the Treasury's meritocratic culture, having started out in life, like Sir Terence, as a northern grammar school boy. But whereas Sir Peter has always appeared the archetypal eminence grise, Sir Terence has eschewed patrician ways. Only 47 years old, he appears a man without 'side,' as they say in the north. He seems happiest when talking about golf, the performance of Queens Park Rangers football club, which he supports, or music. It is a genuine performance but is often used to deflect questioners from finding out too much about his views on economic policy. For Sir Terence is discreet. As yesterday's news shows, he is also ambitious. And he has shown a remarkable capacity to escape blame for the economic policy mistakes of the past 10 years. His arrival at the Treasury 11 years ago caused genuine surprise. As an economist of strong monetarist leanings, he was recruited in 1980 by the then recently-elected conservative government from the London Business School, where he had risen to be both a professor and director of its Centre for Economic Forecasting. He quickly made his mark in Great George Street by helping to devise the medium term financial strategy, which marked the end of attempts to fine tune the economy through fiscal changes. The subsequent evolution of the strategy from one based on monetary targeting, through various permutations of monetarism to one based on sterling's membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System is evidence of a pragmatic approach. He has always laid stress on the importance of controlling inflation. This raises one awkward question: what was he doing in between 1986 and 1988 when the seeds of the late inflationary upsurge in the UK economy were being sown? It was quite easy for outsiders to sense that Sir Peter Middleton was deeply unhappy with the course of events. Sir Terence was more cryptic. If he felt discomfort in the latter years of Mr Nigel Lawson's chancellorship, he hardly showed it. Indeed, in May 1989, after having been the government's chief economic adviser for nearly 10 years on short term contracts, he finally became a professional civil servant. Mr Lawson's resignation and Mr Major's appointment as chancellor in October 1989 gave his career a new lease of life. He quickly became an admirer of the new chancellor, and was heard shortly after Mr Lawson's departure to say that he thought Mr Major 'had real star qualities'. Sir Terence also appeared to revel in the greater freedom that he enjoyed under a minister with less experience and economic expertise. By the time Mr Major became prime minister, it was clear that Sir Terence was one of his close advisers. 'He listens a lot to Terry,' one of Mr Major's advisers said at the time. At first sight next month's jump from chief economic adviser to permanent secretary looks a big one. He will be in charge of 3,000 people and be the chancellor's senior adviser on macro-economic policy. But as the government's chief economic adviser, Sir Terence has been no ivory tower economist. He has been head of the government economic services since 1980 and sits on all management committees in the Treasury. His role in policy making and departmental management has been of increasing importance, almost as if he had been preparing himself for the top Treasury job. SIR TERENCE BURNS 1944 Born March 13.

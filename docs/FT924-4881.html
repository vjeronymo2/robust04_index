			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / The lingering death of a whizzkid's haven: The Stock Exchange seems set to recommend closing the USM The Unlisted Securities Market has been suffering a slow, lingering death. Although it survived the crash of 1987, the recession of early 1990s has gradually drained liquidity and confidence from the market. The Stock Exchange seems set to recommend the abolition of the market, with as many companies as possible transferring to the upper tier. For a brief period in the mid-1980s, the market seemed to have become what it was designed to be; a thriving haven for budding British entrepreneurs. The USM was founded in response to an age-old fear that the stock market was too inflexible to cater for the young, vigorous companies which could be the driving force of Britain's economic growth. The Wilson committee reported in 1979 that there was a 'capital gap' facing companies which were too small for a listing and which did not want to rely on banking facilities. The Stock Exchange was also concerned about the development of 'over-the-counter market' trading in unlisted companies, and wanted to bring this area under its control. There was something rather exciting about the establishment of this market; one of the first companies to join was Lord Hesketh's ambitious venture for building a British superbike. The Hesketh business failed, but as the UK economy emerged from the early 1980s recession, the USM built momentum. From 23 companies at the end of 1980, the market grew to 268 by the end of 1984. In the early years, the market's performance was dogged by a heavy concentration in oil and electronics companies. But as the bull market gathered pace, the speculative attractions of the market increased - the USM Index doubled between January 1 and October 16 of 1987. The crash appeared to deal a grievous blow to the market. Overnight, liquidity in many of the shares disappeared; investors found they were simply unable to offload the stakes they bought when the market was rising. However, there was some recovery in 1988 and 1989. UK corporate profits were still rising, and companies were able to float on the back of strong growth records. Analysts pointed to the 'small company effect', whereby shares in such companies outperformed their larger brethren over long periods, and this encouraged investors to back flotations. But the early 1990s recession was a body blow. Smaller companies tend to have a greater concentration of their business in the UK and thus were doubly hit by the fall in demand and the effect of high interest rates. Small company shares have underperformed those of larger companies in each of the calendar years from 1989-1992. The USM's smaller sibling, the Third Market, which was founded in 1987, was quick to bite the dust. The market, which was designed to cater for even smaller and younger companies, never really captured investors' imagination and was closed at the end of 1990. What may have sealed the fate of the USM, however, was a change in the rulebook. When the USM was established, a five-year record was required before companies could join the main market, whereas USM companies had just a three-year minimum. In 1991, these requirements were reduced to three and two years respectively. Many companies seem to have decided that they might as well wait an extra 12 months and join the more prestigious senior tier. Other small companies have chosen to be acquired by larger groups in a trade sale, rather than face the risks and expense of the flotation process. And many successful USM companies have been promoted to the main market, with weaker groups left behind on the junior tier. The number of new issues has gradually dwindled. In the peak year, 1988, 103 companies joined the market. By 1991, there were just 15, and in this year's first half, only four. The lifeblood of the USM has ebbed away. At the end of June, there were 326 companies on the market, with a total capitalisation of Pounds 5.08bn. That compares with 443 companies and a market value of almost Pounds 10bn at the end of September 1989. And the USM has long since ceased to be an important means of capital financing for small companies. In 1988, companies on the market raised Pounds 308m from investors; that figure rapidly dropped to Pounds 45m in 1990, Pounds 11.6m in 1991 and Pounds 14.6m in the first half of 1992. The value of customer business on the market has also fallen sharply - from Pounds 6.08bn worth of shares traded in 1987 to Pounds 1.43bn in 1991. As a consequence, several market-makers have decided to pull out of trading the shares of many smaller companies, as it was proving impossible to earn profits in the sector. The Stock Exchange recently established a new system for trading illiquid shares, SEATS, but for many investors, the damage may already have been done. It will take a while before they will be prepared to take the risks of investing in small company shares again, even if USM stocks transfer to the main market. Speculation about the USM's extinction has been commonplace in 1992. If most participants are able to transfer to the main market, few will shed any tears. But perhaps if the USM dies, a small part of the once popular vision of an 'entrepreneurial Britain' could die with it.</p>

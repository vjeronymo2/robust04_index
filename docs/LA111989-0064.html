			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: DRUM BOOGIE:  </P> <P> Is it possible -- a rock album without guitars, keyboards or electronics of any  kind? It's been done, thanks to Siouxsie Sioux and her drummer pal, Budgie, who  have taken time off from Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees to make an all-percussion  album under the moniker of the Creatures. Titled "Boomerang," the record  features percussion, Siouxsie's vocals and a Budgie-propelled melange of bells,  chimes and muted trumpets. Due at month's end from Geffen Records, it offers  such songs as "Pluto Drive," "Speeding," "Killing Time" and "Strolling Wolf." .  . . And Bryan Adams is still in the studio working on his new album -- he's  switched producers from Steve Lillywhite to Mutt Lange.  </P></p>

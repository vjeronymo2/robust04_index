			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH HOLY DAYS 'SCHLEP' RAISES OBJECTIONS  </P> <P> Paul Feldman's article on his search for the wildest, craziest High Holy Day  services in L. A. is an unprecedented trivialization and vulgarization of  Jewish observances.  </P> <P> No wonder Mr. Feldman "can't get no satisfaction." He thinks going to synagogue  is like going to the circus. Among his freak show of deviant rabbis, he lists  "a woman rabbi," presumably to distinguish her from "normal" rabbis who are  invariably male.  </P> <P> When Good Friday and Easter arrive, will The Times commission a comparably  voyeuristic survey of off-beat Christian rites? Or might we perhaps agree that  any worship a community offers up in deep earnest deserves to be reported with  respect?  </P> <P> RACHEL ADLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / People: BBC post speculation on the increase Speculation about who will succeed Marmaduke Hussey as chairman of the BBC is likely to increase following the re-appointment of Sir George Russell (above) as chairman of the Independent Television Commission for two more years. The ITC is responsible for licensing and regulating the UK's commercial TV stations. Sir George, 58, who is also chairman of 3i, has been chairman of the ITC since it was established in 1990 and is generally regarded as having done a good job in helping the commercial TV industry cope with the new broadcasting act. His name has been mentioned as a possible successor to Hussey who has been chairman of the BBC since 1986. It is not unknown for the chairman of the BBC to be brought in from the commercial sector. Lord Hill, the BBC's radio doctor before becoming chairman of the Independent Television Authority, was appointed chairman of the BBC in the late 1960s by Harold Wilson, a Labour prime minister who was concerned at the BBC's alleged anti-Labour bias. Later Lady Plowden, a vice-chairman of the BBC in the early 1970s, was switched to be chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority. Although Marmaduke Hussey has been reappointed for a second five-year term which expires in April 1996, there has been speculation that he might retire early, especially now that the questions over the renewal of the BBC's charter have been removed. Hussey turns 71 later this month. However, the extension of Sir George's term as ITC chairman for two years from January 1 means that his term will run past the date when the BBC job falls vacant.</p>

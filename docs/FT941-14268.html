			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Closed Notts pit set to re-open A deal which will lead to the re-opening of a pit closed last year by British Coal is expected to be signed tomorrow, creating 200 jobs. Clipstone colliery near Worksop in Nottinghamshire will become the first pit hit with closure to start up again. The colliery, which used to employ more than 1,000 miners, will be operated under licence by RJB Mining, a Nottinghamshire-based company. It is expected to re-open next week, although coal is unlikely to be cut for several weeks.</p>

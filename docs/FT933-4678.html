			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / R&amp;D spending shows 7% fall TOTAL UK spending on research and development fell 7 per cent in real terms from 1990-91 to 1991-92, according to the government's annual review of R&amp;D published yesterday. There was also a slight decline in cash terms, from Pounds 12.0bn to Pounds 11.9bn The fall takes the country's R&amp;D expenditure in real terms, adjusting for inflation back to the level of 1985-86. A sharp decline in industrial R&amp;D - caused by recession and defence cuts - accounts for almost all of the overall fall.</p>

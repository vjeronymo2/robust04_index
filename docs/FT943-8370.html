			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers to search for diamonds off the coast of Sierra Leone De Beers is to explore for diamonds on the sea bed off the coast of Sierra Leone. The government has granted the world's biggest diamond group a 15,800 square kilometre concession and De Beers will spend USDollars 3m in the next nine months to survey the sea bed before sampling begins. Another Dollars 10m may be spent, depending on the first results. Via its De Beers Marine subsidiary, the group has developed unique underwater exploration and mining techniques. It is operating off the coasts of Namibia and South Africa at depths of more than 100 metres. Last year De Beers recovered 302,000 carats of diamonds off the Namibian coast, a 16 per cent increase on the 1992 level. The new arrangement takes De Beers back to Sierra Leone for the first time since 1988 when, after 32 years buying and exporting diamonds there, country, it quit, blaming the thriving parallel market and Sierra Leone's liquidity crisis at that time.</p>

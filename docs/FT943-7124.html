			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Council's police force plan criticised Plans by Conservative-controlled Wandsworth council in London to establish a municipal police force to patrol housing estates were criticised yesterday by police organisations. The council is considering extending its parks police patrols to estates, using council staff sworn in by magistrates as constables and exercising powers of arrest. Mr Edward Lister, council leader, said on BBC Radio yesterday that problems such as graffiti and vandalism made residents' lives miserable. The council's plan was not a criticism of the Metropolitan Police. Residents would finance patrols through higher rents or service charges. The Association of Chief Police Officers questioned whether council staff would receive sufficient training. The Police Federation said taxpayers in Wandsworth were already financing a professional police force and should not have to pay again.</p>

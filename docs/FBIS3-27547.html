One of the purposes of my visit is  to introduce the economic situation in China to our Japanese  friends. Market prices of goods and [word indistinct] are all  stable in China. This is a very important year for Japan as  well. Reportedly, the Japanese Government is planning to  stimulate economic growth by introducing several important  measures. It is necessary for Japan and China to exchange  opinions in a timely manner to promote bilateral cooperation.    In response, Chairman Inaba said: When the delegates from  the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry visited China last  year, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji made a proposal for us to send a  delegation to China each year. We accepted the proposal and  decided to visit cities in the central and western regions of  China this year.    Moreover, in his meeting with Keidanren Chairman Gaishi  Hiraiwa, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said that Keidanren has been  rendering great services to the development of economic  relations between Japan and China for a long time.    Regarding the economic situation in China, Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji stated: Many reform measures were introduced in China  early this year. These measures were enacted on the basis of  Deng Xiaoping's idea of constructing a socialism which reflects  the characteristics of China. They have been implemented  smoothly in the past 50 days or so. Because of this, we have  deepened our confidence in our effort to promote reform. In our  economic measures, we introduced the experiences of the  developed countries, including Japan.    In response, Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa said: Japan is very  much interested in the Chinese economy. Keidanren formed the  Chinese Committee in May last year. Its purpose is to develop  trade relations with China.</p>

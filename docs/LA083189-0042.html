			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: MASTER'S LANDS GREER FOR MEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Damon Greer, a former Cleveland High guard, has enrolled at The Master's  College and will be eligible to play basketball this season.  </P> <P> Greer was one of 10 San Jose State players who quit the team last season to  protest what they considered unfair treatment by Coach Bill Berry.  </P> <P> Dedan Thomas, an All-Valley point guard at Taft High last year, has enrolled at  Antelope Valley College.  </P> <P> Thomas signed a letter of intent with UNLV but enrolled at Antelope Valley last  week when he failed to meet the core-curriculum requirements of the NCAA's  Proposition 48. He is expected to attend UNLV next season.  </P> <P> Scott Piri, the leading scorer for the Cal State Northridge soccer team last  season, is expected to miss Saturday night's exhibition match against USC  because of a pulled groin muscle.  </P> <P> Piri, who had a team-high 12 goals and 31 points as a freshman, did not play in  Saturday's 2-1 exhibition loss to UCLA at North Campus Stadium after suffering  the injury during Friday's practice.  </P> <P> "It's nothing serious," Coach Marwan Ass'ad said. "But we don't want to take a  chance on anything this early in the season."  </P> <P> Doug Huff, an offensive lineman at Pierce College, will undergo surgery later  this week to repair a chronically dislocated shoulder and will not play this  season.  </P> <P> Huff (6-foot-2, 240 pounds), projected as the starting center, will be replaced  by tackle Darren Spence (6-2, 280).  </P> <P> Warren Johnson (6-2, 240), Myron Prouche (6-1, 260) and Bobby Kyman (6-5, 235)  will compete for Spence's vacated position.  </P></p>

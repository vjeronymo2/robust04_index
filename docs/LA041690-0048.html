			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE DIDN'T WANT SCOUTING TRIP TO END UP A FLASH IN THE PAN  </P> <P> When Cincinnati Manager Lou Piniella took the Reds into Houston last week, it  was only the second time he had been in the Astrodome.  </P> <P> He told Peter Schmuck of the Baltimore Sun that the first time was two years  ago when New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner sent him there on a secret  mission to scout Kevin Bass for a possible deal.  </P> <P> Piniella: "George wanted me to sit in left field with an old hat, a pair of  glasses and a raincoat.  </P> <P> "I said, 'George, they'll throw me out of the stadium.'  </P> <P> "He said, 'What do you mean?'  </P> <P> "I said, 'It's a domed stadium!' "  </P> <P> Add baseball notebook: Schmuck excerpted the following from a profile of  pitcher Bryn Smith in the St. Louis Cardinal media guide: "Bryn's parents met  while working at the old RKO Studios in Hollywood. They were introduced by  actress Jane Russell after his mother, Meg, had been dating Cary Grant. Bryn is  a big fan of the rock group Rush and credits lead singer Geddy Lee with helping  him to handle crowds, a lesson he picked up after joining the group on tour for  a week following the 1984 season."  </P> <P> Schmuck: "Is this for real?"  </P> <P> Trivia time: What do Pie Traynor, Pee Wee Reese and Pete Reiser have in common?  </P> <P> He delivers: How good a clutch hitter is Will Clark? Here are some 1989  statistics on the San Francisco slugger from the Elias Baseball Analyst: He hit  .526 with men in scoring position and the Giants down by a run. He hit .426  with men in scoring position and the score tied. He hit .431 against the NL's  10 pitchers with the lowest earned-run averages. His .472 postseason average  was the third highest since 1969. (Brooks Robinson hit .485 in 1970 and Thurman  Munson .475 in 1976.)  </P> <P> Triple whammy: Anyone notice that a tradition was preserved when Raymond Floyd  lost the Masters? On the Wednesday before the Masters, Floyd won the annual  par-three tournament. No winner of that tournament has ever won the Masters.  </P> <P> Pick-me-up: Denver Nugget Coach Doug Moe has taken some flak for his disheveled  look, but San Antonio Coach Larry Brown, a longtime friend, thinks it's great.  </P> <P> "When things aren't looking good," Brown says, "you can always look at Doug and  make yourself feel good."  </P> <P> 55 years ago today: On April 16, 1935, 40-year-old Babe Ruth made his National  League debut for the Boston Braves. He homered and singled off Carl Hubbell to  lead the Braves to a 4-2 victory over the New York Giants.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The same first name, Harold.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller, asked if the shortened spring  training has hurt the pitchers: "If you can't get in shape in three weeks, you  should be a plumber." HARLEY TINKHAM  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- Large units of Serbian  military forces have engaged in a series of military exercises  in the villages of Dubovc, Galice, and Mikushnice of Vushtrri,  apparently to train troops for combat in populated areas,  according to reports of the Council for the Defence of Human  Rights and Freedoms from Prishtina. Mass concentrations of  Serbian military forces and their movement have created a tense  situation in the above said villages and regions around, because  Serbian soldiers are also using fire weapons during the  exercises.    The "Azem Bejtja" School yard in Dubovc, its grounds as well  as the territories of the former mine have turned into areas  mined by the Serbian soldiers, creating hazards for the  Albanians residing in these areas. Situations of this kind have  also been created in Skenderaj, with dozens of Serbian soldiers  and their dogs standing in front of the houses of Mikushice's  inhabitants shooting incessantly with fire weapons.    The Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms  also  reports that about 300 Serbian troops have engaged in military  exercises with mechanised means in Sibovc of the Podujeve  commune. Military concentrations have been noticed recently also  in Necavc, near Hani i Elezit, with soldiers openly provoking  Albanians and grabbing their cattle.    The mass concentrations of military troops and their  engagement in exercises show of an escalation of military  tension, besides that of the police, which are of dangerous  consequences not only for the inhabitants of the said areas but  also of the areas beyond. This also testifies to the fact that  now, with the Kosova question being on the agenda of the  international organisations to solve it through peaceful ways,  Belgrade is determined to follow the track of war.</p>

Liu said, "for Hubei, the massive Three Gorges project on  the  Chang Jiang river, the project to divert water from its Danjiang  reservoir to north China, and the opening of Wuhan and Huangshi  cities, present good opportunities for an economic takeoff."    Liu, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military  Commission,  expressed the view at a group discussion by Hubei deputies to  the National People's Congress now in session in Beijing.    He expressed the belief that Hubei can certainly achieve  faster economic growth so long as its 56 million people work  hard and properly handle relations between reform, development  and stability.    According to Hubei Provincial governor Jia Zhijie, Hubei's  gross domestic product topped 100 billion yuan last year.    New reform measures taken by the central government since  the  beginning of this year involve the readjustment of interests,  and that makes it imperative to properly handle the interest of  the whole and those of the part, Liu said.</p>

In the meantime, an overseas-based P-3 anti-submarine plane  flown to the sky above the east coastal waters of South Korea  carried out a sea reconnaissance and an exercise of strike at  submarines by mines, torpedoes and depth bombs, escorted by  formations of pursuit planes.    On the 25th, the U.S. imperialists deployed Okinawa-based  formations of F-15s in the Osan Air Force Base, South Korea. On  the 24th, they brought F-18a pursuit-assault planes to the  Kunsan Air Force Base, South Korea, from the Yokosuka Base of  Japan. The U.S. imperialists on March 25 staged an exercise of  surprise bombing strikes at ground targets and an aerial attack  exercise in the skies above Tokjok islet, Pyongchang and Tanyang  areas of South Korea in coordination with war planes flown from  overseas bases and those belonging to the U.S. Air Force present  in South Korea and the puppet air force.    The South Korean puppets on March 24 and 25 drove dozens of  armoured cars and heavily armed puppet army troops in a war  gamble in the areas of Kimpo and Paju Counties, and Cholwon  County in South Korean Kangwon Province.    On the 25th, they sent 20 odd fighter planes of the puppet  army to the sky above the areas of Paju and Ryonchon, and  Cholwon and Rinje of South Korean Kangwon Province, which are  adjacent to the demilitarized zone and staged exercises of  missile strike at ground targets and airlifting operation.    Such war exercises staged at a time when the aggression  forces of the U.S. Pacific Fleet are moving toward waters close  to the Korean peninsula and the U.S. forces in Japan are ready  for action in "an event of contingency" prove that the new war  provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets against the northern half of the country are entering  into a more grave stage.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Tuesday started holding separate talks with other  party leaders in the ruling coalition to seek agreement on  reshuffling his cabinet, possibly on Thursday.    Hosokawa has been trying to get rid of Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the top government spokesman and  leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), for openly challenging his plans  to introduce a national welfare tax, political sources said.    "The prime minister said he would like to carry out a  cabinet  reshuffle if conditions permit," Takemura said at an afternoon  press conference, adding he reiterated his opposition to a  cabinet change.    The sources said the two men also have been at odds over the  course of the seven-party coalition, with Hosokawa favoring  closer ties with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito and  Takemura against it. [passage omitted containing previously  filed material]    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama restated his opposition to an  immediate reshuffle, saying Diet passage of the national budget  for fiscal 1994 beginning April 1 should be the top priority.    "It is necessary to have the budget passed through the Diet  as quickly as possible," he told a news conference. He said  Hosokawa "should restrain himself and avoid a cabinet shake-up  at this time."    Hosokawa is scheduled to deliver his policy speech to the  Diet on Friday, and sources close to the 56-year-old premier  said he hopes to reshuffle his near seven-month-old cabinet by  then.    Hosokawa and his supporters in the coalition reportedly  favor  replacing Takemura in addition to Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii due to a money scandal and International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai because of a dispute with  bureaucrats over the firing of Masahisa Naito, chief of the  ministry's industrial policy bureau.    Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning  Agency, is also likely to be relieved of her duties, sources  said.    Murayama of the SDP, the largest force in the coalition,  said  he will reiterate his opposition to an early cabinet reshuffle  when he meets with Hosokawa later Tuesday. He said it should  wait until after the budget program wins Diet approval.    The SDP chief predicted Hosokawa will eventually have to  give  up his plan for an immediate changeover.    Asked what he would do if asked to join a new cabinet,  Murayama replied that he has not given serious thought to such a  possibility, saying, "I haven't heard any such proposal at all."    Hosokawa told a House of Representatives panel on political  reform that the government has time to change the cabinet  because it has overcome its most difficult tasks -- political  reform and completing the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.    Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Social Democratic Party's Diet  affairs committee, told a news conference the SDP opposes a  reshuffle. "We believe now is not an appropriate time," he said.    He also said it is better to wait until after the Diet  approves the fiscal 1994 state budget, expected in early May.    Hosokawa formed the cabinet last August to carry out  political reforms, and apparently thinks the cabinet will have  accomplished its purpose when amendments to the political reform  legislation are approved by the Diet on Thursday or Friday, the  sources said. The legislation was enacted in January.    Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata said he understands moves to  remove Takemura from his present post, adding that a party head  assuming the post of chief cabinet secretary has a difficulty in  helping a prime minister as a close aide in the coalition  government.    Hata, who is also deputy prime minister and foreign  minister,  said party leaders do not necessarily share the prime minister's  views, as they belong to different parties.    For his part, Hata flatly denied he will assume the post of  chief cabinet secretary.</p>

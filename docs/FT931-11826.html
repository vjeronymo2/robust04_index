			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK building societies Lower short-term interest rates are a mixed blessing for UK building societies. While easy money could inject life into the housing market and stem the flow of repossessions, it is starting to cause difficulties on the funding side. Last year saw a net inflow of only Pounds 295m, although deposit balances rose by Pounds 12bn thanks to interest credited. With base rates now at 6 per cent and likely to fall further, it is easy to imagine a net outflow occuring in 1993. Doubtless the government would be happy if some of this money finds its way into the gilts market. It might have second thoughts if the building societies were left unable to finance any revival in the housing market. The societies appear squeezed. If they keep savings rates high to protect their deposit base, they must either slow the reduction in mortgage rates or forfeit margin. If the mortgage rate is held artificially high, other lenders like banks will steal market share. The societies could press for regulatory permission to raise more funds in the wholesale markets, but that would not help their margins. Besides, if they seek much extra money from the bond markets, they might find themselves paying a premium. The dilemma facing the societies is thus what price they are prepared to pay for market share of both retail deposits and mortgage lending. One way they will probably fight back is by offering longer-dated investment products, say two year bonds. These would allow them to retain customers anxious to move out along the yield curve in search of a higher return. The funds could be used to match the fixed rate mortgages they are increasingly offering. They might even have some left to invest in gilts. That would help cover the PSBR if the government relaxed its full funding rule. Seeking the societies' collaboration in this way might be one way of avoiding another unseeming confrontation over the pricing of national savings products.</p>

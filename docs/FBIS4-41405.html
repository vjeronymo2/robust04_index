			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- The intention of Russian  journalists to adopt a code of professional ethics "inspires  confidence that democracy is alive and kicking," Federation  Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said when speaking today at a  congress of Russian journalists. Stressing that the political  freedom of the media is sealed in the Constitution, he  reaffirmed that the economic situation places dependence on  journalists. Many political groups, who, via financial  institutions and banks are trying to take the press in hand, are  rushing to take advantage of this. According to Vladimir  Shumeyko, they are being driven by the desire to create their  own image in the run-up to the presidential elections. There  are a large number of claimants to the seat of president.    The head of the Federation Council said that the upper  chamber of parliament stands for protecting the rights of  journalists and their economic independence. He said that the  state is committed to giving tax benefits to the "fourth  estate," for "one cannot equate the media with consumer goods  production."    Vladimir Shumeyko also noted that it is precisely  journalists  who must become one of the creators of a nation concept which  would unite Russians, would fill a spiritual vacuum and inspire  confidence in tomorrow. With such an idea, economic problems  would be solved much more effectively, Vladimir Shumeyko said.</p>

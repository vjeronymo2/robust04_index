Manuylov, cand. biol. sci., Moscow]    [Abstract] Intravenous administration of a solution  prepared by perfusing pig liver with physiologic saline  significantly was shown to reduce mortality of mice and dogs  with experimental sepsis due Staphylococcus aureus injections.  Based on these results, analogous trials were conducted on 45  male and female patients, 16-73 years old, with life-threatening  pyoseptic conditions. The infusions were prepared by using  dextran, 10% glucose or autogenous blood to perfuse the  porcine  spleen. The therapeutic regimen consisted of 400-500 ml (2-4  ml/min drop-wise) of the solution given 1-6 times at 1-5 day  intervals, 2-8 days after a surgical intervention. The  beneficial effects of xenogeneic splenic therapy were most  pronounced in 28 patients with destructive appendicites,  cholecystitis and purulent peritonitis. Only 3 (10.8%)  patients  in that category died vs. a 26.7% mortality rate in 15  control  patients. In general, this therapeutic approach was least  beneficial in patients with necrosis of the pancreas. However,  the overall impression of this form of therapy remains a  positive one and the benefits seem to result from detoxication  and enhancement of immune reserves by bioactive splenic  substances. The therapy is most beneficial when instituted early  (12-48 h) in the disease process. Complications in the form of  fever and chills were noted in 10% of the cases and  readily  controlled by antihistaminics and analgesics.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA believes that the 20.7 mpg standard balances the potentially serious adverse economic consequences for GM that could result from a higher standard with the potential for increased petroleum savings. The agency concludes, in view of the statutory requirement to consider specified factors, that the relatively small and uncertain energy savings associated with setting a standard above GM's capability would not justify the potential harm to that company and the economy as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consumer Alert and CEI requested that NHTSA consider the safety effects of its decision. Those commenters stated that the agency should not in any way avoid analyzing the potential safety consequences of a decision to increase the CAFE standards for light trucks. Consumer Alert and CEI cited the record of NHTSA's rulemaking concerning the MY 1990 passenger car CAFE standard, although they recognized that the safety consequences of a decision to raise the CAFE standard for light trucks may differ somewhat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the context of passenger car CAFE standards, NHTSA has recognized that CAFE standards could adversely affect safety to the extent that they result in significant reductions in car size and/or weight. This issue was discussed at length in the agency's notice terminating rulemaking on the MY 1990 passenger car CAFE standard (see 58 FR 6939, February 3, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An analysis of the extent to which significantly higher light truck CAFE standards could affect safety is more complex than for passenger car standards, since purchasers would have many more options for substitution (e.g., different kinds of light trucks, trucks with a high enough GVWR that they are not subject to CAFE standards, etc.) The agency notes that since light trucks are generally significantly larger and heavier than passenger cars, any safety effects of a particular weight reduction would likely be smaller than for cars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While NHTSA recognizes that significantly higher light truck CAFE standards could adversely affect safety, to the extent that they resulted in significant reductions in light truck size and/or weight, the available evidence indicates that MYs 1996&hyph;97 standard of 20.7 mpg will not have any impact on safety. NHTSA notes that, in setting the light truck CAFE standards for recent model years, the agency did not include in its analyses of manufacturer capabilities any product plan actions that would significantly affect the weight, size or cost of the vehicles the manufacturers planned to offer. The agency also notes that the average equivalent test weight of light trucks has increased from 3,805 pounds in MY 1984 to 4,169 pounds in MY 1992. Therefore, NHTSA believes that CAFE standards during this period have not had any measurable effect on light truck weight or size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also notes that the levels of the light truck CAFE standards have not varied significantly for more than a decade. The light truck CAFE standards for MY 1987&hyph;89 and MY 1994 were set at 20.5 mpg, and, as far back as MY 1984, the standard was 20.0 mpg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA therefore believes that the size and weight of current and planned light trucks are not significantly different from what would have occurred in the absence of CAFE standards. As discussed above, Ford and Chrysler will exceed the level of the 20.7 mpg standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 without making any changes in their product plans. While GM will need to make some changes in its product plan to achieve a CAFE of 20.7 mpg, the agency does not believe that it is necessary, or likely, for that company to take actions that would have any adverse effect on safety, in order to achieve that CAFE level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated above, in determining that GM can achieve MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels of 20.7 mpg, NHTSA adjusted GM's projected CAFE level of 20.5 mpg based on several factors. First, the agency adjusted it upward to reflect more realistic mix assumptions with respect to 4WD market share and maintaining market share of certain more fuel-efficient vehicles. Since this adjustment simply reflects the agency's judgment of what GM is likely to be able to sell, based on historical experience, the adjustment does not induce or compel any actions with safety implications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA also concluded that GM can improve its projected MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE by a slight reduction in vehicle performance. This would involve changes in such things as axle ratios. The agency believes that a slight reduction in performance would not have any adverse safety consequences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the agency concluded that GM could improve its MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE by increasing the penetration of some engine and transmission technology improvements that are not projected for full implementation. This action would not result in reduced vehicle weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the 20.7 mpg light truck CAFE standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 will not lead to significant reductions in light truck size or weight, or shifts toward less safe vehicles, the agency concludes that it is not likely to have any impact on safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII.

This rulemaking was reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The agency's detailed analysis of the economic effects is set forth in a Regulatory Evaluation, copies of which are available from the Docket Section. The contents of that analysis are generally described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

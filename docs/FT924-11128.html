			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Stockholm SE unveils privatisation plan THE STOCKHOLM Stock Exchange yesterday broke new ground when it announced plans to privatise and operate on a fully commercial basis from the start of next year. Mr Bengt Ryden, the exchange's president, said: 'It is probably a unique international event to have a stock exchange publishing a prospectus for its own privatisation.' The move was first signalled by the Swedish government earlier this year and is part of a wider shake-up which will remove the bourse's monopoly over share trading from January 1 1993. Mr Ryden said the exchange's new status would improve efficiency and ensure it was well placed to respond to competition. A new share issue will form part of the conversion process, raising SKr30m (Dollars 5m) through the issue of 250,000 shares at SKr120 each. The 350 companies and other organisations associated with the exchange are being given the opportunity to become its new owners, with allocations being carried out on the basis of the sum of exchange fees paid since 1988. This will result in the largest owners being the leading banks - SE Banken, Nordbanken and Handelsbanken - Volvo and the Swedish National Debt Office, with a combined holding of more than 30 per cent. Next year there will be some restrictions on trading in the new shares, but from 1994 they will be freely tradeable. Like many of the companies it lists, the performance of the bourse will from now on be measured in terms of ratios and rates of return. To help eligible investors make up their minds, it indicated that pro-forma profits for 1992 would amount to SKr10m. The price/earnings ratio is 4.2 and the equity/assets target is 40 per cent. There will be no dividend this year. It also warned that 'during the next few years, considerable investments in information technology are anticipated.' The first hint of a rights issue? Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food conglomerate, is bidding for the minority shares in Pierrel, the Italian pharmaceutical group. Procordia, which already owns 72 per cent of Pierrel, is offering just over SKr100m (Dollars 17m) for the rest of the company. This equates to L2,150 for each voting share and L1,150 for each non-voting share. Earlier this year, Procordia paid SKr500m, or L2,650 per voting share, to buy its current stake from Fermenta, the Swedish industrial group. Pierrel's voting shares were trading at around L1,600 and its non-voting shares at around L600 when they were suspended, pending yesterday's announcement, on the Milan and Turin stock exchanges last week. The formal tender for the shares will take place between November 4 and 11.</p>

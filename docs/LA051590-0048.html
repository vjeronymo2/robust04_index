			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: LAKE CASITAS;  </P> <P> WATER CUSTOMERS TO PAY ABOUT 8% MORE  </P> <P> Casitas water bills are scheduled to rise an average of 8.2% after July 1,  according to the proposed 1990-91 budget for the Casitas Municipal Water  District.  </P> <P> The average residential bimonthly water rate would go up $2 from the current  figure of $27.14, district Auditor Ron Morse said.  </P> <P> This is in addition to the 2.75% increase adopted last month.  </P> <P> The district supplies water to 2,400 residential customers and 400 other users,  including the city of Ventura. The other agencies could pass on the rate  increases to their customers.  </P> <P> The scheduled increase, which is expected to raise $258,000, is needed to  offset the cost of inflation in water deliveries, said district General Manager  John Johnson. The earlier rate increase was needed to cover future operating  costs for a new water treatment plant.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, residential rates would go up 5% for those who use less  than 7,500 gallons a month and 10% for those who use more. Commercial and  agricultural rates would rise between 6.5% and 10%, depending upon the category  of service.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the district board is expected to consider the rate increase and  schedule a public hearing on it.

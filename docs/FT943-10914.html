			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rally in coffee futures mystifies London traders Coffee futures rose strongly in New York and London yesterday, but traders were casting about for justification. 'It's a bit of a mystery to me quite why it's proceeding in a northerly direction,' admitted one London-based trader. Volumes were fairly thin and traders turned to charts to explain the rise, saying the New York September contract appeared to have found support at 200 cents a pound, while 'for the moment' London's second position seemed keen to stay above the Dollars 3,300 a tonne reached on July 1 between the two Brazilian frosts. The November robusta position in London opened sharply higher and ended just off its highs at Dollars 3,493 a tonne, up Dollars 140. In afternoon trading in New York, the December position was up 9.20 cents at 215.20 cents a pound. One factor in the market was renewed concern about the quality of Brazilian coffee stocks, after roasters bought up only about half the stocks offered at auction last Friday. This gave some support to suggestions by the US Department of Agriculture that only about 9m bags of Brazil's 17m-bag stockpile might be fit for consumption. Running counter to this, some traders expressed scepticism about the Brazilian government's estimate last week that 11m bags of next year's crop, or 40 per cent, might have been affected by the frost. Independent estimates have ranged from 6m to 9m bags.</p>

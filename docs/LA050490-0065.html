			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE  </P> <P> Just Getting to Know You, Every Little Thing About You  </P> <P> Check out the 17-page, 58-item questionnaire given to prospective jurors in the  criminal case of the United States of America vs. Richard T. Silberman.  </P> <P> This baby's got it all: short-answer questions, fill-in-the-blank questions,  yes-no questions, do-you-know-these- people questions, what-about-this  questions, even essay questions.  </P> <P> All to be completed "under penalty of perjury."  </P> <P> I've seen loan applications that weren't as long. The last time I took a test  this complex, I got three units of upper-division credit.  </P> <P> The questionnaire asks about education, spouse, offspring, work  responsibilities, reading and viewing habits, familiarity with law enforcement  and the courts, knowledge of high finance, general mind-set and name  recognition of 115 players in the upcoming drama.  </P> <P> I half expected a question about heavy petting on a first date.  </P> <P> Rita Hanscom, associate professor of law at National University, says jury  questionnaires are increasing, particularly in heavy headline trials. She  studies these things and does a public seminar with former jurors each year for  Law Week.  </P> <P> She says questionnaires are a good, but not infallible, way to spot the  media-bespoiled juror or the rogue who will refuse to deliberate.  </P> <P> And she says most jurors don't mind giving out information: "I've heard jurors  say they feel cheated if don't get asked about themselves."  </P> <P> Don't get me wrong: I'm not a privacy nut. That's a short slide to paranoia.  </P> <P> Maybe what chaps my lips about the Silberman questionnaire is that it brings  out the latent Mad magazine in me. Take question 33:  </P> <P> "Have you or has any member of your immediate family ever been employed by a  brokerage or securities dealer?"  </P> <P>  No, but I had an Uncle Chick who loved to play the horses. I inherited his  view of risky financial ventures.  </P> <P>  "I hope I break even today," he said on his way to the track, "I can sure use  the money."  </P> <P>  Conclusion: I don't think I'd be a very good juror.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Food for Thought  </P> <P> Everywhere you look.  </P> <P> * Student activism 1990.  </P> <P> Students at San Diego State University will take part in a "rotating fast" for  35 days to protest spraying pesticides on crops.  </P> <P> Each day, a different student will go without eating. At day's end, the faster  can flee to the cafeteria.  </P> <P> * Big-time auctioneer Rick Cole comes to San Diego on Saturday to handle the  sale of 85 vintage/import/muscle cars at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Viewing starts at noon, bidding at 6 p.m. It's part of the 2nd annual Roger  Ward Invitational Historic Grand Prix.  </P> <P> Cole of North Hollywood is called whenever the stuff is expensive and the  bidding is fierce.  </P> <P> His last trip to San Diego was in November, 1984: To auction off booty from the  collapse of J. David &amp; Co.  </P> <P> * The May edition of Sunset magazine has a full-color spread on San Diego, the  "Air Capital of the United States."  </P> <P> The prose and pictures promote the second Air/Space America show, which was  shot down sometime after the magazine's deadline. Oops.  </P> <P> </P> <P> For Gringo Employers  </P> <P> Carlsbad writer Sharon Prosser has just published "Spanish on the Job," a  107-page handbook for North County residents who want to hire migrants for  construction, landscaping, restaurant work or housekeeping.  </P> <P> She bills it as a good way to learn to communicate without "tiresome Spanish  dictionaries, time-consuming Spanish lessons, etc."  </P> <P> Among the key words and phrases in the mixed grammatical effort:  </P> <P> * Can you prune? (Puede podar?)  </P> <P> * You will have Sunday off. (Descansaras los domingos.)  </P> <P> * Clean this up. (Limpia esto.)  </P> <P> * Are you legal? (Tienes papeles?)  </P> <P> * The barbecue (la barbacoa).  </P> <P> * Pay attention. (Ponga atencion.)  </P> <P> * Social Security number (numero de seguro social).  </P> <P> * Bark chips (los pedazos de corteza).  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Britain and France may fund new fighter project BRITISH AEROSPACE and Dassault Aviation of France expect to receive funding from their governments to study co-operation on a future generation of fighter aircraft. The companies have been discussing possible collaboration for about two years, it emerged yesterday. A senior Dassault executive said: 'In the coming months we will make joint proposals to our two governments to secure study contracts so that we can prepare for the future together.' Revival of Anglo-French co-operation would not affect the two fighter jets in which the companies are separately involved, the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) and the Rafale. Both are due to be in service in the late 1990s. France took part in the early stages of the EFA project before breaking off in 1985 because of different requirements and arguments about project leadership. This left the UK to develop the Dollars 20bn-plus EFA with Germany, Italy and Spain. France is developing the lighter-weight Rafale on its own. A new generation is not expected before 2020. The renewed contacts are believed to have been instigated by the French and British defence ministries in the belief that Europe cannot afford more than one project. BAe said it had been holding talks with Dassault on 'specific technologies'. These 'could be applied to some future project beyond EFA and Rafale in line with the wishes of both governments for closer industrial co-operation in the defence field'. It added that it was also discussing sharing technologies with McDonnell Douglas of the US, its partner in the Harrier II jump-jet, and Saab-Scania of Sweden. Dassault made clear that its co-operation with BAe could be extended to other European companies. Deutsche Aerospace, a partner of BAe in EFA, wants to use the EFA consortium as the basis for forming a combined European military aircraft group which could eventually bring in Dassault. Prospects for Dassault continuing on its own have dwindled in recent years as its military aircraft exports have dried up and the French government has cut equipment spending.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Arts: A spectacular Perestroika - Theatre Like Proust or Anthony Powell's sequence of novels, A Dance to the Music of Time, Tony Kushner's epic play Angels in America is not something you should begin in the middle. You should also remember the sub-title. This is A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, not the history of America. Even so, there is a lot of American history in this riveting seven-hour drama. Part One, Millennium Approaches, opened on the Royal National Theatre's Cottesloe stage in January last year, and was magnificent. It has now been revived as splendidly as ever. It is accompanied by Part Two, Perestroika, which initially at least is a disappointment. That is a view which one rapidly revises as the play goes on. By the end, the whole of Angels in America is a wonderful theatrical achievement. One of the problems with Part Two, as Kushner admits, is that he thought of the title before he wrote the piece. 'I had this wild-eyed notion that Gorbachev was going to make the world a different place and bring about the advent of democratic socialism,' he has said in an interview. The real perestroika has not quite worked out like that, but Kushner kept the title because Gorbachev claimed that his job was simply 'to make change irreversible'. Keeping the Soviet background leads to a strange opening. Perestroika begins with a speech by the last surviving Bolshevik in the Kremlin in 1986. It is delivered by Harry Towb, the same actor who starts Part One as an American rabbi at an obscure funeral. Any attempt at parallelism between American and Russian history is quickly abandoned. There are some later references to Chernobyl (as reported to America by the World Service of the BBC) but for the main we return to the original characters. The surprise here is that the two principal victims of Aids in Millennium Approaches are still alive. Indeed, apart from the Russian interlude, Part Two picks up more or less where Part One left off. There is a trip to heaven as Perestroika goes on, but it seems to be on a return ticket, and even at the end one of the Aids sufferers survives with the hope of another five years. No-one can say that Kushner is a pessimist: he even includes the New World Symphony. What do they do all the time? They talk, make love, fall out, then talk again. Apart from the state of America, Angels has three main subjects. One is Aids, another is Roy Cohn, an adviser to Senator McCarthy who died of the disease in 1986, and the third is religion in general and Mormonism in particular. The common thread is homosexuality. The period is broadly the Reagan presidency, even if Cohn seems a throwback. In the gay community, it is more of a shock that a young married Mormon should admit to voting Republican than that he should be a closet gay. To Americans, however, the biggest shock must have been the discovery of Cohn's illness. Here was the most rabid right-winger of the lot, claiming to have been responsible for sending the Rosenbergs to the electric chair, exposed as a homosexual with a disease that had then scarcely been identified. He threatened to sue his doctor if he diagnosed anything more than cancer of the liver. Cohn is magnificently played in both parts by David Schofield. The young Mormon who has no difficulty in sleeping with him is Daniel Craig. But this is a complex set of relationships, almost as if several plays were going at once. At the heart of it is the affair between Prior Walter (Stephen Dillane) and Louis ('my friends call me Louise'), the lover played by Jason Isaacs, who abandons Walter when the latter's Aids is discovered. The scene at the end of Part One where they waltz together is almost unbearably moving. Few of the lovers are monogamous. A gay black nurse called Belize (Joseph Mydell) shows how easy it is to come and go. There are also sub-strands involving the Mormon's pill-popping wife and mother. All of these parts are superbly acted. Yet it is not really the subject that makes Angels work. It is the nature of the dialogue and the quick shifting from one scene to another. Kushner is a master of one-liners, moving from quotations from Shakespeare to popular songs within the same sentence. Even in the most intense episodes, there is a burst of wit. The staging of some of the set pieces is spectacular. Note the smart restaurant scene when Cohn is trying to persuade his Mormon friend to commit perjury, and a similar scene at a bar. The immaculate direction is by Declan Donnellan and the design by Nick Ormerod. In repertory, Cottesloe Theatre, (071) 928 2252</p>

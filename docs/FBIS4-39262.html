			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Parliamentary Chronicle" feature] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Kiev, 31 May </H5>   The first speech at the morning sitting of the parliament  was  delivered by the President of Turkey, who was warmly welcomed by  the MP's. The President of Turkey stressed that his country  pays a special importance to the question of the Ukraine's  territorial integrity. After that the session continued its  work on forming the parliamentary standing committees. The  deputies received the list of candidates for heads of the  parliamentary committees, which immediately pushed  representatives of the parliamentary factions to the  microphones. There was the preliminary agreement to vote for  the heads of parliamentary committees by the list, but now some  deputies found surprises there. The right-oriented deputies  said that their proposals were not included in full and the  quotas were violated. In particular, the list included more  representatives of the group "Ednist" (Unity) and agrarians than  it was before. There were remarks that the list was prepared  not in accordance with the principle of professionalism, but on  the party principle, and that is why it could not be adopted for  voting. The left-oriented representatives insisted on voting  for the list as a whole. After the break the deputies approved  the list of heads of standing committees by the majority of  votes. Speaker of the parliament Oleksandre Moroz made a speech  on the tasks for the Supreme Council and the parliamentary  standing committees. Then the parliament worked on the draft  regulations for the Supreme Council, which was adopted in its  initial wording.  <H5>  Kiev, 1 June </H5>   How to regulate the situation in the Crimea was the first  question on the agenda after the parliamentary standing  committees were formed. President Kravchuk made a speech before  the MP's on this subject. Giving an analysis of the recent  events in the peninsular and actions undertaken by the Crimea's  leaders, President Kravchuk said: "Ignoring the constitutional  demands and Ukrainian laws is not a simple mistake, but a  strategy of the Crimea's present leaders and the party, which  came to power in the Crimea. This strategy is aimed at the  complete separation from Ukraine, with further joining to  Russia." The President of Ukraine submitted to the parliament  the proposals on how to manage the situation in the Crimea,  which are based on a clear and stable position: The Crimea was  and must be an integrative part of Ukraine. All illegal  resolutions and decisions recently taken by the leaders of the  Crimea must be cancelled and brought into accord with the  Ukrainian Constitution and laws. Mr. Kravchuk answered to the  questions of the MP's. After an extensive discussion the  Supreme Council of Ukraine took the Resolution "Fulfillment of  the Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 24 February  1994 "Status of the Autonomic Republic of Crimea According to  the President Ukrainian Constitution and Laws" and the  Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994  "Termination of Validity of the Law of the Republic of Crimea  "Re-Establishment of Constitutional Grounds for the Statehood of  the Republic of Crimea". [quotation marks as received] The  resolution was adopted with 202 votes after the long-lasting  discussion.  <H5>  Kiev, 2 June </H5>   At the beginning of the morning sitting the Supreme Council  adopted the Resolution "Amendment in Wording of Item 4 of the  Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "Fulfillment of the  Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994  "Termination of Validity of the Law of the Republic of Crimea  "Reestablishment of Constitutional Grounds for the Statehood of  the Republic of Crimea." [quotation marks as received] Deputy  from Bukovina Heorhiy Filipchuk was elected the Head of the  Committee for Ecology, who was proposed to this post by  Vyacheslav Chornovil as a candidate from Rukh. The Ukrainian  President's letter on the 26 June elections evoked great  interest and extensive discussion. According to one of MP's from  Zaporizhya, this question was a "cross-road" for many opinions.  The majority, judging from the speeches, were for the elections  to be held at the appointed date. Other deputies proposed to  prepare the respective legislative base and then to hold the  elections immediately. Interesting was the opinion to elect the  heads of regional councils at the parliamentary session, but not  by a direct voting, which may lead to 26 "Crimeas" in Ukraine.  Leonid Kravchuk, who participated at the meeting, considers  that the MP's concentrated their attention only on the question  of postponing the elections for the president, but almost  ignored his proposition that, provided the Supreme Council  prepares and adopts the necessary legislative documents before  the date set for the presidential elections, he will not be  against.  <H5>  Kiev, 3 June </H5>   A draft on introduction of amendments and supplements to the  Law of Ukraine "Forming the Local Power and Self-Governing  Organs" was discussed a day before. In particular, this document  provided for canceling the direct elections for heads of local  councils. So this question evoked sharp debates yesterday. But  this position, if adopted, would considerably change the status  of the heads of local councils, in one hand, and the approach to  the regional economic policy, on the other hand. Arguments  "for" and "against" concerning this issue might be considered  logical, if not for the fact that the legal and legislative base  of Ukraine are not ready for the direct elections for heads of  local councils. In particular, there was raised the questions:  If heads of local councils are elected, to whom they will be  subordinate; who will control their activities? Deputies to  local councils must take control over this question, but  meanwhile, the legal acts do not strictly regulate these  positions. So, this was the question under debates. But in  order to cancel the direct elections it is necessary to  introduce a number of amendments and supplements to the current  legislation of Ukraine. And this question was forwarded for  voting. The amendment was not adopted by the majority of votes.  This means that everything remains as it is provided by the law  taken by the last Supreme Council.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Granada Group Granada's shares may have rebounded strongly but they were always likely to flatten out as the market began to worry about the group's continuing growth prospects. The acquisition of Sutcliffe catering group may neatly solve the dilemma. A price tag of Pounds 360m, representing an exit multiple of 18, hardly looks excessive for a company with expansion opportunities. Although the acquisition may only be earnings neutral in its first year it should boost profits thereafter. Granada should gain advantages from joint buying with its motorway services division. It can also apply its proven cost-cutting skills to improving Sutcliffe's somewhat meagre margins. Even so, P&amp;O sold because it feared UK catering was bound to face increasingly tough competition from international competitors. So Granada has some hard pounding ahead.</p>

[Petroven] to replace  Gustavo Roosen, who will continue to head the intervention  committee at Banco Latino.    Giusti entered the oil industry in 1966 through Shell of  Venezuela, which preceded Maraven, S.A. He has held numerous  positions in the areas of production, oil bed engineering, and  planning both in Shell and Maraven.    In the announcement about Giusti's appointment, it was  reported that 2,170,000 barrels of crude oil per day, at an  average price of $13.34 a barrel, were exported from Venezuela  in 1993. In other words, the volume exported in 1993 exceeded  1992 exports by 116,000 barrels daily. It was also said that the  sales of gasoline produced by the subsidiary (?Cyclop) Petroleum  in the United States increased by 7 percent.    In the refineries located on Venezuelan territory, 950,000  barrels of oil were processed daily. The Amuay refinery  processed 440,000 barrels daily; the Cardon refinery, 265,000;  the Palito refinery, 100,000; and the Puerto la Cruz refinery,  141,000 barrels daily. The production of diesel with 0.05  percent sulfur began in the Amuay refinery during this period.  In addition, the Palito refinery started producing oxygenated  gasoline to meet the new environmental demands stipulated by the  U.S. market.    In addition, Rossen, head of the Banco Latino intervention  board, said that a plan to refloat the bank is under way. He  asked the bank's depositors to keep calm.    [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 2340 GMT on 18 March reports that,  according to Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta, President  Caldera on 18 March removed the entire Petroven board of  directors and appointed Giusti].</p>

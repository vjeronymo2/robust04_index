			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KPFK IN HOT WATER AGAIN WITH '1965'?;  </P> <P> RADIO: THE STATION WANTS TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH THE FCC OVER JOHN  WATSON'S PSYCHOSEXUAL DRAMA.  </P> <P> For John G. Watson, his semi-autobiographical, one-person radio drama, "1965,"  is a painful but therapeutic attempt to come to grips with the traumas of his  childhood and the turmoil that marked his life as a gay teen-ager during the  beginnings of the hippie era.  </P> <P> But for KPFK-FM (90.7), "1965" represents something more -- a controversial  program about a sexual issue that could get the station into more hot water  with the Federal Communications Commission. The station is still smarting from  being reprimanded for indecency by the FCC over the August, 1986 airing of  "Jerker," a play that contained four-letter words and explicit descriptions of  homosexual acts.  </P> <P> So the station ran the program by its attorneys. The question was not whether  "1965" should go on the air -- it is a comparatively mild drama with none of  the profanity and sexual descriptions of "Jerker" -- but whether it could be  broadcast early enough to reach the young people for whom it is intended.  </P> <P> The lawyers gave the go-ahead to air it Sunday at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> "The specific descriptions of sexual activity were pretty mild and the language  was tame," said KPFK program director Lucia Chappelle. "But since the whole  play is the psychosexual biography of one person, we were concerned about what  the FCC's reaction to it would be."  </P> <P> She said that there appeared to be "a lot of homophobia" in the FCC's opinions  on what is considered offensive.  </P> <P> Watson's play, which he wrote and performed, is a monologue by an awkward and  troubled gay 18-year-old who committed suicide in 1965. He comes back from the  grave to comment on the events that led to the suicide. He ultimately concludes  that suicide is wrong, and that he killed himself for the wrong reasons.  </P> <P> The subject of gay teen-age suicide is largely ignored by the mainstream media,  said Watson, who went through his own suicidal period in 1965.  </P> <P> More than grappling with his homosexuality, the narrator of "1965" is dealing  with larger issues he can't understand -- an abusive, alcoholic father, a  dysfunctional family, the inability of close friends who are straight to deal  with his homosexuality.  </P> <P> "I wanted it to air at an early hour," the 43-year-old Watson said. "Sure,  there are some references to sex and drugs, but that's just a normal part of  adolescent life. It's dealing with issues that are crucial for adolescents to  understand."  </P> <P> Chappelle and other officials agreed, but it wasn't quite that easy to put  "1965" on at an early hour.  </P> <P> David Salniker, executive director of the nonprofit Pacifica Broadcasting,  KPFK's parent organization, said that federal actions over the past three years  have left no official "safe harbor" for airing programs with sexual references  or descriptions. "It used to be (that) those programs would have to be aired  after 10 p.m.," he said. "Then it was after midnight. But now it's unsure."  </P> <P> Pacifica is awaiting the FCC's decision next month on whether it will enforce a  law approved by Congress in 1987 that would put a 24-hour ban on indecent  broadcasts. The legislation, initiated by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), calls for  penalties of a $10,000 fine and the possibility of two years' imprisonment.  </P> <P> "Now it is our job to review all the material that might come under the FCC's  definition of obscenity, which puts us in a real impossible position," Salniker  said. "It makes us censors, particularly in the presention of poetry and  dramatic works. We never put on shock jocks or titillating material."  </P> <P> On April 16, 1987, the FCC announced that KPFK violated broadcast decency  standards by broadcasting "Jerker," and asked the Justice Department to  prosecute Pacifica. The Justice Department decided against such action.  </P> <P> Since then, KPFK has been sensitive about reviewing materials that might be  considered offensive by the FCC. But station attorneys felt that "1965" would  not be considered indecent.  </P> <P> "They said it fit within the guidelines, and they would be surprised if there  was one complaint," Chappelle said. "That's good, because this needs to be on  at a time when young people can hear it."  </P> <P> The hourlong program will air during a day of KPFK's annual celebration of gay  pride, and will be followed by a panel discussion hosted by Watson on gay teen  suicide.  </P> <P> Watson said that he was pleased with the decision to air the program at 8 p.m:  "Doing this program was very important for me in dealing with important issues,  and I really want it to be heard by as many young people as possible."  </P></p>

According to  reports, during the so-called ceremony for the commencement of  the work for this year held on 3 January, the South Korean  puppet Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said the Army, Navy, and  Air Force should also maintain a strong combat posture in the  new year.    On the same day, Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the joint Chiefs of  Staff, also made bellicose remarks that the military posture  should be rounded off to cope with the North's threat of war,  that a posture of prompt counteraction should be established,  and the like.    The belligerent remarks of the puppet military leaders  [koeroe kunbu udumoridul] in the beginning of the year plainly  revealed their scheme of armed confrontation with us [urirul  pandaehanun muryok taegyol kido], and they are an intolerable  grave challenge to the fellow countrymen who aspire to peace and  reunification of the country. This shows that though they are  apparently talking about dialogue and the exchange of envoys,  the South Korean puppets actually hindered them and are only  pursuing North-South confrontation.    If the South Korean puppets dare to provoke us, we will  definitely [kyoltanko] control the fire with fire and give a  strict punishment [tanhohan chingbol] to the provokers.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> NASDAQ Halts Trading: Trading of Resdel Industries' stock has been halted by  NASDAQ because the telecommunications company did not meet the exchange's net  worth requirements.  </P> <P> Bruce Rossiter, the company's new majority owner, said the stock will be traded  on brokers' "pink sheets" while he appeals the decision with NASDAQ officials.  </P> <P> The appeal is likely to take months, he said.  </P> <P> Rossiter acquired 57% of the financially troubled firm from the Phoenix Group  International in Irvine in late January for a future cash payment of $1 million  to Phoenix.  </P> <P> Resdel has about $17 million in liabilities for back taxes, unpaid  medical-insurance claims and past due payments to suppliers, contractors and  landlords, as well as a $10-million convertible note held by Reliance Insurance  Group in New York.  </P></p>

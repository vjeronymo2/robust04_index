After the investigations, he urged: We should concentrate  energy, strengthen measures, have extremely great determination  and daring, solidly and effectively do our work, and achieve the  reform work of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.  We should quicken the setup of the modern enterprise system and  enliven large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.    During his investigation and study activities in Jinan city,  Jiang Chunyun, respectively, held forums with six enterprises  with better economic results and four enterprises with bigger  difficulties; and also inspected, on the spot, the Jinan [words  indistinct] Corporation, the Jinan No. 2 Printing and Dyeing  Mill, and the Jinan Beer Shareholding Group Company.    At the [words indistinct] corporation, Jiang Chunyun  affirmed  the practice of using foreign capital to conduct technological  transformation and building it into a new-typed new high-tech  enterprise. He said that using foreign capital to conduct  technological transformation is a shortcut to quicken  enterprises' technological progress.    At the Jinan No. 2 printing and dyeing mill that suffers  deficits, Jiang Chunyun inspected, on the spot, the Shandong  handicraft market which was set up after the mill had readjusted  its structures. He praised this mill for transferring two  thirds of its staff members and workers to the tertiary industry  and also affirmed the second pioneering work done by the mill  with 100 years of history.    Jiang Chunyun said: Doing the second pioneering work is a  revolution of vital importance to all money-losing enterprises.  Facing the strained circumstances, we can neither fear  difficulties nor adopt a wait-and-see attitude. We should  pioneer ways by ourselves and tide over the feeling of fearing  difficulties. Instead of waiting for and relying on others'  assistance, we should press forward in the face of difficulties  and rely on reform to seek existence, make development, and  blaze new trails.    On 7 February, Jiang Chunyun visited the Jinan beer  shareholding group company. After hearing the report on the  situation of enterprises in Jinan city and the speeches on  enlivening large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises made  by the provincial and city departments concerned, Jiang Chunyun  pointed out: Enlivening large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises is the key point and the difficult point of reform.  Whether or not the large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises are full of vitality is a matter relating to the  success of reform. Our next-step tasks are to accelerate the  setup of the modern enterprise system, to positively explore new  ways, to proceed from the reality of large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises to solve a series of key fundamental  problems, and to make these enterprises be full of vitality.    To this end, Jiang Chunyun set forth that first of all, we  should achieve the internal reform of large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises.    Jiang Chunyun said: Reforming the property system is a  prerequisite condition for setting up the modern enterprise  system as well as the key point to promote the overall  enterprise reform. Therefore, to promote the reform of the  property system, we should vigorously encourage the  implementation of the shareholding system, positively develop  limited liability companies, and encourage the development of  the state-owned and civilian-run small accounting units. The  enterprises that are hopeless to halt deficits can be auctioned  off and their ownership can be transferred.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: In the course of enlivening large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, the governments at  various levels and the mass departments should streamline the  administration and delegate power to lower levels, resolutely  and thoroughly delegate to lower levels the rights that should  be delegated, and actually realize the turn from direct to  indirect control. We should carry out policies to help  enterprises eliminate the debts payable and to solve the  problems that enterprises bear financial burden in supporting  social undertakings. It is necessary to provide socialized  service; to set up and perfect markets for production factors,  intermediate service organizations, and social insurance  systems; and to actually create fine external conditions for  reforming and developing large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / People: Cook follows Gray's footsteps JP Morgan has found someone to fill the shoes vacated by Robert Gray, one of the best-known figures in the international capital markets business, who left the firm in April to go to HSBC Holdings. Gray's old responsibilities as joint head of European capital markets will be taken on by another Englishman, Joseph Cook, who returns to London after a six-year stint at Morgan's New York office. Cook went to the Big Apple in 1988, the year Morgan got permission to underwrite US domestic bonds, to set up the US syndicate desk. He then ran the North American capital markets operation. Cook is no stranger to the London eurobond scene. Before joining Morgan in 1985, he was part of the so-called 'Orion mafia', having spent 14 years at Orion Royal Bank, then a key player in the eurobond market. He should also be familiar with Gray's shoes; he stepped into a previous pair nine years ago, when he took over from Gray as head of Morgan's fixed-income syndicate desk.</p>

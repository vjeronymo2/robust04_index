			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: CMI hit by weak steel market A SLOWDOWN in world stainless steel production and weak prices caused Consolidated Metallurgical Industries (CMI), the world's second largest ferrochrome producer, to record a small loss in the six months to end-December. CMI, a member of the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, made an attributable loss of R180,000 (Dollars 64,000). This was a considerable improvement over the R14.7m loss the group made in the same period in 1990. Turnover rose by 41 per cent to R143.7m and operating profit improved to R10.4m from a R5.1m loss previously. Interest payments were down, following a R102m rights issue last year, but payment of a R4.3m preference dividend drove the company into loss. Mr David Kovarsky, chairman, said the results were worse than expected because volumes had been down and the group had hoped for a higher price. He added, however, that the group was happy to be keeping its head above water, given the difficult state of the ferrochrome market. Mr Allan Kuhnert, marketing director, said world stainless steel production had dropped 6.6 per cent in the second half of 1991 compared with 1990 levels. No interim dividend was declared.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORT OF HALIFAX OFFERS A MARITIME GOOD FEELING  </P> <P> A summer storm came swirling down, churning up leaves on the sidewalks and  sending umbrellas tumbling.  </P> <P> As sheets of rain obstructed the view, we sought shelter in the nearest  building -- Halifax's central post office. There, a friendly security guard  greeted all the familiar, wet faces passing through the stamp counters. He  spotted us immediately; two unfamiliar faces glancing around.  </P> <P> "Hello, you," he called out. "You must look at the mosaic under your feet of  the famous Bluenose racing schooner."  </P> <P> Stepping back, we gazed at the blue-and-gold tiles designed in the shape of the  sleek yacht, which until then seemed nothing more than fashionable artwork.  </P> <P> "You can see the replica of the original schooner moored at the Privateers'  Wharf," the guard said proudly. "It's only a block away."  </P> <P> Such is street life in Halifax, one of Canada's quaint, out-of-the-way  provincial capitals.  </P> <P> The warmth and friendliness of Nova Scotia is not lost here, but in a province  known more for its craggy shoreline and hideaway inlets, Halifax is a haven for  maritime history buffs.  </P> <P> Nestled on a peninsula that forms a large natural harbor, Halifax is an  ice-free port that is navigable year-round. As a result, the city is steeped in  maritime marvels, not the least being the famous Bluenose.  </P> <P> While walking along the renovated dock, we found the impressive Bluenose II  resting peacefully in its berth. The 143-foot, two-masted schooner is a replica  of the original built in 1921. The Bluenose plied the seas as a fishing ship,  but her sleek design helped her win many international races.  </P> <P> She was undefeated in 20 years of racing, and as a tribute, she was featured on  a Canadian 10-cent silver coin. In 1946, the yacht met misfortune and sank off  Haiti. The Halifax Herald proclaimed: "Her passing is a national sorrow; the  ignominy of her death, a national shame."  </P> <P> A replica of the Bluenose II was launched in 1963 and is permanently moored  here.  </P> <P> Life in Halifax begins at the wharf, a conglomeration of refurbished  wood-and-stone buildings dating from 1800 to 1905. A waterfront boardwalk  provides easy access to the many shops in the Historic Properties section.  </P> <P> This is Halifax's original settlement, where pirates brought their cargo to  peddle and store. Many of the buildings have been converted into tourist shops,  boutiques, cafes, pubs and restaurants.  </P> <P> The Old Red Store, once used for shipping operations with its hipped roof and  large hoistway dormers, is now the Nova Scotia Tourist Center. The center has a  wide selection of books from Nova Scotian authors, who bring the province's  history of French and English pioneers to life.  </P> <P> Halifax's city tourist bureau is downtown, at the corner of Duke and Barrington  streets. Free city maps are offered in front of the bureau.  </P> <P> Halifax was first settled in 1749, when the British -- some 2,500 strong --  founded a military base here. The Halifax harbor was used as a British naval  base during the American Revolution and the War of 1812. During both world  wars, Halifax was a major supply center for ships heading to Europe.  </P> <P> Life in Halifax begins at the wharf, a conglomeration of refurbished  wood-and-stone buildings dating from 1800 to 1905. A waterfront boardwalk  provides easy access to the many shops in the Historic Properties section.  </P> <P> In 1917, the biggest man-made explosion before the atomic bomb occurred when a  French munitions ship, the Mont Blanc, carrying 4,000 tons of TNT, collided  with the Imo in the harbor. Half of Halifax was laid to ruins and a reported  2,000 died from the blast.  </P> <P> Although the city has never come under attack, it has not lost its military  presence, with the majestic old compound on Citadel Hill standing over Halifax  like a great protective wall.  </P> <P> The Citadel's landmark is the Old Town Clock, which sits in stately fashion on  an emerald green hillside in front of the fort.  </P> <P> The clock, shipped from England in 1803, was designed by the garrison  commander, the Duke of Kent. It still chimes the correct time, the bells  echoing across the city.  </P> <P> The star-shaped garrison of Citadel Hill was constructed between 1829 and 1861,  and is the fourth fortress built on the site. The fort is open free to the  public from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the summer, and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from  September to June.  </P> <P> Guided tours, lasting about three quarters of an hour, are given by Canadian  park rangers, who offer detailed accounts of the fort's past.  </P> <P> A highlight of the tour is the ceremonial changing of the guards and a  traditional gun salute, as well as the playing of bagpipes by members of the  Scottish Highlanders.  </P> <P> Views from the fort's highest points are spectacular when looking across the  harbor to Halifax's sister city of Dartmouth.  </P> <P> Downtown, St. Paul's Church -- constructed in 1750 -- is said to be Canada's  oldest Anglican church. St. Paul's epitomizes the British influence here.  Whereas Quebec City feels as French as a boulangerie, Halifax is as English as  tea and crumpets.  </P> <P> Especially during a rainstorm.  </P> <P> The best months to visit Halifax are June through October, when temperatures  are mild. July and August are the warmest months, but September and October  offer spectacular scenes of changing foliage.  </P> <P> Halifax is host this year to the World Ice Skating Championships March 5-12 at  the downtown Metro Center. The event is the sport's premier competition outside  of the Olympics.  </P> <P> Summer tourists can enjoy two major events -- Festival '90 and the  International Buskers Festival.  </P> <P> Festival '90 -- a celebration of Halifax's birthday -- runs from July 27 to  Aug. 6. Activities include fireworks shows, an Irish dance festival, a jazz  festival, an international town cryer competition and a beach party.  </P> <P> The Buskers competition, from Aug. 9-18, features street performers such as  jugglers, puppeteers and magicians who ply their trade day and night along city  streets. Spectators select their favorite act at the week's end.  </P> <P> Recommended accommodations:  </P> <P> The Gerrard Hotel, 1234 Barrington St., is a beautiful Old English-style  establishment within walking distance of most of the city's attractions.  Although it has only nine rooms, the hotel also runs the Harvey House bed and  breakfast inn in the back.  </P> <P> Rooms at either establishment are $43 U.S. for two with breakfast, $38 without.  The hotel's breakfast is worth a special note; it's as good as any we found in  the Maritimes. Call (902) 423-8614.  </P> <P> The Fountain View Guest House, 2138 Robie St., is inexpensive but offers only  four rooms. It is just off the Halifax Commons, the city's largest park.

The inn is known for its afternoon teas and dinners. The owners  are Buddhists from California and Colorado. Rates range from $57 to $78, with  some suites between $96 and $113.

Rates range from $39-$51. Some suites for $65. Call (902) 469-1896.  </P> <P> Numerous quaint fishing villages can be found within 20 miles southwest of  Halifax on the Lighthouse Route 333, and a few offer inexpensive B&amp;Bs.  </P> <P> Lovers Lane Inn and Cottages (Box 4, Site 31, RR No. 1, Tantallon, Nova Scotia  BOJ 3JO), just beyond the Lighthouse Route, offer accommodations recommended by  the Nova Scotia Tourist Bureau. Rates range from $26-$44. Call (902) 823-2670.  </P> <P> The Seabright Bed and Breakfast inn (Seabright, Nova Scotia BOJ 3JO) has a  private beach. Rates range from $31-$35. Call (902) 823-2987.  </P> <P> As for food, Halifax offers international fare, though seafood is its  specialty. Both the city center and Historic Properties section have a number  of fine restaurants.  </P> <P> Halifax also has one of the finest pub districts in Canada. Most of the 50 pubs  serve hearty food at modest prices in the early evening. The pubs, which  resemble some of London's finest, are concentrated along Argyle Street in  downtown or in the Historic Properties section. Most are restored 19th-Century  buildings.  </P> <P> Halifax has an international airport about 25 miles northwest of the city,  along Route 102. Air Canada is the only carrier servicing Los Angeles to  Halifax daily. All flights have stopovers in Montreal or Toronto. Round-trip  fares are about $465 plus tax. For more information, call toll-free (800)  424-3687.  </P> <P> Bus service in the city is good, but visitors should have access to a car to  drive through the spectacular countryside.  </P> <P> For more information, contact Tourism Halifax at (902) 421-6448 or the Nova  Scotia Tourist Bureau, P.O. Box 130, Halifax, Canada B3J 2M7, (800) 341-6096 or  (902) 424-5000.  </P></p>

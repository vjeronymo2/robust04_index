			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL TO HEAR WAYS TO CHANGE THE AHMANSON;  </P> <P> STAGE: THE COMMITTEE WILL MEET TODAY TO CONSIDER PROPOSALS TO RENOVATE THE  THEATER AFTER 'PHANTOM' CLOSES.  </P> <P> With the box office booming for "The Phantom of the Opera," the Ahmanson  Theatre may not look as if it needs to be fixed.  </P> <P> Today, however, a committee will listen to proposals for how to make the  Ahmanson a better theater, after "The Phantom" has become a mere phantom.  </P> <P> That might not happen for a long time. A "Phantom" spokesman said "there is no  sign of its slowing down" in Los Angeles and no date for its departure. Still,  the theater's managers want to be ready when the big day arrives.  </P> <P> The theater has been criticized for years -- by actors and audience members as  well as critics -- for the effect of its size and acoustics on spoken drama.  </P> <P> The Ahmanson Foundation contributed $100,000 to pay for the first formal  proposals of what to do with the theater. Three architectural firms and one  London-based theatrical consulting firm will make presentations today, and a  London theater manager also has been asked for his advice.  </P> <P> If renovation plans proceed, the ultimate goal is not quite clear.  </P> <P> Actor and committee member Charlton Heston, who has appeared in eight shows at  the Ahmanson, is so adamant about improving it for spoken drama that he wants  to remove the orchestra pit altogether -- "I don't think we'll ever do musicals  again in the Ahmanson," he said.  </P> <P> The spoken-drama advocates would like to see the 2,071-seat auditorium reduced  -- and all of the proposals, said Heston, would provide for a degree of  convertibility, so that the theater could change its seating capacity,  depending on the occasion.  </P> <P> Within the proposals, said Heston, are plans that could shrink the hall to as  few as 800 seats, or expand it to 2,400. He favors a capacity of 1,000-1,200 --  assuming, that is, that a larger house isn't required for the blockbuster  musicals.  </P> <P> Yet committee member Charles Schneider, chairman of the Music Center Operating  Company (MCOC), cautioned against assuming that musicals will disappear along  with "The Phantom," pointing out that the next London musical spectacular,  "Miss Saigon," probably could bring a lot of money into the Music Center.  </P> <P> "We've got people coming to the Music Center (for 'Phantom') who have never  been there before," he said, "and while they're there, they might buy a ticket  to the Taper, the Chorale, the Philharmonic." The main problem with leaving the  Ahmanson open for long-running "Phantom"-like extravaganzas, he said, is  figuring out where to put the Ahmanson subscription audience, which has been  diverted to the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood for the duration of the  "Phantom."  </P> <P> The committee that will review the proposals is led by TV producer Douglas  Cramer, a member of the Center Theatre Group (CTG) board. It also includes five  other members of the CTG board, two other officers (besides Schneider) of the  MCOC, and Robert Ahmanson of the Ahmanson Foundation.  </P> <P> "We have no commitments for financing" beyond the $100,000 spent on the  proposals, said CTG President Lawrence Ramer. "We couldn't go out and seek  money until we knew how much the ballpark figures are (in the proposals)."  </P> <P> Said one of the architects who has prepared a proposal: "The question we all  have is: How real is it? There is no commitment that anything will happen."  Another of the architects, however, predicted that "big, exciting changes" are  in store for the Ahmanson.  </P> <P> Those who will present their ideas at today's meeting include:  </P> <P> Ellerbe Becket, the architectural firm that is descended from the firm of the  late Welton Becket, the Music Center's original architect. None of the  individuals who worked on Welton Becket's original plans will be involved in  the firm's latest proposal, and the company's design principal, Lou Naidorf,  said he is open to the idea of changing the original design: " A lot of  improvements need to be made, and we think they can be." However, he added,  "for the most part, the city has been pleased with the Music Center, and it's  natural that we should come back in" for a remodeling proposal.  </P> <P> Hardy, Holzman, Pfeiffer -- a New York-based firm with a Los Angeles office  which has done work for Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Los Angeles  Public Library, and theaters in Eugene, Ore., Anchorage, Alaska, Denver and  Brooklyn.  </P> <P> Barton Myers, a Hollywood-based architect who worked for 20 years in Canada and  recently designed the Cerritos Community Arts Center. "I understand I am still  controversial with some Music Center people," said Myers, because of his  preliminary study for what was to become the Music Center's new Disney Hall.  Myers suggested placing the building at the top of the Civic Center Mall, to  the east of the Center, instead of the location that was selected to the south  of the Center. If Myers' Ahmanson proposal is selected, he plans to do the work  in conjunction with Theatre Projects, a London-based theater design consulting  firm, which also was invited to submit its own independent proposal to the  committee.  </P> <P> The above-mentioned Theatre Projects, which has advised on the planning of  theaters in 28 countries, including seven national theaters, Cerritos Community  Arts Center, Whittier College Performing Arts Center and the theaters within  the new Escondido civic complex. President Lou Fleming said his company offers  "specialist expertise that isn't available in most architectural firms. In the  final analysis, we would end up advising one of the other three (architects)."  </P> <P> In addition, advice was solicited from Ian Albery, the managing director of  London's Shaftesbury Theatre and past president of the Society of West End  Theatre. Albery said he was asked because of "the work I've done in adapting  existing large theaters." He worked on the rehabilitation of eight West End  theaters, he said.  </P> <P> None of those who will submit proposals, each of whom will be paid $20,000,  would discuss the details of their proposals before the meeting.  </P></p>

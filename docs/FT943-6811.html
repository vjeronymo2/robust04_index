			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Cheung Kong beats expectations Cheung Kong, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's listed Hong Kong empire, yesterday reported a 1 per cent dip in net profits to HKDollars 4.47bn (USDollars 578.3m) for the first half of the year, against HKDollars 4.5bn at the same stage in 1993. The flat results, released after the market closed, were better than analysts had expected and the counter was the most actively traded stock of the day, rising 80 cents to HKDollars 36 in anticipation. Stripping out the 1993 HKDollars 708m exceptional item, reaped from the issue of two lots of guaranteed warrants enabling holders to buy Hutchison shares held by Cheung Kong, earnings rose 17 per cent. The bulk of property projects is to be booked in the second half of the year. Mr Li, chairman, said property prices across the board had begun to decline in May. He added: 'The property market has entered a consolidation phase, but because Hong Kong's economy remains healthy and demand for residential property is still substantial, activity in the property market will pick up again.' Analysts attributed the better-than-expected results to the enhanced contribution from Hutchison, which also reported yesterday and which is controlled by Cheung Kong, and strong gains on treasury operations which SBCI Finance Asia put at HKDollars 1.05bn compared with a forecast HKDollars 800m. This is in sharp contrast to treasury dealings at Hutchison, which were hit by the downturn in bond and equity markets. Taken on a per share basis, earnings dipped 1 per cent to HKDollars 2.03 from HKDollars 2.06 at the interim stage last year. However, shareholders are to receive a bigger dividend, of 27 cents compared with 24 cents in the first half of 1993. Cheung Kong was hit with a sharply increased Hong Kong tax bill this year, at HKDollars 426m for the group itself (without associates) compared with HKDollars 77m in the first six months of 1993. The company's string of properties under development - the area which, along with the 43 per cent stake in Hutchison, last year supplied about 85 per cent of net profits - have been supplemented with interests in infrastructure and power plant projects in the mainland.</p>

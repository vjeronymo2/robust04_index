			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Soros initiates Dollars 25m loan to aid Macedonia MR George Soros, the international financier who made a billion dollars during sterling's fall last September, has initiated a Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.4m) revolving loan for Macedonia, intended initially to cover the beleaguered former Yugoslav republic's oil requirements for the rest of the winter, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The loan follows Mr Soros's Christmas donation of Dollars 50m from his currency profits to international relief organisations working in Bosnia. Mr Soros had to cancel plans to announce the loan yesterday in a speech to the Macedonian parliament because a snowstorm had shut down Skopje airport. However, government officials said the first instalment, in the form of 70,000 tonnes of crude oil, was on its way. Although Macedonia is exempted from United Nations sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, fuel supplies have run low. Because Macedonia has not been officially recognised by the European Community or the US it has no access to commercial credit or to financial aid from international organisations.</p>

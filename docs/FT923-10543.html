			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Arts: Begorrah, 'tis Hollywood himself - Cinema FAR AND AWAY (12) Empire NIGHT ON EARTH (15) Lumiere, Gate Notting Hill, Camden Plaza THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (U) Barbican THE HISTORY of the wheel has been recapitulated in the history of the reel. If trains and cars first assaulted the distances between towns and nations, the movie projector has obliterated them. Two films this week, Ron Howard's Far And Away and Jim Jarmusch's Night On Earth, skim their plots or characters around the globe as if the friction of reality had never existed. In most other respects the two films are perfect opposites. One stars Tom Cruise, was shot in 65-millimetre - the first film to use the process since Ryan's Daughter - and is an ocean-crossing epic about human love and self-betterment. The other, a set of five low-budget stories about cab drivers, is a comedy of stasis masquerading as a comedy of movement. In Far And Away Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman leave the old country to find a home in the new. In Ireland the land is green, the sea sparkles and the smoke curls from the cottages, indicating that the feudal English have been torching the villages again. We are in a troubled Western Ireland, circa 1890. In America, once past that gateway to Irish-American freedom called Boston, the West beckons. Here men are men, women are women and horses are Formula One racing cars with tails. These hurtle their riders to glory in the climactic, eye-boggling Oklahoma land race. By the close of this film - two hours of romance, fisticuffs, music, spectacle and bullhorning Celtic charm  -we feel we have been to Fantasyland and back via Cimarron, The Streetfighter and The Quiet Man. And, come to that, via PG Wodehouse. I kept being reminded of that author's Irish comedy double-act called Pat and Mike. This duo, you recall, only ever had one routine. Pat (or Mike) tells Mike (or Pat) about a ballet in which the dancers rush in and out from stages left and right. Then after a lot of music hall cross-talk Pat (or Mike) finally explains 'Faith and begob, 'tis a Rushin' Ballet.' That is Far And Away in a nutcracker. Characters rush in and out from screen left or right, the soundtrack surges with full-orchestra music, and hanging over all like a deus praesens is the 'Faith and begob' school of Irish locution. This is represented by Cyril Cusack and assorted worthies sporting cloth caps, potato-dust faces and singsong accents. The opening half hour, it must be admitted, has a winning dottiness. Tom Cruise's father, mortally injured by his landlord's hitmen, bequeaths his bully-boy courage to young Tom - 'You're an especially odd boy,' the old man keens - and soon Tom is proving both his oddity and his pluck. He invades the mansion of the wicked landlord (Robert Prosky), gets shot, gets nursed, gets up, gets knocked down again, and then receives a ladder-and-window visit in his bedroom from the daughter of the house, Nicole Kidman (alias Mrs Cruise). 'I'm running away because I'm modern,' explains the Australian actress in an Irish accent. Enough said. Our couple soon take ship to Boston where they masquerade as fine lady and servant: at least until Cruise earns a penny as a prizefighter while Kidman becomes estranged, rueing her fall from social grace. By the time they reach the Oklahoma land race, they have both been up and down and round and round: two socio-economic yo-yos suffering from existential dizziness. A strange madness overtakes the cinema, we have noticed, whenever there are two '9's in the year. Everything suddenly goes all epochal. Remember Gone With The Wind (1939)? Easy Rider (1969)? Now we face a whole decade of this stuff. Far And Away was conceived and directed by Ron Howard of Cocoon, Willow and Parenthood. He wanted to tell his own ancestors' story but has succeeded instead in making a historical soap opera which suffers from elephantiasis. Every emotion is blown large and primal to fit the wide screen: from the early rage of our peasant hero to the final earth-kneeling clinch on Western soil. In between we have the nose-crunching boxing scenes, the sentimental Christmas idyll out of Meet Me In St Louis, the spectacular land race and the quick-witted bickering of the hero and heroine, which is either Beatrice and Benedick or Rhett and Scarlett, according to your taste in cultural invocations. Global expansiveness apart, the only characteristic Far And Away shares with Night On Earth is a tendency to prove that the more geographical space a film covers the less it moves dramatically or psychologically. Howard's film demonstrates this unwittingly: in the un-transplantability of Tom Cruise. Is he of Ireland? Boston? Oklahoma? No, he is of Hollywood, where that toothpaste commercial grin, cartoon-handsome face and acting-class earnestness radiate American Boyishness. If you like your history re-processed in Wishfulfilmentscope - and many do - Far And Away is for you. Low-budget independent cinema has its own version of running on the spot. Cover the globe for you, guv'nor? Certainly. Step in: 'in' being the taxi in Jim Jarmusch's five-story feature, brought to you by the mournful movie wag who made Stranger Than Paradise, Down By Law and Mystery Train. You will experience night rides through LA, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki without feeling that you have changed locales at all. But this is artful immobility. Taxis, as we know, are the same internationally: zones of terror where we part with large sums of money for the privilege of sitting in a traffic jam hearing a man's life story. The taxis do move in Night On Earth; but they do not get anywhere. The sky outside is as dark as a parrot's shawl while the changing duos inside fail to resolve their encounters. Casting agent Gena Rowlands sees star quality, but fails to sign it, in foulmouthed cabbie Winona Ryder; Giancarlo Esposito wrests the taxi's wheel from East German ex-clown Armin Mueller-Stahl who, despite a cab licence, cannot drive; Roberto Benigni inflicts unwanted sexual confessions on a dicky-hearted priest; and only in France and Finland do a blind girl (Beatrice Dalle) and a bereaved father (Matti Pelonpaa) offhandedly suggest that enlightenment can come forth from darkness. Two hours of heads bobbing in leatherette-clad capsules and you may feel like hailing the nearest bus. At moments of maximum claustrophobia, our imaginations flash out yearningly to the Oklahoma land race. But cinema is oddly suited to these exercises in oubliette entrapment. Not only is being in a taxi much like being in a movie theatre - the darkness, the rectangular slices of passing scenery, the non-stop soundtrack - but Jarmusch's comic miniaturism is enhanced by being writ large on a cinema screen. Look at Gena Rowlands's genteel twitches of incredulity as she swaps folk wisdom with the chain-smoking, chain-swearing Winona Ryder. Or at Armin Mueller-Stahl's bemused, I'm-a-stranger-here curiosity as his black American passenger explodes at his (the passenger's) raggedy-mannered, out-all-night sister, whom they have picked up en route to Brooklyn. The reaction shot is king, even when in the Helsinki story the dim Northern light barely leaks through to the glum moustachioed visages. At two hours Night On Earth may be too much of a good thing, but a good thing it undoubtedly is. So is The Thief Of Bagdad, to which I could give but short shrift last week. The glorious 1940 Alexander Korda epic, made by a bevy of directors including Britain's Michael Powell, has been reissued in a brand new print. Thrill to the giant spider's web climbed by Sabu. Tremble at the mighty genie whooshing from the bottle. Gasp at the flying white horse which hoofs it aerially over the multi-coloured onion domes. I am beginning to sound like a movie poster. But that is how all critics sound when their defences are down and they are praising a film they fell in love with long before they were critics.</p>

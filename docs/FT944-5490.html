			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Docklands was Heseltine's, not Thatcher's, vehicle Sir, Peter Marsh has walked London Docklands and interviewed residents ('Tales from London's rebuilt river bank', November 26/27). However, if he thinks that the London Docklands Development Corporation 'was established as a Thatcherite vehicle', he still has some way to go. Mrs Thatcher was not remotely interested in inner city regeneration. It was Michael Heseltine in Docklands, just as it was in Liverpool; and he deserves a place in history for it, because the alternative, probably much dearer to the Iron Lady's heart, was to leave the place to rot. The resident he quotes as gesturing towards Canary Wharf and commenting: 'It's all shit. I wish the IRA would blow it up,' can perhaps be left to stew in his own can of beer, which Mr Marsh describes him as putting down to give us the benefit of his views. But the others who complain that they haven't received any advantage from the new jobs in Docklands deserve more thought. There is an impression in the article that it is the job of government to persist with what cannot continue: that if docks close, then further unskilled work should be conjured up, without people being required to learn new skills, or indeed any skill at all for the first time. This is simply not true. Unskilled work has dried up all over the west, and that includes London Docklands. The 1960s local authority architecture which Mr Marsh castigates is, indeed, horrible. Unfortunately, it was a characteristic of Labour councils at that time to employ architects who liked nothing better than to put up concrete tower blocks, while taking good care to live in pretty Georgian houses themselves. It is a matter of note that the LDDC, from its inception in 1981, has taken care to foster a more human scale of architecture. Osman Streater, Savile Club, 69 Brook Street, London W1 2ER</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on BAe A WAVE of negative sentiment washed over British Aerospace (BAe), sending the shares tumbling to record the day's poorest Footsie stock performance in percentage terms. At the day's low, the shares were down 29 at 213p, with the downward pressure having started ahead of the general decline in the market, when dealers reported a line of stock on offer. One securities house was also very active in the traded options market. The falls were followed by the renewal of worries about provisions necessary to meet problems at the regional aircraft division. Sentiment was additionally weakened by talk of further difficulties in the cash position. Later in the day bargain hunters helped the shares pick up to end a net 27 down at 215p. Trade was relatively light at 1.5m shares. Mirror wanted The return of Mirror Group Newspapers, which began trading on Friday after a suspension of more than six months, continued to attract support. The shares added 5 3/4 at 58 1/2 p and turnover, although well below Friday's level, was still heavy at 6.5m. There is speculation that a stakebuilder has been at work, picking up stock from unsatisfied private investors who decided to get out as soon as possible. However, a number of securities houses also argue that the shares offer intrinsic good value. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson was telling clients that without the attentions of a bidder the shares were worth up to 85p, but 'once bid fever really takes hold, estimates of what MGN is worth will start with a net asset value of 109p and escalate'. Support for Glaxo Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo stood out in a weak market as investors bought the stock for its defensive qualities. The shares held steady when the market was at its worst and rose in the afternoon to close 10 ahead at 688p. Analysts said the stock had received support from an article in a trade publication that featured its anti-migraine drug Imigran, which is awaiting approval in the US. However, most of the rise came in the afternoon and reflected a surge in the dollar against the pound. Some 26 per cent of Glaxo's shares are held in the US in the form of American Depositary Receipts. Lasmo rallies The recent steep slide in Lasmo, which has seen the shares down to their lowest level since 1986, was arrested following news of a substantial uprating in the group's share of Indonesian gas reserves. Lasmo was the Footsie's best performing stock yesterday. The shares fell more than 23 per cent last week as the market fretted over analysts' cuts in net asset values, principally because of a falling dollar and weakness in crude oil prices, but also on worries about forthcoming interim figures. These are scheduled for release on July 29. Oil analysts were heartened yesterday by the news from Indonesia which, allied with asset swaps and any good fortune in drilling operations, could enable Lasmo to maintain oil and gas reserves during 1992. The stock ended 6 higher at 131p on good turnover of 2.8m. The market continued to indicate doubts about the forthcoming flotation of Wellcome shares as the market price fell sharply. The stock, down 35 at one stage, ended 25 off at 845p. Dealers said one broker had sold a small line of shares and no-one was prepared to buy. Current price levels suggest that Wellcome Trust may have to sell its shares into the market at around 800p. Some observers hinted that it might be chary of selling below that level. GEC, with its near twice-covered dividend and substantial cash mountain, was another 'safety-first' stock and gained 4 to 216p. Cable and Wireless, a big dollar earner, saw an early decline reversed and closed a net 4 up at 537p ahead of today's annual meeting, of which edited highlights will be screened by BBC Television at 5.30am on Wednesday. The strong defensive qualities of utilities triggered support for Midland Electricity, 6 firmer at 323p on 3.1m, and Southern Electricity, the same amount up at 310p on 2.6m. British Gas, 2 ahead at 245p, is also viewed as a tried and tested 'bolt hole' when the rest of the market is seen as exceptionally vulnerable. The scale of central bank support for the dollar was the signal for a good rally in oil shares. Shell was the major beneficiary, bouncing from a low for the session of 466p to close 4 1/2 ahead at 475p. BP, down to 196p early in the day, ended marginally firmer on balance at 200p on 8.8m traded, helped by late support from the US, where one of the leading brokerages was said to have issued a buy note on the stock. Tarmac was among many casualties in a depressed building materials/contracting sector, sliding 5 1/2 to 73p; a block of 5m shares was sold at 64p at 4.30pm, the official close of business. A number of textile issues fell as SG Warburg Securities cut forecasts by between 5 and 7.5 per cent, citing general weakness in the dollar, news that Marks and Spencer will be putting pressure on suppliers and gloomy distributive trades figures from the CBI. Alexon, the fashion retailer, dipped 5 to 197p, although two directors announced that they had bought blocks of 25,000 and 5,000 shares. Hazlewood Foods lost 13 to 133p on heavy turnover of 12.3m. This included an agency cross of 5.8m shares. Northern Foods slipped 19 to 584p ahead of Friday's annual meeting, amid fears of a bearish trading statement. Drug retailers performed better than most, with Boots putting on 3 to 431p and Lloyds Chemists losing only a penny at 228p. The CBI distributive trades survey weighed on retailers in general, particularly those involved with the DIY sector, Kingfisher receding 11 to 437p and WH Smith 'A' 9 to 389p.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The session of the NATO Cooperation Council  attended by 16 NATO foreign ministers and their partners from  the Central and East European countries opened in Istanbul  today. The Czech Republic is represented by Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec. Our special correspondent Klara Stejskalova  reports from the venue.    [Stejskalova] Partnership for Peace is an important  practical  step toward full incorporation of the Czech Republic into the  North Atlantic alliance, Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said  at the beginning of his speech.    We regard the political program of Partnership for Peace as  being of equal importance to the military program. We cannot  imagine, however, the principles of partnership being challenged  by one country gaining a special status.    Our interest in NATO is linked with (enhancement of)  European  security. But enlargement will be meaningful only if the  alliance adapts itself to new conditions. Any Russian demands  to subject NATO to the CSCE are unacceptable to our side.    At the conclusion of his speech Minister Zieleniec recalled  President Havel's participation in the commemoration of the  Allied landing in Normandy. His participation was a symbol of  the continuity of our co-responsibility for the fate of Europe.  [passage omitted]</p>

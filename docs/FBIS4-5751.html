			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- The Japanese Government  has presented to the United States a set of comments to counter  the latest U.S. report that found Japan guilty of unfair trade  practices in many industrial sectors, a senior Foreign Ministry  official said Wednesday [13 April].    "The (U.S.) report contains certain assertions which the  U.S.  has already withdrawn during the framework negotiations,  including its claim that Japan's market has low level of  penetration by foreign goods and services compared to the Group  of Seven average," said the document that lists the comments,  which was obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    The comments were prepared by the Foreign Ministry and  submitted to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on Tuesday, said the  ministry official, who declined to be named.    The office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) released  the 1994 National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade Barriers at  the end of March, a hit list that devoted 44 pages of its  281-page report to cite what it views as Tokyo's unfair trade  practices, covering 43 areas in seven industrial sectors.    The latest Japanese comments are designed to demonstrate  that  "Tokyo is doing what it should do" in order to further open its  markets, another official at the Foreign Ministry said.    In the comments, Japan argued that "the reliability" of the  statistics used in the USTR report for asserting Japan's market  is closed must be examined in thorough discussions, along with  "justification of the definition of competitiveness."    "Without such justification and appropriateness attached,  this kind of U.S. approach in the report is too simplistic and  will not be acceptable," the comments said.    The comments answered U.S. claims on Japan's 11 industrial  sectors, including three priority areas covered under the  Japan-U.S. trade "framework" talks -- insurance, autos and auto  parts, and government procurement of medical equipment and  telecommunications.    In the comments, Japan dismissed Washington's perception of  past foreign entry into Japanese markets, saying, "it should be  also recognized that the past Japan-U.S. arrangements have met  with `tangible results'."    Specifically, Tokyo termed as "faulty" statistics used by  the  U.S. in gauging the Japanese Government's procurement of  foreign-made computers.    Because of Japan's market-opening efforts, a "steady  increase" has been recorded in the share of foreign computers in  government procurement, from 8.8 percent in fiscal 1991 to 18.9  percent in fiscal 1992, including that of the central government  entities, which expanded from 4.7 percent to 11.7 percent, the  document said.    On government procurement of telecommunications equipment,  the document said the U.S. assertion that the Japanese market is  closed in terms of the G-7 average is erroneous.    Excluding equipment purchases made by the private sector,  which was what the USTR counted in the latest report, the  foreign share is much higher at 0.6 percent in 1991 in the  Japanese market than the 0.07 percent in the U.S., the document  said.    Measures to improve Japan's government procurement  procedures  for the telecom sector as called for by Washington in the USTR  report are all covered by Tokyo's market-opening package  unveiled at the end of March, the document said.    The document also blasted the U.S. view of Japan's efforts  to  open its insurance market. The March market-opening package  responded to the majority of the insurance issues raised by  Washington, it said.    Moreover, the document described insurance regulations in  the  U.S. as being "by far stricter" than those in Japan. It  explained that the U.S. system, regulated on a state-by-state  basis, "puts heavy burdens on foreign insurance providers by  requiring enormous time and cost for obtaining licenses."    In addition, U.S. branches of foreign insurance providers  are  discriminated against vis-a-vis domestic insurance providers by  the imposition of financial requirements in such areas as  trusteed assets, the document said. "Such discriminatory  treatment does not exist in Japan," it said.    This year's USTR report takes on a significant meaning for  Japan's trade ties with Washington because issues dealt with in  the report could possibly be subjected to retaliatory tariffs  under the recently revived U.S. trade provision known as Super  301.    Under the provision, Washington will identify foreign trade  barriers using the USTR findings. The U.S. would then have  until Sept. 30 to pinpoint priority countries it says are  engaged in unfair trading.</p>

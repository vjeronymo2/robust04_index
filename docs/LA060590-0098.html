			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. IS IN THE EYE OF WORLD CUP'S STORM;  </P> <P> SOCCER: AMERICANS FIND CALM WHILE 23 OTHER NATIONS HANG ON EVERY DETAIL OF  THEIR TEAMS' WELL-BEING.  </P> <P> In Argentina, soccer fans -- everyone in the country old enough to kick a ball  -- nervously await the latest news about the injured big toe on the right foot  of star midfielder Diego Maradona.  </P> <P> In Scotland, fans are updated daily in the newspapers, and hourly on television  and radio, about striker Mo Johnston's "mystery ailment," believed to be a torn  abdominal muscle. "Johnston Leaves Scots Quaking," reads a headline in the  Guardian.  </P> <P> The London press reports that the English team is in chaos, having been saved  from a humiliating loss in an exhibition game against Tunisia by a last-minute  goal. A Brazilian newspaper's poll of the country's leading doctors determines  that one of the team's key players, Romario, is unfit to play.  </P> <P> Spain's coach, Luis Suarez, tells that country's sports daily, Marca, that no  one will commit suicide if his team does not win the World Cup. Marca is not so  sure.  </P> <P> Four days before Friday's opening game in Milan between defending champion  Argentina and Cameroon, much of the world's population is experiencing severe  lightheadedness believed to be connected with World Cup fever.  </P> <P> The United States appears to have immunity, acquired through years of  indifference to the world's most popular championship.  </P> <P> North American sporting events need not apply for the designation, as Norwegian  marathon runner Grete Waitz once so eloquently pointed out in a discussion of  baseball.  </P> <P> "The World Series?" she said. "How many countries are playing?"  </P> <P> So, as the United States, making its first World Cup appearance in 40 years,  opened its training camp Monday in this seaside resort about 10 miles from  Pisa, all was appropriately calm.  </P> <P> No one was quaking. No one was even injured. Even if someone had been, it is  doubtful the United States' leading doctors would have offered opinions about  whether he was or was not fit to play in Sunday's opener against Czechoslovakia  in Florence.  </P> <P> Not knowing what to expect, the U.S. Soccer Federation arranged to have  security guards at the training camp, drawn from Italy's police and military as  well as the U.S. Army base at nearby Camp Darby. They had a quiet day Monday,  when the only visitors were about 20 reporters who showed up for a morning  practice. The afternoon practice was closed to the press.  </P> <P> U.S. Coach Bob Gansler patiently answered all questions, but he appeared to  most enjoy the ones from an Italian journalist. Ever since the Italians  announced that their players could not have sex during the month of the World  Cup, officials from each of the 24 teams have been asked by reporters if they  have a similar policy.  </P> <P> The Brazilians can have sex, but not the Irish. The Austrians announced that  their team cannot have sex the night before games.  </P> <P> And the U.S. players?  </P> <P> "Not at halftime," Gansler said last week.  </P> <P> Wives and girlfriends are not welcome at the camp, in the Italian Olympic  training center, but Gansler said he could not prevent the players from  visiting them in Florence.  </P> <P> "It's not the moments of pleasure that concern me," he said. "It's the hours of  pursuit."  </P> <P> On Monday, the Italian journalist tried to bait Gansler into criticizing the  Italian approach.  </P> <P> "Sex is very important to Latin peoples," the journalist said.  </P> <P> "Sex is very important to Americans, too," Gansler said. "That's why there are  250 million of us."  </P> <P> Otherwise, the only issue involved Eric Wynalda's suitability to play midfield.  He is a forward by experience and nature, but last month Gansler moved him to  the midfield so that the team can have another scorer in the starting lineup.  </P> <P> Wynalda, who is from Westlake Village, says that he is not comfortable in the  midfield, but he said Monday that he is more comfortable there than on the  bench.  </P> <P> That is where he spent the last 40 minutes of Saturday's 2-1 loss to  Switzerland in an exhibition game. Afterward, Wynalda let off steam,  complaining that he was not suited for the position's defensive  responsibilities.  </P> <P> "I've had a lot of time to cool off," he said Monday. "I was a little  disappointed with the loss.  </P> <P> "As far as the position goes, I think I can handle it. I don't think there's  any reason to pull me off the field. I'd like to be up front (at forward),  though. That would be nice."  </P> <P> Asked if he felt Gansler might move him out of the starting line-up, Wynalda  said, "Anything's possible."  </P> <P> But Gansler did not seem to be leaning that way.  </P> <P> "Eric has played that position before, but it's a learning experience for him  to play it at this level," he said. "He's got to have some patience. He's  certainly more frustrated with his play there than I am."  </P> <P> If Wynalda does not contribute, the man to replace him in the midfield might be  UCLA freshman Chris Henderson, 19, who learned Monday that he is the youngest  player in the World Cup.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, some day I can be the oldest," he said.  </P></p>

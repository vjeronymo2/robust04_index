			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (4): A mainstay of the county economy - Financial services Bournemouth and Poole both expanded on the back of the financial services sector during the 1980s. Employment in the sector nearly doubled. Consolidation has followed, and further expansion now seems unlikely. Life insurance, in particular, faces a tough year as the industry attempts to digest new government regulations covering sales practices which could reduce sales and increase their costs of compliance. But there is little danger that the area will lose any business. Mr Allan Frost, chief executive of Abbey Life, the life insurance group and for many years the largest employer in the conurbation, makes it clear that the reasons for relocating still hold good. 'The reason we moved here was that in the mid-1970s if someone walked through the door in London with an O-Level you would lay out the red carpet. It made sense to move outside London where there was a willing pool of labour and where costs were much lower.' Abbey Life moved to Bournemouth in 1977 and three years ago cemented its relationship with the town by building a new dazzling white palace for its headquarters. The exterior has provided a new landmark which dominates the skyline for anybody arriving in the town by rail, while the interior - complete with a large atrium - proves to be as well-appointed an office as any in the City of London. All the company's UK operations, including the training of sales staff, are based in Bournemouth. Retention of workers, in a business where employment is notoriously volatile, has been reasonable with 10 per cent turnover a year since the move to Dorset. At present, 65 per cent of staff have been with the company for five years or more, while at Abbey Life Investment Services (ALIS), which claims to be the biggest asset management operation in southern England outside London, turnover is only 2 per cent. Waterloo station is less than two hours away by train and the company's fund managers, fully equipped with Reuters share-dealing technology, obviously feel that working outside the City is no disadvantage. ALIS investment performance has improved slightly in recent years as the company has attempted to broaden its market to include independent intermediaries, rather than rely totally on its direct sales force. Moving out of London has helped retention and the company is also happy with Bournemouth's education system which includes two grammar schools and a number of independent schools. However, Abbey Life has no plans to expand in the near future. It will concentrate for the next few years on absorbing the insurance industry's spasm of regulatory change. Lloyds Bowmaker, the finance house arm of Lloyds Abbey Life which owns Abbey Life, is also based in Bournemouth. The conurbation's largest employer is now Frizzell, the insurance broking and financial services group which employs more than 2,000, while Abbey Life has only about 1,400 permanent staff in Bournemouth. Frizzell's offices are crammed into several buildings at County Gate, on what was the boundary between Hampshire and Dorset until local government was reorganised in 1974. Attracted initially by a need for skilled labour - the company tries not to recruit 16-year-old school-leavers - and by relocation grants then available, Frizzell has now made its 'power-base' in Dorset for about 20 years, and has no plans to move. Most of the company's business is done via the telephone and little or nothing is lost by being based outside London. Its investment in the area has been heavy, with two floors of one office block devoted to full-time training. This is aimed, successfully, at boosting staff retention which is helped by siting the offices in a pleasant seaside town. Mr Tony Miller, manager of training, makes clear that the company is happily settled in the area, but that expansion in employment is now probably at an end. He said: 'I think we have reached our maximum employment level. I just don't think that expansion of people is the answer for further growth.' Other, more recent, arrivals include Chase Manhattan, the US bank, which is using Bournemouth as the 'admin' centre for its European operation, and Zurich Municipal, the insurance company, which has moved its brokerage division to the city, although its UK head office remains in Guildford, Surrey. This concentration of financial services in the town helps ensure a large pool of labour with the relevant skills. But few insurance companies are left in London, as low central office costs are vital for them in a competitive market. Dorset is therefore unlikely to attract many more new businesses from the sector, although the financial services community sector it already has seems well-established as a mainstay of the county economy.</p>

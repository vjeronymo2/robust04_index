			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Rapid growth in health insurance Health insurance is one of the fastest growing areas of consumer spending with an 80 per cent increase to Pounds 1.16bn in the five years to 1993, market research group Mintel says. Private medical insurance accounts for the majority of health insurance spending - Pounds 759m last year - but critical illness cover has grown the fastest, from Pounds 12m in 1989 to Pounds 145m last year. Mintel reports that 80 per cent of those interviewed said their parents should spend money on looking after themselves in old age rather than storing it up to be passed on in inheritance.</p>

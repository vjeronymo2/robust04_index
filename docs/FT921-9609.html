			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Conservatives bring protectionism out of closet: Bush, under attack by Republican left and right, is making what could be free trade's last stand MR Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator running against President George Bush in New Hampshire for the Republican presidential nomination, has brought to the fore a new truth in US politics: protectionism, even isolationism, is no longer 'politically incorrect' among American conservatives. President Bush, under attack from left and right, is making what could be a last stand for free trade. Thus, the warning of a US turn inward, issued in Munich on Sunday by US vice-president Dan Quayle and his senatorial colleagues, is no empty threat to push the European Community into submission in the international trade talks. The trade debate cuts across party lines. In New Hampshire, Democratic presidential runner Senator Tom Harkin plays the economic nationalism tune with unabashed enthusiasm. Senator Bob Kerrey stands in the middle with promises to get tough against Japan, which is where President Bush, innately a free trader, has been moving for the election season. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul Tsongas are both internationalists. Among conservatives the rise of protectionism has been fuelled by the end of the Cold War. Mr John Cregan, president of the Business and Industrial Council, an advocacy group of 1,500 strongly nationalistic companies, argues that free trade was only viable as long as it was in US interests. When the US dominated the world market-place, it could afford to make concessions to solidify alliances against a common communist foe. Concerned about the erosion of US economic sovereignty, he and many other conservatives see support for protectionism as a return to the natural order. Lincoln, he says, was 'a proud protectionist'. The struggle under way for the soul of the conservative movement was illustrated by a recent debate at the Heritage Foundation, a centre of conservatism, between Mr Cregan and Mr Jim Bovard, a committed libertarian author who contends that those who say the US market is open are 'hypocrites or dishonest or fools'. 'The fraudulent and failed nature of this (free trade) approach was sadly illustrated in the president's pathetic trip to Tokyo,' said Mr Cregan. 'We once again enter trade negotiations armed with nothing stronger than the gospel according to Adam Smith. We expect a nation that is growing by the size of Canada's GNP every three years - a most generous investor in Treasury bills and the world leader in ceramics, robotics and memory chips - not to lash out once the 'free trade' missionaries have gone home.' He said the 'liberal trade syndrome' failed to recognise that, having won the titanic struggle between capitalism and socialism, America was in another competition that pitted American-style entrepreneurial enterprise with a mutant form of capitalism perfected by the Japanese and adopted by a host of Asian countries. 'We have made the same mistake over and over of viewing Japan or Korea or even Germany, with its structure of financial/industry combines, as more or less like us.' Mr Cregan said he supported a bold foreign trade policy for the post-Cold War. It called for domestic policies that empowered the individual to be free from excessive government interference at home, while ensuring that the entrepreneur was freed from distortions of the market through economic aggression from abroad. Mr Bovard, on the other hand, argued that in some areas, America was one of the most protectionist industrial countries in the world. 'Our agricultural import quotas permit each American citizen to consume the equivalent of only one teaspoon of foreign ice cream per year, two foreign peanuts per year, and one pound of imported cheese per year. We have import restrictions on 500 different steel products, on autos from Japan, on machine tools from Japan and Taiwan, on beef from Australia and Argentina, on butter from Europe and on cotton from Egypt.' He said that while the average American tariff was now about 5 per cent, some tariffs were 'in the stratosphere'. Low-priced watches had an average tariff of 151.2 per cent, tobacco stems 458.3 per cent and some low-priced shoes 67 per cent. 'If this is free trade, then perhaps the federal income tax system is truly voluntary. 'Nowadays, we have paranoid protectionists who sound as if they check under their bed each night to see if there are any predatory foreigners. And dumping is what they see all around them. Our dumping law is so sweeping that the Commerce Department almost automatically convicts 95 per cent of foreign companies accused of dumping.' The great mistake many conservatives were making was to try to solve America's economic problems with trade barriers, said Mr Bovard. Politicians sounded mystified as to why the US was falling behind in some areas. The federal, state and local governments soaked up about 45 per cent of the US GNP; in Japan, government spending accounted for 28 per cent. 'Politicians first seize almost half the national wealth, and then blame foreigners because American productivity in many industries is not keeping up. Rather than erecting new trade barriers, the US should slash Dollars 300bn-Dollars 400bn from the federal deficit - and watch American productivity skyrocket,' he said.</p>

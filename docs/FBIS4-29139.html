			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief General Wimon Wongwanit  yesterday welcomed the move to include representatives of the  military on the Committee for Democratic Development set up by  House Speaker Marut Bunnak.    He said all opinions should be heeded in a democracy.    Gen Wimon said people should not misinterpret the  participation of the military as interference in politics.    "I have stated several times that the military has a policy  of non-interference in politics. I will not let the Army become  involved," he said.    Gen Wimon said soldiers and their families made up 300,000  people, constituting a large part of the community.    "Opinions from all sectors should be listened to in a  democracy."    He said he did not think it improper for military  representatives to join the panel because "they can present  another view on the panel".    "Don't you think military personnel are also Thai people who  are entitled to political rights?" he asked.    Gen Wimon said although he was a soldier, he could not be  barred from exercising his right under a democratic system.    "I have performed my duty under a democratic system and it  does not involve my military career."    Gen Wimon said he had not yet been officially informed  whether military representatives would be invited to join the  committee.    He said he personally would not sit on the committee.</p>

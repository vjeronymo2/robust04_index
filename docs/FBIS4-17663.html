			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council I. </F> Plyushch by Serhiy Pravdenko, HOLOS UKRAYINY editor in chief,  Eldar Seyidbekirov, and Svitlana Pysarenko for the newspapers  HOLOS UKRAYINY and GOLOS KRYMA on 13 April 1994; place not  given: "The People Are Looking Forward to Changes and Are  Associating These Changes With New Democratic Forces"]    [Text] [Question] Ivan Stepanovych, is it possible,  already today, to draw some conclusions on the elections. How  do you see the new parliament?    [Plyushch] I am generally pleased with the elections to the  new parliament, although I expected better results. Take, for  example, Kiev. The capital has remained as though uninvolved.  Only five out of 23 constituencies elected their deputies.  Many of the constituencies were 1,000, 1,500, or 2,000 voters  short each. This indicates that the elections were not properly  organized and that the election campaign was not sufficiently  well conducted.    I hope that Kievans do strive to create a law-governed state  and that they will express this striving at repeat elections by  taking part in the voting.    Regarding the political forces that came to the parliament,  this question is not a simple one. One should not make hasty  conclusions as though the "left-wing" or the "right-wing" forces  have prevailed. Had our society been structured as "left" and  "right" or in terms of parties, then some conclusions could be  drawn. More that 100 deputies from the "left-wing" forces have  come to the parliament -- representatives of the Communist  Party, Socialists Party, and Peasant Party. However, when I  went over their election platforms, I did not come across any  indication there that they had come to the Supreme Council in  order to fight it. They do not cast any aspersions on Ukraine's  strategic course. It is only a matter of changing tactics.    However, one cannot say that the democratic forces suffered  a  defeat. Talking about the defeat of Rukh [Ukraine's People's  Movement for Perestroyka], the Democratic Party, the Ukrainian  Republican Party, or the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party  -- it is true that the number of their deputies has dwindled.  Well, there are about 100 "left-wingers" and more than 50  "right-wingers." The total is about 150. How about the rest of  the elected deputies? I think that they constitute a healthy  center. In my opinion, this political force will constitute  that backbone to which both "left-wingers" and "right-wingers"  will cling. Perhaps, small "wings" of the "radical left" and of  the "radical right" will remain. It is a normal phenomenon.    Nor do I see a tragedy in the fact that many well-known  people's deputies failed to gain a victory at these elections.  Objectively, people are looking forward to changes and are  associating these changes, at the new stage, with new democratic  forces. Those deputies who have not been elected at the recent  elections have extensive experience and will be able to put it  to use by getting mandates of deputies in local councils as well  as in executive structures.    I was in favor of holding the elections during the fall of  1993. The level at which the democratic forces were at that time  was quite high and strong. We arrived at the elections at a  different and a lower level, when the so-called democratic  forces retreated from their positions somewhat. Unless  elections to the local power structures are held in June, the  situation will become further exacerbated. This is one of the  factors -- a political one. Here is another factor, just  appraise it. If one plans to contend at elections and wants to  get a mandate, he will work with double energy. If the time for  elections comes and one is not sure that he will be elected, he  will primarily resolve his personal problems.    Third, people are already looking forward to elections. It  is clear that those who want the process of development to be a  guided one and who do not want chaos to prevail are looking  forward to elections. The opinions became divided: Those who  are sure of themselves are in favor of elections, and those who  fear elections are against them. I believe that elections of  representative and executive bodies from villages to oblasts  will take place. Regarding presidential elections, it is not  such a burning question as it is presented. If the Supreme  Council approves the amendment to the Constitution and the prime  minister becomes head of the executive power and forms that  power, then is it really necessary to elect a president through  nationwide elections, or perhaps the president who is now in  office will continue fulfilling his functions? Meanwhile, the  Law on Ukrainian Presidential Elections is still in effect....    Unfortunately, the parliamentary elections proceeded against  the background of strained relations with Russia. You know,  after the first round of voting, I met with representatives of  the Russian State Duma and I thought that political forces that  realized that Ukraine was in earnest and forever were beginning  to prevail and win in Russia. However, for some reason,  recently, when gleams of political stability appeared in Ukraine  and when changes for the better started taking shape in the  economy, as we are already repaying our debt to Russia, despite  everything, certain political forces in Russia have made  themselves felt. Not only on the territory of the CIS, but also  far away from it, they stir up passions and impose upon  everybody their opinion that Ukraine cannot exist without Russia  and that Russia cannot exist without Ukraine. The Crimean card  is being played with increasing fervor.    [Question] How do you, Ivan Stepanovych assess the recent  events in the Crimea? What is your opinion of the institution  of presidency in the Crimea and the first steps taken by  [Crimean President] Yu. Meshkov -- the transition to the Moscow  time, the directive on the military service for the Crimeans on  the Crimean territory, and the dismissal of the Security Service  chief and the minister of internal affairs from their posts?    [Plyushch] You have formulated your question in a very  narrow way. The Crimean problem did not start with electing  Yuriy Meshkov as president of the Crimea. It is older than  that. Of course, I do not claim to be the only owner of the  truth. However, as a citizen and a political figure, I cannot  remain silent. My conclusion is as follows: It is a  well-planned and coordinated action on the part of certain  political forces in Russia that have inherited the  aforementioned qualities from the former Soviet Union. I think  that it will not be long before we learn the truth about this.  Only then will we assess objectively everything that is going  on in the Crimea; this is just a fraction of the large-scale  operation. Journalists will find a name for it.    I recommend that you read the interview with Lieutenant  General Lebed in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. He thoroughly imbibed  everything that has been going on in the former Soviet Union  during recent years and what is going on now. In my opinion,  Lieutenant General Lebed, who was in charge of individual  operations, wants the people to know the truth. A reporter  asked him why he had started writing (this frontline general  writes books), and he replied that he hoped that the people  would stop and think of how to put life in order in such a  colossally large country as Russia with its 150-million  population. If this figure -- 150 million -- had not been  mentioned, I would still have doubts as to what country he had  in mind.... He was only talking about Russia. First, build  life in your own country and then pacify, teach, and improve  others. It is not Russia that must unilaterally resolve  problems of the former Union. The CIS had to do this. However,  nothing has been resolved over more than two years. The  Dniester Region, according to him, is the problem for Moldovans  and Russians and the Crimea -- for Russia and Ukraine. How  about Baykonur? [President of Kazakhstan] Nursultan Nazarbayev  is an intelligent person. An agreement for leasing Baykonur was  concluded, and billions [monetary unit not specified] were hoped  for. Where from? Where can a country that imports much of its  foodstuffs get this much money? Well, the CIS had to tackle the  problems of the Black Sea Fleet, the Crimea, the Dniester  Region, Abkhazia, and so on. Just a few years ago, Gorbachev  repeatedly said: "Don't you worry, this will also start in  Ukraine." Some people now want this to start. Even in Russia's  embassies much is done to shape the opinion in the United States  and in developed Western countries to the effect that it is  impossible to separate Ukraine from Russia.    On the television, they show, close-up, Chernomyrdin and  Kebich signing the agreement on common currency. Nobody is  saying how they understand it. The ECU in the European  Community did not emerge right away, but only after  corresponding conditions were created and only for interstate  settlements, whereas the states have retained their national  currencies. In the CIS, attempts are being made to draw the  countries into the ruble zone. This is also one of the  fundamental problems that the CIS must resolve.    The same applies to the Crimean issue. Who can determine  today which of the peoples residing in the Crimea has more right  to talk about itself as the people of the Crimea? The Crimean  Tatar population is speaking about its autonomy. Undoubtedly,  it has every reason for this. Today, hardly anybody would  disagree with the fact that 50 years ago, a crime was committed  against this people -- a whole people. It took almost half a  century for this people to be rehabilitated; apologies were made  to them, and they were offered to come and settle [in the  Crimea]. However, it was Suslov's ideology. In adopting this  decision, they did not think that it needed to be fulfilled. It  was simply a political step, like yet another noisy campaign; to  say one thing, to write something else, and to do something  entirely different.    Furthermore, some people say that the Russian-speaking  population residing in the Crimea is the troublemaker. In the  course of the implementation of the specific Soviet national  policy, the Crimea and Sevastopol were specially colonized by  Russians. How can these people inhabiting the peninsula be  accused of anything, these people who previously served for 15  or 20 years in the cold seas? They knew that, after the  service, they would live in warm Sevastopol under the gentle  Crimean sun. Or take Tauria, the northern part of the Crimea,  where Ukrainians constitute one-third of the population; did  they ever think that they would see the times when somebody  would try to determine whether or not they are indigenous,  whether they have the right to live in the Crimea, and whether  they side with Ukraine or with Russia? It never occurred to  them. I know the moods of those people.    I am sure that the Crimean population understands all of  this. Look, Moldova has changed its stand and held elections.  There were 75 percent of voters, they elected the parliament,  and embarked upon the road toward development. They don't even  think about [uniting with] Romania. What should the Dniester  Region do? Where to go? Russia does not accept it. Nor does  Ukraine. We have an agreement with Moldova, and we cannot  violate it. The same may happen to the Crimea -- as is  happening in Abkhazia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. This  must be realized by those high-ranking officials, who cannot  properly handle their presentation weapons, which go off inside  their pockets [an allusion to commander of the Black Sea Fleet  Admiral E. Baltin].    [Question] Ivan Stepanovych, in 1991, at an assembly of the  Crimean Tatars -- Kurultay -- a Majlis was elected and granted  the status of a supreme plenipotentiary representative body. At  the recent elections to the Crimean Supreme Council, where the  quota was 14 seats, the Majlis actually received all the  mandates. Do you find it expedient to recognize the Majlis as a  supreme representative body?    [Plyushch] I will, perhaps, disappoint you. I have deep  respect for Dzhemilev and Chubarov, leaders of the Majlis.  However, as an official, I am responsible for maintaining peace  and calm in the state -- among the Crimean Tatars, among the  Russians, and among the Ukrainians. If, as you are saying, the  Majlis is recognized as a representative body of the Crimean  Tatar population, this would not do any good either to the  Crimean Tatars themselves, to the Russians, or to the  Ukrainians. It would lead to hostility and confrontation.    A certain protocol must be followed in intrastate and  interstate relations. I will quote an example. Before leaving  for the celebration of the 72d anniversary of Turkey's Great  National Assembly, I included Kurashyk, who was at that time  chairman of the Crimean Council of Ministers, in the delegation.  However, it was quite embarrassing for me when, among the state  delegations that took part in the festivities, I also saw a  Crimean delegation with Dzhemilev and Chubarov at the head. It  was regarded as a state delegation. They should have officially  made proposals on the composition of the Ukrainian delegation,  taking into account Dzhemilev's and Chubarov's long-standing and  close ties with Turkey. Then everything would have been entirely  different. As it were, the situation might be regarded as a  challenge to Ukraine.    Later, I had a conversation with the president of Turkey. I  thanked him for his understanding of the problems of the Crimea  and Crimean Tatars, who were settling in the Crimea, and for the  intention to provide assistance to Ukraine for resolving urgent  and vital issues of the Crimean Tatar population -- the building  of housing, reclamation of land, arrival in the homeland, and so  on.    I would like to thank the peninsula's Crimean Tatar  population and the Majlis for the well-balanced policy it has  been pursuing over recent years. Believe me, my attitude toward  the Crimean Tatar autonomy is precisely the same as toward the  Crimean Russian, or, for example, Crimean Ukrainian autonomies.  Yuriy Meshkov gives preference to the Crimean Russian autonomy,  Chubarov, and Dzhemilev to the Crimean Tatar one. I want an  Autonomous Crimean Republic within Ukraine.    [Question] They say that Crimean autonomy has become a  precursor for Ukraine's federalization. What is your attitude  toward this and how do you assess the situation?    [Plyushch] The Crimea is one thing and Ukraine's  federalization is something different altogether. Do not link  the Crimea to federalization. Even though the law "On the  Division of Powers Among the State Bodies of Ukraine and the  Crimea" with changes and additions to it is the first stage in  the development of future federal principles of organizational  administration in Ukraine, the division of functions among the  Cabinet of Ministers and central power structures, on the one  hand, and regional bodies of executive power and  self-government, on the other hand, may become the next step.  How many years this is going to take will depend upon the  course of reforms. How can there be any talk about a federal  structure in the conditions when central organs govern 70  percent of property. When people think in the following terms:  If we speak Russian, our pension will double and if Ukrainian  it will be in coupons [karbovantsi]. Who talks of a  federalization here?    Our society needs to mature. This is my opinion: If we are  in favor of a democratic and law-governed state, then we are in  favor of a federal structure. If we advocate an administrative  command system -- this means a unitary system. This is largely  how things are.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 21 (XINHUA) -- A new geothermal field  of 840 sq m [square meters] has been discovered near this north  China port city.    According to a local energy official, a three-year survey of  geothermal reserves in the area is well on its way to completion.    Geologists say the temperature at the well mouth of the  "Shanlinzi" geothermal field, which is the second-biggest after  the Wanglanzhuang field, that has ever discovered in this city,  is between 75 and 96 degrees centigrade.    The amount of heat that can be used is equivalent to that  given off by 12.23 million tons of standard coal, they claim.    The exploration of geothermal resources in this area started  in the 1970s. To date, some 14 thermal wells have been drilled  and tap to serve industry, agriculture and animal husbandry,  tourism and daily life of local people.    Tianjin boasts rich geothermal resources, and some ten  geothermal fields have been found. They cover a total area of  3,074 sq m and have a total hot water reserve of 7.876 cu m  [cubic meters].</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Star Mining Dollars 250m Russian gold investment to go ahead Star Mining, the small Australian exploration company, has signed a protocol in Angarsk, Siberia, which it believed protects its interest in the large Sukhoi Log gold project, and paves the way for its USDollars 250m Russian investment plan to go ahead. Star said that 'in the light of these very positive developments', it expected to release the first USDollars 5m tranche of capital to Lenzoloto, the state-controlled Siberian goldminer in which it holds a minority interest, this week. In Sydney, Mr Graeme Ellis, a director of Star, expected the payment to go ahead tomorrow. Star, which holds a one-third interest in Lenzoloto (sometimes translated as Lena Gold), has pledged to provide USDollars 20m of 'charter capital' to the Russian joint-stock company. However, the money has been in an escrow account in Moscow while political uncertainties hanging over the Siberian project were negotiated, and the release of technical information related to Lenzoloto was authorised. Last year Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Russia's precious metals and stones committee, said foreign companies would be excluded from developing the Sukhoi Log deposit, reckoned to be one of the world's biggest gold deposits. However, Star said it believed the protocol 'will resolve all outstanding disputes concerning the development of the . . . deposit and the re-registration of mining and exploration licences'. It said it was 'expressly agreed' that, while the regional Irkutsk administration and the ministry of atomic energy would participate in the Sukhoi Log development, 'this would be done in such a way that Star retains its present shareholding'. This amounts to a one-third interest via the Lenzoloto investment. Although Lenzoloto has operations which produce around 350,000 ounces of gold a year as well as other development projects, these are dwarfed by the Sukhoi Log potential. With the injection of Star's USDollars 250m, the aim is to raise Lenzoloto's annual production to 2m ounces in six years. About three-quarters would come from Sukhoi Log. Mr Ellis said yesterday Star was likely to seek a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange in 'the near future'.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Ifo says Germany is not in recession: Munich economic institute believes recovery could start from mid-year THE GERMAN economy is not in recession, in spite of three consecutive quarters of contraction, according to the highly respected Ifo economic institute in Munich. The chances are that the economy will avoid the full extent of the downturn being experienced in other industrialised countries, and start to recover from the middle of the year, the institute's researchers conclude. The current downturn amounts to a cyclical weakening, but it looks worse than it is because it includes a technical correction from the extra ordinary economic expansion in the first quarter of 1991, according to the latest assessment by the institute. However, its cautiously optimistic forecast coincided yesterday with a renewed stern warning from the German Bundesbank that no relaxation in monetary policy could be The central bank's governing council yesterday took no action on interest rates at its fortnightly meeting, but later Mr Otmar Issing, a full board director, warned businessmen in Duisburg that the 4 per cent rate of inflation remained 'highly unsatisfactory'. Every additional burden on public spending which was not matched by a reduction in state consumption and subsidies 'must endanger the further economic development and stability in Germany, and exacerbate the task of monetary policy,' he said. Ifo says that recession should be defined according to capacity utilisation in the economy, rather than changes in the rate of economic growth. On that basis, the high point of the current German cycle was reached in autumn 1990, when industrial capacity utilisation reached 90 per cent. In spite of a gradual decline since then, the average capacity utilisation still stood at 86.8 per cent in December, 1991, compared with levels below 80 per cent seen in previous German recessions. As far as growth of real gross national product is concerned, the first quarter of 1991 saw an annualised growth of no less than 10 per cent, thanks to a mild winter and a sudden inflow of foreign capital. The contraction in the next two quarters was essentially a technical correction. Only in the last quarter was there a real slowdown, it says. In Ifo's view recovery depends on the world economy picking up from mid-year. That should coincide with a recovery in private consumer demand in west Germany, thanks to higher child allowances and the end of the 'solidarity surcharge' on income tax to pay for unification. It warns, however, that its own indices of business confidence, business expectations, and industrial orders all point to a more prolonged slowdown. 'Even if the panic-mongering with the code-word 'recession' is unjustified, more attention is still needed to be paid to the risks in the Germany economy,' it concludes. KRUPP HAS emerged as a clear favourite to take over east Germany's largest steelmill, EKO, at Eisenhuttenstadt on the Polish border, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin. Mr Hans Kramer, a executive board member of the Treuhand privatisation agency, said yesterday: 'We give Krupp the advantage,' although he cautioned that the consortium of Thyssen, Peine-Salzgitter and Hoogovens (Netherlands) could not be ruled out if there were last minute changes. The agency's supervisory board will take the final decision on February 27. The German Finance Ministry will also have to approve the deal along with the European Commission; both have indicated they will go along with the conditions of the sale. Mr Kramer said Krupp planned to invest more than DM1bn (Pounds 300m) to modernise EKO and add badly-needed rolling mills. Bids by two Italian steel companies, Ilva and Arvedi, had been eliminated after the proposals arrived piecemeal and too late, he added.</p>

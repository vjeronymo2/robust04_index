			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Mundial to be fully privatised in late March MUNDIAL Confianca, one of Portugal's top three insurance companies with an estimated turnover of Es32bn (Dollars 237m) in 1991, will be fully privatised in the second half of March, the government announced this week. Several other privatisations, including the sale of an initial stake in Petrogal, the oil group and the country's largest company, and the completion of the sale of Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa, Portugal's third largest bank that was 40 per cent privatised last year, are also expected soon. Conditions for the sale of 51 per cent in Petrogal are due to be announced next week. This year, the government plans to accelerate its privatisation programme with the sale or partial sale of 18 companies which it hopes will raise about Es350bn. Since the programme began in 1989, the government has raised Es370bn from 14 big privatisations. The sale of Mundial will be split into three tranches with a starting price of Es3,500 for a single indivisible block of shares representing 40 per cent of the company's share capital. The other 60 per cent will be divided among employees, small investors and overseas investors who will be reserved 25 per cent of the shares, and general investors for the remaining 35 per cent of the shares. Employees will be offered shares at a fixed price of Es2,925 per share, and foreign and small investors at Es3,100 per share. The starting price for general investors will be Es3,250 per share. Foreign investors will be limited to a maximum 25 per cent of the privatised shares, though they can join up with Portuguese groups in bidding for the single block of shares or/and buy shares from the tranche aimed at general investors. Several groups have already indicated interest in Mundial including Banco Totta &amp; Acores, a Portuguese bank in which Spain's Banesto has a large stake, Allianz, the German insurance group, and Mr Antonio Champalimaud, a Portuguese entrepreneur and former owner of the company before its nationalisation in 1975. Sociedade de Construcoes Soares da Costa, Portugal's biggest civil construction company, yesterday said 1991 pre-tax profits had topped Es2.5bn compared with Es2.05bn in 1990, Reuter reports from Lisbon. Turnover for 1991 was over Es55bn against Es50.6bn the previous year.</p>

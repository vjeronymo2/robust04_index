			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: SNP sees 40% of vote as a mandate THE Scottish National Party needs the support of 40 per cent of the electorate to win a mandate to negotiate independence for Scotland, Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said yesterday. The party calculates that it could win the majority of Scotland's 72 seats with 40 per cent of the votes cast on April 9. This would give the party a moral authority to act on its programme for independence within the framework of the European Community, Mr Salmond said. He added he was 'very confident' that the ICM poll in the Scotsman last week which gave the SNP 28 per cent was right, and that a Mori poll in the Sunday Times, which showed the party on 24 per cent, had got it wrong. Both polls had showed Labour in the lead with 42 per cent. He said that in the election of October 1974, the SNP had started with poll ratings of 22 per cent, but had won 30 per cent of the actual vote, which gave it 11 MPs. The SNP holds five Scottish parliamentary seats. It had 14 per cent of the vote in the 1987 election. Since then, it has gained Glasgow Govan from Labour in a by-election and Dunfermline West through the defection of Mr Dick Douglas, the sitting MP, from Labour. Mr Salmond, who was launching the SNP's general election campaign in Edinburgh, said the party was optimistic of achieving its 40 per cent in spite of the amount of ground it still had to gain. 'The Scottish National Party enters this election full of confidence and the will to win. We are not running for a place, we are not campaigning for a hung parliament, we are campaigning for a mandate for Scottish independence,' he said. Mr Salmond said that the future of Scotland was the biggest issue in this election campaign, and claimed that the SNP was setting the agenda for all the other parties. PLAID CYMRU, the Welsh Nationalist party, began its election campaign with a call for extra help for small businesses in Wales. Mr Ieuan Wyn Jones, MP for the Isle of Anglesey in the last parliament, said the most important economic benefit for the Welsh economy would be the end of the uniform business rate.</p>

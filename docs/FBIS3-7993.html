Let us follow the report by correspondent Armir  Shkurti.    [Shkurti] At the beginning of this meeting, Luan Shahollari,  chairman of the PS Managing Committee for Tirana, said that the  meeting was organized to detail the questions set forward in the  party's second national conference as well as to protest against  the violation of basic human rights and freedoms. Mr.  Shahollari stated that the PS second conference decided on a new  political solution -- to hold new, early elections. Among the  main questions treated in the second conference, the speaker  selected the establishment of a social market economy instead of  a free market, the attitude toward the national question, and  the PS's international stance as a branch of the European left.    At the end of his speech, Mr. Shahollari considered the  solitary confinement of former Prime Minister Fatos Nano by the  court to be unjust and requested his release.    PS Deputy Chairman Servet Pellumbi mentioned once again  early  elections as a new political solution. Mr. Pellumbi called on  the PS to be a force capable of stepping up the democratic  processes. That is why he requested it to listen more to the  voice of the opposition and practice political dialogue. Mr.  Pellumbi also considered the arrest of former Premier Fatos Nano  to be unjust and asked his immediate release. Later, the  meeting focused only on the demand to release former Prime  minister Fatos Nano.    Mr. Namik Dokle mentioned documents and messages of  international institutions in support of Nano.    At the end of the meeting, a protest addressed to the  highest  institutions of the Albanian state and to international  organizations was read. In the name of the PS members and  sympathizers in the city, the protest considered the arrest of  former Prime Minister Nano unfair. At the end, the protest  declared that the PS members and sympathizers in the capital  will continue to protest this case with all democratic ways and  means.</p>

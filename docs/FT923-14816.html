			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: European banks With the future of the Maastricht Treaty still a matter of debate, it might seem premature to speculate on the European financial scene after currency union. But as the Community moves towards the establishment of a European central bank in Germany, it is difficult to ignore the implications altogether. The European banking industry, for example, would be confronted with a world in which monetary conditions were uniform from Lisbon to Lubeck regardless of the state of the local economy. In countries where membership of the system made money excessively tight, as is already the case in the UK under the ERM, the banking industry would be in for a rough time. Indeed, the once proud national names of European banking would become vulnerable to the sort of problems that afflict regional banks in the US. The national economies of Europe may be less interdependent than the state economies of the US, where, for example, Massachussetts has grown to rely heavily on the defence industry. But if the single market produces the intended rationalisation of European industry, similar concentrations could appear on this side of the Atlantic. Moreover, the US has at least a centralised support system both in the form of deposit insurance and through the Federal Reserve's role as lender of last resort. The European vogue for subsidiarity may reduce the political appeal of such a centralised approach. The message for Europe's banks is that they need to spread their activities more widely around the Community to balance the risks from currency union. So far, progress has been slow, largely because banking cultures differ so widely from one member state to another. Indeed, the trend has if anything been inward looking, with the emphasis on domestic mergers in markets from the Netherlands to Spain, Italy and - if Lloyds had had its way with Midland  -the UK. That is fine as long as it is a first step towards a broader European approach. If not, bigger local banks will simply incur bigger local risks as the single currency comes into circulation.</p>

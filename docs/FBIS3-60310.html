			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been over six years since the disastrous  Chernobyl breakdown, which is compared by some specialists to a  nuclear war. Meanwhile, other dramatic events have shaken the  world, and the international community has forgotten the  Chernobyl nuclear plant. Ukraine has been left almost alone  with its post- Chernobyl problems, which, despite all the  forecasts, do not disappear, but grow in numbers. It is not  possible to cope with the scope of tasks without help. The  Supreme Council Committee for Issues of the Chernobyl Aftermath  has held a press conference for Ukrainian and foreign  journalists devoted to these problems.    A new problem has appeared, in addition to the old ones,  reported Professor Kopeykin, who has been working in Chernobyl  since the first days of the disaster, often without any  remuneration. All forecasts on the disintegration of  radioactive fall-out were too optimistic. Nobody was  anticipating that disintegrated plutonium would appear, but the  professor found it in the vicinity of the "red forest" in 1989.  Dangerous derivatives of plutonium decay were discovered --  americium and curium. The issue of including americium in the  legislation concerning Chernobyl aftereffects is currently on  the agenda. Due to americium's inclination to migrate, the  resettlement zone may be expanded.    After all, no one knows where will the winds blow from...  Additionally, another issue seems very strange: Why are we  calling on the international community to cooperate in  liquidating the aftereffects of the disaster, while  simultaneously adopting a resolution on continued operation of  the Chernobyl nuclear power plant? Will the radioactive threat  be more compelling this way? There is already enough evidence --  strontium can be found near Turkey and Italy, not mentioning CIS  countries. It is quite understandable why the Belarusian  legislature issued a statement objecting to the resolution. The  entire world, not only our neighbors, has criticized our  position on this issue...    Explanations such us "if we stop the Chernobyl plant, we  will  freeze in the winter" are naive. As Volodymyr Usatenko, head of  the Committee for Scientific, Social, and Legal Issues,  emphasized, power units at the Chernobyl power plant, which are  using 70 percent of their capabilities due to various  malfunctions, are not even able to provide heat for the northern  part of Kiev Oblast. To purchase five-year supplies of fuel for  the plant, Ukraine needs 350 billion rubles, and it simply does  not have such money...    Last year, pointed out Deputy Attorney General Olha Kolinko,  no official of the five ministries that are responsible for  liquidating Chernobyl aftereffects visited the troubled zone,  which is becoming a zone of crime.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FORMER UCI ACTIVIST MARCHES NO MORE BUT REMAINS TRUE TO IDEALS  </P> <P> Michael Krisman emerged as one of the best-known activists in the UCI class of  '69. He organized boycotts, sit-ins and other demonstrations against the  Vietnam War and the university's faculty hiring and other policies.  </P> <P> He was a prominent member of the campus chapter of the militant Students for a  Democratic Society. He joined in street protests at the 1968 Democratic  Convention in Chicago, and later that year took an unauthorized trip to Cuba.  </P> <P> Even after his graduation as a history major, he remained at the center of  controversy.  </P> <P> Off-campus conservative groups demanded that Krisman -- just hired as a UCI  staff coordinator for academic advising -- be fired.  </P> <P> "Oh, I still remember the big headlines and about how the John Birch and other  groups made me out as some kind of wild radical -- which I wasn't," recalls  Krisman, 47, who now lives in Sacramento and is principal consultant to the  California Assembly Committee on Housing and Community Development.  </P> <P> But Krisman won that battle, thanks to the backing of then-UCI Chancellor  Daniel G. Aldrich Jr., who stressed that the activist was well-qualified.  </P> <P> While he no longer takes part in protest marches, Krisman has remained a  dedicated activist. For the past 15 years, he has continued to "work within the  system," seeking reforms in such areas as farm labor, low-cost medical care,  consumer advocacy and affordable housing. He has worked as administrator, field  aide or consultant for various state agencies or commissions.  </P> <P> "That was my way of doing things back at UCI. I was never a hard-core radical;  I was always seeking change but not disruption," he says. "I wanted to avoid  the excesses and intolerance of people on either side, left or right."  </P> <P> In 1965, he started out as a "pleasant, Young Democrats kind of student." And  as a former Army paratrooper, he was a backer of the Vietnam War at first. But  the activism at Irvine and within the broader protest movement soon transformed  him.  </P> <P> In the late '60s, he "grew up intellectually and socially -- a kind of quantum  leap in awareness for me and a lot of other people."  </P> <P> Krisman looks forward to attending the coming reunion of the class of '69 with  a mixture of curiosity and anticipation. "I still feel close to UC Irvine," he  says. "Orange County still fascinates me."  </P> <P> Students today see the '60s as ancient history, he says. "Today, there is no  real commitment to the community. It's all self-gratification and greed."  </P> <P> Still, there are some consolations, says Krisman, who is married with three  children.  </P> <P> "My older kids do realize they enjoy greater personal freedom," he says. "And  that, I tell them, they can thank the '60s for."  </P></p>

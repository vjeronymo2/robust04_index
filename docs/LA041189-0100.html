			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> FORD CHAIRMAN'S EARNINGS: $10.5 MILLION  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Petersen earned $10.5 million in compensation  last year, mainly from exercising stock options, the company said Monday.  </P> <P> Separately, Ford announced the appointments of three new executive vice  presidents including Allan Gilmour, who is considered Petersen's likely  successor.  </P> <P> The compensation for Petersen and four other top executives was detailed in  Ford's annual proxy statement, which is being mailed to shareholders in advance  of the company's May 11 annual meeting.  </P> <P> Ford was the nation's most profitable auto maker last year with earnings of  $5.3 billion.  </P> <P> Petersen got $3.3 million in salary, bonuses and other benefits and gained $7.2  million from exercising stock options last year. His compensation topped the  $3.7 million Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca received for 1988.  </P> <P> Ford President Harold Poling earned $4.1 million, including $2.6 million in  salary and other compensation and $1.5 million from exercised stock options.  </P> <P> Last year, Ford reported that Petersen exercised no stock options and received  $3.7 million. Poling last year exercised stock options worth $8 million and  received $10.9 million in total compensation.  </P> <P> United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber and Vice President Stephen Yokich,  who heads the union's Ford Department, criticized the payments as part of  "Detroit's annual executive pigout."  </P> <P> "We think it would be far better advised to invest in new facilities and hire  more employees rather than squander valuable resources on trying to keep up  with the 'junk bond' barons," they said in a statement.  </P> <P> The salaries, supplemental compensation payments and stock options of other  Ford officers listed in Monday's proxy statement:  </P> <P> * Louis R. Ross, executive vice president for North American automotive  operations and named Monday as executive vice president for international  automotive operations, $3.5 million.  </P> <P> * Philip Benton, executive vice president and president of the Ford Automotive  Group, $3 million.  </P> <P> * Gilmour, Ross' predecessor in international operations who was appointed  executive vice president for corporate staffs, $1.7 million.  </P> <P> Because Gilmour was the only one of the three also named to the office of the  chief executive -- which is shared by Petersen, Poling and Executive Vice  President Stanley Seneker, the company's chief financial officer -- he is seen  as the likely choice to succeed Petersen when he reaches Ford's mandatory  retirement age of 65 in the fall of 1991.  </P> <P> At the end of March, Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Sr., grandson of the  company's founder, retired from the company and his title was eliminated. Ford,  who was a member of the office of the chief executive, will remain a member of  the company's board of directors.  </P> <P> The appointments of Gilmour, Ross and Alexander Trotman, who succeeds Ross,  become effective May 1.  </P></p>

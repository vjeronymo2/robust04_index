			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU reforms lift farmers' incomes Reform of the common agricultural policy boosted farm incomes last year, the European Commission said yesterday. The commission published initial estimates based on accounts from 58,000 farms across the European Union which showed an overall decline in income of 1.2 per cent last year. But sectors subjected to the 1992 MacSharry reforms moved strongly against the trend. According to the Eurostat figures, incomes in the beef and cattle sector rose by as much as 25 per cent last year compared with 1992, while specialised cereal farmers enjoyed an 11 per cent increase and dairy farmers saw a 7 per cent rise. Mr Rene Steichen, EU farm commissioner, said the commission's analysis of the figures 'clearly indicates that the production sectors subject to reform experienced a significant income increase in 1993'. This runs counter to popular belief among farmers that the reforms, which cut price supports to reduce production and introduced direct income payments or livestock payments in compensation, would be financially painful. Mr Steichen accepted that the reforms were not the only reason why incomes had risen but added: 'The figures nonetheless confirm the positive benefits for farmers of improving market balance, as well as the income stabilisation effect of direct payments'. The agricultural sectors that suffered most last year receive only light support from the CAP or have not yet been reformed. Pig and poultry farmers took a 37 per cent knock to their incomes while horticulturalists were down 8 per cent and wine-makers suffered a 14 per cent decline. Incomes varied enormously between member states, according to the Eurostat figures, with a rise of over 15 per cent in the UK contrasting with a fall of nearly 15 per cent in Germany and 11.7 per cent in the Netherlands. The UK benefited from currency devaluation, which pushed up the value of Ecu-based payments, and is heavily dependent on sectors that underwent reform. Germany and the Netherlands produce a lot of pigmeat, wine and vegetables between them, the sectors that suffered last year. The commission qualified the overall income drop of 1.2 per cent, pointing out that farmers received only 86 per cent of the direct payments due to them during 1993.</p>

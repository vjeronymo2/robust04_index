			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Petition for Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A petition was received on October 15, 1992, from the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE), Local No. 2, requesting an amendment to the radiography regulations to require a minimum of two radiographic personnel when performing industrial radiography at temporary jobsites. The petition was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57392). Thirty-eight comment letters were received, 35 were in favor of granting the petition. Resolution of this petition has been addressed in this proposed revision to part 34.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IUOE petition offered three options for the makeup of the two-person crew: (1) Two radiographers; (2) one radiographer and one radiographer's assistant; and (3) one radiographer and one trainee, with the trainee having completed 40 hours of approved radiation safety training and passed an examination. The petitioners identified a number of problems associated with the use of licensed material by one radiographer at temporary jobsites. These problems included: (1) Difficulty keeping the area under constant surveillance while radiographic operations are ongoing; (2) difficulty in maintaining surveillance when working in trenches; and (3) difficulty in obtaining assistance in the event of an emergency if there is only one individual. The petitioners believe that the suggested change is necessary to ensure a safe working environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments received raised concerns regarding the combination of a radiographer and a trainee as a two-person team. Many stated that the trainee is an unskilled individual that may or may not achieve radiographer status and spending the time and money for 40 hours training may not be financially feasible for some radiography companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule, if adopted, would constitute a partial granting of the petition in that it proposes to require, at a minimum, a two-person crew whenever radiographic operations are being conducted outside of a permanent radiographic installation. The NRC has decided not to adopt the term ``radiographer trainee,'' and is proposing that the second person be another qualified radiographer or an individual who has met, at a minimum, the requirements for a radiographer's assistant. The NRC recognizes that, in Agreement States, the training of those individuals designated as trainees would meet the NRC's training requirements for a radiographer's assistant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated cost of requiring the two-person crew could be significant for licensees who send only one radiographer to a temporary jobsite. However, the current regulation requires direct surveillance of the operation to prevent unauthorized entry into a high radiation area. To comply with this regulation most licensees already must use more than one qualified individual in many situations. For certain circumstances where a licensee could demonstrate that adequate surveillance can be maintained by one radiographer, the Commission could consider granting an exemption through the process described in the proposed &sect;34.111. The Commission is concerned that this requirement could cause a significant impact on a number of small entities which currently do not use two-person crews, and is soliciting comments on the potential impact. Furthermore, the Commission is interested in receiving proposals for alternatives to the two-person requirement which would achieve comparable enhancements in safety with less of a burden on licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the Commission believes that by requiring at least two qualified individuals to always be present when radiographic operations are being conducted, there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational safety measures and emergency procedures will be effectively implemented. The expectation is that violations involving failures to perform adequate radiation surveys of radiographic exposure devices and the surrounding area, failures to adequately post and monitor the restricted area, and failures to lock and secure the camera when not in use will become less frequent. Furthermore, if an incapacitating injury to a radiographer should occur at a remote location, the presence of a second individual could be an important factor in preventing unnecessary radiation exposures. The Commission is considering amending the Enforcement Policy as a result of this proposed rulemaking to provide, as an example of a Severity Level III violation, the conduct of radiography operations without the required second radiographer or individual with, at least, the qualifications of a radiographer's assistant as provided in the proposed &sect;34.41.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

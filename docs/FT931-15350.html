			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Serb leader agrees to peace plan for Bosnia: Assembly's approval needed THE Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic last night accepted a constitutional framework that could end the war in the republic, subject to approval within seven days by the Bosnian Serb parliament. In a dramatic reversal of his earlier rejection of a plan put forward by international mediators, Mr Karadzic's decision came only hours after talks in Geneva had been brought to the brink of collapse. His agreement to the constitutional principles was announced in a communique issued by the spokesman for Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of the rump Yugoslav federation, which comprises Serbia and Montenegro. According to Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman, it should open the way to adoption of the overall peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the conference, which includes an ending of hostilities and division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into a state with 10 semi-autonomous provinces. Mr Eckhard said: 'Our assumption is that the constitutional agreement is an icebreaker.' He added that the negotiations on the other two agreements would now go forward with a 'certain momentum'. He expected the military agreement to be the easiest to complete since it was 'already 95 per cent done'. It was clear from the communique that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, and Mr Cosic, who had been asked by the co-chairmen to join the negotiations between the warring factions in Bosnia, had played a crucial role in swaying Mr Karadzic. The communique spoke of 'the insistence' of the two presidents 'proceeding from the interests of the Serbian people for a peaceful solution to the crisis'. Mr Milosevic said on leaving the talks: 'I must say that we have realised a very essential, very important step towards peace.' The draft constitutional principles accepted by Mr Karadzic recognise 'three constituent peoples' in Bosnia - Serbs, Moslems and Croats - and state that the proposed provinces into which Bosnia would be divided would not be able to formulate foreign policy. Mr Karadzic made clear he had been persuaded that the provinces would have a wide measure of autonomy. 'You could say there will be many states within a state. We are going to present it (the deal) honestly to our assembly and I do think it is going to pass.' Mr Karadzic told BBC radio last night that he would resign if the Bosnian Serb parliament rejected the plan. However, he said he still objected to the proposal to place all heavy weapons under UN control. Earlier, any prospects for a peaceful solution seemed to have disappeared. Mr Vance and Lord Owen said that Mr Karadzic had resisted pressure from all sides to accept the constitutional principles. Pressure from Major, Page 8</p>

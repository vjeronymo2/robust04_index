Zemskov, candidate of military </F> sciences: "Combined Arms Battle: Security and Defense of  Military Posts and Installations"]    [Text] Many regions of the country today are characterized  by an unstable, criminogenic situation. The number of grave  crimes, including piratical attacks using all kinds of firearms  and silent weapons, has risen sharply.    Experience of recent years shows that criminal elements are  choosing military installations as "promising" targets more and  more often: housing areas, storage areas with stockpiles of  supplies and military property, and weapon and ammunition  arsenals. Attacks on guardhouses, unit checkpoints, small posts,  assigned personnel of on-duty services and the daily detail, and  on individual servicemen have stepped up considerably.    Investigations of the enumerated incidents permit concluding  that a rehearsed system of forcible seizure of weapons and  combat equipment has taken shape in a number of areas where  troops are stationed. A planned attack usually is preceded by a  thorough study of the installation and its security system and a  detailed coordination of the criminals' actions. In essence,  organized groups and entire units are active, especially in "hot  spots." Unit details and subunits supporting a  state-of-emergency regime are subjected to simultaneous attack.  There have been cases of seizure of weapons and military  property by individual citizens.    To achieve their criminal schemes, the bandits study the  security system: procedure and time of sentry relief, terrain in  the vicinity of installations, nature of their outfitting with  technical and engineer equipment, and organization of  communications. For example, an attack was made twice in the  course of a month on one of the Moscow garrison units to seize  weapons. An investigation showed that the criminals were well  informed concerning the security system and the procedure for  sentries' performance of duties and their relief.    Other techniques also are used, such as provocations with  hostages (wives and children of servicemen) used for an  unhindered approach to bases, arsenals and other installations,  and bribery of soldiers and of servicing and maintenance  personnel. All this has been done in Georgia and in other  republics and areas.    A brief survey of attempts and an analysis of methods used  confirm the urgent need for improving all work connected with  organizing troop duties in units and subunits. Reliable security  and defense of installations and military posts should be  ensured above all through proper, regulation assignment of  routine garrison duty and guard duty. The latter holds a special  place in troop life and activity. It must be regarded as  performance of a combat mission in peacetime and it must become  an important condition for maintaining high combat readiness and  a subject of constant concern of the commander and staff.    The problem of which we are speaking is rather vast and  impossible to cover in one article. Therefore I will dwell in  more detail only on the substance of the concept and certain  recommendations of a practical nature.    Security and defense of installations represent a complex of  troop actions coordinated by goal, place and time in combination  with technical, engineer and other measures. They are conducted  to ensure safety of installations, keep outsiders from  penetrating to them, and prevent seizure and loss of military  property.    Technical and engineer measures consist of the arrangement,  installation, proper operation and further upgrading of various  technical and engineer security equipment. This equipment  includes structures, obstacles and the following systems:  signalling, communications, automatic equipment, telemechanics,  mechanization, lighting and surveillance.    In organizing troop duties, the commander must see to it  that  installation security meets modern requirements--reliability,  continuity of effect, activeness and flexibility--and has  necessary depth.    Reliability is that state of security which precludes the  possibility of intruders penetrating into installations or the  illegal transporting (carrying) of arms and other military  property from them. It is achieved by skilled construction of  the security system, use of its most advisable methods, proper  organization and precise performance of duty, maintaining high  combat readiness of subunits and guard details, appropriate  training of personnel, and constantly keeping technical and  engineer security equipment in operating condition.    Continuity of security is where each installation checkpoint  and perimeter sector is under surveillance and covered by  particular forces and assets at any time.    Activeness of security presumes a wide maneuver of forces,  assets and fire, and also decisive actions of subunits, guard  details and sentries for ensuring reliability of installation  defense.    Flexibility of security consists of reacting promptly to a  change in the situation and concentrating efforts on avenues of  the most likely intruder actions.    Depth of security is that disposition of forces and assets  which provides for detaining intruders in or near the restricted  area. This is achieved by an optimum distribution of forces and  assets to lines of the zone and by assigning areas of  responsibility to guards outside the installation when the  situation becomes complicated.    With respect to practical recommendations, in my view it is  apropos to look at the procedure for organizing the security  system and one of its most important components, use of  technical and engineer equipment.    The following are determined in organizing an installation  security system: security methods; number and makeup of guards,  security and defense sectors, guardhouse locations and procedure  for personnel actions; number and kinds of checkpoints; number,  kinds, purpose and locations of posts and the length of routes;  nature of preparation of the restricted zone with technical and  engineer security equipment, its density and the procedure for  installing it; makeup of unit (subunit) reserves and procedure  for their employment.    Special attention is given to outfitting the restricted zone  with technical and engineer security equipment (one variant is  shown in the diagram). Commanders proceed from the importance of  the secured area in installing technical and engineer security  equipment. Thus, a category one installation is outfitted with  two or more lines of perimeter detection equipment and with  installation security signalling and a category two installation  with one line. Only installation security signalling may be  installed at a category three installation.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-028-12A>      Variant of Preparing a Restricted Zone with Technical and Engineer Security </FIG>      Based on troop experience, systems based on television,  radar, vibration, electromagnetic and combination principles of  action such as Luch, Klen, Shchit, Setka, Kvarts, Radian and  others may find wide use. In sectors that cannot be viewed it is  advisable to use remotely controlled television cameras  operating with low illumination.    The use of troop details equipped with radar detection  equipment is becoming a promising direction for improving the  effectiveness of security and defense duty for military posts  (installations). It is recommended setting up technical  observation posts, which permit reliably covering an  installation sector (perimeter) by creating a continuous radar  surveillance zone. Each post can consist of one or two radar  teams with the PSNR-2 [type of ground reconnaissance search  radar] (or PSNR-5 or SBR-3 [type of short-range reconnaissance  radar]). The posts are put out individually or included in the  guard detail.    AMP-90, Luch-1 and Luch-2 searchlight stations and PZS  [mobile battery charging station] searchlights powered from  special mobile generators may find wide use at night. Use of  various laser devices with a night and day branch, night vision  devices of all types, and night sights is possible.    To strengthen reliability of security it is advisable to set  up obstacles difficult to negotiate, such as two rows of  12-strand barbed wire reinforced by a metal net and deflectors  [kozyrki]. It is recommended setting up low wire entanglements  between outer and inner perimeters of an obstacle, outfitting  observation towers with bulletproof walls, and equipping  personnel of the guard detail duty shift with Sirena, Palma or  Romashka portable radios.    As spelled out in the Russian Federation Armed Forces  Provisional Garrison and Guard Service Regulations, security and  defense of installations equipped with technical and engineer  security equipment can be accomplished with the posting of  sentries or by the method of control and security team alert  duty. Control and security team alert duty is the most  effective. Here the technical and engineer equipment is  consolidated in a unified system, which permits promptly sending  intrusion signals to the guardhouse. Transportation is assigned  to deliver such teams to the prescribed place, or armored  equipment is assigned when there is an attack by armed criminals  (units).    It is understandable that other measures also contribute to  preventing weapon, ammunition and combat equipment thefts. In  certain cases it is advisable to transfer weapons from scattered  small depots for storage at one well equipped installation. A  technique such as sealing off weapon storage rooms, rifle racks,  and safes under control of the unit duty officer or officer of  the guard has proven itself in the troops. This method also is  used in storing combat equipment in closed bays of motor pools.  Entrance gates in a number of units are equipped with a call  button or code pad, and a two-way communications device is  mounted on the gate for conversations with arriving persons.  Gates are opened and closed automatically and the control panel  is in the checkpoint building to preclude an attack on a sentry  or a person on duty.    From the editors.    We request unit commanders, chiefs of staff, officers  of combat arms and services, and all readers to share experience  in organizing security and defense of military posts and  installations and to express their views and recommendations on  actions of commanders and staffs under emergency conditions.  Your opinion will help gain a deeper understanding of the  subject touched on and thereby will facilitate accomplishment of  the troops' primary mission--maintaining their constant combat  readiness.

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BRAND 'X' IS QUALITY IN RUFFIAN  </P> <P> Trainer Charles Carlesimo neglected to send co-owner Gregory Mordas' silks to  Belmont Park when he shipped Quick Mischief for Saturday's 1 1/16-mile Ruffian  Handicap. He was unaccustomed to such details, having never before run a horse  in a Grade I stakes.  </P> <P> The jockeys' agents at Belmont were not exactly clamoring for the opportunity  to ride the 4-year-old filly, whose career was defined by a nine-length victory  at Monmouth Park more than 15 months ago. Her 111-pound assignment also limited  the number of riders eligible to make the weight.  </P> <P> Carlesimo was concerned that Quick Mischief might not be up to facing  Southland-based Gorgeous, one of the leading older fillies bound for next  month's Breeders' Cup Distaff. But Gorgeous was scratched from the Ruffian  Friday.  </P> <P> "We were thrilled that Gorgeous was scratched," Carlesimo said. "And it came up  slop, which we like."  </P> <P> When Carlesimo looked through his binoculars toward the quarter pole Saturday,  he saw Quick Mischief comfortably in front and jockey Raul Rojas, clad in  substitute blue silks marked with a white "X" -- the New York Racing Assn.'s  version of the house blazer -- looking over his shoulder for competition and  finding none.  </P> <P> She was in control with three-eighths to run after six furlongs in 1:09 4/5.  From there, her lead widened to three lengths at the wire in 1:42 4/5. Quick  Mischief paid $16.40 and earned $144,480, more than doubling her previous  earnings of $111,280.  </P> <P> Julie Krone rode Safely Kept to victory in the Meadowlands Budweiser Breeders  Cup. Safely Kept, who was timed in 1:09 1/5 for the six furlongs, paid $3,  $2.40 and $2.10.  </P> <P> Southland-based Itsallgreektome, the 3-5 favorite, scored his fourth stakes  victory on the turf in his last six races by defeating Noble Dr. by a length in  the Grade III Ascot Handicap at Bay Meadows. Itsallgreektome completed the 1  1/16 miles on the turf in 1:43 1/5 and paid $3.40, $2.60 and $2.20.  </P> <P> Hansel closed with a late rush along the rail to win the Washington-Arlington  Futurity at Arlington International Racecourse. Hansel, who was timed in 1:36  2/5 for the mile, paid $4.80, $2.80 and $2.20.  </P></p>

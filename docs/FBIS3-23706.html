			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin, Konstantin Smirnov: "MFER </F> Collegium: Ministry Tallies 1993 Foreign Trade Results"]    [Text] Russia's foreign economic results in 1993 and the  outlook for changes in foreign trade and its regulation in 1994  were discussed at a session of the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations [MFER] collegium yesterday. Judging from the proposals  made at it, the ministry, unlike the government, supports the  idea of liberalizing foreign trade activity and does not rule  out the possibility of abolishing the institution of special  exporters in 1995.    Russia's balance-sheet foreign trade indicators for 1993 are  impressive. It had a positive balance of $16 billion (which is  somewhat less, it's true, that the government's September  forecasts of $20 billion). However, the world market continues  to see Russia only as a raw materials supplier (primarily oil  and gas). The positive results were achieved in the traditional  way, through increases in the physical volume of oil and gas  exports, despite unfavorable price changes: At the end of last  year, the price of one barrel of oil had fallen by $14 (changes  in gas prices follow changes in oil prices). The proportion of  machinery and equipment fell to 7 percent (9 percent in 1992).  Although recent signs of an increase in world prices for raw  materials do not in principle rule out the possibility of  continued growth of oil and gas exports this year, positive  shifts in their structure could be made possible by credit  support or tax breaks for exporters, something that (like the  creation of a state system to insure exports against unfavorable  changes in world market prices) no one in either the MFER or the  government is seriously thinking about yet.    At the same time, against the backdrop of rather prolonged  periods of exchange rates favorable to imports, a policy of  limiting imports was pursued in 1993, and they fell by 27  percent. The value of grain imports dropped by 56 percent, which  is in keeping with the policy of cutting subsidies for  centralized imports. The sharp reduction (by 30 percent) in  imports of machinery and equipment was less in keeping with  targets.    The collegium session confirmed that the government is not  of  one mind in its assessments of the outlook for changes in  foreign economic regulation. For example, while the commission  on operational issues (led by Oleg Soskovets), in returning  commercial timber to the list of "strategic" raw material  exports, essentially "emasculated" the liberalization of foreign  economic activity carried out by Gaydar, the ministry continues  to favor a reduction in the number of goods whose export is  subject to quotas, proposing to leave only oil, oil products,  and certain ferrous metals in the "strategic" category. The very  likely introduction of quotas on aluminum and pig iron will be  on the conscience of importers from the European Union, not the  MFER.    One may also conclude from the collegium session's outcome  that the heyday for special exporters is coming to an end. Their  functions of ensuring effective exports and state control over  foreign exchange proceeds can readily be handled successfully by  tenders based on state export quotas, on the one hand, and by  the evolving system of foreign exchange control, on the other.  In addition, the MFER's cherished uniform computerized control  system could easily be reoriented from special exporters to  tender winners. This change, which could in practice occur only  next year, would signal a real turn from administrative to  economic regulation.

He  characterized the results as not bad: This applies to both the  $16-billion positive trade balance and the maintenance of  exports at the 1992 level. Among setbacks the minister cited $10  billion in delinquent payments in trade with the CIS countries  and a 40-percent reduction in imports. Among promising areas of  endeavor in 1994 Mr. Davydov cited efforts to fine-tune the  uniform control system for exports of strategic raw materials  and the solution of problems relating to the participation of  regions in foreign economic activity. (Plans call for  emphasizing the institution of regional authorized  representatives.) Among other problems, the minister spoke at  length on protectionism, at the KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent's  request. The increase in import tariffs as of March 1, in his  opinion, will result not in the abundance of goods promised by  its supporters, but in shortages of goods. "We need to protect  the consumer, not the producer," Mr. Davydov said. He added that  even in the West, with its developed competition on domestic  markets, higher tariffs usually result only in a brief respite  (one to two years) for domestic producers and are not  accompanied by an immediate jump in prices. But then prices rise  all the same, and the competitiveness of domestic goods sharply  falls. In Russia, however, with its high proportion of  production monopolies and undeveloped competition, prices will  jump on the very next day. A protectionist policy is also doomed  for the reason that Russia is simply compelled to become  integrated in the world economic system. And Mr. Davydov  promised that the MFER "will do everything in its power to  achieve that integration."</p>

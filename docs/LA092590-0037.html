			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY REPORT;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> ROBINSON STILL ANGRY OVER REVERSAL OF CALL  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson was still livid about an officials' decision that took a  pass-interference call away from the Rams in the second quarter of their 27-21  loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.  </P> <P> On a third-down play from the 50-yard line, Ram receiver Derrick Faison broke  past linebacker Seth Joyner over the deep middle of the field, but was bumped  by free safety Wes Hopkins when the ball came to him.  </P> <P> The official closest to the play threw a flag, but after a conference the  officials decided that the pass was uncatchable.  </P> <P> "(It) was a big play that was an absolute terrible call by the officials,"  Robinson said. "They called the play, then they decided that they weren't sure  it was interference, then they decided not to call it. The film clearly  indicates pass interference."  </P> <P> Robinson said kicker Mike Lansford, who suffered a strained lower calf muscle  in his right leg against Tampa Bay, probably will be 100% for the Rams' next  game, Oct. 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals. Lansford handled the place-kicking  duties Sunday, but the Rams signed John Carney last week to kick off. TIM  KAWKAMI  </P></p>

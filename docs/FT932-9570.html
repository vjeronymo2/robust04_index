			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Arts: Monsters, every which way - Cinema INDECENT PROPOSAL (15) Adrian Lyne LEOLO (18) Jean-Claude Lauzon BRAINDEAD (18) Peter Jackson MISTRESS (15) Barry Primus IN THE SOUP Alexandre Rockwell WILD WEST (15) David Attwood After Honeymoon In Vegas, Indecent Proposal: and the evidence is mounting up. The only place Hollywood sees as more corrupt than itself is Las Vegas. There, blazed by lights and buzzed by helicopter shots, people who hazard their money end up losing their souls and/or spouses. Our last trip to the Nevada sin-bin saw Nicolas Cage lose Sarah Jessica Parker to gangster James Caan. This time Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore are the couple in straitened circs and Robert Redford is the flashing teeth with the overflowing wallet. One million dollars he offers to Mr and Mrs Harrelson for a night with Demi. Afterwards the lovebirds can rebuild their recession-racked nest - he an architect, she an estate agent - and forget about one benighted fling with Mr Goldenhaired Mephistopheles. Or can they? The first and far livelier half of Indecent Proposal is directed by Adrian Lyne with the paparazzo relish he brought to Fatal Attraction. Lyne turns every close-up into a flashbulb snap of the exposed soul, as hero and heroine wander a casino where guilt-edged insecurity is the name of the game and where a magnifying camera turns even the roulette wheel's bumping silver ball into a boulder from hell. Also from hell, but the suaver section, is Mr Redford: slipstreamed into the story in a series of glancing-eyed reaction shots, a debonair Devil in a dinner jacket. But as a movie story, Indecent Proposal has a built-in-flaw. It is over with the delivery of its moral punchline. 'Can money buy love?' Yes. End of story. But obliged to fill a two-hour running time, Lyne and screenwriter Amy Holden Jones pretend that the pay-off is merely a premise. They then stretch the plot for a further hour, turning one night's sex-for-hire into a flimsily overextended romance between fallen wife and Faustian billionaire. The truly interesting question - does the damage to a marriage linger even after the interloper has loved and left? - is squashed by the homewrecker's continued presence as romantic threat. A potentially many-sided moral conundrum becomes a humdrum emotional triangle. The cast compounds the sense of bathos. Fatal Attraction had Glenn Close using the whip on an equally short-distance plot idea, but who could begrudge the extra show-gallops from a mad Medusa with peroxide mane? Indecent Proposal has dull Woody Harrelson and three-faces Demi Moore (winsome, more winsome, lachrymose). And though Redford spellbinds when proposing the hellish bargain - a golden boy turned tarnished angel - even he blands out under the obligation to canter endlessly round the same whimsical-romantic course. ***** Jean-Claude Lauzon's rude, funny and anarchic Leolo is a portrait of the artist as a mad young fantasist. 'People think I'm French-Canadian' narrates the title teenager (Maxime Collin), Lauzon's fanciful sketch of himself as a boy; 'but because I dream, I'm not.' No, in his dreams he is Sicilian. His mother conceived him from a crate of tomatoes (sic) which caught a stray peasant's flying seed. Now Leolo lives in Montreal with a lustful Grandpa who schemes to seduce a young neighbour, a weakling older brother taking body-building lessons and a mother from whom Leolo conceals his own delinquent tendencies. These include masturbating into pieces of liver - clearly no part of the food-chain is safe from this family's reproductive habits - and concocting schemes to murder grandpa. These include a noose-and-pulley apparatus designed to drag the old boy out of his bathtub and hang him. (It fails to work.) Writer-director Lauzon's artistic noose-and-pulley system is at work dragging Fellini, Philip Roth and several others out of their bathtubs. Where his last film Night Zoo was a dry-run film noir, inspiration in Leolo is a matter of violent, splashy raids. Here some raw sex from the Jewish-American bildungsroman tradition; here some Amarcord-ish family caricature; and as coup de grace - or dis-grace - a group cat-raping scene which may have entire audiences fainting clean away. Creative energy and taboo-bashing, though, have a history of honourable fellowship in cinema. Leolo makes our mouths gape with the spectacle of the forbidden and then crams more dubious goodies into the defenceless jaws. The film's chief fault is its determination to find glamour and comedy in madness. (The family's visits to asylum-penned Grandpa become awaydays to Arcady.) Its virtue is its honesty about the myths of boyhood innocence. Not even Leolo, though, had a family life quite like that depicted in Braindead. Have you ever watched your loved ones turn into zombies, mutants and man-eating multiple amputees - and then felt bound to add to the carnage? Such is the destiny of young Lionel (Timothy Balme) in this black comedy cum splatter epic from New Zealand's Peter Jackson of Bad Taste and Meet The Feebles. One moment Lionel's mother is the life and soul of the local WI, the next she is bitten by a rare monkey and comes apart at the seams. The boy's duty is plain. Glue back that cheek-flap. Staunch that fountaining abscess. And when Mum, plus most of the town, turn into deformed and slavering cannibals, wield everything from a horse hypodermic to a rotary mower to stop them running amok. Holding a handkerchief to your mouth, you should marvel at the special effects. The call-sheet of consumer durables on this production, claim the press notes, included pork fat, polyfoam, human hair, ultra-slime (sic) and 'hundreds of litres of maple syrup'. It makes The Evil Dead look like Mrs Miniver. And it is horrendously funny. Once again the cinema looks squarely at the forbidden and proves that with enough jet-black comic propulsion, nervous laughter can launch itself into liberating hilarity. Mistress, a comedy about movie-making, gives us different monsters. Called film financiers, they batten onto innocent film-maker Marvin (Robert Wuhl), who is hoping to resuscitate a long-neglected script about a suicidal painter. Thanks to a producer friend (Martin Landau), Marvin's backers soon include a mad Jew (Eli Wallach), a sleaze merchant from Outer Sunset (Robert De Niro) and a big ego from Little Italy (Danny Aiello). And their girlfriends. These must all have leading parts. Hence this film's title. But we have seen it all in The Player, and director Barry Primus, alas, is no Robert Altman. Mistress advances on stepping-stones of well-worn Tinseltown apercus to lower, ever more lacklustre things. The comedy needed more fizz, the malice more momentum. These commodities are plentiful in Alexandre Rockwell's In The Soup. But this lissom lampoon will be seen only by three men and a dog at the National Film Theatre. Rockwell proposes a young Italian-American film-maker (Steve Buscemi) embroiled with an older producer (Seymour Cassel). Since Cassel's life is in hock to the Mafia, he furnishes wilder and more interesting material than the boy's script. But as the Mob keep knocking on the door, when does stimulating source material turn into serious life-endangerment? Rockwell shows Olympic skill in jumping from mood to mood, from batty vignette (singing Italian landlords) to even battier vignette (TV quiz game called The Naked Truth in which contestants are quizzed au naturel). The film may get - cross fingers - a wider release later in the year. Finally, Wild West: an example of that noble British genre that we might call Ethnic Muddying. See My Beautiful Laundrette, Sammie And Rosie Get Laid and company. Take a Yorkshire-born director (David Attwood), add an Anglo-Indian screenwriter (Harwant Bains), then stir in two Asian-British juvenile leads, Naveen Andrews and Sarita Choudhuri as star-crossed Southall-dwellers aspiring to be Country singers. Result: a comical dish with a mixed, tangy, rebellious flavour that can be poured over the heads of racial purity theorists. Modestly made - neither the sound-recording nor the photography will win Oscars  - but funny, charming and laudably interracial.</p>

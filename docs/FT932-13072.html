			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Stop the world, let me off WOULDN'T it be splendid if John Major woke one morning in No 10 Downing Street and found, pinned to his pillow or propped against his tea-maker, a note from the Saint signed with the famous logo - a matchstick man with a halo. The message would be quite short: 'I am watching you, sonnikins. Your performance in office has been nothing but bloomers. Yet I believe you have the makings of a decent man, so I am giving you a fresh start. That's all I've got to say for now. Just raise your game considerably. The Saint is watching you. Understand, honeybunch?' Perhaps you didn't know that the Saint used words like 'sonnikins' and 'honeybunch' - or 'sweetness' or 'loveliness' - when admonishing villains? Neither did I until this week, when news of the death of Leslie Charteris, the Saint's creator, sent me scurrying to the bookshop to buy my first Saint books: Enter the Saint, one of the earliest (published in 1930), and The Saint Goes West (1942). Their innocence is charming. How simple life was then. Right was right and wrong was wrong, and sex was still in the cupboard. Even the violence the Saint dished out was choreographed slapstick, at the end of which he was liable to drawl, perhaps a little breathlessly: 'Any time any of you bad cheeses want any more lessons in rough-housing, you've only got to drop me a postcard and I'll be right along.' In an introduction to the Everyman paperback version of Enter the Saint, Ion Trewin says that it is possible, with hindsight, to see why the Saint caught on so swiftly. With the depression at its height, Charteris offered not just escapism but a contemporary Robin Hood who, like the Robin Hood of myth, would hand over the loot - in the Saint's case to charity, keeping 10 per cent as his fee. In fact, analysis of the Saint books has shown that there were five Saints all told, from the piratical and energetic Mark I Saint of the early books to the final Mark V version: cosmopolitan and almost world-weary. But he would be laughed off the bookstalls today. In Enter the Saint, Charteris tells us that there was 'a certain quiet assurance about his bearing, a certain steely quality that came sometimes into his blue eyes, a certain indefinable air of strength and recklessness and quixotic bravado' that reminded his opponents of 'wire and whipcord and indiarubber and compressed steel springs and high explosives.' Dearie-me, honeybunch. And the Saint's enemies were the crudest of cut-outs  -'crooks, blood-suckers, traders in vice and damnation, and other verminous excrescences of that type.' There is little indication that the Saint would survive more than about three minutes in a late 20th-century world echoing with the rumble of apocalyptic prophesy. The Branch Davidians were not alone. In the US, as many as 600 groups and individuals are currently proclaiming the onset of global catastrophe, according to the Millennium Watch Institute in Philadelphia, which monitors such predictions. Ted Daniels, who runs the institute, attributes this doom-saying to the approach of the year 2000. 'I think that's getting people excited. It seems to follow in people's minds that there ought to be some huge change. All those zeros pop up on the odometer and it's got to mean something.' Yet the Saint books have set me thinking. Their escapism is no mere accident. It is cleverly contrived. Because of the conventions of their time, the view of the world they present is the result of determined and skilful filtering, and of vigorous self-censorship. Leslie Charteris was not an innocent. He knew a lot about the real world. But you can hardly tell that from the books. Quite soon - I predict - escapism and censorship will make a big comeback. The planet is spinning towards so much horror that people will feel the need to be protected from it, if only to preserve their sanity. They will want newspapers and TV stations that offer them a sanctuary - a non-stop merry-go-round of music, comedy, sport, sex, fashion, gardening, food and wine tips, happy stories from safe places, medical breakthroughs, strange objects in space, Princess Diana, religious visitations and the latest speculation about particle physics and parallel universes. They can sign me up tomorrow.</p>

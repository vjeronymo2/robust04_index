			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: FANS' JEERING PLAGUED MOORE, HIS WIDOW SAYS  </P> <P> Tonya Moore, widow of former Angel pitcher Donnie Moore, blames fans who  continually jeered her husband for contributing to the frustration that  eventually induced him to shoot her and kill himself, according to an article  in the February issue of GQ.  </P> <P> Tonya Moore is also quoted as saying her husband beat her "to a pulp" when she  was 19 and struck her again the night he gave up a two-out, two-strike home run  to Dave Henderson, which allowed the Boston Red Sox to overcome a ninth-inning  Angel lead and eventually win the game and the 1986 American League  championship.  </P> <P> Although he had 31 saves in 1985 -- still a club record -- Moore was booed by  Angel fans after giving up Henderson's home run and was never able to match his  previous success.  </P> <P> "I'll never forgive the fans for what they did to my husband. Never, ever," the  magazine quotes Tonya Moore as saying.  </P> <P> After recovering from bullet wounds to her neck and chest after the incident in  the couple's Anaheim Hills home July 18, 1989, Tonya Moore spent two months in  a mental hospital. She told GQ that her two sons still require therapy. HELENE  ELLIOTT  </P></p>

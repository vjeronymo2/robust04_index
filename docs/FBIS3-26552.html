Instead of asking the state for money to carry out capital  construction, Zhuhai has relied on its own efforts to develop a  lot of basic facilities. This move is correct and it has offered  a good example to the whole country.    Premier Li Peng made an inspection tour of Zhuhai from 29  January to 4 February. During these seven days, Premier Li Peng  went to construction sites, enterprises, and the grass-roots  levels to conduct investigation and study; inspected the  construction of the Qiao Bridge, the Zhuhai Bridge, the first of  its kind in southern Guangdong, which was open to traffic by the  end of last year, the Juren Holdings Company, and Zhuhai's urban  construction and management; and listened to accounts given by  the city party secretary and mayor Liang Guangda and other  leaders. Premier Li Peng was pleased at the results of his  on-the-spot inspection and the accounts given to him. He fully  affirmed the work of the city leading body and spoke highly of  and expressed satisfaction at Zhuhai's economic construction,  urban building and management, environmental protection,  hygiene, land management, afforestation, population control,  social security, and overall administration. Zhuhai is indeed a  beautiful city. The climate is pleasant and warm as in spring.  I came here last year. During the current trip, I have  witnessed the tremendous changes. With its rapid economic  development and beautiful urban planning, Zhuhai is indeed a  match for the cities of the developed nations.    Through the in-depth inspection of Zhuhai, Premier Li Peng  said that Zhuhai's reform, opening up, and economic construction  are successful. He spoke highly of the unremitting efforts made  by Zhuhai to overcome difficulties and implement the central  policy of reform and opening up, and the spirit of continuously  forging ahead and advancing amid storms. He specially presented  Zhuhai with the poem "Ode to the Bamboo" by Qing poet Zheng  Qiao: "Taking root in the steep rocks of the mountain, it  remains firm and strong despite being buffeted by winds from all  sides." Premier Li Peng encouraged Zhuhai party and government  leaders and party members to earnestly study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, make bold  explorations and practice, and constantly attain new  achievements in establishing a socialist market economy and  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Premier Li Peng left Zhuhai for an inspection of Shenzhen on  the morning of 4 February.</p>

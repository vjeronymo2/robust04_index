			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RED SOX FAR FROM INVINCIBLE  </P> <P> The 90th version of the Boston Red Sox came south with several questions, as  befitting a third-place, .512 team. Who would play right field? Who would play  first base? And, most notably, what to do about a pitching staff that has too  few starters and too many closers?  </P> <P> Now, as the engine begins to warm on the first season of the post-lockout era,  the Red Sox have managed to solve only the first-base question. And even that  is tenuous. Is the Billy Jo Robidoux-Carlos Quintana platoon system the answer  until Mo Vaughn is ready? Maybe. Does Billy Buckner fit in? Probably for now,  as part of the 27-man roster. But not after that.  </P> <P> For the most part, the everyday positions this year will be filled with the  same faces as last year, when the Red Sox collapsed behind the Toronto Blue  Jays and Baltimore Orioles. Other than first base, the only sure difference is  catcher, where Tony Pena takes over.  </P> <P> And then there is the pitching, or lack thereof. The starting rotation looks to  be Roger Clemens, Mike Boddicker, John Dopson and a cast of thousands. The  bullpen is strong, if chemically unbalanced because there is one short-man too  many. There is only one answer -- Lee Smith has to go. General Manager Lou  Gorman knows it. Unfortunately, so does the rest of baseball, so no one is  offering enough by Gorman's standards.  </P> <P> So, we have a team whose pitching is questionable, whose speed is non-existent  (except for center fielder Ellis Burks) and whose primary power source last  year, Nick Esasky, now plays in Atlanta.  </P> <P> But there is good news for the Red Sox. Help is on the way. If spring training  answered any question unequivocally, it is that the crop of youngsters steaming  toward Fenway is better than even the organization thought. And even better,  even the ever-cautious Red Sox management says it won't be long before Tim  Naehring, Vaughn, Scott Cooper, Kevin Morton and Mickey Pina are in the bigs.  </P> <P> If mixed properly with the current nucleus, the youngsters could make this  franchise one of the more highly charged teams of the 90s.  </P> <P> Does all of this mean the Red Sox are just playing out the year, waiting for  the future to arrive, and thus are destined for third place again? Possibly.  But in the equal-opportunity American League East -- where the prevailing  mediocrity makes all things possible for all teams -- the Red Sox could even  win it, barring serious injuries to key players.  </P> <P> But don't count on it. Second place is more likely, behind the Blue Jays. Or  third. Or fourth. Or some place even lower than that.  </P> <P> The team expects to take 11 pitchers to start the season. Sure things are  Clemens, Boddicker, Dopson, Wes Gardner, Greg Harris, Dennis Lamp, Rob Murphy,  Jeff Reardon and Lee Smith.  </P> <P> That leaves Mike Rochford, Eric Hetzel, Dana Kiecker and Tom Bolton fighting  for the last two spots.  </P> <P> Whatever the configuration, we're not talking the 1969 Baltimore Orioles here.  </P> <P> Clemens (17-11, 3.13) has had a monster spring, and seems driven to carry that  into the regular season. Just don't ask him about it. The only question at this  point is whether he will wear Jim Rice's No.14 Opening Day. Or maybe he'll opt  for Al Nipper's No. 49.  </P> <P> Behind Clemens comes Boddicker (15-11, 4.00) and Dopson (12-8, 3.99). Boddicker  had a horrendous start last year, but finished strongly. He has pitched  passably this spring, alternating between making people look foolish with his  assortment of curveballs and off-speed stuff, and getting hit hard. He says he  is ready, but a fast start is a must. Dopson remains an enigma. He was a  surprise last year and Manager Joe Morgan is pleased with his spring. But,  sometimes he just checks out mentally. And virtually every pitch is an  adventure. Rich Gedman says he has no idea how Dopson's ball is going to break.  "And he doesn't, either," Gedman said.  </P> <P> After those three, life becomes a mystery. The Red Sox had hoped to use Smith  as the trade material that would bring in a fourth starter, allowing them to  use one of the current hired hands as a fifth starter. The lack of a trade has  deep-sixed that plan, and the demise of Shane Rawley forced the team to hold an  open audition for both jobs throughout the spring.  </P> <P> The results were less than sterling. The only candidate who really pitched well  each time out was rookie Dana Kiecker, and he has ane excellent chance of  making the roster as a fifth starter or long man out of the bullpen. But as a  fifth starter. The fourth slot will go by default to Gardner (3-7, 5.97). The  Red Sox remain exasperated by Gardner's inability to pitch up to his potential.  "It has to be Gardner right now," Gorman said. "He has the most experience and  the best arm. We just have to hope he gets straightened out." Another  possibility is left-handed Rochford, particularly early in the year against  predominantly left-handed hitting teams like the Tigers.  </P></p>

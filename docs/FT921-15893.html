			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (9): Dependence on capital inflows - Balance of payments KENYA's current account deficit of more than Dollars 400m annually - 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990 - highlights the country's dependence on capital inflows. During the 1980s, Kenya ran up an accumulated current account deficit of Dollars 3.5bn and was a net capital exporter to the tune of Dollars 500m. It relied almost exclusively on foreign aid and loans from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and IMF to finance its Dollars 3bn current account deficit. In fact, gross disbursements during the 1980s exceeded Dollars 4.5bn, of which the World Bank provided almost one-third, and bilateral loans from donors another third. The balance was provided in the form of export and suppliers' credits and bank borrowings which totalled Dollars 675m. This is not a reassuring situation, at a time when Kenya is coming under intense, albeit largely politically-inspired, pressure from donors, and when foreign aid budgets are being closely scrutinised and reallocated. The debt-service ratio peaked at 39 per cent in 1987 then fell to 29.5 per cent in 1990 and Kenyans have become proud of their status as one of only four sub-Saharan countries to have avoided debt-rescheduling in the last eight years. The government says that it will reduce the debt-service ratio to 24 per cent next year, though this is based on the somewhat optimistic assumption that export earnings will increase 10 per cent annually during the next two years. Provided Kenya can keep the donors moderately happy while avoiding serious political upsets, the external debt situation should continue to be manageable. However, Kenya's proud debt servicing record could be threatened if the country falls short on either count, especially since its past export track record does not lend support to the rose-tinted export growth scenario.  ---------------------------------------- BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (SDRS M)  ----------------------------------------                      1990    1991    1992 Exports               740     755     860 Imports             1,702   1,618   1,745 Trade deficit         962     863     885 Net services          341     324     380 Net transfers         275     235     230 Current account      -346    -304    -275 Net capital           238     208     230 Overall Balance      -108     -96     -45 1 SDR = Dollars 1.4 Source: Kenya government  ----------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------- FOREIGN DEBT (INCLUDING UNDISBURSED)  ---------------------------------------- DEC 31 1990 (DOLLARS M) Year-end        Pounds bn Multilateral       3,243 Bilateral          2,278 Export credits       366 Banks                583 Supplier credit      154 Total              6,625  ---------------------------------------- Source: IMF  ----------------------------------------</p>

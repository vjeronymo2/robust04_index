			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minister of Commerce Uthai Phimchaichon told the  10th international general meeting of the Pacific Economic  Cooperation Council that the setting of the ASEAN Free Trade  Area, or AFTA, is needed to promote the current multilateral  trade system in the region. Minister Uthai made the remarks in  his speech to about 600 representatives from 21 countries in  Asia and the Pacific at the conference held in Malaysia during  22 to 24 March 1994. He said while countries in the world have  moved since 1980 toward groupings as regional trade blocs and  Europe has already declared its single market in 1990, the Asian  region should consider the ASEAN Free Trade Area, or AFTA, to  increase its efficiency to survive and take advantage of the  ASEAN wide market.    He recommended that AFTA be a potential tool for trade  promotion in the region. He said that the free trade system  will lead the Asian region and ASEAN to the world market as well  as to induce foreign investors to the region.</p>

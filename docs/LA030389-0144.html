			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ORANGE;  </P> <P> JAIL TERM FOR EX-OFFICER ON SEXUAL BATTERY CHARGE  </P> <P> A former police officer for the city of Orange who pleaded no contest to  fondling a woman during a pat-down search while he was still a policeman has  been sentenced to 60 days in jail.  </P> <P> Three counts of felony sexual battery were filed against Gordon Whaley, 29, of  Moreno Valley in October.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory L. Prickett said Whaley pleaded no contest in  December. A no-contest plea is tantamount to admitting guilt but can not be  used as evidence of guilt in a civil dispute.  </P> <P> Whaley left the Orange Police Department in June, one month after the alleged  fondling occurred during a roadside search. The officer searched the  22-year-old woman after he saw marijuana fall from the glove compartment while  she was looking for her car registration.  </P> <P> Whaley was sentenced by Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown earlier this week.  </P></p>

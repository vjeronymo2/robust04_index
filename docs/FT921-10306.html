			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: LTV net improves, but operating loss deepens LTV, the US steel, aerospace and energy group which has been living for five years under the protection of the bankruptcy courts, yesterday reported a deepening of fourth-quarter operating losses, which it blamed on the US recession. LTV reported a net loss of Dollars 8.5m, or 12 cents a share, an improvement on the loss of Dollars 19.5m, or 23 cents, reported in the same period of 1990. Sales dipped from Dollars 1.6bn to Dollars 1.52bn. In the full year, it made Dollars 74.1m on sales of Dollars 5.99bn, compared with income of Dollars 70.9m on sales of Dollars 6.14bn in 1990. However, the figures were flattered by a third-quarter income tax refund of Dollars 129.7m and related fourth-quarter interest income of Dollars 53.3m. At the operating level, it lost Dollars 56.3m in the final quarter, up from Dollars 25.9m a year ago. Its steel operations reported a fourth-quarter operating loss of Dollars 54m, up from Dollars 11.1m, due to lower prices and shipments and higher wage costs. Its energy products business produced a loss of Dollars 16.3m, compared with a profit of Dollars 1.4m, mainly because of charges for excess or slow-moving inventory. However, its aerospace and defence business, which LTV agreed this week to sell to a joint venture between Lockheed and Martin Marietta, produced operating income of Dollars 14m, up from Dollars 8.8m in the final quarter of 1990. LTV has been involved in years of difficult negotiation with its creditors and the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation over the terms of a restructuring which could bring it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It said yesterday it intended to file a new plan of reorganisation on February 14, and that it had made 'substantial progress' toward bringing creditor groups to agreement.</p>

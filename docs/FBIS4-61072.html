			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Startsev] </F>   [Text] Rome, 2 May -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has  accepted with satisfaction the invitation to attend the G-7  meeting to take place in Naples this July. As became known  today from informed sources within the office of the chairman of  the Italian Council of Ministers, the Russian president had sent  a message to Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in which he noted the head of  the Italian Government's great contribution to attaining  agreement on Russian participation in examining political issues  of international security and in preparing the meeting's final  political document. This decision, the message notes, creates  good prerequisites for the Naples meeting to become an important  new milestone in relations between Russia and the G-7.    As is known, in late April, C.A. Ciampi told B. Yeltsin  about  a preliminary timetable and the form of Russian participation in  the forthcoming summit. The head of government of Italy, the  country that currently holds the G-7 presidency, made  considerable efforts to ensure that the Naples summit be held as  "seven plus one." It is noteworthy that Russia will not only  take part in discussing political problems, but will also be  directly involved in preparations for the Naples conference. B.  Yeltsin's letter says that he has instructed the Russian  Federation Government to join most actively in preparations for  the summit.</p>

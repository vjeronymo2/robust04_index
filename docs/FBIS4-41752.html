			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian government will stick to a strict  financial policy in 1995, though the country has overcome  hyperinflation, acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin told a  meeting of the government consultative council for foreign  investments Monday.    According to Dubinin, the monthly inflation rate will fall  from 8-10 percent to 2.5-3 percent at the end of 1995.  Production growth, if any, will take place no earlier than the  end of next year.    Dubinin informed the meeting of proposals to ease the tax  climate being prepared. He said some taxes, including VAT  (currently at 20 percent), would be reduced, and the entire list  of taxes to be levied in 1995 would be reviewed.    The finance ministry is considering emission of stocks which  could be used for payment of taxes, Dubinin said. He added that  the government would use a number of tax privileges in order to  attract foreign investments to the top-priority industries.</p>

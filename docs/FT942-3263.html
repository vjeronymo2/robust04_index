			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: NZ forestry group optimistic Forestry Corporation of New Zealand is optimistic that the recent lifting of a ban on logging the Pacific north-west forests will not have an adverse effect on profits, Reuter reports from Wellington. Mr Tim Cullinane, chief executive, said yesterday: 'It is by no means certain that the changes that have taken place will in fact hold. 'I think we can expect the environmentalists will run another solid charge through the courts system, and our intelligence is that there will not be much of an increase in volumes coming onstream.' He said he thought wood prices would hold steady for the rest of the year. Forestry Corp earlier announced a net profit of NZDollars 157.1m (USDollars 92.5m) before payment to the government of a NZDollars 112m dividend. Gross sales were NZDollars 454.2m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists,  on March 15, staged an exercise of returning to the base after  dropping bombs in the air above Yongwol and Pyongchang, South  Korea, with the mobilization of Japan-based F-15 fighter-bombers  and FA-18 pursuit-assault planes, according to military sources.    On the 14th and the 15th, overseas-based KC-135s refueled  more than 30 fighter-bombers and assault planes in an air war  exercise above Kunsan and Kapyong.    Meanwhile the Kim Yong-sam group staged a war rehearsal on  the 15th with the mobilization of many warships, attack  helicopters, artillery pieces, tanks and armoured vehicles.    At that time, a "civilian defence training" was under way in  Seoul.    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets would be  well advised to act with discretion, clearly mindful of the  grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless belligerent  moves increasing tension on the Korean peninsula.</p>

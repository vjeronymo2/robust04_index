			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / BP cuts price of petrol by 6p BRITISH Petroleum will cut its petrol prices by 6p a gallon from Monday following the strengthening of the pound against the dollar. The move is likely to spark a round of price cuts by rivals in the intensely competitive petrol market. Pump prices rose earlier this year. BP's cut will take the maximum price for four-star to 254.1p a gallon and for unleaded to 231.4p a gallon.</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome share price victim of 'bear raid by professionals' THE WELLCOME share price has been the victim of 'a long-drawn-out bear raid by the professionals,' according to Volume Analysis, a company which examines stock market trading patterns. Shares in the drugs group have fallen sharply since Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, said in early March that it would reduce its stake from 73.5 per cent to under 50 per cent, and possibly to 25 per cent. They were 1,126p before the original announcement and closed yesterday at 854p, down 15p on the day. They have fallen by 20 per cent more than the FT-SE 100 index over the period. Last week Wellcome Trust said it planned to sell 330m shares, cutting its stake to 35 per cent. However, more shares could be sold. There have been suspicions that institutional investors have been talking the price down or even selling shares with the aim of buying them back cheaper in the sale. Mr Charles Wyatt of Volume Analysis said that last week, when the share price fell heavily, intra-market trade was nearly three times the volume of customer business. Normally the proportions would be the other way round. He said this suggested professionals in the market had been 'going short in size to bring the share price down' prior to the sale.</p>

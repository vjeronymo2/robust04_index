			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Duma Committee on Budget, Taxes and  Finances considers it necessary to limit Russia's foreign loans  in 1994 to 4.7 billion dollars instead of 5.7 billion dollars  proposed by the government.    The committee prepared a corresponding draft law and a  report  on the need to reduce foreign loans.    This year the Russian government intends to repay 4.7  billion  dollars of foreign debts. The State Duma Committee believes  that the reduction of loans by the same amount would make the  size of attracted credits dependent upon the ability of Russia's  economy to service the foreign debt.    Russia's foreign debt without taking into account the debt  to  East European countries and delayed commercial payments exceeded  80 billion dollars by the beginning of 1994. Annual payments  which Russia is to make according to the schedule of servicing  and repayments of the principal amount of the debt exceeded 20  billion dollars in 1992-1993. Holding talks with the clubs of  Russia's creditors allowed it to reduce repayments of the  foreign debt to 2 billion dollars in 1992 and 2.2 billion  dollars in 1993. The servicing and repayment of the foreign  debt in 1994, taking into account the amount delayed from last  year, demands the granting of 32 billion dollars.</p>

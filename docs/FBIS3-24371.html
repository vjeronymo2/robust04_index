That Is What the Stavropol Kray Trade Union Aktiv Decided After  Discussing the Economic Situation in the Region"]    [Text] Yevgeniy Kuznetsov, head of the Stavropol Kray  administration, met with executives of the kray trade union  council and trade union activists. He told them about the state  of the economy. It is, alas, catastrophic. Mainly because of the  reformist center's radicalism.    The time has come to conclude a tripartite agreement between  the executive power, the employers, and the trade unions. The  main link--the employers--proved to be the least reliable. They  are no longer subordinate to anyone, while the authorities, as  the governor conceded, no longer have any levers of control over  their territory.    What does such excessive independence lead to? Let us take  the example of Neftekumsk Rayon. Before it produced 7.2 million  tonnes of oil, now it extracts barely 1.2-1.5 million. It is  high time for municipal ownership to take over the oilfields.  But no, their managers, with support from the center, resist:  This is ours, don't dare to intervene, these aren't "the old  days."    Now the rayon is on the verge of a strike. The entire  responsibility for the social protection of its inhabitants has  shifted to the executive power, while the main culprits--the  no-good industrial managers--remain on the sidelines.    Nor do the trade unions have their former influence over the  employers, especially in the new, post-reform structures. The  managerial corps is running loose, setting unthinkable salaries  for themselves and their associates, while defrauding and  hurting the workers. The people's lack of legal rights is  crowned by arbitrariness.    Perhaps saddest of all is that now there is no political  force in the kray capable of influencing the public frame of  mind. Numerous dwarf parties are up to their ears in political  squabbles. The executive power's only hope is the trade unions  as a more or less organized force.    Moreover, it should be recognized openly that these are all  not just Stavropol's problems. Rather, they are an exact  reflection of the situation in the country: Working people no  longer demand higher wages and lower prices, all they demand is  that the government pay off its own debts for work long since  done and produce shipped.    What we see both here and in the villages is: Last harvest's  grain and sugar beet have still not shipped and everything is  rotting on kolkhoz threshing-floors. Wool, too. It turns out  that it is more profitable for the state to import wool from  Australia and sugar from Canada than to produce its own. The  country's only sheep and goat breeding scientific-research  institute has closed down. Elite herds and flocks have been  slaughtered.    The situation is much the same in all of Russia's granaries.  For example, in Orenburg Oblast they also reduced agricultural  production to a minimum; all that is left is for their own  needs. But the Orenburg people at least have a powerful  industry, which the Stavropol country doesn't have. The kray is  fully dependent on the center.    Because of this the governor asked the trade union officials  to assume public control over food production and the use of  various social protection funds.    Nevertheless, in response to their questions Yevgeniy  Semyonovich displayed optimism.    "I don't agree that everything is going totally wrong. A new  society is forming. There is a glimmer of hope that the economy  will be renovated. Housing construction is proceeding at the  same rate. Construction of a local oil refinery is in the works,  and a rare-earth metals mine is planned. The administration is  doing everything to prevent total failure."    As for calls for the government to resign and the formation  of a "government of popular trust," in Kuznetsov's view, "It is  foolish, a new spiral of politicking. Doubtlessly, there are  forces in the country who would like to fish in the muddied  waters of unbridled radicalism.    "We had before us the example of China, which has achieved  the expansion of its economy without overreaching, but we didn't  make use of it. Figuratively speaking, now it's not the Chinese  but we who have made the 'great leap' into the market. And it  looks like we've landed in a deep puddle."    The administration is now sustained only by pride,  understanding that it must lead the kray out of the dead end.  "There's no one else to do it," Kuznetsov says. A bitter but  honest admission.    Trade union officials asked the administration chief many  questions. For example: How were low-income people to pay  heating bills? What is being done to restore collapsed health  care in the villages? Will losses suffered from a hailstorm in  Novoselitskiy Rayon be covered?    The governor asked for the trade unions' help. For example,  it was necessary to place the targeted distribution of subsidies  to low-income people under public control, establish control  over property insurance for kolkhozes and private farmers so as  to prevent them from being helpless in the face of natural  disasters, and so forth.    It occurred to me that many of those questions would have  been resolved long ago if only V. Krasulya, deputy chief of the  kray administration, who oversees them, would view the trade  unions as his allies, and not as opponents of his ultraradical  "democratic" views. But everyone knows that he refuses to visit  the kray trade union council!    The trade union activists were, understandably, concerned  when the unceremonious administrative interference in internal  trade union affairs would finally end. Why do departments  subordinate to V. Krasulya devote such great efforts to breaking  up the kray's trade unions rather than strengthening them? They  resort to administrative instructions, hatching of intrigues...    "Brush off whoever encroaches on your affairs," the governor  said. "Of course, one can't expect peace and accord between  trade unions and the executive power. They are bound to worry  one another. But only in the interests of the working people,  not to their detriment. Every rayon administration chief who  promotes confrontation between the authorities and the largest  public organization will be held responsible to me personally."    On the whole, the meeting was surprisingly useful and  constructive. The trade union aktiv saw a leader deeply  concerned with the kray's fate. It is really hard for him today.  Isn't that also the concern of his partners? That means the  executive power and the trade unions should become allies.    In hard times it is necessary to give the kray executive  authorities worker support, that was the result of the entire  meeting. It seems that in Stavropol both sides have mastered  this simple truth. It would be good if it finally reached the  center.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today received Mr.  Vasim Jaffery, the Pakistani minister of state for economic  affairs [name and title as heard] and head of the two countries'  joint committee.    At the meeting, the president emphasized the expansion of  economic cooperation between the two countries in line with  diplomatic ties. He said: Although there are grounds for  cooperation between Asian countries, it is not at the expected  level. Perhaps the tendency to cooperate with the West and lack  of complete confidence and trust in the natural facilities and  potentials in the region is one of the factors preventing its  realization.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed the necessity for the two  countries' joint committee to become more active to present to  the world a suitable example of regional cooperation.    At the meeting, Jaffery said: Implementing the agreements  reached between Iran and Pakistan, particularly those reached  during Mrs. Benazir Bhutto's visit, are always stressed by the  Pakistani Government.</p>

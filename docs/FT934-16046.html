			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Management: The best way to rear corporate babies LIKE lumbering behemoths let loose among a litter of their new-born, large companies have a nasty habit of trampling their fledgling ventures to death. The surviving progeny then take as long as eight to 10 years to stand profitably on their own feet. Their parents would do far better to farm out the task of child-rearing to experts who are better at it: the venture capital community. That just about sums up conventional wisdom on 'corporate venturing': the spawning of internal ventures by established companies. After successive waves of fashion since the 1960s, it fell out of favour in the mid-1980s, as the well-publicised experiences of a few companies, including CBS and Shell, seemed to show once again that 'intrapreneurship' was rarely worth the effort and pain involved. But this conventional wisdom is wrong on almost every count, according to a controversial book from Harvard Business School Press by two entrepreneurship professors. Called 'corporate venturing', it re-analyses many studies on the subject. Most large companies are certainly slow and clumsy. But the professors claim that quite a number has demonstrated that a fair proportion of new ventures can become profitable within two or three years if they are managed properly, and that as many as half can do so within six years. More surprising still, the book claims that a like-for-like comparison between the record of corporate venturing and external venture capitalists shows that the latter do no better than corporations: about one in 10 investments turns out to be a blockbuster, while two or three yield mediocre returns, and the rest fail. All this will startle anyone who remembers the spate of 1980s reports about the abysmal experience of individual large companies with internal diversification. One should certainly be wary: the two academics, Zenas Block of New York University and Ian MacMillan of Wharton, are unashamed evangelists for corporate venturing. Moreover, assessment of ventures' success and failure, even from large-scale statistical studies, can never be crystal-clear: it is always coloured by certain assumptions. Yet Block and MacMillan's conclusions are firm enough to rekindle the flames of corporate interest in venturing, now that the need for whole-scale revitalisation, rather than just restructuring, is being recognised by a growing number of companies (see last Monday's article on corporate creativity). One researcher, above all, is to blame (or thank) for the poor reputation of corporate venturing over most of the past decade: Ralph Biggadike. His seminal study, of 68 ventures started by 35 large US companies, was summarised in a widely-read 1979 article on 'the risky business of diversification'. It concluded that individual new ventures needed, on average, eight years to reach profitability, and that it took an average of 10 to 12 years for a company's return on investment in its entire venturing activity to equal that of its mature businesses. Block and MacMillan challenge Biggadike's reading of his own data, claiming that these 'clearly show that nearly 50 per cent of ventures become profitable within four years'. This is far less clear than they claim, since the data are slightly ambiguous. My re-reading of Biggadike's original article suggests he was correct in citing a figure of 38 per cent. But this is still a respectable success rate, even if he also showed that cashflow took twice as long to go positive. Block concedes that his book may overstate Biggadike's findings slightly, but he points to a larger study a full decade later, which suggested that more than 40 per cent of US ventures - a remarkable rate - had become profitable after less than three years. Leaving aside the question of whether all the early performers in that survey would have remained profitable - in Biggadike's study, more than half did not - Block is right when he complains that companies are too ready to believe that a statistical study can be an accurate predictor of what will happen if they take a particular course of action. As he says, that ignores the unique character of every company and every venture. Such studies can provide only general guidance. What matter are the circumstances of each case, and how well management tailors its practical actions to suit them. It is here that the Block-MacMillan book is at its strongest. For instance, it advises companies to avoid in most cases the popular - but dangerous - step of of housing ventures in separate divisions from the mainstream business. Instead, says the book, they should frequently be placed within existing divisions, but sheltered from normal planning and control systems; otherwise they will be strangled. They should be given high-level sponsorship, but must also manage political relationships and expectations. In trying to make their culture more entrepreneurial and venture-friendly, say the academics, companies should not follow the popular but ineffective 'cultural transplant' route: trying to imitate the innovative culture of creative giants such as 3M. Instead, they should develop their own unique brand of entrepreneurship by learning from their own past experience with innovation projects - failures as well as successes. A new venture is no less an experiment than one conducted in a scientific laboratory. 3M, Hewlett-Packard and a few other creative big companies have long shown that such careful self-education is vital for a giant which wants to avoid stifling its new ventures - and eventually consigning itself to oblivion.</p>

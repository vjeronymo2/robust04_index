			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Munsif al-Sulaymi: "Salim Salih Tells AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT: Hassan II's Reception Pleased Us, We Believe  Recognition Exists Tacitly"]    [Excerpts] Rabat -- Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the  south Yemen Presidential Council and assistant secretary general  of the Socialist Party, has described Moroccan King Hassan II's  reception of the South Yemen delegation the evening of the day  before yesterday as "very useful, and it pleased us." [passage  omitted]    On the possibility of Morocco's recognizing the proclaimed  Democratic Republic of Yemen, especially as official Moroccan  media services have said that the Moroccan monarch received the  delegation of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" [DRY], Salim  Salih said that "the question of Morocco's recognition [of the  DRY] tacitly exists, proceeding from our status prior to four  years of unity which has proved difficult to achieve. Proof of  this is the existence of two armies, two establishments, two  currencies, and two regimes." [passage omitted]    On his assessment of the causes of the failure of the  endeavors made by the international envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, he  said that "we have always responded to all the initiatives, most  importantly the U.S. and European initiatives. We sought to  interact with the proposals presented. But most regrettably,  the other party is focusing on one option -- war, which has  entered its eighth week and yet has not achieved what the Sanaa  regime wanted to achieve." [passage omitted]    On the prospects for the dialogue with Sanaa regarding a  mechanism to halt the fighting and how this mechanism can be  agreed, as the idea was initially endorsed at the Cairo meetings  headed by Brahimi, he said: I believe that "the other side does  not at all want to reach clear and specific results regarding a  cease-fire and choosing the right path. All it is doing is  getting around the resolutions by giving others the impression  that it has accepted the resolutions." [passage omitted]    Salim Salih Muhammad said that Sanaa has offered no sign or  hope of withdrawing its forces besieging Aden. He expected the  war to continue for a long time. He expressed his hope that  sanctions would be imposed on the side not complying with the  resolutions of the international will and pushing the region  into the furnaces of real dangers that threaten security and  stability.

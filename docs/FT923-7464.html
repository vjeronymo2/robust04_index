			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Technology: Multimedia and the consumer - Technically Speaking THE 'multimedia' clans gathered recently in the Japanese resort of Hakone intent upon participating in the birth of a huge new market for products that exploit the confluence of electronics and the arts. Each of the 100 or so delegates representing leaders in the graphic arts, the computer industry, publishing, consumer electronics and film all appeared confident that by forming partnerships they can create products with vast potential. Yet they stumbled in attempting to identify future uses of multi-media, and puzzled over how to charge customers for yet-to-be-defined products and services. After years of such industry gatherings, initially attracting computer and consumer electronics executives but now drawing a more diverse crowd, multimedia is still a solution looking for a problem; an intriguing combination of technologies that has yet to find a commercial outlet. Delegates in Japan were quick to congratulate each other on being 'visionaries' by their mere presence at the conference, but there was a somewhat snooty presumption that consumers are not visionary because they may be reluctant to purchase the 'new media' products of the future. It was broadly suggested that 'consumers will not determine' the success of new technologies and that industry must lead the consumer into the future. This, despite the obvious absence of direction within the multi-industry group and the failure of most consumer electronics companies to come up with successful new products over the past few years. Neither have the personal computer companies much to crow about. With PC hardware now reduced to a 'commodity', they rely almost entirely upon the ingenuity of semiconductor suppliers and software developers to provide evolutionary improvements in their products as the early flare of the 'PC revolution' fades. Both industry segments desperately need a new generation of products to boost their fortunes. So it is hardly surprising that they should promote the exciting potential of multimedia. In an attempt to make the Hakone conference an important step along the way to the 'convergence' of multimedia industries, John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer, produced a list of six proposals that all participants were supposed to etch into their corporate agendas: Hardware makers, such as Apple, will need to create a 'platform' for multimedia. Apple itself vowed to increase sharply production of computers with compact disk capacity. The hardware and software industries should establish a 'New Media Centre' that would provide facilities for experimenting with technologies and space for artists to increase the flow of software for these technologies. Diverse companies should exchange more information electronically in a 'Virtual Forum'. As a first step, Sculley announced that Apple will open up its electronic mail services to other systems to encourage communication. The technology industry should create 'hypernetworks'; communications systems that speed the convergence of text, graphics, video and sound. A working group should be established to devise standards for the publication, sale and distribution of multimedia materials and propose updates to intellectual property laws to fit the new technologies. The industry should refine multimedia technology for educational applications. In the future, Sculley suggested, the 'haves and have-nots' will be defined as those who do or do not have access to multimedia technology. As these proposals demonstrate, there are many hurdles to be overcome before multimedia can reach its full potential in the marketplace. Inter-industry partnerships may be important, yet in the self-congratulatory atmosphere of Hakone there is a danger that this industry intelligentsia may loose sight of its ultimate goal - the consumer.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed intervenes on dollar/yen THE DOLLAR bounced back against the yen in yesterday's afternoon trading in Europe after the US Federal Reserve intervened to support its currency for the first time this year, writes James Blitz. The Fed bought dollars in the market after the US currency set another all-time low against the yen of Y109.15 in New York. The intervention took the market by surprise, pushing the dollar up to a London close of Y111.2. In New York it ended at Y111.75. The move by the Fed was seen as extremely significant, one which might even signal the end of the yen rally seen in recent weeks. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said there had been a misperception about US exchange rate policy in recent weeks. He added that finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations would issue a communique on exchange rates after their meeting tomorrow. Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in London, said the Clinton administration might think the continuing depreciation of the dollar would have only a limited impact on the Japanese trade surplus. 'The US may be taking the view that the trade imbalance has more to do with structural problems relating to products, rather than anything to do with exchange rates.' Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss Banking Corporation commented that the US administration might have been moved to act by the weakness in both US bond and equity markets in recent days and by the surge in the gold price. By contrast, the dollar failed to consolidate against the D-Mark in Europe, in spite of comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, implying that the speed of German rate cuts might increase. The Bundesbank president said Germany's economic situation had deteriorated, and that this had to be taken into account in the setting of money market rates. After closing at DM1.5675 in London on Monday night, the dollar peaked at the DM1.5830 level yesterday before easing back to finish at DM1.5800. In subsequent New York trading the US currency moved higher to end at DM1.5847. The peseta weakened sharply at the start of European trading, bottoming out at Pta74.05 to the D-Mark. The Bank of Spain intervened again to support its currency, bidding between Pta73.85 and Pta74.00. The peseta closed at Pta73.68, fractionally firmer on the day. One interbank dealer in London said the level of intervention by the Spanish authorities in recent days had been colossal. He estimated that the Bank's reserves were now in the area of Dollars 20bn, one third of the level at which they stood in January. Sterling again broke through the DM2.50 level against the D-Mark, following strong UK business confidence figures. It slipped back, however, to close unchanged on the day at DM2.4925.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Local election results sealed fate of the 'scapegoat' THERE WAS an edge of irritation in Mr John Major's voice earlier this week when, sitting in his study at 10 Downing Street, he was pressed on Mr Norman Lamont's future as chancellor. During the rest of his hour-long interview with the FT on Monday the prime minister was relaxed and affable. But his response to questions about whether he was about to reshuffle the cabinet was sharp. He had no intention of giving the media advance notice of changes. But Mr Major knew as he spoke that Mr Lamont's days at the Treasury were numbered. Mr Lamont's fate was sealed on the morning of May 7. As the Conservatives reeled under the impact of defeats in Newbury and in the county council elections, those in the prime minister's inner circle drew a damning conclusion. As long as Mr Lamont stayed on as chancellor there was little prospect of the government recovering its poise. More significantly for Mr Major, the chancellor had become a personal liability. With talk of a challenge to the prime minister in the autumn, he could not afford to allow Mr Lamont to deliver the November Budget. As party officials conducted an intensive post-mortem on the election defeats one factor cropped up again and again. The most powerful weapon deployed by the Liberal Democrats had been a simple slogan: Voting Conservative is a vote of confidence in Norman Lamont. The message was reinforced by an outcry from Conservative constituency associations. Everywhere party chairman Sir Norman Fowler went he was told that the party judged that the chancellor had become the focal point for discontent. No-one would trust the government - nor have confidence in its economic policies - as long as Mr Lamont was still there. The conclusion conveyed to Mr Major by Sir Norman and by Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, was that Mr Major's own position depended on him sacking the man who had run his campaign for the party leadership two-and-a-half years ago. Private soundings revealed that it was a judgment with which virtually everyone in the cabinet concurred. And although Mr Lamont still had friends on the back benches, the message was that they would not fight to keep him. Mr Lamont thought otherwise. He spent the past two weeks fighting for his political life - telling friends that he must not be made a scapegoat, urging support from colleagues. But the tide became unstoppable. A week ago the prime minister decided he had to go. Sir Norman was told at the weekend and spent the next few days in a series of meetings with the prime minister planning the wider changes which would accompany Mr Lamont's move. It was thought there was a chance that the former chancellor would accept the indignity of a move to the department of the environment. But the reshuffle was planned on the basis that he would refuse. The angry manner of Mr Lamont's departure yesterday was public testimony to his belief that Mr Major had betrayed him. The implicit threat was that he might now seek his revenge. His words from the back benches will be as eagerly awaited as those of Mr Nigel Lawson and Sir Geoffrey Howe in the final days of the Thatcher era. The message from Downing Street yesterday was that Mr Major had decided to 'refresh' his cabinet. It was true as far as it went. But no one at Westminster doubted that all the changes were built around a single aim - to put Mr Kenneth Clarke into the Treasury in time to halt the fall in the government's popularity and to start preparations for November's unified budget. The reshuffle was done with political skill. Mr Major demonstrated his authority by appointing Mr Clarke in spite of the fears on the Tory right that he remains wedded to the European exchange rate mechanism and, more generally, to a central role for Britain in the European Community. The political balance came from Mr Michael Howard's elevation to the Home Office. An instinctive right winger is now in charge of an issue that Conservatives regard as second only in importance to the economy - law and order. Mr Howard is now the candidate of the right should Mr Major fall under Westminster's No 11 bus. Mr John Redwood's elevation to the cabinet and the choice of Mr David Heathcote-Amory for the European job at the foreign office were designed to reinforce the same point - Mr Major is sensitive to the political balance in his party. Mr Major's hope is that the acrimony will fade, that the Tory right will judge that there is a common interest in uniting around the new chancellor, that Mr Clarke will start to persuade the electorate that the government will sustain the economy recovery and that it has restored its grip. The prime minister may prove correct. But he is aware of the dangers. There have been broad hints from friends of Mr Lamont that if there were mistakes made in the approach to sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, they were made by the prime minister. In the crude jargon of Westminster, Mr Lamont knows where the bodies were buried. He might decide to reveal them. Mr Major's recovery depends on his new chancellor reaping the rewards of Mr Lamont's Treasury stewardship. If the recovery is sustained and inflation remains low, the restless right of the Tory party may keep their counsel. Mr Lamont may choose discretion over revenge. Friends believe that his reputation will be best served by dignified silence. But as Mr Major's ministers digested the events of yesterday few denied there were still far too many 'ifs'. The scars left on the Tory party by the war over Maastricht will not heal quickly. Mr Major has dangerous and destructive enemies in his own party. He has appointed to the most powerful job in his government his most likely successor. What he needs now, above all else, is a run of political luck. He had no choice but to sack his chancellor. But it offers no guarantee of escape.</p>

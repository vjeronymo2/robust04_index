			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Credit where it is needed Sitting in the front room of her council house in Coniston Grove, Bradford, Ms Lesley Clayton watches Pounds 200 counted out in front of her. The money, which she will use to buy clothes and birthday presents for her two small sons, is to be repaid at Pounds 6 a week for a year. The annualised percentage rate of interest (APR) on the loan is 168.2 per cent, writes John Gapper. Ms Clayton, an unemployed single parent living on social security of Pounds 88 a week, is content with the terms. It is the second time the credit company Provident Financial has lent her money. She did not consider asking a bank. 'I've never dealt with a bank. If you don't have capital, they won't lend to you. You can't blame them really,' she says. Ms Clayton's assessment of the attitude of banks towards the unemployed and the low-paid is increasingly accurate. Many were welcomed by banks in the 1980s - 45 per cent of the 1.3m customers who repay loans weekly to Provident Financial have cheque accounts. But now they are less in demand. 'In an ideal world, we wouldn't have them on the books,' says a banker. Yet as banks concentrate their sales efforts on 'high net worth' professionals, other lenders are flourishing. Provident Financial is the biggest provider of unsecured credit to poor people. The company, founded in 1880 by a non-conformist philanthropist, raised profits on weekly credit by 18 per cent to Pounds 45.7m last year. Despite criticism of collected credit by consumer groups, 'the Provi', as it is known, also appears to be popular. In a survey by an independent market research company, its service was rated at 4.5 on a scale of 1 to 5 by its customers, compared to an average 3.8 rating for other banks. Ms Clayton agrees. 'They show you what you're letting yourself in for,' she says. The person showing her is Mrs Eileen Bosher, one of 10,000 collecting agents for Provident. Ms Bosher, who lives nearby, spends about 15 hours a week collecting weekly payments from her 88 customers. She earns abut Pounds 95 a week from the 7.5 per cent commission on gross collections of Pounds 1,250. 'It's a bit like being a social worker. I even do the shopping for some,' she says. Provident makes small loans - an average of Pounds 330. For most banks, loans of less than Pounds 1,000 do not cover costs. The APR rates on its Handycash loans range from 105.4 for a two - year term to 353.9 for a 20-week loan. Provident emphasises that its APR rates include all charges, in contrast with banks' rates on overdrafts which are around 20 per cent. It allows borrowers to miss occasional payments, but is strict about pursuing loans. Although it makes full provisions against all loans more than 12 weeks in arrears, it takes borrowers it believes are capable of paying to court. It also insists on agents continuing to call years after a loan has been written off, even in search of repayments as low as 50p. In the 1960s, Provident diversified into retailing through catalogues and stores where vouchers could be exchanged for goods. It feared that the ending of the weekly wage packet in manual jobs could doom weekly credit by taking cash from households. But the fears were unfulfilled, and it is now disposing of catalogue and store businesses to concentrate on cash loans. Mr Howard Bell, managing director of personal credit, says it is returning to its roots partly because it no longer feels threatened by banks. 'Banks moved down market in the 1980s, and they got their fingers burned,' he says. He says banks lack a network of local agents to judge the risk of unsecured lending to people with few or no assets. Provident is also at odds with banks in its scepticism about selling other products through its network. Having experimented with agents selling products such as holidays, it has given up. 'Our agents are simple folk, and everything else is more complex than cash loans. If people want to buy insurance, we'll lend them the money,' says Mr Bell. As banks spurn the poorer customers they took on in the 1980s, the prospects of the 900 credit companies that lend to 4m people appears healthy. Banks' increased use of credit ratings to repel such customers is only likely to add to demand for Mrs Bosher's loans. 'Let's face it, we're all human. Anyone can have a bad time,' she says.</p>

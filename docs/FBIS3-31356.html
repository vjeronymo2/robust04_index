Macedonian commentators warned that the Greek move would cause  regional destabilisation.    Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said Wednesday he  was  "forced" to take these steps because of what he called  landlocked Macedonia's "continual provocations and growing  irredentist intransigence."    Greece accuses the former Yugoslav republic of trying to  usurp a name Athens says is solely part of Greek heritage and of  harboring expansionist aims over the Greek province of the same  name.</p>

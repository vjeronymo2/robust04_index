			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAINFALL WILL NOT HALT WATER RATIONING PLAN  </P> <P> Despite the deluge of rain that hit the county last week, the city of Ventura  plans to forge ahead with a water rationing program.  </P> <P> Officials say the recent rain soaked into the ground, failing to provide the  runoff needed to add water to Ventura's two primary sources, the Ventura River  and Lake Casitas.  </P> <P> "The rain that we've had really soaked into the ground but hasn't added much to  runoff, which is what we need," said Shelley Jones, Ventura city public works  director.  </P> <P> The water conservation program, which is still under wraps, will include  elements of rationing programs used by six California cities, Jones said.  </P> <P> However, it will follow most closely a stringent program in Goleta that forces  residents who use excessive water to pay up to 10 times normal water rates,  Jones said.  </P> <P> The program will be unveiled for review by the City Council either later this  month or in early February.  </P> <P> Additional winter storms of the same magnitude could begin to produce runoff  that would help restore levels in Lake Casitas and the Ventura Rivers, said  Dick Barnett, engineering department manager for the Casitas Municipal Water  District.  </P> <P> However, Ventura plans to play it safe no matter what the winter brings.  </P> <P> "Even if it rains, there will still be a program in Ventura that will cause  people to reduce their water use," Jones said.  </P> <P> After a three-year statewide drought, 130 agencies statewide have imposed  rationing programs that affect 10 million people.  </P> <P> "Ventura is not all alone out there," Jones said.  </P></p>

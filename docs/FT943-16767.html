			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: German telecoms prepares for float Deutsche Telekom, the German state telecommunications monopoly, yesterday revealed the first casualties of a drastic financial restructuring designed to prepare for privatisation in 1996. Mr Helmut Ricke, chairman, expressed his confidence that privatisation would begin on schedule in 1996, with a first tranche of up to DM20bn (Dollars 12.7bn) in shares going on sale. His directors believe that up to 40 per cent of the group's future shareholders will be foreign. At the same time, Mr Ricke said he was 'extremely relieved' at news that the privatisation legislation had been approved this week by the German Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. It now faces one last hurdle in the Bundesrat, the upper house, on July 8. He revealed that the immediate effect of restructuring was a net loss for 1993 of DM2.87bn, compared with a loss of DM1.27bn in 1992, in spite of a sharp increase in turnover this time. Turnover rose 9.3 per cent to DM59bn. Telekom blamed the loss mainly on a DM4.4bn asset revaluation, which reduced profits before tax and government levies from DM7.6bn to DM3.2bn. Taxes and levies payable to the federal government, including a straight 10 per cent charge on sales payable instead of corporation tax, totalled DM6.1bn. The full scale of the adjustment necessary before privatisation was spelt out by Mr Ricke, and his finance director, Mr Joachim Kroske, in the annual results. The biggest problem for the enterprise is that its equity ratio - capital and reserves as a proportion of total assets - has shrunk to just 22 per cent, because of the huge borrowing programme to finance investments in modernisation, notably in eastern Germany. Total debt is DM107.5bn, or almost 70 per cent of the balance-sheet total, with a sharp increase in debenture loans. The massive investment programme in eastern Germany finally appears to be slowing, with gross investment in plant and machinery amounting to DM24.5bn, compared with DM27.5bn in 1992. Mr Ricke said the key to future flexibility and competitiveness lay in the development of new and stronger subsidiaries in important areas such as mobile communications and cable television, and a push into international joint ventures. He singled out the strategic alliance with France Telecom to include Sprint, the US telecommunications company, as 'the milestone of the year'. The deal would pave the way for global telecommunications services, he said, providing one-stop shopping to cosmopolitan residential customers, as well as multinational business customers. Heavy losses in the initial phase of mobile telephone investment - amounting to DM800m at DeTeMobil on the D1 mobile net alone last year - should be rapidly reduced. Losses would be less than half that rate in 1994, Mr Kroske said.</p>

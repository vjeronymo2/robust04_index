			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI Sir Colin Southgate's comments yesterday ruling out a demerger of Thorn EMI for the next three years were a disappointment. Splitting the group he chairs into its music and TV rental parts looked an attractive way of enhancing shareholder value. The advantages of keeping the two divisions yoked together are slim. The steady but not terribly exciting rental business arguably drags down the rating that free-standing EMI shares would enjoy. The best that can be said about Sir Colin's remarks is that they should clear up speculation over group strategy. The management's main challenge for the medium term is to hit its targets of boosting music margins from 14 per cent to 16 per cent and rental margins from 8 1/2 per cent to 10 per cent. The group's first quarter figures, reported for the first time yesterday, show a slight slip in margins in the music business. But it would be wrong to conclude much from this as EMI's results are highly cyclical and its Japanese arm did particularly well in the first quarter of last year. Equally the small improvement in rental margins means little, though it is encouraging that Thorn is close to stemming what has been a steady erosion of its UK rental business. If Thorn can hit its margins targets, investors will look kindly on its plans to diversify into book publishing. Sir Colin has highlighted this as an area where EMI could apply its existing skills in managing intellectual property. With a demerger off the agenda, management will certainly have time to look at other strategic moves.</p>

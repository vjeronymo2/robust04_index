			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Property Surging UK equity and bond markets and hints of lower interest rates have created another ripple of excitement in property. With yields on most assets now falling sharply, the 9 per cent yield apparently still on offer is attractive. Investors able to buy prime properties with long leases, secure tenants and upwards-only rent reviews may earn higher returns than from almost any other asset class over the next few years. Theoretically, property shares should be highly geared to a recovery in capital values. This helps explain the sector's continued popularity despite its mere 4 per cent yield. There is a danger, though, that property shares are running way ahead of themselves. The recent rash of rights issues has only reduced gearing. Moreover, it will be difficult for companies to buy attractive properties since sellers are scarce in a rising market. Property companies may be tempted to buy secondary locations. But such sites are by definition risky. Any large interest rate rises would expose them horribly. Capital values are unlikely to be underpinned by private buyers because of the banks' reluctance to lend. The hope must be that rising rents will push up capital values. But that prospect remains hazy, considering the vast glut of secondary property still on the market. The latest data suggests rental values are still continuing to fall.</p>

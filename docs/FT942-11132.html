			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (6): Tentacles of a top hotelier - Profile / Dionisio Pestana Dionisio Pestana is the acceptable face of capitalism in Madeira (though he does have a few detractors). He admits to working a 26-hour day, has no hobbies (since he gave up squash and tennis a few years ago), does not admit to being one of the richest men on the island - which he certainly is - and shows no signs of easing up in his myriad business activities. But then, why should he: he is a mere 42 years of age? First, a few business facts. The privately-owned Group Pestana, in effect controlled by Dionisio, runs the largest hotel chain in Madeira, but not only that: it is the biggest hotel operator in mainland Portugal, with extensive properties in the Algarve, Estoril and Lisbon. In addition, the group is in effective control (the regional government has 25 per cent of the shareholding, but no blocking 'golden share') of the Madeira Development Company, which runs the island's expanding free trade industrial zone, the offshore financial centre, the industrial services division and the international shipping register. Mr Pestana also has an interest in a charter airline, owns travel agencies in a number of European centres, including Britain and Germany, and has even ventured into electricity generation by buying in some windmills and associated expertise from Denmark, 'because our group's electricity bills were getting too high'. Overall, an extensive industrial and commercial portfolio, and Mr Pestana is not even a native son. The foundations of the Pestana empire go back a bit, to his father, Manuel, who like thousands of his fellow-islanders left Madeira in the 1950s and 1960s in search of work and fortune. In those days, Madeira was slap-bang in the sealane from Britain to South Africa via the Cape Verde islands. Manuel took one of these passing ships to the Cape and soon built up a highly successful construction company in South Africa and Mozambique. Dionisio is Manuel Pestana's only child. After university, where he took a business degree, the young Pestana went to Europe on a working vacation. Visiting his father's island homeland, he was encouraged by Manuel's dream of building a luxury hotel in the centre of Funchal. With foresight - the Salazar dictatorship still ruled in Portugal - and using some of the early profits from his construction business Mr Pestana acquired a prime site in the city in the mid-1960s. The timing of his arrival in Madeira could not have been better, coming immediately after the 1974 revolution in Portugal. He explains: 'The whole country, including of course Madeira, was in a state of shock after the years of dictatorship. There were few entrepreneurs: no-one at that time had the courage, resources or commercial vision to take the plunge in the new, free Portugal. As someone from outside, I guess I saw things differently.' His father's dream was soon fulfilled with the building of the Madeira Sheraton (since renamed the Madeira Carlton where Mr Pestana retains his executive offices), and was the foundation for the group's rapidly-expanded hotels chain on the island. His next move was into Portugal itself. While tourism in all its forms - Mr Pestana is a believer in a totally integrated approach with the company controlling direct sales outlets, providing air transportation and accommodation - remains the sheet-anchor of the group, its tentacles have moved much wider. In a dominant partnership deal, which is unusual to say the least, Pestana has joined with the regional government to control and operate the Madeira Development Company, and hence ownership (until the year 2017 under existing arrangements) of the industrial zone, the offshore financial centre and the embryo shipping register (MAR). Mr Pestana may be in bed with the local regime, but he makes no bones about who calls the shots; his 75 per cent stake is what counts. And, to be fair, that appears to be the way that Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, the president of the regional government, likes it. The International Business Centre was conceived as an operation run for free enterprise businesses by free-enterprise businessmen. The founding philosophy was to keep the bureaucrats at bay and red tape to a minimum, maximise fiscal and other operating concessions and get as much development money as possible out of Brussels (the European Union). Taming the bureaucrats and getting the necessary enabling legislation through the central government and parliament in Lisbon did, however, take its time - in fact almost the entire decade of the 1980s. But Dionisio Pestana was not idle. When not alternatively praising and threatening the regional and central governments, he was busy scouting out other similar tax-free facilities, making a special study of the industrial zone at Shannon in Ireland and of the Dublin financial services centre. Does his considerable hold on the island's economy bring with it social obligations to the wider community? Mr Pestana reflects for a while before saying 'No. We're in business for profits, to make money. All our enterprises are designed to be profitable, but it doesn't always happen that way. To that extent, I guess, we often do end up with a social input.' As an afterthought, and without clarification, he mentions that he does have a 'small foundation'. The collective 'we' and 'our' in his replies seem to run against the man's very image, a style and approach suggesting that he rules his business empire like a dictator, a one-man executive board. Again, a brief period of reflection, and then Mr Pestana rattles off the names of his top aides and departmental managers. Most notably, he mentions the widely-respected Mr Francisco Costa, who heads the Madeira Development Company. But there is a small slip. 'Costa is my man on the company; we meet every second Monday for discussions and policy decisions.' Its all rather precise, but then Mr Pestana is a precise man, but he is not without wit and a good deal of charm. He prefers living on Madeira rather than in Lisbon because he can get around quicker and avoid the social circle in the Portuguese capital. That, he implies, would be rather a waste of profitable working time. One thing is for certain: Manuel Pestana, now in retirement, can be proud of his boy.</p>

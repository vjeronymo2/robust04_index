			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead Hanson may have some good news on the US coal strike when it reports annual profits on Thursday. The strike cost Hanson Pounds 29m in the third quarter and it predicted it would cost Pounds 60m to Pounds 80m in the fourth, to the end of September. Investors are keen to see a settlement, the only question is what the coal producers will have had to give to the mineworkers to achieve that. The market is also hoping for a dividend increase, although forecasts are for a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.29bn (FRS3 basis) in 1992 to Pounds 1.05bn-Pounds 1.07bn, and around Pounds 50m less excluding disposal profits against Pounds 1.09bn. Either way earnings per share will be significantly lower. Hanson pays its dividends quarterly, and has paid 2.85p for each of the last four payments. Some feel an increase is due, perhaps to 3p a quarter, while others think a rise will not be forthcoming. The City is anticipating a steady and unspectacular set of figures from GEC, which reports its first six months on Wednesday. The expectation is that the second half of the year will be significantly stronger when a number of large contracts are due for implementation. Profits before tax are expected to be in the region Pounds 350m - Pounds 360m, roughly level with or perhaps slightly down on the Pounds 356m recorded in the same period last year. Earnings per share are expected to be about 8.1p, compared with 8p and a five per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2.81p (2.68p) is forecast. Bass, the UK brewing, hotels and retail group, is expected to report on Wednesday a 5 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits from Pounds 473m to about Pounds 495m. Brewing profits are likely to be hit by margin pressures and bad debt provisions, and pub retailing will feel the effects of disposals. Improvements should come from Holiday Inn in the US and UK leisure operations. A Pounds 175m restructuring charge will reduce Grand Metropolitan's pre-tax profits for the year to about Pounds 770m, 16 per cent down on last year's Pounds 913m. Thursday's announcement is expected to reveal a brighter picture at the trading level. IDV, the spirits division, should achieve double digit profits growth with some help from currency translation. Another good performance is forecast for Burger King and North American food operations will show some recovery. Higher losses and Pounds 6m to Pounds 8m of restructuring costs at the Racal-Redac software subsidiary and other special factors are expected to result in markedly lower pre-tax profits at Racal Electronics, the data communications, radio and network services group, which reports its interims on Thursday. Pre-tax profit estimates range from about Pounds 12m to Pounds 16m against Pounds 23.1m at the interim stage last year. 'Normalised' pre-tax profits are likely to be around Pounds 21.7m. MEPC, the UK's second largest property company,is expected to announce on Thursday pre-tax profits for the year to end September of around Pounds 99m, down on the previous Pounds 109.6m. Net asset value is estimated to emerge at 440p, down from 465p last time. However, the dividend is expected at least to meet the company's June forecast of 14.75p.</p>

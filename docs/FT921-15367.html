			<p>920110 FT  10 JAN 92 / Mayor opposes London-wide body SIR BRIAN Jenkins, the lord mayor of London, last night called for co-operation between existing borough councils rather than the creation of a new authority for the whole capital. He said he opposed calls to establish a 'mayor for London'. He told leaders of councils and voluntary bodies from across the capital that partnership, not legislation, should be the way forward.</p>

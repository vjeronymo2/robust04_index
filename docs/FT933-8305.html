			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / World Trade News: UK's very tangible benefits of invisibles  -A 20% rise in the City of London's foreign earnings from financial services IMAGES of young men and women aggressively selling the pound on Black Wednesday last September did little to endear the City of London to the British public. But the UK's financial centre may yet work its way back into the nation's affections with the publication yesterday of detailed invisible earnings figures. These show that although City and other financial institutions did not earn enough to offset the UK's considerable trade deficit last year, the deficit on the current account would have been considerably worse without the overseas earnings of the Square Mile. According to British Invisibles, a trade group which promotes UK financial and other services abroad, net overseas receipts of UK financial institutions jumped 19.8 per cent last year from Pounds 15.7bn in 1991 to Pounds 18.8bn. The strong performance contributed to an overall invisibles surplus of Pounds 4.8bn in 1992, compared with a surplus of Pounds 2.6bn in the previous year. With a visible, or merchandise, trade deficit of Pounds 13.4bn the overall current account deficit in 1992 was Pounds 8.6bn, considerably lower than had been expected. It compared with a deficit of Pounds 7.6bn in 1991 and Pounds 18.3bn in 1990. The improvement in invisible earnings was distributed fairly evenly across the whole financial sector, with particularly strong overseas earnings by pension funds, investment and unit trusts, insurance institutions and dealers operating in the securities markets. But although the figures are promising, the underlying performance of the services and financial sectors was muddied last year by the devaluation of sterling in September. This boosted income earned in foreign currencies in the fourth quarter and there was a corresponding sharp rise in portfolio earnings. Total income from portfolio investment increased by 37.7 per cent last year to Pounds 10.6bn. Within this, portfolio investment income for the banking sector rose by 19.2 per cent, reflecting a greater emphasis on investment in securities. Pension fund income from portfolio investment rose to Pounds 2.2bn compared with Pounds 1.56bn the previous year. While welcome, the leap in earnings will only improve the UK's current account position in the long term if the pound stays at its present level. If not, the better invisibles surplus resulting from the devaluation will prove transient. Neither British Invisibles nor the Central Statistical Office was able to say yesterday how much the improvement in overseas earnings from financial institutions stemmed from the devaluation of sterling and how much was due to an underlying improvement in the performance of the sector. 'The overall increase might have been exaggerated by special factors, but there has unquestionably been some healthy growth underneath,' said Ms Jill Leyland, who prepared the statistics for British Invisibles. The figures showed that bank earnings from overseas increased by 10.3 per cent last year to Pounds 8.7bn. British Invisibles said the good figures were due in part to the reduced costs of the banks' overseas sterling borrowing, but also the sharp rise in portfolio investment income. Dealers operating in the securities markets earned a net Pounds 1.4bn last year compared with Pounds 791m in 1990. Although this series is erratic, Ms Leyland said the jump probably reflected the turmoil of the markets in September last year. Earnings for the insurance sector were the best for five years with net overseas receipts jumping 21.6 per cent to Pounds 4.3bn compared with Pounds 3.5bn in 1991. Mr Tony Baker of the Association of British Insurers said that while devaluation had boosted earnings, particularly by inflating premiums from North America, the rise also reflected a substantial increase in portfolio investment income as a result of higher investment in overseas equities and industrial bonds. 'These figures show the importance of the insurance sector to the UK economy,' said Mr Baker. 'You have to ask where we would be without them, especially when you look at the balance of trade figures.' Net services income of the insurance sector was adversely affected by continuing higher claims, widespread flooding in Europe last September and, to a lesser extent, Hurricane Andrew in the US, British Invisibles said.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 NET OVERSEAS RECEIPTS OF UNITED KINGDOM                    FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (Pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               1982   1983   1984    1985    1986    1987  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banks                        2,378  3,026  4,353   4,619   5,385   4,493 Insurance institutions       1,648  2,230  2,497   3,266   4,898   4,633 Fund managers                  n/a    n/a    n/a     n/a     n/a     n/a Investment trusts              116    162    170     183     189     170 Unit trusts                     63    109    126     138     214     219 Pension funds                  326    459    559     810   1,032     713 Dealers operating in   securities markets           120    102    134     227     583   1,162 Commodity traders, bullion   dealers and export houses    367    441    499     511     440     368 Baltic Exchange                246    246    270     229     221     227 Lloyd's Register of Shipping    37     33     27      25      24      22 Money market brokers            38     40     49      57      58      59 Finance leasing                 68     64     72      66      50      40 Less adjustment               -848   -924 -2,062  -2,224  -1,658  -1,171 Total                        4,559  5,988  6,694   7,907  11,436  10,935  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1988    1989    1990    1991    1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banks                             4,440   5,901   7,231   7,911   8,729 Insurance institutions            3,411   2,795   2,389   3,570   4,340 Fund managers                       n/a     n/a     202     231     282 Investment trusts                   155     183     223     191     293 Unit trusts                         254     352     388     353     486 Pension funds                       933   1,394   1,390   1,566   2,229 Dealers operating in   securities markets                901   1,361     936     791   1,435 Commodity traders, bullion   dealers and export houses         415     325     431     493     454 Baltic Exchange                     334     427     474     470     401 Lloyd's Register of Shipping         18      23      29      33      39 Money market brokers                 56      73      85      84      92 Finance leasing                      40      40      40      40      40 Less adjustment                    -630    -690     -64     -24       0 Total                            10,327  12,184  13,754  15,709  18,820  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Central Statistical Office  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Arts: Salome - Opera For this opera, there was a time when censors like the Lord Chamberlain insisted that the head of John the Baptist be kept under decent wraps on its salver, so that the squeamish might pretend that Salome was only making love to the Sunday joint. Not any more: the prophet's severed head was my third last week, after The Bacchae and Richard III. In Peter Hall's production, revived at the Royal Opera by himself and Jeannette Aster, it is almost a portrait-bust with gore. Natural enough, for Michael Devlin's 'Jokanaan' is a visual apparition above all: young, lithe and near-naked, gaunt and wild-eyed, precisely as required. Just any old head later would never do. His lean baritone sounds properly forceful on stage; it is not a very resonant voice, and the electronic relay from his cistern doesn't flatter it. (A bit of re-miking might make all the difference.) Also new to the production is Kenneth Riegel's first-rate Herod, unerringly pointed and telling, with no campy excess. Some threadbare timbre near the end, as he pleads desperately with Salome to choose some alternative prize, is no matter. One rarely gets a Herod of such finesse. His Herodias is Gillian Knight, who booms sonorously but is made to look too much a blatant cartoon to carry much baleful weight. Robin Leggate repeats his sterling Narraboth, Fiona Kimm is a good Page (why not more boyish, though?) and all the lesser roles are cannily filled. About Maria Ewing's Salome there can be little argument. This is a hugely fascinating portrayal, distinguished no less by its meaningful stillnesses than by its largesse of psychological detail. Famously, when Strauss told his prim first Salome that he wanted 'a 16-year-old princess with the voice of an Isolde', she retorted that that was an 'either/or'. If the Ewing soprano is not exactly an Isolde instrument, it soars confidently over the orchestral waves in the final monologue. The controversial vocal tricks that she likes to exploit are used here to colour passages that aptly make one's skin creep. The physical embodiment is superb (and her scorched-earth policy with her Seven Veils just as sensational as it was in 1988), but at a level of intensity far above mere sex-kitten stuff. In fact, the Ewing reading is severly consistent: her teenage Salome is in the grip of an idealised fantasy of erotic love, so private and self-contained that Jokanaan merely supplies an abstract target for it. The Seven Veils dance spells out obsessive yearning - sensibly not too strenuous, in view of the monologue yet to come, but vividly apropos: even her unashamed final pose looks like the climax of a secret dream, not a public seduction. After that, I missed only a note of rising exacerbation in her repeated 'The head of Jokaa-naa-an]' (Strauss has written it viciously into the notes). Both earlier and later, there were places where I wished that she could boast a thrilling pianissimo to match her more forward effects. Yet she found a teasing lightness in places where Isolde-voices never do. Edward Downes conducts the score solidly, and paces it well. More thrilling pianissimos from the pit would have been welcome too (especially at the start), and the brass were inclined to bark rather than bite - Downes rarely made Strauss's dynamic 'hair-pins' as sharp or as tense as they can be. Even without the operatic screw tightened to the hilt, however, this Salome is a remarkably potent affair. Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. In repertory until to June 10</p>

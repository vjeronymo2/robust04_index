			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / International Company News: Zenith and Novell in networking initiative Zenith Data Systems, the personal computer arm of Groupe Bull of France, and Novell, the leading US computer networking software supplier, will today announce an initiative to simplify and cut the cost of networking for small workgroups. The initiative, if successful, will strengthen Novell's hold on the networking market while throwing an additional lifeline to the troubled ZDS. The two companies are launching a family of network servers, small computers which manage the information flow around a network. Priced between Dollars 999 and Dollars 1,599, the servers claim to bring the advantages of shared information and services to groups of up to 20 staff without the disadvantages of traditional networking methods. Setting up the specialised hardware and software for networking takes several hours and requires experienced engineers. These networks are too complex and expensive for small businesses or workgroups. ZDS and Novell claim the new servers, the Z-Stor family, can be set up in less than 10 minutes by computing novices. The Z-Stor units will be the first to use Novell's new operating software derived from its acquisition last year of Digital Research, a pioneer in operating software. The software is a competitor to Microsoft's MS/Dos and Windows, but Mr Bruce Fryer, ZDS product manager, said there was no intention of using Novell's system on other ZDS computers.</p>

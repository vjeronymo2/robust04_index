			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Yeltsin 'to press on with own poll' THE closest advisers of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said yesterday that he would press ahead with his own poll - to run parallel with a referendum conducted under the control of the Congress of People's Deputies. This decision, and the intention of both sides to further their own understanding of their constitutional rights, means that the Russian power struggle continues unabated. Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, told the daily Izvestiya that 'the decisions of the ninth Congress will not stop Mr Yeltsin from carrying out his own simple and very democratic plan - to put to a popular vote the question of trust in the president. At the same time the draft for a new constitution will also be put to popular conformation.' Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and Mr Yeltsin's chief tactician during the Congress session, said that there would be a 'battle of the referendums' as the Congress outcome had left Mr Yeltsin 'probably only one choice: to hold a parallel poll to the referendum'. Mr Shakhrai said that the Congress, which ended four tumultuous days on Monday, had been a 'tragi-comic act'. He said that a list of allegations that Congress had breached the constitution were now in front of the president and, when signed, would be sent to the Constitutional Court. The parliament, said Mr Shakhrai, was now 'outside of a legal state' and thus Mr Yeltsin had no obligation to obey any of its directives or decrees. However, he said that the president's side would as far as possible follow the constitutional order, and would not press ahead immediately with legislation under the decree establishing a special presidential regime. 'We will wait for some time,' said the deputy premier, 'but this cannot be long, perhaps a day or two.' However, Mr Yeltsin himself seemed less certain, according to reports of comments made by the deputies who met him yesterday to discuss the results of the special Congress. Many of the deputies urged him not to hold his own poll - and one, asking not to be named, said that 'Yeltsin acknowledged that the decision to hold a parallel vote was ill-considered'. Mr Yeltsin, who proposed the idea of a referendum on trust in himself and on approval of a new constitution, saw Congress take the idea and rewrite the questions - striking out one on the constitution and adding questions on elections of the president and deputies at an unspecificed date, and on approval of the economic reforms. A poll conducted after the Congress session by the Russian Institute for Public Opinion showed that Mr Yeltsin retains the trust of 50 per cent of the population.</p>

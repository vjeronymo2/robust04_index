			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Berlusconi and RAI do battle The new Italian government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi yesterday decided to raise the stakes in its battle to gain control of the RAI state broadcasting organisation by pledging to remove the management. The RAI management was brought in last year to cut costs and end its political partiality but the new government has felt RAI to be prejudiced against it. The government was obliged yesterday to renew legislation that enabled debt-ridden RAI to keep operating but the cabinet made it clear it would only do this if there was an immediate management change. Management had earlier threatened to go to court and force bankruptcy, thus depriving the government control over its future.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government fights to recover on VAT  -Taxation LABOUR yesterday escalated its offensive over the government's plans for value added tax by seeking to highlight inconsistencies in prime minister John Major's statements on the subject. Using remarks made by Mr Major last April, the opposition tried to cast doubt on his apparent pledge earlier this week not to implement further VAT increases. It later appeared to be unwittingly assisted in its aims when Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, reasserted Conservative commitment to the notion of indirect taxation. Mr MacGregor said the Tory-engineered shift from direct to indirect taxation was 'absolutely right' because it enabled more people to spend money as they wished to spend it. 'That is the policy we have consistently pursued, with the result that direct taxes have come substantially down,' he said. In an exceptionally rowdy Commons, Mr Roy Hattersley, deputising for Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, opened by inquiring whether Mr Major's remarks on Tuesday constituted a 'categorical assurance' that the VAT rate would not rise. If it was, he asked, how did that assurance square with Mr Major's statement made last April 6 that 'no honest government could give a categorical assurance that they would not increase VAT - no government ever has and no government ever will.' Was Mr Major telling the truth 'last Tuesday or last April?' Mr MacGregor, standing in for the absent Mr Major, said the prime minister's remarks on Tuesday had made the position 'absolutely clear.' Mr Major had stated then there would be no VAT increase. The government had published its spending plans and did not need a VAT rise to meet them. He said this contrasted with Labour's position, which involved 'high spending policies and is all over the place in deciding how it intends to finance them.' Mr Hattersley retorted by maintaining that Mr MacGregor lacked either the courage or the authority to say whether the prime minister's pledge was categorical or represented a promise he had no intention of keeping. Mr Peter Kilfoyle, (Lab Walton) asked by how much VAT had risen since the Tories entered office in 1979.</p>

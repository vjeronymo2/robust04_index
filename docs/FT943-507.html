			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Mexican ruling party official assassinated: Stock exchange falls sharply as fragile political peace is shattered The secretary-general of Mexico's ruling party, Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, was shot dead yesterday in the centre of Mexico City, shattering the fragile political peace following last month's presidential elections, writes Ted Bardacke in Mexico City. Mr Ruiz, number two in the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) and former governor of the state of Guerrero, was last week named head of the PRI's majority delegation in the Chamber of Deputies. He was also said to be in the running to become interior minister, in charge of internal security and politics. Mr Ruiz was shot in the neck as he was driving his car away from a breakfast meeting with PRI deputies. The alleged assailant, who witnesses said was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, was being held by federal agents. Mexican financial markets fell sharply on the news. The stock market was down 53 points, a fall of 1.9 per cent, at the close. It had fallen as much as 3 per cent during the day. The peso fell 1.1 centavos against the dollar to 3.3965. The attack came just over six months after the ruling party's presidential candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, was shot dead in Tijuana. Mr Colosio's murder, the first assassination of a senior government figure in Mexico since the 1920s, together with the still unresolved Indian peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, led to concern that more political violence might follow. His replacement, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, won the August 21 election, in spite of continuing frustration in Mexico that the motives behind Mr Colosio's death have yet to be explained. Mr Ruiz, a graduate of Essex University, had been named as a negotiator for Mr Zedillo in the talks over political reform expected to begin next month. At the breakfast Mr Ruiz was attending before the attack, he explained to new PRI deputies the framework of both national political reform and internal reform of the ruling party. These called for eight months of consultations culminating in changes to internal PRI structures, including the method of selecting candidates. Mr Ruiz was known as an advocate of internal primary elections as well as a more powerful and independent legislature.</p>

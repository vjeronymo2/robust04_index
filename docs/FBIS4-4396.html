			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- An electric appliance  discount chain store without a license to sell rice decided  Wednesday to call off the planned rice sales next Sunday [3  April] after discussing the matter with the Food Agency and the  Tokyo Metropolitan Government. "The three sides concluded the  talks by deciding we should donate the rice," said Toshio  Miyaji, president of the Tokyo-based Jonan Denki Co.    About 15 tons of rice the company has bought from farmers in  Ogata, Akita Prefecture, will be donated to old people's homes  with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government helping in its  distribution.    Jonan Denki's store in Tokyo's Suginami ward sold rice last  Sunday in defiance of the Food Agency's warning that selling  rice without a government license is a violation of the Food  Control Law. About 2,000 people lined up to buy about 12 tons  of brand-name rice produced in Ogata.    The bad weather last year has made domestically grown rice  scarce, and consumers have been queuing and paying high prices  for domestic rice since February.</p>

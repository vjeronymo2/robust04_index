			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Press Center has  announced that all information points to the fact that Generals  Perisic [chief of the General Staff of the FRY Army] and Mladic  are directly commanding the Serbian aggressor's offensive on  Gorazde.    The immediate commander of the ground forces is Colonel  Grubac, who has received orders to unconditionally continue  (?attacks) and capture Gorazde. It is up to him to decide on  the means of achieving this. The Chetnik warlords' intentions  toward Gorazde have not been deterred by yesterday's NATO air  strikes. The losses inflicted by the NATO air strikes on  Chetnik positions are not significant for Perisic, Mladic, and  Grubac, although the targets that were hit are obviously  important to the Chetniks and there is reliable information that  they suffered losses on their side. [Words indistinct] will not  say a word about this, just like they did not admit that it was  their planes that were shot down over Novi Travnik at the  beginning of March this year.    Information [words indistinct] must not be given out.  Karadzic and Mladic have imposed an embargo on everything that  is happening around Gorazde. Colonel Grubac, who has orders to  capture Gorazde, did not take the NATO planes' attack as a  threat. On the contrary. This is yet another in a series of  motives to continue carrying out his orders. General Momcilo  Perisic is chief of the General Staff of the Army of the  so-called Yugoslavia, and although he and Mladic are the same  generation as far as their education in military schools is  concerned, when it comes to operations around Gorazde, Perisic  is avoiding Mladic. He is often in contact with Colonel Grubac,  who directly briefs him on all events. Perisic's obsession is  the forcing of the Drina River, which is why he has sent  pontoons of the so-called Army of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia to this area. It is not excluded that in case of  repeated NATO air strikes, the Chetnik forces will attempt to  down them. The Chetnik persistence best shows whether and how  many more planes again need to attack the aggressor's phalanx  around Gorazde, states the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army Press Center.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Tax staff to ballot on market testing THE FIRST nationwide ballot on industrial action against market testing in the Civil Service begins later this week and may lead to serious disruption in the Inland Revenue, David Goodhart writes. The Inland Revenue Staff Federation is asking its 50,000 members to vote for a policy of non-co-operation if, as expected, the government decides to extend market testing in the Revenue beyond the experiments being undertaken with secretarial staff. The result is not expected until January. Mr Clive Brooke, IRSF general secretary, is warning of a 'spring of discontent' next year in the Civil Service when disputes over implementing the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay squeeze will coincide with a wave of market testing. The government has identified more than 3,000 Inland Revenue jobs for market testing, the largest group in the Information Technology Office.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  (CPRF) in a statement on May 3 bitterly denounces in the name of  the nation the treacherous crime of the Kim Yong-sam group in  totally blocking dialogue and negotiation for the relaxation of  tensions and peaceful reunification and running about recklessly  to unleash a nuclear war for destroying the entire nation, in  league with outside forces.    Recalling that the present South Korean rulers are opposing  the convocation of a national conference with far- fetched  arguments and are these days rushing headlong along a dangerous  road of war against the North with the encouragement of outside  forces, the spokesman says:    "It is the unshakable will of the entire nation to break the  deadlock and open up a decisive phase for reunification by  achieving great national unity this year, one year before the  50th anniversary of the liberation of the country. [no closing  quotation mark as received]    The Kim Yong-sam group must act with discretion, clearly  mindful that their blocking the historical national conference  proposed to be convened around August 15 is an unpardonable  anti-national crime against reunification.    The spokesman ardently calls upon all the political parties,  organisations and individual figures in South Korea and overseas  Koreans to join in the grand march for reunification with a bold  decision.    He expresses the hope that all the progressive organisations  and people of the world will pay deep attention to the grave  situation created on the Korean peninsula and continue to extend  active support and solidarity to the Korean people in their just  cause of national reconciliation and unity and the peaceful  reunification of the country.</p>

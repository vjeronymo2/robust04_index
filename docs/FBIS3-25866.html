			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by staff reporter Guan Yanzhong (4619 1750 1813): </F> "A Just Cause Enjoys Abundant Support"]    [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO)--It was shortly  after 2200 on 25 January. The 19th meeting of the International  Union for Protection of Nature and Natural Resources, held at  the Sheraton Hotel in Buenos Aires, began to discuss the  so-called motion on Tibet.    In his speech, delivered on the morning of 24 January, the  Chinese representative strongly urged the meeting to cancel the  motion on the Tibet issue put forward by Australia's Wilderness  Society, for it contradicted fact and international law. This  evening, the Chinese representative was the first speaker. He  reminded members of the union, above all state members of the  union, to note that "this shortest motion, which in fact does  not have any suggestions, is only a political petition; it views  Tibet as a country and preaches the independence of Tibet. This  is an action which violates international law because the United  Nations recognizes Tibet as an inseparable part of Chinese  territory." The Chinese representative pointed out that the  alleged "rapid destruction of environment in Tibet," mentioned  in the motion, is not in accordance with the facts.    Thereafter, the representatives of the Norwegian, Pakistani,  and Belgian state members, the latter representing the European  Community, spoke. They pointed out that "what is mentioned in  this motion involves China's internal affair, and is a political  matter," "not a matter for the union." Therefore they were  opposed to the motion. The representative of the Australian  state member was also opposed to the motion, saying that "this  is a matter which involves state sovereignty."    These righteous speeches made the motion sponsor feel  uneasy.  The representative of Australia's Wilderness Society falsely  claimed that "according to the data provided by the exiled  Tibetan government, the number of forests in Tibet has greatly  decreased, the human rights of `natives' have been seriously  infringed, and the environment in Tibet has been seriously  destroyed." He still stubbornly adhered to his original motion.  Thereafter, a representative of an environmental protection  organization from New Zealand pretended to be very solemn when  reading a so-called document which said that "politically, Tibet  has no human rights, and its natural environment has been  destroyed."    The Chinese representative pointed out in his speech that  the  meeting of the union is not a political forum for discussing  human rights, and that "if the motion sponsor is interested, we  can provide him with the white paper published by China on  sovereignty over Tibet and the human rights situation there."  "We have a lot of data to illustrate that Tibet's environmental  protection is the best in China." The Chinese representative  pointed out, tit-for-tat, that "Tibetans are not so-called  `natives,' they are the masters of Tibet and account for an  absolute majority of the population in Tibet. What has been  mentioned by the motion sponsor is totally not in accordance  with fact..."    The chairman of the meeting decided to put the motion to a  vote. An absolute majority of state and governmental  organization members, as well as nongovernmental organization  members, voted against it. The so-called motion on Tibet issue  was rejected by the meeting in this way.    A just cause enjoys abundant support; an unjust cause finds  scant support. Obviously, one cannot wins hearts and minds if  he attempts to use international forums to achieve the aim of  dividing China.</p>

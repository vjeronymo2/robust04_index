			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alterations provisions have been similarly reorganized to contain the exceptions proposed throughout the NPRM. The interim final rule includes special technical provisions for alterations to address existing conditions and constraints. Guided by the new construction requirements, which must be observed when feasible, entities making alterations will be able to craft an alternative which best fits existing conditions. The distinction between new construction and alterations is more fully discussed at ADAAG 14.2 (New Construction) and 14.3 (Alterations) and in appendix notes to these sections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.1&blank;General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is a scoping provision which applies the requirements of this section and those of ADAAG 4 (Accessible Elements and Spaces: Scope and Technical Requirements) to pedestrian areas, elements, and facilities in the public right-of-way which are subject to title II of the ADA. Where the provisions of this section differ from the requirements of ADAAG 4, the provisions of this special application section prevail. An appendix note distinguishes between the public right-of-way and adjacent sites, provides examples of work covered by this section, and clarifies the application of ADAAG 4 provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed to cover only work provided as part of a ``public improvement project.'' Several commenters from the public works agencies of local governments noted that work in the public right-of-way may be accomplished in other ways, as, for example, in urban areas, where public site improvements may be provided by developers of sites adjacent to the public right-of-way. These and other commenters also requested a clarification of the responsibilities of private sector entities (such as utilities) undertaking work in the public right-of-way by franchise or other agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``public improvement project'' is not used in the interim final rule. This clarifies that all work in the public right-of-way is covered by this section. For example, these guidelines must be applied to work undertaken in the public right-of-way by any entity under contract, agreement, or other arrangement, such as utilities, contractors, or developers. However, because new or altered work in the public right-of-way will be constructed or installed within the physical limits of a project area or the contractual limits of a project scope of work, all elements, areas and facilities in the public right-of-way that are required to be accessible by section 14 retain the concept of the project as the basis for their scoping. For example, the number of new on-street parking spaces required to be accessible by ADAAG 14.2.6(1)(a) will be based upon the total number of new on-street parking provided in the project area. The appendix note has been expanded to include examples of covered projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters requested clarification of the differences between pedestrian facilities on a site covered by ADAAG 4 (e.g., a park, campus, plaza) and those in the public right-of-way covered by this section (e.g., public sidewalks). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only work in the public right-of-way is covered by ADAAG 14. The public right-of-way is the strip of land over which a public road and its appurtenances (e.g., shoulders, parkways, and public sidewalks) are built. Most public rights-of-way are coincident with and include roadways; some are established as easements to provide pedestrian access to a public facility through private sites or properties. Public rights-of-way are generally limited in width, occupied below-grade by public services, such as utilities, and above-grade by traffic control devices, signage, and other street furnishings. A public or private site, however, is a parcel of land bounded by a property line or a designated portion of a public right-of-way. For example, a new park or campus containing sidewalks, curb ramps, and street crossings, is a site covered by ADAAG 4.1.2 (Accessible Sites and Exterior Facilities: New Construction), whereas a downtown pedestrian shopping street in the public right-of-way between opposing property lines is covered by ADAAG 14. The appendix note at A14.1 has been expanded to clarify the distinction between a public right-of-way and a site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the future, the Department of Justice will consider whether to amend its regulation implementing title III to apply ADAAG 14 to streets and sidewalks within large, privately-developed sites and subdivisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters requested clarification of the differences between ADAAG 14 and the technical provisions of ADAAG 4.2 through 4.35 for the same or similar elements, such as public sidewalk curb ramps, passenger loading zones, parking spaces, and walks and sidewalks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, the technical provisions in ADAAG 4.2 to 4.35 apply to public rights-of-way unless modified by ADAAG 14. ADAAG 14 modifies some technical provisions of ADAAG 4.2 to 4.35 to address site constraints particular to the public right-of-way. For example, a public sidewalk curb ramp in the public right-of-way is subject to the technical provisions of ADAAG 14.2.4 (Public Sidewalk Curb Ramps), not to ADAAG 4.7 (Curb Ramps). A public sidewalk in the public right-of-way is subject to the technical provisions of ADAAG 14.2.1 (Public Sidewalks), which substitutes a continuous passage for the accessible route contained in ADAAG 4.3. Some technical provisions, however, such as those contained in 4.2.4 (Clear Floor or Ground Space for Wheelchairs), 4.9 (Stairs), and 4.27 (Controls and Operating Mechanisms) apply without modification to public rights-of-way and are referenced in the interim final guidelines. This has been clarified in an appendix note. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.1.1&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section defines common elements of the public pedestrian environment, including continuous passage, public sidewalk, public sidewalk curb ramp, public right-of-way and site infeasibility. Appendix notes clarify the definitions of continuous passage and public sidewalk and explain that when a public sidewalk is used to satisfy a requirement for an accessible route, the public sidewalk must comply with ADAAG 4.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definitions of marked crossing and walk included in the NPRM have been deleted, as they are defined in ADAAG 3.5 (Definitions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM defined a sidewalk as ``[a] walk in the public right-of-way along a vehicular way that is part of a pedestrian circulation network.'' The City of Portland (OR) urged that the definition include walks in public rights-of-way or easements that may not be contiguous with vehicular ways, noting that they are subject to similar constraints of terrain, width, and adjacent development. Commenters from design and engineering disciplines stated that both paving and separation were integral to the concept of a sidewalk in transportation and public works specifications. One commenter encouraged use of a definition of sidewalk commonly recognized by streets and highway authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

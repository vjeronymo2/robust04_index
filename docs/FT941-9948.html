			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metal group offshoot allays fears Buderus, the German building material and heating technology company 80 per cent-owned by the troubled Metallgesellschaft group, said yesterday the near-collapse of the parent company had not affected its own activities. Mr Hans-Ulrich Plaul, chief executive, said yesterday the parent's crisis had not changed how customers and suppliers sought to do business. Buderus had no 'contractual ties' with the parent company, Mr Plaul said, reiterating comments made a month ago as Metallgesellschaft's problems came to a head. Buderus, acquired by Metallgesellschaft as part of its purchase of the non-paper activities of Feldmuhle Nobel in 1991, is commonly regarded as a jewel in Metallgesellschaft's crown. It announced yesterday profits for the three months to December of DM41m (Dollars 24.1m), up from DM30m in the comparable period.</p>

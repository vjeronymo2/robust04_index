			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> HONIG TO SEEK TAX HIKE ON 'SUPER RICH'  </P> <P> State schools Supt. Bill Honig has announced plans to seek a 1992 ballot  initiative to raise the taxes of the "super rich" unless the governor and  Legislature act first on the proposal.  </P> <P> "We should raise (state) taxes by 5% on the top 1% of families in this state,"  Honig said Thursday as he introduced the idea at a California Taxpayers' Assn.  meeting. Honig said the 5% increase would affect families making more than  $208,560 a year who pay less in combined federal and state taxes than those who  earn $70,000 or more. Honig said his proposal would raise $2 billion a year to  finance California's future education, transportation and health care needs. If  he follows through with his plan, Honig probably would have to seek a ballot  initiative, given Gov. George Deukmejian's steadfast opposition to tax  increases.  </P></p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wellington launch postponed The planned launch of Wellington Underwriting as a listed company investing in Lloyd's of London has been postponed following the insurance market's failure to agree new rules on corporate capital, writes Ralph Atkins. The company said it was now proposing an impact day in the middle of next week instead of today. Wellington had intended to place 30m shares at 100p and use the capital to invest in seven Lloyd's syndicates run by the Wellington managing agency. It hoped to attract money from existing corporate investors at Lloyd's, but this depended on Lloyd's approving new rules on corporate vehicles investing in each other. Wellington has decided to go ahead without the new rules.</p>

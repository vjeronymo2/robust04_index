			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1614 GMT on 10 January presents a program on Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR)  entitled "There Actually Is Such a Party" hosted by Sergey  Torchinskiy. His studio guests are Zafar Maksudovich Fatkudinov,  Academician at the Academy of Economy, Finances and Law, doctor  of juridical sciences and a writer and Andrey Fedorovich  Zavidiya, Chairman of the Galant company.    Asked to explain why he wanted to take part in the program,  Zavidiya says: "Well, to be brief, there is currently too much  noise around the LDPR's sensational victory at the parliamentary  elections. As the main organizer of these victories, I bear my  share of the responsibility for all the statements which  Vladimir Volfovich subsequently made and that is why I am here:  to debunk a myth, dispel some rumors and conjectures."    Zafar Fatkudinov explains that no single party was as  skilled  as the LDPR in capitalizing on people's fears, emotions and gut  feelings, hence its electoral victory.    Andrey Zavidiya then says, "The point is that the LDPR's  program and its rules are completely out of sync with Vladimir  Volfovich statements." Zavidiya shows the viewers  Zhirinovskiy's "The Last Push South" and the party's program,  entitled "The Liberal- Democratic Party of the Soviet Union --  Documents and Materials" and says that the party's program "is a  fine program. I recall that when I paid for it, it was 26,000  -- the Zavidiya firm paid for the LDPR's program in 1991. Let  me just remind you that I was, I am, and will remain a rank and  file communist and that it is possible and desirable to  cooperate, if not with everyone, then with the majority. I have  practically no objections to this program and that is why I lent  my support to the leader of the party whose program we intended  to implement together. In particular, during the 1991  presidential elections we came third with him, in tandem with  him and this was sensational. But the LDPR's program certainly  fails to tally with Vladimir Volfovich current statements and  that is why it is actually necessary to shed some light on this  issue.    "That is to say that the program does not plan any pushes  south, or any other direction, north, west or east. But in his  book he does plan such pushes, going so far as to state that it  would be no tragedy at all for a country like Turkey to vanish  from the face of the Earth. These statements are very poor  tactics, of course, and I am aware of my own personal guilt in  the sense that this man has practically come to power and I am  the main agent to have facilitated this and that is why I would  like to take this opportunity to say that I am duty bound to  apologize to the peoples and countries visited by Vladimir  Volfovich where he was rude to their peoples and leaders".    Fatkudinov explains that the retaking of the Baltic states  or  the area of Alaska, as advocated by Zhirinovskiy, would entail  rivers of blood, as was already once the case with Finland in  1940. Zhirinovskiy's adventures might lead to a nuclear  holocaust, says Fatkudinov. People in the post-imperial Russia  are very sensitive to the perceived suffering of their fellow  countrymen elsewhere, but these issues are to be resolved by  diplomacy and not tanks. No one has yet been able to recreate  their own former empire and the way forward is to try and find  room for refugees as was done successfully in Germany after the  Second World War, says Fatkudinov, stressing that this is the  only way to avoid bloodshed. Torchinskiy regrets that this was  not spelled out during the election campaign and Fatkudinov  agrees. The government must facilitate this expected influx of  refugees and Zhirinovskiy's statements merely exacerbate the  position of the Russophone population outside Russia.    Asked by Torchinskiy about the LDPR's economic program,  Zavidiya replies that it owes a great deal to former Prime  Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, a personal friend. Torchinskiy jokes  about Zavidiya's self-proclaimed communist views and his  position as Chairman of the Galant company which has 1,500  enterprises. Zavidiya goes on to say that the Galant company  set up 3,500 organizing committees throughout the country and  that they voted for him, rather than Zhirinovskiy who allegedly  relegated his party list place from    Zavidiya says that his was "a decisive" contribution to the  victory. "The point is -- and we have had conversations with  him on this -- that generally speaking he senses that I am a  more serious rival than he is himself at the future presidential  elections in 1996."    Returning to the party's economic program, Zavidiya says  that  it revolves round the principle of mixed economy and the  development of all forms of ownership. Fatkudinov derides  Zhirinovskiy's reckless promises to improve the lot of all and  sundry immediately. He finds particularly objectionable  Zhirinovskiy's notions of fighting crime: Execute them on the  spot. We've been there once, recalls Fatkudinov. Zavidiya adds  that many people expected Zhirinovskiy to step down from his  party chairmanship following the victory and to concentrate on  being a deputy in the Duma. Torchinskiy then goes on to ask:  "Many materials appear in the press to the effect that the  appearance of the LDPR was provoked by the CPSU, the then CPSU  leadership, of course and by the KGB."    Zavidiya replies: "I categorically disagree with this, for  the simple reason that I first made my acquaintance with  Vladimir Volfovich during the events marking the anniversary of  the October Revolution on 6 November 1990. It was also there  that I met Boris Nikolayevich. I personally gave my visiting  card to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and to Vladimir Volfovich  Zhirinovskiy, during the celebrations of the October Revolution  anniversary in the Kremlin. Boris Nikolayevich did not  telephone me, but Vladimir Volfovich did. We met and began to  cooperate. The first thing he said was: Andrey Fedorovich, how  can the program, already being printed, be paid for? I said it  would have to be looked at. I mean he gave me, he showed me  their program, I saw that it was a normal program pure and  simple and paid for it -- 26,000 rubles all in all, I paid for  the whole program. I also paid 10,000 for his posters -- 10,000  for his posters and not a single kopeck more was handed over  personally or otherwise. As for the election campaign in  Russian, I paid for my travels with my own money."    Asked about other sources of financing, Zavidiya says: "I  simply have no such information, but since he turned to me for  such a trifle as 26,000 and 10,000 -- well, I do not know, if  there were other sources of financing, surely he would not have  turned to me for such trifles, but this is just what I think."    Asked about who defrayed Zhirinovskiy electoral expenses,  Zavidiya says it was not his concern, for his organization  worked for and voted for him and assured him that they did not  share Zhirinovskiy's views. Fatkudinov concludes his  contribution to the program by quoting the Criminal Code which  makes propaganda of war a crime punishable by imprisonment of  between three and eight years. Zavidiya doubts that many people  share such extreme views. The task of electoral victory was  accomplished, but between 50 to 60 percent of those who voted  are his supporters, now leaving the party, says Zavidiya: "The  LDPR bloc will collapse in the nearest future, you will see  that". Asked for his forecast for the future, Zavidiya says  that Zhirinovskiy will desperately push for presidential  elections in 1994 -- his last chance. He hopes there will be no  such elections. Asked whether he would take part in a live TV  debate with Zhirinovskiy, Zavidiya says he would be delighted to  do so, it would be his wildest dreams come true, and that he is  ready for this at any time.</p>

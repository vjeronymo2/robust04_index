			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 5 (ATA) -- Serbian military forces and  vehicles are being concentrated in the Dubovc village of  Vushtrise in Kosova. They are expected to engage in a series of  military exercises which, according to Serbian military  officials, will continue until May 16 and also extend to the  villages of Galice and Mikushnice, according to reports from  Prishtina.    The Serbian military command has ordered the stopping of the  movement of the population between May 9-11 in the said villages  because of the use of firing arms by the forces during their  training.

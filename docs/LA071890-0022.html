			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOO TOUGH FOR MERE MORTALS?;  </P> <P> NEW SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT WILL NEED A BETTER-BEHAVED BOARD  </P> <P> There is a paradox in the announcement that the talented William Anton is to  become superintendent of the L.A. Unified School District. The paradox is that  this might just be a job at which no good man or woman can succeed.  </P> <P> Anton has risen from classroom teacher to become superintendent at a time when  parents and other observers question if any educator can turn the beleaguered  district around.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles public schools -- under-financed and overcrowded -- are  micromanaged by an overly political school board that had lost confidence in  Supt. Leonard Britton, who has resigned.  </P> <P> If the job was tough when Britton took the helm three years ago, it is even  tougher now. Anton inherits a budget pockmarked by massive cuts, a contentious  board, a wary union and low staff morale.  </P> <P> He has worked in the past with legislators and hopes to reassure Sacramento  that every dollar sent to the district will be money well-spent. Part of that  task will include addressing the widely held perception that the district is  top-heavy with expensive administrators.  </P> <P> Parents are losing confidence in the public schools. Many send their children  elsewhere. That exodus is expected to increase as the district puts all schools  on a year-round calendar -- despite the lack of promised air conditioning -- to  make room for newcomers. Anton's instincts are pragmatic; he says delivering on  that long overdue air conditioning is a top priority. But he also must think  bigger. More than ever, this district needs a leader -- someone not afraid to  step on some toes if he needs to. Anton already has demonstrated his ability to  work with others. But sometimes he'll have to cajole, twist arms and anger some  board members and other big shots in order to be a champion for the children of  the nation's second largest school district.  </P> <P> More than 610,000 students attend the district's schools. Nearly 61% are  Latino; as many as one-third speak little or no English, but there is a  shortage of bilingual teachers. Anton, a Latino, is expected to be sensitive to  those challenges and to address ethnic rivalries among students.  </P> <P> Because he has spent 38 years in the district, Anton has credibility with  teachers, administrators and the board. He has reached out to the union chief,  who is also new to that job. So Anton says the right things. He wants to make  every school work. He wants every child to learn. That will require bold  action.  </P> <P> How much maneuvering room will the seven-member board leave him? Right now the  board is full of praise, all but canonizing him. But what happens when the  political honeymoon with Saint Anton ends, as all honeymoons do? Will it be  back to micromanagement as usual? And therefore back to the paradox of the  prescription for superintendent failure?  </P></p>

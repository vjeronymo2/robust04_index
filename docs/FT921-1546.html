			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Leading Article: County Hall JAPANESE investment has been one of the most positive forces in the UK economy for two decades. It has probably saved the British car industry. That said, the government's decision to permit the sale of County Hall to the Shirayama Corporation, for use as a hotel and leisure centre, is deeply to be regretted. County Hall, former home of the Greater London Council, is not London's finest building, although it stands on a magnificent site opposite parliament. The London School of Economics would like to move there from cramped premises on the other side of the river. Such a move would express confidence in a British institution of world renown. It would also secure the building for a prime civic purpose at the end of a construction boom which has erected some fine towers and atriums to Mammon, but few to Academe. For the government to let the building become a hotel for the sake of a few million pounds difference in the bids reveals a blind spot one would not have thought typical of Mr Major's public spirited style of Conservatism. If it wins, Labour says it will reverse the decision. It would be right do so. Better still, Mr Major should think again.</p>

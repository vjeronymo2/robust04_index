			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLE'S LATINO APPEAL  </P> <P> Thank you to Quincy Jones for his Feb. 11 remembrance of Nat King Cole on the  25th anniversary of his untimely death.  </P> <P> Perhaps because of lack of space, while mentioning Cole's successful tours he  missed the ones to Mexico, South America and Cuba, where he was extremely  popular. He recorded in Spanish and Portuguese many still-popular favorites. "A  mis Amigos" (To My Friends), "Cole Espanol" and "More Cole Espanol" are still  best sellers.  </P> <P> He sang at the opening of Rio's opera house. Wherever he sang the crowds went  wild. He was the best ambassador the U.S.A. ever had in Latin America. His  style, in any language, had a universal appeal.  </P> <P> JOSE MANUEL CUETO, MD  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

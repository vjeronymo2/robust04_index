			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL VOTE PROMPTS RENEWED EFFORT TO BREAK UP DISTRICT  </P> <P> San Fernando Valley parents angry over the school board's decision to operate  schools year-round said Tuesday they will support efforts by state  Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge) to break up the Los Angeles  school district, and others said they will try to overturn the year-round  decision.  </P> <P> "We're looking at it so the community can have more local control over their  children's education," said Judy Diamond, a parent at Dearborn Avenue School in  Northridge. "I'm planning on volunteering to help."  </P> <P> La Follette aide Rob Wilcox said the assemblywoman in the past two weeks has  collected the names and phone numbers of hundreds of Valley and Westside  parents who have expressed an interest in the idea of breaking up the  700-square-mile, 610,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District into eight  or more smaller districts.  </P> <P> "Year-round might be the straw that broke the camel's back," Wilcox said.  "Parents and educators we've talked to are outraged about it."  </P> <P> The school board Monday voted to convert all schools in the district to some  form of year-round schedule by summer, 1991. On a motion offered by West Valley  board member Julie Korenstein, the board stopped short of requiring 109  elementary schools -- including 45 in the Valley -- to change their schedules  starting this summer.  </P> <P> The board required those 109 schools, however, to increase their capacity 23%  beginning this summer by scheduling classes year-round, adding portable  classrooms or increasing class size.  </P> <P> Sylmar Elementary School Principal Yvonne Chan said Korenstein's motion to  delay mandatory implementation of year-round schedules will only help the  least-crowded Valley schools. At Valley schools already filled to capacity,  such as Sylmar, there is no more playground space to put portable classrooms.  </P> <P> Those schools will have to pick between year-round scheduling and larger class  sizes, "which nobody wants, so you are back to year-round," Chan said.  </P> <P> Barbara Romey, twice a candidate for the board and a longtime opponent of  year-round schools, said the year's delay "gives people time to go shopping for  private schools" and "to break up the school district."  </P> <P> Romey predicted that anger over the year-round issue will breathe new life into  efforts by La Follette, who has failed in several attempts to interest the  Legislature in dividing the Los Angeles district.  </P> <P> This time, instead of trying to force the issue through the Legislature, La  Follette is hoping that the state Board of Education and the Los Angeles County  Committee on School District Organization will draft a plan to put before the  1.5 million registered voters who live within the boundaries of the Los Angeles  school district. The committee has seven members, elected by the county's  school districts.  </P> <P> La Follette last fall sponsored a series of public hearings before a commission  she created to look into breaking up the district. The commission's  recommendations, expected next month, will go to the state Board of Education,  which can recommend that the county committee come up with a redistricting  plan.  </P> <P> In a separate effort, Noel W. Weiss, a Northridge parent and attorney, said  Tuesday he will begin a signature drive to collect the approximately 375,000  signatures needed to put the school board's year-round decision before voters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weiss said he and other parents will begin a drive this week to collect the  signatures of 25% of the registered voters living in the Los Angeles school  district, the percentage required for a vote on the issue. The state Education  Code allows for voters living in a school district to overturn a board decision  to operate schools year-round.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that we in the Valley and the Westside are not going to  allow" year-round schools, Weiss said. A vote overturning the board decision  will force decision makers to find other ways of accommodating students in the  burgeoning district, he said.  </P> <P> Not everyone was angry over some of the other changes -- all aimed at coping  with overcrowding -- that will go along with the year-round plan.  </P> <P> Gary Turner, principal of Verdugo Hills High School in Tujunga, said he and  parents in the area are delighted at the school board's decision to allow  neighborhood ninth-grade students to attend the school, beginning this fall.  </P> <P> The change will relieve crowding at Tujunga Elementary Schools because it will  also allow for sixth-graders to be moved to Mt. Gleason Junior High School,  which will in turn transfer its ninth-grade classes to Verdugo Hills.  </P> <P> "The PTA, Booster Club -- everybody has been pushing for this for five years,"  Turner said.  </P> <P> The change will increase enrollment at the school from about 1,800 to close to  its capacity of 2,500, Turner said. The 500 to 700 local ninth-grade students  expected to attend Verdugo Hills next year will join approximately 300  ninth-graders who are now bused to the high school from other parts of the  city.  </P> <P> "We'll continue to pick up the bused-in kids and mix them in with our own  kids," Turner said.  </P> <P> Verdugo Hills High School will become the seventh high school in the Valley to  enroll ninth- through 12th-grade students.  </P> <P> Parent Jeanette Fawcett, a parent and member of the high school's school  council, said she was happy about the decision, even though the board included  it along with measures to eventually convert the school to a year-round  schedule.  </P> <P> "It doesn't bother me, I have to work here year-round anyway," said Fawcett,  who works as a school clerk.  </P></p>

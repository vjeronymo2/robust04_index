The spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, termed the statement issued  by the recent Damascus meeting on the Iranian islands as  repetition of the "baseless claims by the UAE over the islands".    Foreign minister of the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council,  (P)GCC, and their counterparts from Egypt and Syria concluded a  two-day meeting in Damascus, Syria, on January 10 without  reaching any result.    "We pay attention to that part of the statement of the  Damascus meeting which mentions friendly neighborhood and  elimination of disputes through peaceful talks and declare our  readiness to continue talks and receive officials from the UAE,"  said Mohammadi.    "However," he added, "it is the UAE which has not responded  positively to Iran's readiness to continue bilateral talks."  He deplored that the UAE Government on the one hand emphasizes  on mutual talks to settle misunderstandings between the two  countries but on the other hand does not take any practical step  in this connection.    It should be noted that Iran has repeatedly welcomed the  visit to Tehran of the UAE officials to hold talk on the  settlement of misunderstandings between the two countries  without any prejudgements.    However, the UAE officials have not yet responded to the  good-will shown by Iran which is of importance for the  strengthening of the friendly neighborhood and stability in the  region.</p>

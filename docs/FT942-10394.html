			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Japan boost for foreign cars Imported cars captured a record 8.4 per cent share of the Japanese new car market in April according to figures released yesterday by the Japan Automobile Importers' Association Sales of imported cars rose last month by 35.1 per cent year-on-year to 21,856 in sharp contrast to the continuing decline in the overall Japanese new car market, where total car sales fell by 6.1 per cent to 259,249. The volume of imported cars is being increased significantly by rising imports to Japan from Japanese vehicle makers' overseas plants. Total imports of Japanese-badged cars jumped by 61.5 per cent to 5,459 from 3,381 a year ago. Overall new car sales in Japan have fallen for three years in succession from 5.1m in 1990 to 4.2m last year, and total new vehicle sales declined by a further 5.8 per cent year-on-year in the first four months this year. By contrast sales of imported vehicles in the first four months jumped by 37.6 per cent year-on-year to 86,662, including a 28 per cent increase in sales of imported cars to 78,825 cars. In the whole of last year imported cars accounted for 4.6 per cent of the total Japanese new car market.</p>

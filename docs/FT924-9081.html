			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / CBI postpones 'putting the boot in': Michael Cassell says business wants action from the government THE Confederation of British Industry assembles tomorrow in Harrogate, sagging under the weight of recession, but with high expectations that the government is about to put the flesh on the bones of its strategy for growth. Last November, delegates attending the CBI annual conference in Bournemouth complained about 'two lost years' in the struggle for economic progress. A year later their allegiances and patience are stretched to breaking point. Industry's despair over an ailing economy cussedly refusing to revive has been heightened by the damaging uncertainty of recent political drift. As a string of cabinet ministers take their turn on the CBI platform, and with the Autumn Statement only days away, they will be left in no doubt that business leaders are not interested in hearing more political platitudes. Mr Howard Davies, who will be addressing his first CBI conference as director-general, says: 'We have told the prime minister and the chancellor that we are not yet in a slump, but that we soon could be. We have reached a critical point. 'Perhaps now is not the time to put the boot in, but we have to make clear we expect immediate action. For them to do nothing is not an option. It would be inconceivable.' The CBI will use the conference to announce its plan for reviving the manufacturing sector, the outline of which was put to the prime minister last week. Beside specific recommendations for action, it sets out the ground rules for a new partnership with government which the CBI believes ministers have already started to embrace. The CBI wants to see some evidence of the new approach from ministers arriving in Harrogate. In particular, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will find himself on the spot. Business has watched him engage in what Mr Davies calls a 'pretty half-hearted' attempt to make his department a more effective conduit between government and industry - but the CBI expects much more. 'So far we have got a draft prospectus for a programme of one-stop advice shops,' says Mr Davies. 'But has he won any important battles yet?' A conference announcement of a substantive policy change would, he says, help provide the answer. The CBI is particularly anxious to pin down Mr Heseltine on the question of his expressed intention to 'intervene before breakfast' and wants a precise definition of what the minister means. 'We do not want interference all over the shop,' Mr Davies stresses. 'We want a working partnership and a proper dialogue.' He is encouraged, if sceptical, about the commitment from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to examine all policy proposals in the light of their impact on industry. 'We hope the Treasury understands what he said,' says Mr Davies. 'It means they ought to be ready to discuss public expenditure priorities and the balance of taxation strategy with industry. 'We are not suggesting the CBI should take over the Treasury, but we need the chance to go back to first principles. Traditionally, there has been no discussion with industry; we simply do not meet. 'In the early stages of the latest public expenditure round the Treasury did its usual number. 'Infrastructure? - forget it] Training budget - watch out]' That attitude must change and we intend to shamelessly exploit the chancellor's pledge.' Industry believes the Autumn Statement offers the government a last golden opportunity. Apart from a shift from current to capital spending, a clampdown on public sector pay and a linked cut of 2 percentage points in interest rates, it also sees the case for a supplementary package of proposals to stimulate the economy further. Expectations at Westminster are that something may be on the cards. 'The government has to cut through the cliches about the need for confidence. It needs a high-profile, dramatic announcement which proves its change of approach,' Mr Davies says. Evidence of a change of heart, says Mr Davies, might soon include lower electricity prices for large users, improved Exports Credit Guarantee cover and some 'sympathy' on investment allowances. Tax cuts, he says, should be off the agenda. He also favours a specific initiative aimed at stimulating the housing market, possibly involving cash for housing associations to buy repossessed homes. Lower interest rates alone, he says, will not revive a market in which buyers believe asset values will continue to fall.</p>

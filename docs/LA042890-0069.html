			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS CONFRONT MONGOLIA TROOPS  </P> <P> Thousands of opposition party demonstrators confronted troops and police in the  Mongolian capital Friday, defying a government decree making such rallies  illegal, witnesses said.  </P> <P> It was the first time the Communist authorities had called in the army since  Mongolia's democracy movement sprang to life last December.  </P> <P> No force was used, however, and the two-hour rally was peaceful.  </P> <P> At least 10,000 people and 1,200 unarmed soldiers and police faced each other  at noon in Sukhbator Square in the center of Ulan Bator, a Western diplomat  said. Other witnesses estimated there were 20,000 to 30,000 people in the  square during the rally.  </P> <P> Police loudspeakers blared orders to leave the square, but demonstrators sang a  popular protest song, "Honkh Nido" (Sound of the Bell), to drown them out.  </P> <P> The pro-democracy rally was one of the biggest in Mongolia, although organizers  had hoped that 60,000 people would turn out, one diplomat said.  </P> <P> At one point, President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat emerged from the imposing  building which houses Mongolia's Parliament to take a look at the rally, a  witness said.  </P> <P> Diplomats said it was the first big test of the new Communist Party leadership,  installed in March in response to opposition demands.  </P> <P> Mongolia, long dominated by the Soviet Union since becoming the world's second  Communist state in the 1920s, has introduced democratic reforms rapidly and  peacefully.  </P> <P> Friday's rally followed abortive talks Thursday between Ochirbat, who was  appointed last month, and the opposition Mongolian Democratic Assn.  </P> <P> The MDA demanded that Ochirbat establish a "temporary people's parliament" and  an extraordinary commission representing all political parties before national  elections are held.  </P> <P> Ochirbat has pledged free elections in late July.  </P></p>

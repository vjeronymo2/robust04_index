			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAN KILLS HIS WIFE'S STEPBROTHER TRYING TO BREAK INTO THEIR HOME  </P> <P> A South County homeowner shot and killed his wife's stepbrother early this  morning while the man reportedly was attempting to break into the family's  Torino Street home, despite a court order to stay away from the family.  </P> <P> Alfred LeBrun, 25, was killed almost instantly by a single shotgun shot in his  chest, fired point-blank by Jeffrey S. Alix, 33, who was awakened in the middle  of the night by what he told police sounded like a prowler.  </P> <P> "I feel numb," Jeffrey Alix said today as stood in the living room of his  one-story, single-family home at the end of a cul-de-sac. "I can't believe it  happened."  </P> <P> The 1:58 a.m. shooting occurred when Alix, who had just gone to bed shortly  after returning from work, heard the front door rattling, Sheriff's Department  spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> "(Alix) goes out in the front room, and at that point, he hears a gate at the  side of the house being opened," Olson said.  </P> <P> Alix then grabbed his 12-gauge shotgun and walked out of the house. As he  passed through the gate and into the darkened back yard of his home, Olson  said, he saw a silhouette of a man he said was trying to break through the  glass door.  </P> <P> Alix screamed, Olson said, and when the unidentified man turned and apparently  lunged at him, Alix fired once.  </P> <P> Alix's wife, Lynn, 31, came running outside, and when she flipped on a light  switch, the couple discovered that the shooting victim was her stepbrother.  </P> <P> LeBrun, described in court documents and neighbors as extremely violent, had  been under a restraining order to stay away from the couple, their two children  and Lynn Alix's father, Charles Audet.  </P></p>

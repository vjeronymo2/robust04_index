			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Calor advances 16% to Pounds 45m THE COLD winter of 1990 was good news for Calor Group, the bottled gas company, which yesterday unveiled a near-16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 45m for 1991. The result, was struck after exceptional reorganisation costs of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 6.5m). Turnover was 10 per cent higher at Pounds 362.2m. The increase in sales was partly due to higher gas prices during the year. Mr Hamish Macpherson, group treasurer, warned that the milder conditions of this winter did not bode well for the group. 'From the weather point of view we are more pessimistic than last year.' A proposed maintained final dividend of 6p makes an unchanged 12p total. Calor had indicated at the interim stage that it planned to build up retained earnings for investment purposes. Earnings per share rose from 15.5p to 18.1p. During the year, margins came under pressure as Calor cut prices to maintain its market position. Mr Macpherson said that margins continued to decline, especially given the milder winter this year. The cold weather early last year had given a 'leg up' to bottled gas, which has been in long-term decline for several years. Gas tonnage overall had increased by 5 per cent. Forays into central Europe, through the Pam Gas project in conjunction with SHV, Calor's 44 per cent shareholder, had had a 'reasonable' start, Mr Macpherson said. The restructuring programme continued, with 200 jobs cut already in the current year. The final stage was due for completion in 1992, and would result in a 'considerable' exceptional cost. Strong cash flow had helped to cut debt by Pounds 20m to Pounds 20.1m, with gearing of 11 per cent.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Yeltsin reforms find regional support A KEY Russian conservative leader yesterday admitted that most regional leaders supported President Boris Yeltsin's constitutional reforms. Mr Nikolay Ryabov, deputy to parliamentary chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, said that if deputies rejected Mr Yeltsin's plan for a constitutional assembly, they would push society to confrontation. His change of tack has given the president a substantial boost in his efforts to introduce a constitution designed to bolster his powers. 'The situation in the country has changed. All the heads of the administration and half of the leaders of the local councils will go to the Kremlin (that is, take part in a proposed constitutional assembly). If we step aside from participation this assembly will turn into a constituent assembly and adopt a constitution. We must put this under our control at least in part.' The president got support from an even more surprising quarter - Mr Sergei Baburin, a leader of the hard-line nationalists Russian Unity bloc - though he said that the final decision on the constitution should be taken by the Congress of Peoples Deputies, the full assembly of the present parliament. In bowing to the increasingly obvious fact of Mr Yeltsin's greater influence and power over the regional leaders, the parliamentary leaders have reserved their right - set out under the present constitution - to act as the final body which can confirm the constitution. This means that Mr Yeltsin has at least convinced some of his opponents that they must fight on ground of his choosing. This tactical shift by two strong opponents of Mr Yeltsin came at the same time as the parliament voted to ask the Constitutional Court to rule on the legality of Mr Yeltsin's attempt to bypass the parliament by calling the constitutional convention composed of representatives of the republics.</p>

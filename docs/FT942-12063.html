			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Cambodia peace talks put off as fighting flares Cambodian peace talks scheduled to begin yesterday between Khmer Rouge guerrillas and the Phnom Penh government have been postponed indefinitely amid some of the most serious fighting in the country for five years. King Norodom Sihanouk offered to host the negotiations at his royal palace, but the continuing warfare in northern and western Cambodia together with complaints from Khmer Rouge leaders that their safety could not be guaranteed in Phnom Penh meant the talks had to be called off. 'We must put an end to this war but no-one listens to me,' a downcast King Sihanouk told Cambodian journalists. 'The round table cannot take place for the time being because there is a very serious difference between Phnom Penh and the Khmer Rouge.' Khmer Rouge guerrillas recently recaptured their headquarters at the gem-mining town of Pailin near the Thai border and their northern stronghold at Anlong Veng, and are intensifying their attacks on government-held areas. A Buddhist monk and a nun were killed in the north-west on Saturday by the Khmer Rouge, while taking part in a 'peace march' in the company of government soldiers; six men working for a Cambodian mine-clearing project are believed to have been killed in an ambush; and fighting has closed the main road linking to Thailand to Cambodia to all but military traffic and forced the evacuation of UN staff from Sisophon. In the south, four westerners are being held by the Khmer Rouge as part of what seems to be a new tactic of hostage-taking, and embassies have urged their nationals to take care while travelling. Tens of thousands of Cambodians have fled the fighting, either to other parts of the country or to Thailand. The Cambodian government is now considering legislation to outlaw the Khmer Rouge. A year ago this month, Cambodians went to the polls at the culmination of a Dollars 2bn UN peacekeeping operation. The outcome of the election was a coalition government bringing together the royalist Funcinpec party and the previous communist administration, but the Khmer Rouge refused to take part or to relinquish territory. The guerrillas, although weakened by popular support for the UN-sponsored peace process, bided their time until the departure of most of the peacekeepers. According to Prince Ranariddh, senior prime minister and Funcinpec leader, the government's policy is to keep the door open for talks with the Khmer Rouge while weakening the guerrillas militarily. At present, however, it is the government army which is on the defensive.</p>

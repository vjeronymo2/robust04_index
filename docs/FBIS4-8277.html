			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Questions of economic  integration and European security were the main topics discussed  by visiting members of the Finnish Parliament's Foreign Affairs  Committee and their Czech colleagues at their meeting today,  Pertti Paasio, chairman of the Finnish Parliament's Foreign  Committee, told CTK after the talks.    Paasio said that the Czech Republic, given its interest in  joining NATO, had a somewhat different idea about its security  than Finland, which did not see participation in a military  grouping as its way to security. "The roles of our countries in  the Partnership for Peace project are therefore somewhat  different but the two countries will be complementing each  other," he said.    Paasio said that within the Partnership Finland was sharing  its experiences with United Nations peace-keeping operations but  did not intend to participate in joint military exercises of the  countries which participate in the project.    Paasio mentioned similar efforts of Finland and the Czech  Republic at approaching the European Union (EU) and achieving  full membership of European economic structures in the long run.  He voiced the hope that trade between Finland and the Czech  Republic would be more extended in the future that it has been  before.</p>

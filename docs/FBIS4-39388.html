			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By Correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] If the process of settlement in Trans-Dniestria  develops favorably, the need to keep Russia's 14th Army there  will disappear, a member of the Russian delegation to the talks  with Moldova told INTERFAX on Tuesday [7 June].    According to the diplomat, participants in the ninth round  of  talks between Russia and Moldova, which opened in Moscow on  Tuesday, will focus on issues connected with the status of  Russia's 14th Army and the time of its withdrawal.    The Russian delegation is led by the Ambassador at Large  Vladimir Kitayev, and the Moldovan by the First Deputy Foreign  Minister, Nicolae Osmokescu.    A document on the legal status of the 14th Army may be  drafted during the present round of talks, the diplomat said.  "If events in Trans-Dniestria develop favorably, only purely  technical problems connected with troops withdrawal will remain  to be resolved. It's true, though, that such a process may take  a long time," he said.    During the previous round of talks, INTERFAX's interviewee  said, the Russian side submitted a number of proposals aimed at  fixing "technically possible times" for the Army's withdrawal.  "We cannot take our servicemen to the open spaces. Three to  four years are required to organize the withdrawal of personnel,  military equipment, ammunition, etc. Properly. As far as we  can judge, Kishinev agrees with this on the whole," he said.    The diplomat drew Interfax's attention to another "extremely  important aspect." "On 15 May 1993 in Moscow President Boris  Yeltsin and his Moldovan counterpart, Mircea Snegur, signed a  joint communique on the need to synchronize the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Moldova with the process of peaceful  settlement in Trans-Dniestria," he said.    "Lately bilateral contacts on this issue became more  productive. Besides, a dialogue between Kishinev and Tiraspol is  gradually taking shape," he said. "It's indicative that the  Moldovan leadership has postponed the implementation of the bill  on official language, which served as a detonator of the  conflict, and rejected the idea of joining Romania."    The diplomat drew attention to the circumstance that some  Moldovan politicians began to speak in favor of giving up the  principle of synchronization. "It's quite possible that this  issue will be raised at the present round of talks," he noted.    Under the communique of 15 May 1993 Moldova is not in a  position to abandon the principle of synchronization  unilaterally. "We believe that such an approach is premature to  say the least," he concluded.</p>

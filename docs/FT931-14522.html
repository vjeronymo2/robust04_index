			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Observer: Switched on Eyebrows will surely be raised by Lord Hanson's giving one of his top executives 20 months off to help Board of Trade president Michael Heseltine to interfere in British industry, under the guise of a secondment to the mechanical engineering 'sponsorship division'. After all, Hanson was one of the fiercest critics of Hezza for precipitating the downfall of the noble lord's heroine, Lady Thatcher, and has always been regarded as on the laissez-faire wing of big business. The less government interference the better, would seem to be his motto. Is Britain's best-known predator turning a little pink? Or could it be that the long-serving Ian Stewart, now 53, has been at a loose end since the particular company he headed, British Ever Ready, was sold to a US pet food firm last April? It's hard to imagine Hanson operatives such as Tony Alexander or Tony Cotton being given such a long leave of absence.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PAY INCREASE, HONORARIUMS PLAN EXPECTED  </P> <P> A bipartisan House task force has decided to recommend a substantial pay  increase for Congress, coupled with a phasing out of honorariums, and will  present the tentative plan to Democratic and Republican leaders later this  week, informed sources said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The pay plan, which would contain a provision for cost-of-living raises in the  years ahead, would be coupled with a tightening of some House rules on  financial disclosure, gifts and travel, and reductions in the amounts of  outside earned income that members may accept.  </P> <P> Most of the recommendations will amount to adjustments, rather than wholesale  changes, in House policies that have drawn fire from critics, but the task  force is expected to recommend basic and perhaps far-reaching changes in the  House Ethics Committee. It would split that committee into two panels, one that  would function as a grand jury to bring charges and the other to judge the  charges.  </P> <P> Any final plan would be up to House leaders of both parties, who are described  as pessimistic that any pay-raise plan can be sold to the public.  </P> <P> The task force was formed earlier this year after a presidential panel  recommended a 51% pay increase for the House and Senate. Groups around the  country, led by radio talk programs, many newspapers and consumer advocate  Ralph Nader, protested and forced defeat of that proposal.  </P> <P> The task force is not expected to recommend a raise as high as 51%. Sources  said its recommendation will be more complicated, effective over a greater time  and probably less than 30%.  </P></p>

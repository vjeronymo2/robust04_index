			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Planning a decade without power: Loosening links with Labour A DELEGATE returning to this year's Trades Union Congress after an absence of 10 years would have found much unchanged. There were composite motions combining contradictory views and an arcane internal dispute - over the readmission of the EETPU electricians' union - which was incomprehensible to most outsiders, but was almost the only matter to excite the delegates all week. But beneath the surface, radical steps were being taken to reposition British trade unionism for another decade without political influence. Most union leaders accept that they will carry influence in industry or politics only if they effectively represent the varied, sometimes contradictory, interests of their members. That means a looser link with the Labour party, a slimmed-down TUC bureaucracy and a new relationship with employers, symbolised in the highpoint of the week - the address to Congress by Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, Plenty of wise things were said in the debate on slimming and refocusing the TUC bureaucracy, and it was agreed to reduce the TUC's priority areas from 17 to six. The political will to stop the TUC spreading itself too thin is not yet there, though, and Congress once again committed the bureaucracy to innumerable fresh campaigns. A new leader at Congress House, the TUC headquarters in London, might provide the impetus genuine refocusing requires. Mr Norman Willis, the TUC general secretary, bounced back from pre-Congress speculation about his future and had, by his standards, a reasonable week. But he is almost certain to go within the next year. During that period, the unions' ties with the Labour Party will be re-ordered. There was no TUC debate on the subject but there was a vivid illustration of why some want to abolish the link when Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, led calls for the devaluation of sterling. Either the union leaders will change Labour's policy, undermining the party's claim to speak for the country as a whole, or they will create a row between the the two 'wings' of the labour movement. Most union leaders recognise the constraints the Labour link imposes on their political lobbying and are keen to become more broad-based. But few can contemplate an end to direct influence in the party. There is no reform model leading the debate. The idea of converting the 5m political levy payers in the unions, most of whom are unaware that they even pay the levy, into 'associate members' of the party, is widely considered too complex and a recipe for bankrupting the party. The best guess is that the union vote at the Labour conference, the central element of the link, will continue to decline to 50 per cent or less and votes will not be cast in blocks. If there is ever another Labour government, much will have changed. It will have looser links with organised labour and much else will have changed from 1979 - the last time Labour held office.</p>

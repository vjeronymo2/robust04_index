			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: Pension funds need an effective whistle-blower Sir, I am surprised that no mention is made in the article, 'Simple duties of trustees' (January 11), of the responsibility of pension fund trustees to appoint auditors to audit the financial accounts and review internal control in their pension funds. The external audit of pension funds is an important part of the control of pension fund activities. I believe that the current review of corporate governance and focus on the need for audit committees in listed companies should be widened to cover control in pension funds. There should be a link between the findings of the review and the control requirements for pension funds, some of which are registered companies. In a research study conducted by the Institute of Internal Auditors in 1988, it was evident that very few had established an audit committee or an internal audit activity. I doubt whether this situation has changed very much since that time. Internal audit can be an effective control and whistle-blower in a pension fund and if given a reporting line to an audit committee at trustee level, a provider of independent advice and information. Let us all hope that out of today's debate and reviews there will be a stronger structure of audit in pension funds, both internal and external.

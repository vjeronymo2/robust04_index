			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPIPHYLLUM SHOW WILL BLOOM AT THE SOUTH COAST BOTANIC GARDEN  </P> <P> You may have a little trouble pronouncing the name, but don't let that stop you  from admiring the beauty of the epiphyllums on display from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Sunday at South Coast Botanic Garden. The stunning blossoms of these plants are  vibrantly colored, have many different shapes and petal forms, and may range  anywhere from 2 to 11 inches in diameter.  </P> <P> Epiphyllums (also called epies or orchid cactus) are native to the jungle areas  of Mexico and Central America. They grow on trees but they are not parasites,  using the trees only for support. These easy-care plants can be grown in pots  and require only weekly or biweekly watering, depending on location and  weather.  </P> <P> The South Bay Epiphyllum Society will be displaying single flowers,  arrangements and blooming plants. There will also be epiphyllum cuttings and  rooted plants on sale.  </P> <P> Admission to the garden and show, at 26300 Crenshaw Blvd., Palos Verdes  Peninsula, is $3 for adults, $1.50 for seniors and students, 75 cents for  children from 5 to 12 years of age.

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Security stepped up in Crimea The Ukrainian authorities have been increasing the level of security in the Crimean peninsula after a month of violence and crime in the area which is home to the disputed Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea fleet. The move comes less than three weeks before the republic's presidential elections. Four Crimean politicians have been murdered since mid- November, including a Ukrainian member of parliament, the head of the Black Sea fleet's press centre and a Crimean presidential candidate. On Tuesday it was reported that armed Ukrainian marines seized two fleet offices. No shots were fired. Cross-accusations of misconduct, such as the office seizures, are frequent. Ukrainian navy officials have accused Russian officers of trying to prevent servicemen from taking an oath of loyalty to Ukraine. While these incidents have been small and isolated, they are indicative of increasing tension in the region, once the tranquil holiday playground of the Kremlin elite. Fuelling the instability is the unresolved dispute over ownership of the Black Sea fleet, a serious obstacle in Russian-Ukrainian relations since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia is likely continue to press for full ownership of the fleet in exchange for offsetting Ukraine's Dollars 2.5bn energy debt. President Leonid Kravchuk agreed to consider this formula at last September's Russian-Ukrainian summit. However, the rise of Russia's nationalists has made Ukraine more wary of relinquishing its share of the navy despite its severe energy crisis. The danger in Crimea is that Ukrainians might respond to imperialist rhetoric by becoming more anti-Russian, and that ethnic Russians who make up roughly 70 per cent of the Crimean population, will step up their pro-Russian campaign to break away from Ukraine. The ultra-nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky brought out a huge vote among Russian citizens in the coastal city of Sevastopol, the Black Sea fleet's base. The Crimea was removed from Russian jurisdiction and gifted to Ukraine by the Soviet leader Mr Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 as a symbolic gesture to mark 300 years of friendship between the two nations. The Russian Space Agency announced yesterday that it had reached a preliminary agreement to lease the ex- Soviet Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Russia hopes to make commercial satellite launches from this installation, while Kazakhstan is looking to offset its Dollars 1.3bn debt to Russia. Mr Yuri Koptev, head of the agency, added that a final agreement could also include Russian access to Kazakh military sites such as the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground. It was unclear how this potential arrangement would affect Kazakhstan's newly acquired non-nuclear status.</p>

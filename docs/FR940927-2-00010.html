This decision updates and supplements the Record of Decision for the Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for the Fast Combat Support Ship (AOE&hyph;6 Class) U.S. West Coast Homeporting Program which was issued on March 10, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action is to dredge and make structural upgrades at Pier D of the PSNS, and dispose of the dredged material in federally and state approved disposal sites. The action will provide the necessary bathymetry for permanent berthing for up to two AOE&hyph;6 Class ships and temporary berthing of one of the largest deep draft ships already homeported at PSNS, typically an aircraft carrier. The proposed action has been developed from a combination of three berthing configurations and five disposal options. The required dredging quantity is approximately 105,000 cubic yards, of which approximately 53,400 cubic yards are contaminated and are unsuitable for in-water disposal. The disposal method is a mixed mode of operation which utilizes an upland facility (landfill) for contaminated sediment disposal and an in-water site for disposing of clean material. The primary upland disposal site is the Olympic View Sanitary Landfill (OVSL) about 10 miles south of Bremerton. The Roosevelt Regional Landfill (RRL) and Columbia Ridge Landfill and Recycling Center (CRLRC) would be used as backup in the event of unforeseen problems at OVSL. Each of these landfills is currently authorized to accept the type of dredged materials produced by this project which have been designated unsuitable for in-water disposal by regulatory agencies. The primary in-water disposal site is the Puget Sound Dredge Disposal Analysis (PSDDA) approved Elliot Bay disposal site near Seattle which is about 15 miles east of PSNS; backup sites include PSDDA approved Commencement Bay near Tacoma or Port Gardner near Everett. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other berthing configurations and the ``No Action'' alternative were considered and eliminated. Other berthing configurations would not address the Navy's need for operational flexibility at PSNS with respect to large deep-draft vessels. The ``No Action'' alternative would not accommodate Navy's AOE&hyph;6 homeporting mission in the west coast. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

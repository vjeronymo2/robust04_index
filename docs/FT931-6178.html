			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / EC in new agreement on small print in contracts THE European Community yesterday gave consumers a new weapon to use against unfair small print in contracts. EC consumer affairs ministers agreed a directive to outlaw standard contracts weighted against the consumer. The accord ends 16 years of discussion between member states, and could open a range of previously acceptable agreements to legal challenge, including banks' contracts with customers, package holiday deals which allow tour companies to impose surcharges, and even broad warnings that customers use services 'at their own risk'. But consumer organisations said yesterday that the new legislation, which will not come into force until December 31 1994, did not go far enough, and was too vague. They believe it should include a definitive list of illegal clauses, rather than an 'indicative' list, and should cover all contracts, including those negotiated by the consumer. Ms Monique Goyens, legal adviser to Beuc, the European consumers' organisation, said: 'We are pleased that this directive is almost on the statute books, but it will bring few concrete benefits to any of Europe's consumers.' Other consumer groups said its main benefit would be to raise consumers' awareness of the dangers hidden in the small print. Ms Rebecca Evans, barrister with the Consumers' Association in London, said: 'A big piece of legislation coming in will reinforce in the public mind that they are not stuck with the small print, and there are things that companies can't do.' Mr Jan Trojberg, the industry minister in Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, said the directive would raise minimum consumer protection standards in southern EC countries such as Spain and Portugal.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Most life groups welcome watchdog's plan to help victims Several leading life companies yesterday offered a cautious welcome to SIB's two-year plan to help victims of pension mis-selling. But Legal &amp; General, one of the largest, attacked the plan. Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said: 'We believe that SIB is unfairly putting too great a burden of the costs of resolving the issue on the life assurance industry.' In a reference to the role of occupational pension schemes, he added: 'This is a pensions-industry problem which should have been funded by the whole of the pensions industry.' Mr Prosser said Legal &amp; General would make additional provisions to take account of administrative costs and possible liabilities for compensating customers of independent advisers which had gone out of business. Mr Geoffrey Lister, chief executive of Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, warned that many smaller independent financial advisers might be forced out of business. Last year the society set aside Pounds 5m as provision against past errors, and is to commit a similar amount this year. Mr Lister also focused on the responsibilities of occupational schemes, calling on them to support SIB's hope that they 'will be reasonable in their demands when it comes to reinstating transfers and opt-outs'. He added: 'Otherwise I fear the IFA sector will become solely the preserve of larger organisations like ourselves.' NPI, a mutual insurer which specialises in pensions, was similarly concerned that smaller advisers could be forced out of business by the administrative costs of the plan and hoped that the larger insurers would help. However, it said the overall compensation figure was likely to be 'not terribly significant' in terms of the size of the sector. Mr David Davies of Pearl Assurance said: 'The guidelines appear to strike a sensible balance between the need to resolve priority cases quickly and to recognise that other clients may need their situations reviewed later.' Pearl had started work a year ago to identify its share of cases, he said, and had conducted 7,000 interviews out of a total of 38,000 customers who took an opt-out. But the timescale for SIB's review was attacked by the Consumers' Association, which said that too many people advised to take out personal pensions faced financial uncertainty for too long. Some of the unions whose members may have been affected, including the GMB general union and the Association of Lecturers and Teachers, expressed similar concerns. Prudential, which has insisted that it does not have a problem with opt-outs or transfers, reiterated that sales staff were forbidden to sell opt-outs and that it did not need to make provision in its accounts against possible compensation claims. TSB, the banking and insurance group, said the report would 'help in rebuilding customer confidence'. Mr Kevin Wesbroom, a partner with consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said several factors might have produced the high estimates of potential opt-out and transfer cases, including general concern about pensions after the Maxwell affair, the withdrawal from pension schemes of those made redundant, and an exodus from the pension funds of declining industries. Asked if life companies would comply with the proposal he said: 'I don't think they have any choice - although a few will squeal.'</p>

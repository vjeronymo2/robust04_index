Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri yesterday denied for the  second time in two days that there will be a cabinet reshuffle,  noting that reports about this matter are merely newspaper  speculations.    Deputy Prime Minister Michel al-Murr repeated an earlier  denial that there will be a reshuffle of portfolios. He  explained that although there are certain reservations about the  level of performance in some ministries, this does not  necessitate a reshuffle.    Sources close to the prime minister told the newspaper  AL-NAHAR that those who spread rumors about a cabinet reshuffle  are seeking to achieve two things: First, to provoke a dispute  between the prime minister and the Chamber of Deputies speaker;  and second, to provoke quarrels between the prime minister and  the ministers and also among the ministers themselves. The  sources noted that such quarrels would paralyze the government  and undermine the current cooperation between the government and  the Chamber of Deputies over the passing of laws beneficial to  the country's peace and reconstruction process.</p>

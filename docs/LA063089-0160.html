			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRADLEY TAKES OATH FOR FIFTH TERM;  </P> <P> VOWS 'MORE LIVABLE, MORE PROSPEROUS AND MORE JUST' CITY  </P> <P> Tom Bradley, facing investigations that threaten his political career, became  Los Angeles' first five-term mayor today with a pledge to make his city "more  prosperous, more livable and more just." There was no mention of the probes of  his personal finances in his speech prepared for an inaugural ceremony on the  sunny First Street steps of City Hall.  </P> <P> Rather, he sought to look beyond the immediate future, mapping out an agenda  for the city for the next four years designed to funnel more municipal  resources into programs for the poor.  </P> <P> "The headlines will come and go," he said. "The 30-second sound bites will be  heard and then fade away and be forgotten; what will remain long after we are  gone, what will count in the ultimate balance, are the doors of opportunity  that have been opened, the air that has been cleaned, the neighborhoods that  have been given new life, a generation that has been given new hope."  </P> <P> Strongly implying that he believes that his place in history will be determined  by his handling of such issues rather than the current investigations, Bradley  said, "All of this -- and more -- will be the real test of our success or  failure, and in meeting that need, nothing will be permitted to distract our  attention or sap our energy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Target of Investigations  </P> <P> Since Spring, Bradley has been the target of probes by federal and city  officials into his stock transactions and his employment by two local financial  institutions which had business pending before the city.  </P> <P> Also sworn in with Bradley were two high city officials in charge of aspects of  the probes, City Atty. James K. Hahn and Controller Rick Tuttle.  </P> <P> Bradley pledged to propose a "new strategy" to drive drugs and violence from  public housing projects.  </P> <P> And he reiterated his determination to obtain more revenue from downtown  redevelopment, an effort now held up by legal and political disputes.  </P> <P> The mayor also said he will soon announce a program to reduce pollution of  Santa Monica Bay from storm drains flowing into it.  </P> <P> Bradley promised to spur economic development of poor areas. "Los Angeles  cannot permanently exist as two cities -- one amazingly prosperous, the other  increasingly poorer in substance and hope," he said.  </P></p>

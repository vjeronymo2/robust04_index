Group"]    [Text] DASSAULT ELECTRONIQUE has concluded an agreement  with the major shareholders of SOREP S.A. under which it will be  taking over 2/3 of equity in SOREP S.A.    SOREP, located at Chateaubourg, in the vicinity of Rennes,  specializes in the development and production of hybrid circuits  and ASICs for military, civil and space applications as well as  for telecommunications and oil prospecting. Since its founding  in 1978, SOREP has been an important partner of DASSAULT  ELECTRONIQUE in microelectronic activities.    In 1993, SOREP S.A. had a revenue of 101 million FF (period  ending 31 August 1993). It is a 100-percent shareholder in the  EDGETEK Co., 43 percent in ERULEC and 56 percent in SOREP Inc.  in the U.S.A., in partnership with SCHLUMBERGER.    The SOREP Group as a whole generates an annual revenue of  nearly 230 million FF and employs around 450 persons.    For the DASSAULT ELECTRONIQUE Group, this outside growth  operation is the culmination of a long production partnership  and complementary microelectronic action. The SOREP Group will  keep its identity and independence and under this alliance will  acquire new facilities to develop its own microelectronic  service activities for the benefit of customers in France and  other countries.    The DASSAULT ELECTRONIQUE acquisition, made in complete  agreement with the management of SOREP, will become effective  during the month of January 1994.</p>

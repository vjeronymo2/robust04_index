			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 128'S EFFECT ON WATER SUPPLY  </P> <P> Much has been written about the Hayden Initiative, Proposition 128, in recent  weeks. However, very little has been said about its effect on Southern  California's water.  </P> <P> I am particularly concerned about the very real possibility of a substantial  reduction in the water available to Southern California from Northern  California. Your readers should know that in much of Southern California, 100%  of all domestic water is imported either from Northern California via the State  Water Project or from the Colorado River.  </P> <P> Proposition 128 mandates "full protection and propagation of fish, shellfish  and their habitat." This would undoubtedly mean diversion of water to San  Francisco Bay from the State Water Project, thereby reducing water available  for distribution to consumers. Real people will be shortchanged. People need  water.  </P> <P> After four years of drought, water is already in short supply in Southern  California despite aggressive voluntary conservation. Mandatory cutbacks will  be required if our drought continues into its fifth year. Public water  suppliers are developing alternates to imported water; however, many of these  are unreasonably costly or are limited in quantity.  </P> <P> One successful alternative currently used to reduce our need for imported water  is to reclaim water for non-domestic purposes. This is both economical and  available. Proposition 128's stringent restrictions on the use of chlorine will  tend to eliminate the use of reclaimed water as an economic alternative. This  would further compound our shortage.  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the Coastal Municipal  Water District, the Municipal Water District of Orange County (the major  wholesale suppliers), most of the retail water agencies in Orange County, the  Assn. of California Water Agencies, and the Water Advisory Committee of Orange  County have all adopted resolutions opposing Proposition 128 for these reasons.  </P> <P> Other parts of the proposition may be desirable, but its negative effect on  Southern California water would be pervasive. Your readers should know the  facts before they decide.  </P> <P> HUNTER T. COOK  </P> <P> General Manager  </P> <P> Coastal Municipal Water District  </P></p>

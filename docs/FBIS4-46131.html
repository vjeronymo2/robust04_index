			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Hizballah Secretary General  Hasan Nasrallah stressed the need for the "flaccid leadership to  stop putting restrictions and limitations on the scope of the  work of the resistance, which is a sacred weapon. The scope of  the resistance must expand with the expansion of the scope of  the aggression." He explained that this does not mean there  should be self-security [for Hizballah] or that this will result  in chaos but that there should be cooperation and measures that  would enable the people to stand on the side of the state.  While Nasrallah did not rule out the possibility of an internal  breach [of security by a double agent], he said the fate of  Israeli navigator Ron Arad is a riddle "we cannot solve."    Nasrallah made these remarks at a news conference held at  the  Hizballah Information Mobilization office in Harat Hurayk [in  Beirut's Southern Suburb] yesterday to discuss the kidnapping of  Mustafa al-Dirani, one of the leaders of the "Believers'  Resistance." The news conference was held amid stringent  security measures.    Nasrallah opened his news conference by noting that the  targeting of one of the symbols of the resistance is an  unleashing of the Zionist terrorism that is backed by U.S.  equipment and technology and "encouraged by the international  collusion manifested in its ugliest form in the way it dealt  with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and the various Zionist enemy  attacks on Lebanon and the region." [passage omitted]    He warned that the confrontation is no longer restricted to  a  limited geographic area and that all the Lebanese territories  are now vulnerable to Zionist violations and aggression. He  said the resistance weapon is sacred wherever it may be and that  the scope of resistance can stretch with the expansion of the  area of aggression. "Therefore, the relaxed leaders must  refrain from laying down restrictions, drawing limits, and  specifying the area of resistance activity, because all this is  a luxury and theoretical talk that has nothing to do with the  reality of the challenge and suffering," he said, emphasizing  that enhancing and protecting the resistance in the face of the  Israeli profanity is one of the main prerequisites for  establishing real national peace in this country.    Cautioning that the Gaza Agreement still gives the Zionist  enemy an extra footing, Nasrallah called for serious action to  thwart it and prepare for a new, massive revival against the  Israeli schemes. He maintained that the kidnapping method was a  new message with major implications. "It was targeted against  the resistance, the homeland, the nation, domestic social peace,  and the security of Lebanon and the region. Most probably the  goal is far beyond what the enemy has announced regarding the  search for information on the seized navigator. It even seeks  political objectives within the Zionist entity," Nasrallah said.  He stressed that the process of planning, reacting to, and  dealing with that incident must be as big as the implications,  the risks, and the objectives the enemy has attached to it.    Nasrallah concluded by saying: As long as the enemy has  opted to expand the scope of confrontation, it must bear the  responsibility for that decision, because the resistance  fighters' and mujahidin response will come from where they  expect and where they do not. Anyway, he said, the battle will  be long. Victory will be ours and shame and destruction will be  the share of the Zionist occupiers.    Nasrallah then answered correspondents' questions. He  remarked that "local infiltration is possible" but that the  issue "is sheer speculation." He explained that party elements  have visited the target area and gathered information from the  people. "The picture is taking final shape as far as we are  concerned, if it has not already materialized."    He pointed out that the area was experiencing storming  operations. "We were careful to avoid problems, because our  policy is to facilitate the work of the authorities concerned.  This atmosphere was used to achieve a better performance in  that operation," he said. He revealed that gaps existed,  denying the party's responsibility for them. "The Israeli  operation could have been costly," he remarked, stressing the  need for cooperation with the Lebanese Army and the Syrian  forces to block these gaps.    Answering a question, Nasrallah said: We demand neither  self- imposed nor relaxed security. What we want to say is that  there should be cooperation and measures that enable the people  to stand by the Lebanese state against any Israeli aggression.  The resistance can live with social peace. It is even a  prerequisite of that peace.    Nasrallah does not expect Israel to achieve what it wants  from al-Dirani's kidnapping, because "Ron Arad's" issue has  become like a riddle. "We dealt with the issue very seriously  because it is part of a process that can help release all POW's  and detainees in Israeli jails. Hajj Mustafa cooperated  seriously with us. He knows the declared and circulated  information on the issue to an extent, after which neither we  nor him know anything of the issue. That is why I can swear  that the Israelis will reach a dead end with him (Abu-'Ali  al-Dirani)."    The Hizballah secretary general affirmed that the party has  not ruled out a swap. "But we do not know the party holding  Arad; we do not even know whether he is being held by a  particular party. Besides, Israel rejects any solution involving  a swap unless the Israeli navigator is involved in it," he said.  He believes that "Arad's" issue might be a mere excuse to  target the resistance and its leaders. He expressed surprise  that the world is interested in this issue although it ignores  hundreds of Lebanese and thousands of Palestinians who are being  held in the occupation's prisons.</p>

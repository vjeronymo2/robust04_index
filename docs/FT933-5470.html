			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Kantor launches offensive US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor yesterday launched an offensive to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement by presenting a 74-page rebuttal of assertions in an anti-Nafta book released last week by Mr Ross Perot, writes Lisa Bransten from Washington. Mr Kantor accused Nafta opponents of favouring the 'status quo,' which has cost the US jobs by forcing US companies to move to Mexico to sell their goods. As Congress returns next week, the administration is seeking votes for Nafta, but has so far won only a minority of its own Democratic party.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kostas Kiriakopoulos: "These Are Not Just Easter </F> Firecrackers"]    [Text] When these days the neighborhood calmness is broken  by the noise of explosions, our mind goes to the colorful Easter  firecrackers.    Yet, in the first four months of 1994 we heard other  "terrorist" explosions since 17 November, the "Revolutionary  Peoples Struggle" [ELA] and their other kinsmen moved several  times through the dark streets of Athens leaving their explosive  identification mark.    Since the beginning of the year, 17 November made its  appearance three times, according to the evidence, and ELA five  times. It may be noted that the organizations have not assumed  responsibility for those attacks by issuing proclamations, but  the ELA made telephone calls. This was a usual terrorist  activity, not a drastic increase as originally thought, since  during the same four-month period in 1993, 17 November struck  seven times and ELA struck four. Almost the same applies in the  case of ELA for the same four-month period in 1992--ELA acted  five times while 17 November remained completely inactive. 17  November apparently suspended its activities in the first months  of 1992 following the encounter with the police on Louizis  Rankour Street. But by the end of 1992 it had acted four times,  starting with the murder of Thanos Axarlian during the rocket  attack against Yiannis Palaeokrassas.  <H5>  Was It a Failure? </H5>   The officers of the antiterrorist units, assessing the  "quality and quantity" of the various "strikes," observe that  although the number of actions is approximately the same as  those during the previous two years, there is indeed an increase  after many months of "quietness." The bloody game of Greek  terrorism does not stop. Let us not forget that 17 November  started its season this year with the cold-blooded murder of  Mikh. Vranopouloas. Later, it attacked two insurance companies,  the American "Alico" which has been in the Greek marketplace and  the Dutch "Nationale Nederlande" for 30 years. It was at that  time that the failed rocket attack on the British carrier "Ark  Royal" became known. It was noted that if the two rockets were  launched from the Piraeus small lot and had hit the ship, the  diplomatic and political consequences for our country would be  hard to foretell. It would have been the organization's most  spectacular strike.    The policemen, however, have certain reservations and wonder  whether the action did indeed fail. The two rockets were placed  some 200 meters from the target, a distance which is an  impediment to effectiveness, as shown by other strikes. Some  imply that after the "easy and secure" strikes against the  insurance companies, the organization sought to impress not only  the Greek public opinion.  <H5>  The Targets Are "European" </H5>   With the exception of "Alico," all the targets of 17  November  and ELA had a purely European character. This is certainly  related to the UN activities in the Balkans and the troubled  area of Bosnia. If one should accept the theories which hold  that the terrorist actions affect or are related to certain  governmental actions at the diplomatic, political, social, and  business level here and abroad, he will see the summit  conference of the EU leaders, which will take place in  approximately two months in Corfu. He will see the effort to  attract foreign investors to Greece; the opening of the tourist  period; the prime minister's visit to the United States; the  treatment of Kurds in European countries such as Germany.    It is assumed that the bomb attacks on the German [Company]  "Miele" (by 17 November) in the building also housing the UN  High Commissioner and on the Greek office on refugees which  works with the UN (by ELA) are directly related to the Kurdish  issue and its repercussions in Europe. These assessments come  mostly from the political leadership of the Ministry of Public  Order, not the "operational" echelons of the Greek police. As  for the selection of the targets, the Attiki Security  antiterrorist unit admitted indirectly that "it was almost taken  by surprise." During the period with the largest number of  terrorist actions, the major political issue was the reaction of  the "productive classes" to the government-sponsored tax bill.  Naturally, the police had taken extraordinary measures to guard  the tax collection offices and state financial agencies, having  in mind last year's avalanche of bombs and rockets against tax  collection offices, as well as against tax collection officials'  cars, especially directors. The discovery of the two rockets  aimed at the British carrier gave an opportunity to assess 17  November's armory. Police officials believe that this  organization has used up almost half of its rockets during 17  attacks with 2.36-inch and 3.5-inch antitank missiles stolen in  December 1992 from the storage area of the Sykourio military  camp in Larisa. The National Defense Ministry had reported at  that time that the terrorists had stolen 60 to 65 rockets. They  have now "used up" more than 30.  <H5>  The Others </H5>   In a recent TV interview, Public Order Minister St.  Papathemelis said that ELA is simply the tail of 17 November.  This is nothing new since, for years now, the prevailing theory  in the headquarters of the antiterrorist service is that of  "communicating vessels" regarding the two major organizations.  However, after a given action by ELA, we see other anarchist  groups attacking party offices, state-owned cars, police  officers, banks, and security services. These groups, known also  as the stooges of the terrorists, apply the tactic of assuming  responsibility for a given action by telephone. During recent  years, 16 such groups have been active mainly in Athens but also  in Salonica. Among those groups, we have the "Anarchist Group 15  May," "Rabid Anarchists," "Anarchists Beyond Detection," and  others that gain their "revolutionary mantle" after a specific  terrorist attack. Be that as it may, their bombs are not Easter  firecrackers either.</p>

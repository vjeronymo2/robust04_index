			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Radio Investors in the UK television sector know how incoherent regulatory regimes can produce stock market mayhem. The radio sector may be about to experience a similar speculative frenzy. A judicial review of the Radio Authority's approval of EMAP's bid for Trans World Communications starts tomorrow. If the authority's decision is upheld, it could lead to a further rash of corporate activity. If not, it calls into question whether radio's regulator is deemed capable of minding its own back yard. The review concerns EMAP's attempt to skirt ownership rules by proposing to sell two licences to a separate venture jointly owned with its merchant bank. This arrangement makes a mockery of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Broadcasting Act, although the Radio Authority seems powerless to object. Other companies have devised similarly ingenious means of splitting ownership and control. Daily Mail and General Trust has increased its stake in Chiltern Radio above the permitted 20 per cent by buying more shares through a joint venture company. Radio is already one of the hottest stock market sectors because of its high operational gearing and potential to grab a bigger slice of the advertising cake. For example, Capital Radio now trades on 36 times historic earnings. But with big media groups, such as Reuters, keen to muscle in on radio, the excitement may rise further. That makes it all the more imperative for the government to speed up its review of media ownership rules and finally introduce a coherent set of industry-wide regulations.</p>

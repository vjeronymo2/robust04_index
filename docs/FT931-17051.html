			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Sickening rule for employees - Health insurance BRITISH tax law is littered with arbitrary distinctions between employees and the self-employed. The tax treatment of permanent health insurance (PHI) is a case in point. As a rule - provided you stay healthy - you will be better off in employment, but should you ever claim against the policy, then self-employed status will prove more tax-efficient. Plans to protect income against long-term disability have enjoyed growing popularity in recent years, becoming an almost invariable feature of executive remuneration packages. Until 1981, PHI was a taxable benefit for directors and other higher-paid staff, although not for other employees. But the 1981 Finance Act introduced a blanket exemption and PHI remains to this day one of the dwindling band of tax-free perks. Paying PHI premiums for staff gives an employer the best of both tax worlds. Not only can he confer a tax-free benefit on his workers but also the cost of so doing will be a deductible item for corporation tax purposes. But while the taxman has a positive attitude to PHI for employees, his approach is quite different if the insured is self-employed. Premiums paid by the self-employed - whether sole proprietors or business partners - cannot be deducted from their taxable profits. So if bosses are insuring themselves and their staff, it will be worth their while asking the insurance company to 'load' the premiums as far as possible on to the staff policies. The Inland Revenue's pro-employee bias is abruptly reversed in the event that illness or accident leads to a claim for PHI benefit. Some policies provide for lump-sum payments and these will normally be tax-free, irrespective of the status of the recipient. But in the more usual case of ongoing periodic benefits, employees draw the short straw. This is because such benefits are taxed in precisely the same way as the salary they are replacing. So income tax will be deducted through the pay-as-you-earn system (even though the taxpayer is no longer in a position to 'earn' anything) and national insurance contributions will also be due. Although the self-employed are also subject to income tax, they can take advantage of an Inland Revenue concession which affords them a significant tax 'holiday'. The concession - that applies in the rare case of an employee who has made his own PHI arrangements - stops the tax clock from running until the unfortunate individual has been receiving PHI for one complete fiscal year. The length of the tax-free period will therefore be maximised if the insured person can arrange to start drawing benefit immediately after April 6, the first day of each tax year. Take the case of Oscar, a Treasury mandarin who suffered a nervous breakdown on Black Wednesday. Oscar had prudently arranged his own PHI policy which, like many such policies, requires him to wait 26 weeks before claiming benefit. He will therefore be able to draw his first monthly cheque on April 1, 1993. But if he does, his tax exemption will end on April 6, 1994, because by then he will have been in receipt of benefit for a full tax year. If, instead, he defers his first claim until May 1993, he will extend his tax holiday until April 5, 1995. The sacrifice of a single monthly instalment will be more than compensated by the extra 11 months of tax immunity. If, for example, Oscar's monthly benefit is Pounds 2,000, he will receive an additional Pounds 22,000 of tax-free income. That means a saving - at the basic rate - of Pounds 5,500. Oscar's timing was relatively fortuitous. Obviously, for somebody whose benefit entitlement is triggered nearer to the middle of a tax year, there will come a point at which the cost of deferring benefits outweighs the tax advantage. Although the ability to receive up to two years' tax-free income is unique to the self-employed, with no equivalent for employees, the position is quite different where the individual concerned is an expatriate. By a quirk of UK tax legislation, PHI payments to self-employed expatriates are fully taxable in this country, after the expiry of the initial tax-free period. By contrast, benefits paid to non-resident employees should escape the Inland Revenue's clutches. David Cohen is a partner in City law firm, Paisner &amp; Co.</p>

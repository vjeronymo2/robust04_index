			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / California action may prompt rise in US executions CALIFORNIA carried out its first execution for 25 years yesterday, raising fears among opponents of capital punishment of a wave of executions across the US. Robert Alton Harris was gassed to death in front of 49 witnesses at San Quentin prison after a series of reversals in which a federal appeals court four times stayed his execution, and was four times overruled by the Supreme Court in Washington. The Supreme Court overturned the fourth and final stay, which was issued after Harris had been strapped in the gas chamber, and ordered the lower courts not to file any more stays without the high court's permission. After this ruling, Harris was hastily returned to the chamber for the last time, looking sombre but winking at one guard. Harris was executed for murdering two teenagers in 1978. The state of California has often set political and social trends for the US. It not only has the second-largest number of convicted prisoners facing death - 328 after Harris's execution - but has also been the scene of a vigorous public debate, as conservative politicians attacked the liberal state judges appointed by Mr Jerry Brown, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, when he was governor in the late 1970s. Popular support for the death penalty as a punishment for murder has almost doubled since the mid-1960s, when it fell to about 40 per cent. Nine executions in 10 have taken place in the southern states. Black prisoners have received a disproportionate number of death sentences. Although the death penalty has been brandished by politicians as a weapon against rising crime, it is rarely carried out. Only 169 executions have been carried out since 1976. At the current rate, 15 times this number of new prisoners arrive on 'death row' each year. The Bush administration last year tried to pass legislation making it easier to carry out a death sentence by weakening the habeas corpus protections which enable prisoners to delay execution with seemingly endless appeals. The Democratic-controlled Congress responded by proposing to extend the death penalty to 50 federal crimes - a largely irrelevant gesture which covered such offences as the murder of a federal egg inspector. However, the extension was also intended to curb indiscriminate sale of guns. President George Bush then threatened to veto the entire bill, partly because he claimed it would tie the hands of policemen and prosecutors by further extending habeas corpus protection, but also partly because of his opposition to gun controls. The resulting stalemate has blocked any federal crime legislation, leaving states to press ahead with their own solutions.</p>

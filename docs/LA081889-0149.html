			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SYRIANS FIRE ROCKETS AT BEIRUT PASSENGER SHIP  </P> <P> Syrian gunners fired 120 rockets today at the only passenger vessel that serves  the Christian enclave, wounding seven people on the wharf and causing the ship  to flee for Cyprus, police said.  </P> <P> It left behind hundreds trying to escape the artillery war that has killed 779  people and wounded 2,104, by police count, in five months.  </P> <P> The sea route to Cyprus is the only link to the outside for the 1 million  Christians of the 310-square-mile enclave, sealed on the other three sides by  Syrian soldiers, guns and tanks.  </P> <P> A police spokesman said the Syrians opened up with truck-mounted multiple  rocket launchers soon after midnight as the hydrofoil Santa Maria docked at  Jounieh, a Christian port 12 miles north of Beirut.  </P> <P> "Arriving passengers had just disembarked, and departing passengers were  gathered on the dock to board the vessel when the rocketing started," said a  spokesman for the Jounieh Port Authority.  </P> <P> Tony Mansour, spokesman for Santa Maria's agents in Larnaca, Cyprus, said  rockets began exploding around the ship before the crew had unloaded the  baggage of 120 passengers who got off at Jounieh.  </P> <P> Only eight of the 300 waiting passengers had boarded when the Santa Maria  sailed away, and six of the eight passports still were in the hands of Jounieh  port officials.  </P></p>

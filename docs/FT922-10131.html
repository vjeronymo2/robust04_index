			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transfering a house I AM the sole beneficiary and executor of the estate of my uncle. I also hold his enduring power of attorney although this is not registered with the Court of Protection as yet. My uncle is 91 and almost totally dependant on me and my mother, who lives with him, for assistance he wishes to transfer the house he owns into my name. What procedure should I follow? You can use the power of attorney to effect the transfer, if you register it and if the occasion for the power's exercise has arisen. If not you would need to have the transfer executed by your uncle, who should be advised by an independent solicitor and, if appropriate, with medical advice as to his capacity. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

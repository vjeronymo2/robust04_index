			<p>BFN     [Text] After Cote d'Ivoire, it is now Cameroon's turn.  Indeed, the country has been granted a reduction of its public  debt by the Paris Club, which includes various Western  creditors. Thus the Cameroon public debt is being rescheduled  in accordance with the so-called London terms, which are the  most favorable conditions that the Paris Club can grant.  Norbert Navaro reports:    [Begin Navaro recording] It is the first time that Cameroon  has been granted a collective reduction of its debt. This debt  totals 45 billion French francs, equivalent to 4.5 billion CFA  francs. Two-thirds of this sum make up Cameroon's public debt,  the only one the Paris Club is interested in.    The Paris Club has granted preferential treatment to  Yaounde.  Like Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon is one of the four countries with a  so-called intermediary income in the franc zone. The two others  are Congo and Gabon. Until Cote d'Ivoire set a precedent last  Friday [25 March], the annulment of 50 percent of debts was  granted to the poorest countries only.    The Paris Club is only concerned with little less than 900  billion CFA francs of Cameroon's debt on this occasion. This  corresponds to the financial commitments that were not honored  in the past, plus those that will come up in the next 18 months  -- this is the duration of the agreement between Yaounde and the  IMF which was reached on 15 March. Fifty percent of a small  part of these 900 billion CFA francs will be annulled, and the  remainder will be spread over 23 years.    The Paris Club was admittedly more generous with Cote  d'Ivoire last Friday, but this unprecedented -- and unexpected  -- help toward Cameroon comes in addition to the annulment of a  debt worth 400 billion CFA francs granted by France to Dakar on  12 January, the date of the devaluation.

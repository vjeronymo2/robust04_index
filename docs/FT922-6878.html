			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Thailand's revered king has his day BEFORE every show in Thai cinemas the audience rises for the national anthem and for a faded film showing King Bhumipol Adulyadej - officially dubbed the 'working monarch' - inspecting worthy rural projects throughout Thailand in unremarkable civilian clothes. The frowning, bespectacled man visiting irrigation canals in the countryside looks like an ordinary, if particularly serious, Thai citizen. But both he and the institution of the monarchy are revered by his subjects to an extraordinary degree. Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932 and the king's legal powers are severely circumscribed. Yet he is regarded as a mediator and arbiter of last resort at times of national crisis. Like the government, the pro-democracy demonstrators who have confronted the army in the past four days of disturbances in Bangkok have repeatedly and publicly emphasised their loyalty to the king. Thai academics appealed to the 64-year-old king to intervene, as he did in 1973 by meeting the leaders of the discredited authoritarian government and student demonstrators, and finally by appointing a new administration. Last night the king finally stepped in. State television showed him giving an audience to Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the embattled prime minister, Mr Chamlong Srimuang, on Monday, and Mr Prem Tinsulanonda, prime minister from 1980 to 1988 and now an adviser to the king. The three men crawled into the room on their knees while the king sat on a sofa - as a mark of respect for the monarch his subjects are obliged to keep their heads lower than his. Breaking his silence on the crisis, the king told the prime minister and opposition leader: 'If you both continue to seek to win, in the end the country will lose.' He urged them to turn to each other and seek compromise. King Bhumipol has been on the throne for 42 years. Born in the US in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where his father was studying medicine at Harvard, he went on to cultivate interests ranging from photography and jazz to boat-building and painting. As he grew older he developed an interest in rural development, initiating more than 1,000 projects in the countryside and reinforcing his popularity among the peasantry. Although the king is held in profound respect - public criticism of the royal family is forbidden and it is not unknown for people to be convicted of lese-majeste - he is aware of the limitations of his power and of the danger of different factions attempting to manipulate him. 'I am called a king, but my duty - you have noticed - is not the duty of a king,' he said in a BBC interview 10 years ago. 'We keep in the middle, neutral and in peaceful co-existence with everybody,' he said then when asked about his involvement in politics. 'We could be crushed by both sides, but we are impartial. One day it would be very handy to have somebody impartial.' That day arrived yesterday.</p>

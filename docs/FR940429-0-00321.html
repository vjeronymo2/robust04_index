The lender may capitalize, in accordance with &sect;682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The lender shall file a claim with the guaranty agency in accordance with &sect;682.402(g) no later than 60 days after the lender receives the borrower's written request and sworn statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If a lender receives a payment made by or on behalf of the borrower on the loan after the lender files a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency, the lender shall forward the payment to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its receipt. The lender shall assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in determining whether the borrower is eligible for discharge of the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The lender shall comply with all instructions received from the Secretary or a guaranty agency with respect to loan discharges under paragraph (e) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The lender shall review a claim that the borrower did not endorse and did not receive the proceeds of a loan check. The lender shall take the actions required under paragraphs (e)(8)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section if it determines that the borrower did not endorse the loan check, unless the lender secures persuasive evidence that the proceeds of the loan were received by the borrower or the student for whom the loan was made, as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii). If the lender determines that the loan check was properly endorsed or the proceeds were received by the borrower or student, the lender may consider the borrower's objection to repayment as a statement of intention not to repay the loan, and may file a claim with the guaranty agency for reimbursement on that ground, but shall not report the loan to credit bureaus as in default until the guaranty agency, or, as applicable, the Secretary, reviews the claim for relief. By filing such a claim, the lender shall be deemed to have agreed to the following_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower endorsed the loan check or the proceeds of the loan were received by the borrower or the student, any failure to satisfy due diligence requirements by the lender prior to the filing of the claim that would have resulted in the loss of reinsurance on the loan in the event of default will be waived by the Secretary; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower did not endorse the loan check and that the proceeds of the loan were not received by the borrower or the student, the lender will comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(8)(ii)(B) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Within 30 days after being notified by the guaranty agency that the borrower's request for a discharge has been denied, the lender shall notify the borrower of the reasons for the denial and, if payments are due, resume collection against the borrower. The lender shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date the lender suspended collection activity, and may capitalize, in accordance with &sect;682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for admission on the basis of ability to benefit.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) For periods of enrollment beginning between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1991, a student who had a general education diploma or received one before the scheduled completion of the program of instruction is deemed to have the ability to benefit from the training offered by the school.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A student not described in paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section is considered to have the ability to benefit from training offered by the school if the student_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) For periods of enrollment beginning prior to July 1, 1987, was determined by the school to have the ability to benefit from the school's training in accordance with the requirements of 34 CFR 668.6;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) For periods of enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 1987, achieved a passing grade on a test_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Approved by the Secretary, for periods of enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 1991, or by the accrediting agency, for other periods; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Administered substantially in accordance with the requirements for use of the test; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Successfully completed a program of developmental or remedial education provided by the school.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Venezuela bank loss may reach Dollars 500m Losses at Banco Latino, Venezuela's second largest commercial bank, which was taken over by the government after closing its doors last week, may be as much as Dollars 500m (Pounds 337.8m), according to Venezuelan bankers. There was no official confirmation of the figure but it began to circulate privately after monetary officials took their first, quick look at Latino's books last weekend before deciding on full state intervention. According to the bankers, it was the size of the apparent losses that deterred other Venezuelan banks from stepping in to save the bank, which reported assets of Dollars 1.9bn at the middle of last year. Other disconcerting elements surfaced as the government began the task of taking over the bank's management, deciding when to re-open and examining the books. For one thing, the government's bank deposit guarantee fund has 33 per cent of its total resources, or Dollars 160m, on deposit at Banco Latino itself. It is not clear if these funds can be used in the short term. Moreover, bankers are worried that the freezing of Latino's resources could cause serious problems at other Venezuelan banks, especially at two financial institutions where Latino had large equity stakes and strong business relationships. Last week Banco Maracaibo, an important commercial bank, disclosed it had purchased shares that Latino previously had held in the institution. Latino reportedly had 38 per cent of Maracaibo's stock, but no details on the sale were made public. However, according to bankers, the international ramifications should be modest: Latino has no public debt outstanding and bank credit lines to it were said to be modest. Government investigators are looking into Latino's offshore holdings, which could amount to over Dollars 600m, according to one Venezuelan banker. Bankers said the practice of dumping non-performing loans into offshore subsidiaries has not been uncommon. Attention is concentrated on the bank's Curacao subsidiary. The bank also has a 51-per-cent-owned joint venture in the Netherlands Antilles with ING Bank of the Netherlands - the Interunion Bank (Antilles), a Miami-based US subsidiary and an office in Colombia. A decision by the Venezuelan government to delay application of an unpopular value added tax has split the cabinet and caused widespread confusion among merchants and consumers. The finance minister, Mr Carlos Rafael Silva, strongly opposed the decision and offered his resignation on Monday but President Ramon Velasquez refused to accept it.</p>

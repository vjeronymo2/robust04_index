			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Motoring: Romeo stoops to conquer ALFA ROMEO, having peered into the abyss, is feeling confident about making a comeback in Britain. The new 155, which went on sale this week, has the ingredients of success. It looks, goes and even sounds like a proper Alfa Romeo. Starting with the traditional shield-shaped air intake, the 4-door body rises like a wedge to a high boot lid. Aerodynamic efficiency is claimed to be among the best in class and, hard lessons having been learned, corrosion resistance has been built in. Two engines are offered; the twin overhead camshaft, two plugs per cylinder Twin Spark in-line four and a V6. The Twin Sparks come in 1.8 litre, 129 horsepower and 2.0-litre, 143 horsepower versions. The 2.5-litre, 166 horsepower V6 has been developed from the 3-litre engine used in the big Alfa 164. They are transversly mounted, driving the front wheels through a 5-speed gearbox. Italian males being what they are, Alfa Romeo does not even offer an automatic alternative. A turbocharged four-wheel drive 155, with left hand steering only, joins the range in the autumn. Pricing looks almost predatorily keen. All 155s have power steering, electric front windows and sunroof, central locking and headlamp wash. The 1.8 is listed at Pounds 13,700. Even the V6, complete with ABS brakes, alloy wheels, climate control, power adjusted and heated front seats and exterior mirrors, is under the Pounds 19,250 tax band at Pounds 19,050. A similarly equipped 2.0-litre Lusso is Pounds 17,650. Alfa Romeo is looking for conquest sales, mainly among under-40 year old males. It thinks the 1.8 Twin Spark could seduce present business users of Vauxhall Cavaliers and Peugeot 405s. The 2.0-litre Twin Spark models (Pounds 15,100 and Pounds 17,650) are seen as alternatives to the Audi 100, the top of the range Nissan Primera and BMW 320i. And for the V6, Alfa Romeo has the Rover 800 and Mercedes 190E in its sights. A few days ago I drove a 2.0-litre Twin Spark and a V6 for over 300 miles (500 kms) in Scotland. The roads varied from the M8 to narrow single tracks with passing places on the remote Ardnamurchan peninsula. Of the two cars, I preferred the 2.0-litre Twin Spark. True, it had less muscle than the V6. But it rode much better on its soft, quiet and shock absorbing Goodyear NCT2 tyres than the V6, sportily shod with lower profile, higher speed-rated Pirelli P700s. Allowed to spin freely on the gears, the Twin Spark's 4-cylinder engine growled satisfyingly. The V6's exhaust note was just as authentically Alfa Romeo. Though it would pull happily enough in traffic at low revolutions in high gear, it enjoyed being given its head. What can one say of performance nowadays without perjuring oneself or putting one's head in the noose? Alfa Romeo claims, I am sure correctly, top speeds of 128 mph (206 kph) and 0-60 mph (0-96 kph) acceleration of 9.3 seconds for the 2.0-litre, 134 mph (216 kph) and 8.4 seconds for the V6. I found both cars nimble, well mannered and - can one say this of a machine?  -enthusiastic. Being tall, I have never been happy with the driving position in Alfa Romeos of the past. The new 155 is no different. Alfa man is still reckoned to be as long armed and short legged as a chimpanzee. With the well shaped and pleasantly soft seat back as far as it would go, my right foot was still bent at an acute angle though my arms were almost straight. But drivers under 5ft 10 in (178 cm) tall are less likely to complain.</p>

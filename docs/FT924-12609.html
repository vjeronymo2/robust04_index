			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Heron banks postpone meeting A MEETING of banks which lent to Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, has been postponed from today until October 29. The meeting will consider proposals to be put to banks and bondholders owed more than Pounds 1.3bn by the group, which has been hit by the fall in property values. The delay by the banks in holding the meeting was said to be caused by the need to finalise the proposals and make adjustment to take account of 'a number of external factors', including interest rate and currency movements. The group's 11 bonds are all denominated in currencies other than sterling. The fall in the value of the pound has meant a rise in the sterling value of the bonds from Pounds 450m when talks started in the spring to nearly Pounds 600m now. Bondholders say that Heron's banks refused to provide the funds to hedge the foreign exchange risk on the bonds. They say that bondholders, many of whom are individual investors, should not be expected to bear that risk.</p>

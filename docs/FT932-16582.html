			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Tony Brook leads SelecTV changes MR TONY BROOK, the former managing director of TVS Entertainment, yesterday became deputy chairman of SelecTV, the independent television production company rocked by allegations of irregularities and riven by internal disputes. Mr Brook, an executive with long experience in ITV, will succeed Mr Peter Laister as chairman of the company, which makes Birds Of A Feather and Lovejoy, on May 1. A report into SelecTV's problems by its solicitors, Richards Butler, is believed to be heavily critical of the standards of corporate governance. The company has expanded from a turnover of Pounds 95,000 to Pounds 22m in less than four years. Apart from a number of hit shows, its greatest asset is the 15% stake in Meridian, the ITV company for the south of England, which won its franchise from TVS. Following the investigation which was prompted by the issuing of a writ against Mr Allan McKeown, the managing director, by Mr Michael Buckley (the former chairman) with the knowledge of Mr Laister, then an independent director, a number of changes are expected. They will include SelecTV, expected to make a pre-tax profit of around Pounds 600,000 for 1992, appointing its own separate finance director and company secretary for the first time. The Richards Butler report is understood to clear Mr McKeown, who is married to the actress Tracey Ullman, of any wrong doing. However, it is believed that a number of transactions agreed either verbally with various directors or through memos were not formally minuted by the board, as they should have been under company legislation. Further legal action could flow from the Richards Butler report. Apart from the alleged irregularities mentioned in the writ, which was never served, the solicitors also looked into how SelecTV came to own 12m shares in a company called Wilton - the corporate vehicle of Mr Buckley, who was ousted as chairman of SelecTV last week. The shares cost SelecTV Pounds 250,000, which has been written off. The board will take legal advice this week on whether further action is needed as a result of the Richards Butler inquiry into the share deal. SelecTV is expected to issue a statement to the Stock Exchange this morning. Mr Buckley is calling for an independent legal investigation and is appealing to institutional shareholders of SelecTV to call an extraordinary general meeting to look at the all the issues involved.</p>

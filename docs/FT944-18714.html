			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Tension high in Indian state Political tensions in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh were running high last night, after police shot dead four demonstrators and injured 10. The demonstrators were on their way to New Delhi for a rally in support of demands for a separate state for the northern hills of Uttar Pradesh, where many feel alienated from the plainsmen who dominate the state. The firing occurred at Muzzafarnagar, 200km from Delhi. The Delhi rally of 50,000 people also turned violent when students, who have led the campaign for a separate hill state, protested at the presence on the platform of national politicians. Demands for a hill state have been revived after a decision by the Uttar Pradesh administration, led by lower caste parties, to implement laws reserving up to 50 per cent of government jobs and college places for lower caste Hindus. The hill districts, where upper caste Hindus dominate, erupted with protests. The conflict has thrown the state administration into disarray and has embarrassed the Congress (I) party of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister.</p>

The outcome compared with the previous year's Pounds 1.25m, and was struck from turnover ahead Pounds 6.47m at Pounds 17.03m. It included only a six months' contribution from Space-Time Systems (Holdings), which was acquired in June 1990, and took account of exceptional provisions of Pounds 417,000 (credits Pounds 189,000) and interest charges of Pounds 760,000 (Pounds 84,000). A final dividend of 0.5p makes a 1p (nil) total. Earnings per share emerged at 3p (5.7p). Year-end gearing amounted to 80 per cent. The directors' objective is to reduce borrowings via internal cash flow and continuing sales ofnon-core assets.</p>

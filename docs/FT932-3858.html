			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen rises on eve of talks THE YEN continued to appreciate against the dollar yest-erday, touching a new high against the US currency as dealers awaited the result of today's trade talks between the US and Japan, writes James Blitz. US officials will probably call for a scaling down of Japan's huge trade surplus at the meeting, and will make tough demands which Japanese officials may be unwilling to accept. There was no significant news relating to the talks yesterday. But dealers continued to believe that the US administration was happy to see the yen appreciate, and that intervention from the Federal Reserve to hold down the Japanese currency had been slight. After touching Y105.95 to the dollar at one stage, the yen ended in London yesterday at Y106.20 from a previous Y106.55. In New York the dollar finished at Y106.05. Mr Julian Callow, an international economist at Kleinwort Benson in London, said the Y100 to the dollar level was almost certain to be reached. But he thought there could be some short term retracement over the next few days. Today's tankan business report from the Bank of Japan may show that the strong yen rise is hurting Japanese exporters, reducing fundamental support for the currency. By contrast, the dollar remained well underpinned against a generally weak D-Mark, touching DM1.6403 in Europe before closing lower at DM1.6340. It ended New York trading at DM1.6285. The dollar's recent strength is the product of last week's very good payroll report for May. In Mr Callow's view, the rise in US payrolls, up 209,000 on the month, indicated that second-quarter GDP in the US was at an annualised 4 per cent - and this suggested that the very low US growth seen in the first three months of the year was a blip. The market's main concern today will be with the US producer price data for May, which will probably determine the near term outlook for the US currency. Most dealers are expecting a monthly rise in the order of plus 0.1 per cent, well down from the April figure of plus 0.6 per cent. A higher figure might prompt the Fed to lean towards raising short-term interest rates, reducing the comparative premium for investors holding D-Marks. The dollar could also be affected today by the US retail sales figures for May. The market is expecting a 0.7 per cent rise on the month. But if the figure is weaker than this, it may make it harder for the Fed to justify a rate rise. Sterling yesterday held steadily against the D-Mark and the dollar, in spite of the increasing uncertainty surrounding the future of Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. For the last two days, dealers have shrugged off the attack launched on Mr Major by Mr Norman Lamont, his former chancellor. The pound closed unchanged at DM2.4825.</p>

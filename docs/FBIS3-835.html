They discussed Nigeria's border conflict  with Cameroon, the Liberian peace process, and the devaluation  of the CFA franc, and the economic and social consequences for  the West African subregion.    At a news conference after the talks, Babagana Kingibe said  the desire of the Nigerian Government is to seek accommodation  and reconciliation and to resolve the conflict with Cameroon  through dialogue. He said as part of efforts to find a peaceful  solution to the dispute, the two countries have been invited to  Cairo, Egypt, on Wednesday [16 March] by the OAU Conflict  Resolution Committee. Babagana Kingibe said Nigeria will  cooperate fully with the committee to see to a peaceful  resolution of the dispute. On Liberia, he expressed confidence  that things will go well with the peace process this time  because indications are that all the factions are eager to see  peace prevail in the country and will therefore adhere to the  Cotonou accord.    The deputy minister designate for foreign affairs, Dr.  Mohamed ibn Chambas, said the role of France in the dispute  between Nigeria and Cameroon is being viewed with concern by  Ghana. He said the French, by their action, are meddling in the  affairs of two sister African countries. They should,  therefore, leave the problems to Africans to solve.</p>

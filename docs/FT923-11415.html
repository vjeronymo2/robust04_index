			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Taunton closes 14p above offer price TAUNTON CIDER, the west country drinks group, yesterday joined a select band of recently-floated companies to begin trading at a premium to the offer price despite the general despondency hanging over the market. The shares opened at 145p and closed at 154p, a 14p premium to the offer price. Apart from Kenwood Appliances, the kitchen tool manufacturer which opened at a premium but has since fallen back to 278p, or a 7p discount, Taunton is the only recent publicly-offered flotation to rise from its offer price. Despite the relative failure of these issues, bankers and analysts have been at pains to stress that most of the flotations have hit their targets of reducing debt and gaining a public quotation. than They also stress that institutions have been prepared to pay prices that represent quite high earnings multiples, in the knowledge that they could be left with shares at the underwriting stage because of weak retail demand. Anglian Group, which perhaps suffered most from the weak market and perceptions that it was more closely linked to the building sector than may in fact be the case, sold at a 12.2 earnings multiple. Its shares are now trading at a 7p discount at 203p. Country Casuals was entirely placed at 130p, representing a 15.9 pro-forma earnings multiple. Its shares opened at 145p but had drifted back to 135p by yesterday. According to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, some Pounds 1.68bn has so far been raised in 1992 - double the same period last year excluding the electricity companies.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BEACH TOWEL IS ONE TO BEAT IN LI'L BROWN JUG  </P> <P> The trainer of Little Brown Jug favorite Beach Towel says looks can be  deceiving.  </P> <P> Gordon Remmer, a co-trainer of Beach Towel, on Wednesday said that to look at  his horse next to others you wouldn't see much of a difference.  </P> <P> But it is what is inside Beach Towel that sets him apart.  </P> <P> "He's got a will to win," Remmer said. "That's something you don't know when  you look at him, but he sure displays it on the race track."  </P> <P> Beach Towel is the heavy favorite going into today's 45th running of the Little  Brown Jug at the Delaware County Fairgrounds. The Jug is the third of pacing's  triple crown events.  </P> <P> Heavy rains caused the postponement of Grand Circuit racing on Sunday and again  Wednesday. But sunshine and mild temperatures are expected for the Jug. And  even a drizzle couldn't dampen Remmer's admiration for his horse.  </P> <P> "We consider him to be a once-in-a-lifetime horse," Remmer said.  </P> <P> The 22-horse field was narrowed in three eliminations. Beach Towel was  considered the horse to beat even before he drew the No. 2 post in the third  elimination, away from most of the other top contenders.  </P> <P> Chief among the challengers are In The Pocket, Global Assault, Road Machine and  Brando Hanover in the first elimination, Kiev Hanover and CKS in the second and  Scoot Outa Reach in the third.  </P></p>

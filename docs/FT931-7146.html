			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Ambulance inquiry criticises 'climate of mistrust' THE GOVERNMENT yesterday faced political embarrassment over a report cataloguing repeated examples of flawed management leading to the collapse of the London Ambulance Service's computer system. Mr Jim Harris, former marketing director of British Airways, resigned as chairman of the LAS board when the report, the result of an official inquiry, was published, and Labour MPs called on Mr Tom Sackville, the junior health minister responsible for the ambulance service, to join him in resigning. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has given health authority officials a month to produce arrangements for better accountability in the service. The report's severe criticisms of LAS management follow National Audit Office concern over inadequate financial controls in the West Midlands and Wessex regional health authorities. It will heighten debate over whether the new style of National Health Service management since the 1991 reforms is contributing to difficulties. London's computer despatch system, designed to locate and mobilise emergency ambulances automatically, collapsed soon after going into full-scale operation last October. It plunged the service into chaos although the report concludes that, on the basis of coroners' court conclusions, there is no evidence that late arrival of ambulances caused deaths. The collapse of the computer followed prolonged criticism of the LAS for failing to attend emergencies within official target times. The report attacks not only what it describes as the LAS management's high-risk strategy for introducing the computer system, but wider managerial issues in the service. It says efforts to revitalise the LAS between 1990-92 to meet the cultural changes of the NHS reforms 'actually worsened what was already a climate of mistrust and obstructiveness.' Management misjudged the industrial relations climate so that staff were alienated by changes rather than brought on board. It was announced yesterday that the LAS board and health authority officials had decided to terminate the contract of Mr John Wilby, the service's former chief executive, before the computer failure in October. But he pre-empted this by resigning. Mrs Bottomley said that while standards had improved since last autumn, other ambulance services provided a better service with fewer resources. At Westminster, she and Mr Sackville came under fierce attack from London Labour MPs, in particular for 'sweeping aside' earlier warnings that the service was in difficulty. They also condemned Mrs Bottomley for refusing to concede a management board of elected councillors. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the report was 'a damning indictment of government complacency, inaction and irresponsibility'. Chief bows to criticism, Page 11</p>

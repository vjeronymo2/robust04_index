			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Sergeyev report: "Voice Heeded"] </F>   [Text] Our economy is becoming increasingly fevered. In  the first quarter the production slump reached the record level  of 25 percent. The unstable internal political situation in  Russia and the deepening economic crisis, which could cause a  powerful social explosion this year, are giving rise to growing  Western concern. Political and business circles in the United  States, Germany, Japan, and other states are increasingly openly  voicing their opinion of the inability of the country's present  leadership to find a way out of the impasse without relying on  strong public organizations.    The Federation of Commodity Producers [FCP] has sent the  Russian Federation president proposals for taking measures  without delay to rescue Russian industrial and agricultural  production. The message makes a hard-hitting analysis of the  very grave situation in the Russian economy and sets forth  specific measures to organize a system of cooperation between  the FCP and the government with a view to working out and  implementing specific joint actions. B. Yeltsin has examined  the proposals and instructed V. Chernomyrdin to arrange  cooperation with the FCP for the purpose of overcoming the  disastrous drop in production and curbing the growth of  unemployment.    The FCP's practical activity in shaping new relations  between  commodity producers and the government and foreign partners is a  real step on the way to creating a self-organizing system of  economic relations. Russia will be unable to emerge from the  crisis without the painstaking, gradual building of working  market infrastructures and new relations in the economy. The  hopes of Ye. Gaydar and his supporters that an unrestrained  market will itself set everything to rights and that the economy  will start working efficiently have, as was to be expected,  proved a bluff. The transition to a civilized market is a  complex process which must be conducted sensibly and  systematically.    This FCP activity is meeting with increasing support from  Russian entrepreneurs, the corps of directors, and trade unions.  This is of considerable importance, since Yuriy Skokov has  declared his intention to run as a candidate in the 1996  presidential election and needs new supporters and broad  support. Today this cannot be achieved with fine promises alone  -- few people believe them anymore.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Hongkong Bank increases bid for Midland to Pounds 3.9bn HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation increased its bid for Midland Bank to Pounds 3.9bn yesterday, offering for the first time to pay shareholders partly in cash. Midland's rival suitor, Lloyds Bank, responded by hinting that it may improve its proposed terms, if it is cleared to bid by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr William Purves, HSBC chairman, said in Toronto his bank's new bid terms were 'definitely the final offer'. Although Hongkong Bank is free, under UK Takeover Panel rules, to renew its bid in the autumn if it does not succeed now, Mr Purves added: 'If Midland shareholders turn us down and choose to wait for the outcome of the Monopolies inquiry to see if Lloyds is allowed to bid, those shareholders should not assume that we will make another bid then.' For each 100 shares in Midland, shareholders are being offered 120 shares in the new Hongkong Bank Holding Company after the merger and either Pounds 65 of bonds or Pounds 65 in cash. The offer values each Midland share at 480p. Last night Midland closed at 452p, up 31p. The terms were welcomed by Midland and Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive, who said the bank would recommend shareholders accept the offer. Midland says it is increasingly worried about the effect on its business of a prolonged takeover battle. Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds chief executive, who was also in Toronto, at a meeting of the International Monetary Conference, said his board would be meeting on Friday. He hinted Lloyds was likely to offer. 'We will have to tell Midland's shareholders what our offer is worth now and what it could be worth later,' he said. However, last night Mr Pearse called on Lloyds to withdraw its proposed bid. Speaking on BBC Radio's Financial World Tonight, he said: 'Lloyds is now an irrelevancy. There is now no doubt in my mind that the chances of its succeeding on competition grounds in its bid for Midland are virtually nil. It would save us all a lot of irrelevant work if it withdraw.' In the City, some analysts said the new offer tipped the odds in favour of the Hongkong Bank bid succeeding. Shareholders remained undecided. One large institution said: 'Frankly we would much rather be shareholders in Lloyds Bank. The new Hongkong offer is quite rich and quite tempting but Lloyds is a natural holding for us and a more logical fit for us than a vague global bank.' Hongkong Bank has brought forward the acceptance date on its offer by nearly two weeks to June 25, giving shareholders little more than three weeks to decide whether to accept the offer or wait until the autumn in the hope that Lloyds will be cleared to launch its own bid. Hongkong Bank is now offering slightly more than Lloyds' proposed terms for each Midland share, but Lloyds is widely expected to raise its offer above 500p if it gets clearance. Hongkong Bank's original offer to Midland shareholders gave them 118 shares in the combined bank and Pounds 50 worth of bonds. valued each Midland share at 401p. One important feature of the new offer is that it makes Hongkong Bank bonds much more attractive to institutions by improving their yield from 1.6 per cent to 2.4 per cent above gilts and arranging for them to be underwritten by Credit Suisse First Boston, Schroders, Cazenove, and SG Warburg.

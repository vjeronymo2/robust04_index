			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Croats and Serbs fail to agree Krajina ceasefire The Croatian government and Serbs from the breakaway Croatian republic of Krajina yesterday failed to agree on a ceasefire which would start paving the way for an eventual peace treaty between Croatia and Serbia. Talks in the Russian embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, will continue today. They represent the highest level meeting for many months between the two sides, as well as the first attempt by the Russians to broker a ceasefire aimed at ending the three-year-old conflict between Serbs and Croats. The talks, hosted by Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, coincided with threats by Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, to use military force to assert control over Krajina. The Krajina Serbs, backed by the Yugoslav army in June 1991, waged a war of secession against Croatia's moves towards independence. The Serbian side called for Croatian troops to withdraw from Krajina, a swathe of territory which cuts across south-west Croatia. For its part, the Croatians insisted on asserting their authority over the region. Any substantial compromises, particularly by the Serbs would gradually lead to the gradual suspension of sanctions on Serbia. Mr John Mills, the UN spokesman, yesterday called the closed-door meetings 'detailed and purposeful'. But he warned of a 'growing impatience in the international community for solutions to be found in the regions'. Previous UN attempts to forge a settlement on the status of the Serbs in Croatia have failed. A ceasefire in January 1992, which called for the return of hundreds of thousands of refugees, was violated one year later when Croat forces pushed across UN lines.</p>

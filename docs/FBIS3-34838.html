The base identified as the wing base of the  terrorists and situated north of Trincomalee and to the west of  Nilaveli area was overrun and destroyed without much resistance  from the terrorists, according to a senior military officer in  the East. The terrorists put up a token resistance and withdrew  at the approach of our troops supported by the Air Force, the  officer said.    Several soldiers, including Special Forces personnel, were  involved in the offensive codenamed (Wale Sumana), named after  one of the giants in the army of Sri Lanka's ancient King  (Vettigamono), which was launched late last week amidst much  secrecy. The number of casualties incurred by the terrorists  before their withdrawal from the area was not known, but the  Army had a single casualty from an antipersonnel mine. Soldiers  recovered mines, about 100 kilos of explosives, food, and other  items from the terrorist base which comprised about 15 bunkers,  10 huts, a lecture room, a (?sewing) center, stores, and a  dental clinic. (Wale Sumana) is the first major combined  offensive to be launched by the security forces since the  assuming of command by the Army commander, Lieutenant General  Gerry de Silva, and also the first in 1994.</p>

This was announced by  Tarmo Melder, adviser to Estonia's minister of defense.  According to him, the first, test batch should come off the  assembly line at the beginning of March. The adviser did not  name the manufacturing plant, stating that the ministry of  defense and the main staff are engaged in talks with several  enterprises.    There are also counterproposals, however. The Arbadet  joint-stock company, one of the co-owners of the Kaitseliit  Fund, located in the city of Turi has provided its services  to the ministry of defense. It has been learned from  well-informed sources that the Tarkon state joint-stock company  (formerly the Tartu Radio Equipment Plant) is also prepared to  produce cartridges, as is the (Baliyes) enterprise (the former  Baltiyets plant) in Narva.    The cartridge boom certainly did not just happen. On 3  February Estonia signed the Partnership for Peace program, which  apparently can absolutely not be implemented without NATO-model  cartridges; particularly since the Israeli company Taas Israel  Industries Ltd. recently provided Estonia with modern weapons  conforming to NATO standards. The first ship from Israel  delivered to the republic Galil assault rifles, (Nechev) machine  guns, (Miniuem) submachine guns, sniper rifles, grenade  launchers, 81mm mortars, 106mm guns, antiaircraft guns,  missiles, guided projectiles and ammunition.    These weapons are sufficient for the republic to arm 12,000  men.</p>

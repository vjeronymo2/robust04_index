			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swedish construction groups rise sharply SKANSKA and NCC, the two leading Swedish construction and real estate groups, yesterday reported sharply improved first-half figures. However, they relied on gains from divestments and the absence of write-downs to compensate for the continued deterioration in market conditions. The companies predicted they would make a profit before property write-downs for the full year, although Skanska took the gloss off its forecast of a SKr2.2bn (Dollars 272m) profit by saying it was set to make further 'substantial' write-downs again this year. Both groups made big losses in 1992 because of huge property write-downs. Skanska saw first-half pre-tax profits rise to SKr1.38bn from SKr813m, while NCC returned a SKr304m profit, against a SKr7m loss for the same 1992 period. Skanska recorded capital gains from divestments of SKr366m and NCC gains of SKr476m. The continuing downturn in the Swedish construction market was largely responsible for cutting Skanska's first-half revenues to SKr14.0bn from SKr15.2bn and for its prediction of a 12 per cent fall in full-year revenues to SKr28.2bn. However, the group's operating profit before financial items rose to SK1.50bn from SKr1.30bn, and its performance benefited further from a reduction in financial costs to SKr128m from SKr488m. Full-year financial expenses should be SKr1bn less than last year at around SKr700m. The group said real estate markets in Sweden, Europe and the US remained weak. Reduced Swedish building activity also explained the drop in NCC's revenues to SKr8.6bn from SKr10.4bn. Profits in the group's main unit, NCC Bygg, fell to SKr288m from SKr378m. Excluding capital gains and losses from associated companies, the group made a SKr108m first-half loss, compared with a SKr218m profit.</p>

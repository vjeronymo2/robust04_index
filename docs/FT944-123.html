			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Battling Stanhope expects verdict on future in 'days' Stanhope, the embattled property developer struggling to cope with its banks' decision not to extend its credit facilities, has announced that a decision on its future will be made within the next few days as intense negotiations with creditors and potential rescuers continue. At the group's AGM yesterday, Mr Stanley Honeyman, chairman, said: 'The current position with our banks is that discussions are continuing and we expect to make an announcement next week.' 'At the same time we are still in intensive negotiations with investors.' Stanhope's banks are owed approximately Pounds 148m. They withdrew their support on December 23 after protracted negotiations broke down. Two separate rescue plans - one by PosTel, the investment group, and British Land, which has a 30 per cent stake in Stanhope - were discussed. But they were rejected by the banks, which were not prepared to write off more than 20p in the pound as demanded by the proposals. Since then, Stanhope has been operating without credit facilities, although the banks are said to be sympathetic while talks are continuing. In particular, negotiations between Stanhope and British Land have been resumed. Mr Stuart Lipton, founder and chief executive of Stanhope, said yesterday that the board was also talking to other investors, which may suggest that the PosTel deal could also be revived. 'We are still talking to both banks and investors and while these continue we are still in business,' he said. Stanhope's chief asset is its 50 per cent holding in Broadgate Properties, which controls much of the Broadgate and Ludgate office developments in the City of London. Mr Honeyman said that, given the group's precarious circumstances, the board was postponing publication of the 1994 report and accounts, due out next week.</p>

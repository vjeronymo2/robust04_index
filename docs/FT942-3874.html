			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (13): Kompan's playgrounds in demand Hans Mogens Frederiksen and Tom Lindhardt Wils were men with a mission when they founded Kompan in Denmark in 1970. Rejecting the concrete bleakness of the 1960s children's outdoor playground, they demanded colour, excitement and play value. They were clearly on to something. Kompan is now the world's leading producer of playground equipment with an annual turnover of DKr500m, 90 per cent of which is exported through sales to 40 countries. Strong bright colours and bold clear shapes make its equipment instantly recognisable. And the accolades have come flooding in, culminating in one of the 1994 EC Design Prizes. Flemming Aggergaard, managing director of Kompan International, emphasises that design has been 'fundamental' to the company's success. He says the challenge is to link the aesthetic and fun with the stimulating and educational - while ensuring that 'look' is never promoted above safety. Safety, play value and quality are the watchwords. Kompan looks at the world with a child's eye. 'We try to understand what happens when children play. We work to find products which further their intellectual and social needs,' says Aggergaard. Child education experts have been involved in product development from the start. The emphasis is on primary colours and organic shapes. Much of the equipment is spring-loaded and as much as possible is made from wood. But he is conscious of the competitive threats - manufacturing barriers to entry are low and the group's products are expensive. Hence the stress on 'concept' as much as 'product' and the attention given to the whole chain of activity from planning to after-sales service. The group even helps to arrange insurance - a big item in markets such as the US. Kompan has done more than simply transform the look of playgrounds and shift emphasis from physical prowess to social interaction. Aggergaard notes approvingly the subtle shift in customers' attitudes from 'what can we get for the kids' to 'what would be good for the kids.' Kompan's important selling tools are its child development seminars. The aim, says Aggergaard, is to 'explain to customers why we are doing things as we are.'</p>

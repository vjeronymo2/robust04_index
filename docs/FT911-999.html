			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Arts: Hanover Band - Queen Elizabeth Hall Even in Salzburg the advance of period performance practice is proving inexorable. It has been the custom in the city since the 1930s to give an annual performance of Mozart's C Minor Mass in St Peter's and the local press was apparently struck by the clarity and expressiveness that John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir brought to the same music in comparison when they turned up with it earlier this year. In London it is almost de rigeur to perform this work on period instruments now. Gardiner himself gave a single performance of it at the start of the year, prior to setting out for Salzburg, and he was followed on Tuesday by Roy Goodman and the Hanover Band. It would be interesting to know what Salzburg thinks of them, as their music-making has even less inclination to make Mozart sound like he traditionally used to. The awkwardnesses of using period instruments were easy to hear. Wind intonation was often sour; the orchestral balance was as it comes. Goodman does not often intervene to right inequalities or impose his own ideas. In some ways a less obviously 'interpreted' approach to 18th-century music like this is welcome; but when Gardiner conducted the Mass, it was clear that we were in the presence of a blinding masterpiece, and here it was not. The vocal parts, solo and choral, were very respectably taken. In the 'Domine Deus' there were two well-contrasted sopranos, Lynne Dawson shining bright, Anne Dawson more mature and rounded of voice. The 'Et incarnatus', taken by the former, went with no lingering or sentimentality (and no trills). The Hanover Band Chorus showed itself no less to be a useful small choir. But the performance was rarely moving in the way that Gardiner's had been. In the first half Goodman and the orchestra warmed up on Haydn's Symphony No 102, a taster of the complete cycle of Haydn symphonies that they are recording for Hyperion. Again there were doubtful moments of balance, when the strings were lost from view, but the performance had vitality and fun. The minuet was taken at Czerny's recommended metronome marking, which shows that Beethoven is not the only one to have handed down to us speeds long deemed to be impossibly fast.</p>

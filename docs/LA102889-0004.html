			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS TOUCH ALL BASES ON TOUCHY ISSUE  </P> <P> What a glaring difference between the two columns the day after the earthquake.  Jim Murray's was measured, compassionate and insightful. Mike Downey's  hysterical and posturing. He writes: "Why the gods chose to strike down . . ."  "Ours is not to reason why?" This guy would make Grantland Rice blush.  </P> <P> Then Downey called for the World Series to be canceled. Nonsense. Human beings  have a magnificent ability not only to survive but to prevail. The games will  do more for morale than a million pious mumblings in newspaper columns.  </P> <P> ED HONECK, Orange  </P></p>

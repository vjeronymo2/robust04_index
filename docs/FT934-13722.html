			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Interacting with the full Spectrum - Former Apple head John Sculley's surprise move MR JOHN Sculley's move from Apple Computer to Spectrum Information Technologies has perplexed many observers. Why should a man who could have his pick of jobs in the emerging world of digital interactive media, choose Spectrum, a Dollars 100m revenue company that has lost money for the past five years? 'I looked at a whole bunch of opportunities over the past few months, everything from running major corporations to various derivative businesses in interactive television,' Mr Sculley says. 'But I had little interest in running a major corporation. I have already done that a couple of times' - at PepsiCo and Apple. 'My real interest, having been bitten by the bug of Silicon Valley, was in doing something very entrepreneurial, where I had a chance for significant wealth creation.' He was drawn to Spectrum by its patented technology that enables wireless data communication, via cellular networks, linking portable computers and personal digital assistants, such as Newton, his pet project at Apple. He describes excitedly the first time he saw Spectrum's cellular modem technology operating, four weeks ago in his new Connecticut home; sending messages, via a cellular telephone from his Apple Newton to a fax machine. 'Suddenly I realised all the things that we talked about with Newton, about mobile communications, but had not been able to deliver at the product launch in August, were now possible.' But Mr Sculley claims 'zero credit' for discovering Spectrum. 'I stumbled on to it. I'm almost embarrassed to explain,' he says. 'Mr Peter Caserta (Spectrum chief executive before Sculley's appointment on Monday) had been trying to get in touch with me for months.' The Spectrum executive finally prevailed upon his next door neighbour, a former PepsiCo employee who knew Mr Sculley, to place a call. Mr Sculley reluctantly agreed to meet with Mr Caserta as a favour to his friend. A one-hour meeting turned into a five-hour session, Mr Sculley recalls, 'and the more I heard, the more interested I became.' But still he had no thoughts of joining Spectrum, nor did the company have any ambitions to hire one of the best-known executives in the industry. Only after Mr Sculley resigned from Apple, last Wednesday, did he begin negotiations about joining Spectrum. He set about a thorough examination of its business, hired a team of engineers to assess its technology and attorneys to examine its patent claims, worked out an employment contract and finally, on Sunday night, signed an agreement to join Spectrum as chairman and chief executive. Mr Sculley has acquired rights to take a significant equity stake in Spectrum, through stock options, but declined to give details. Both Mr Sculley and Mr Caserta, now vice-chairman of Spectrum, talked on Monday of building Spectrum into a company with the clout of Intel and Microsoft, two of the most powerful companies in the computer industry. Both are reluctant to discuss Spectrum's past business dealings, but Mr Sculley sees Spectrum as a 'gem of a company'. If so, say other computer industry executives, it is a diamond in the rough, lacking the polish that might be expected of a company with which Mr Sculley would associate himself. In May, Spectrum announced a technology licensing agreement with AT&amp;T and claimed that it would make 'hundreds of millions of dollars' from the deal. Its stock soared Dollars 9 to Dollars 13 1/8 in a few days. But when AT&amp;T said it expected to pay Spectrum only 'a few million dollars over three or four years,' the stock plummeted to Dollars 4. Shareholder lawsuits are pending. This and other controversies surrounding technology licensing agreements, Spectrum's acquisition last year of a chain of computer stores and disputes over its patent claims have earned it a mixed reputation. Spectrum has lost money for the past five years. On Monday, however, its shares leaped from Dollars 7 5/8 to Dollars 11 1/8 on news of Mr Sculley's arrival. But none of this seems to worry Mr Sculley. 'I've satisfied myself that I'm comfortable attaching my reputation to this,' he says. 'The draw for me is a chance to be able to help a company, much as I did when I went to Apple 10 years ago,' he says. 'The model I was looking for, my ideal, was to do something like Barry Diller did with QVC, the television shopping channel, a year ago. He found a small company that nobody had noticed. When he joined up he got an equity position in the company and a lot of people started looking at it and saw its potential.' 'The world will have to decide whether Spectrum is equivalent to that. But Spectrum has a lot of things that were on my list of criteria.' In particular, Mr Sculley says he was looking for a company that could profit from the convergence of computer, communications and consumer electronics technologies. 'I felt that if I could get a company that was small but had cash on its balance sheet - Spectrum has Dollars 20m  - we could begin to move into acquisitions, alliances and relationships. I know most of the heads of the major telecommunications companies around the world and can open doors for Spectrum.' After his first day at the helm, Mr Sculley had set priorities: improving relations with licensors of Spectrum's technology and planning new licensees. 'I haven't been this excited since I joined Apple 10 years ago,' he says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "E.W.:" "Popiwek Until Year's End? Senate Adopted </F> a Law on Regulation of Salaries"]    [Text] On 5 May the Senate adopted a neopopiwek [tax  on excessive wage increases] law, with 51 votes in favor, 14  against, and eight abstentions. In the only amendment  submitted, the senators made the reservation that the law  approved by them is to be in force until the end of the year.  The document will go back to the Sejm, which must debate the  amendment, and then it will wait for the president's signature.  The law can become effective on the first day of the month  following the month in which the law is announced.    The senators rejected a motion by Senator Zbigniew  Romaszewski of "Solidarity" to completely reject the law, and  they decided to refuse to accept an amendment submitted by  Senator Piotr Andrzejewski which would have limited the law's  scope to independent shaping of salaries by all economic units.    The law (similar to an earlier governmental document)  provides that those enterprises that exceed the allowed salary  limit will be penalized by a so-called sanction payment, which  will be 1.5 zlotys for each zloty paid out above the norm. The  payments will be directed to the state budget, with enterprises  which send at least part of their production abroad, being given  breaks. The law covers all state-owned and communal  enterprises, state-owned banks, and companies where the State  Treasury has no less than 80 percent of the shares. On the  other hand, popiwek does not cover private enterprises or banks,  firms with participation of foreign capital, or cultural  institutions and convalescent homes.    Based on the law, enterprises will be able to select one of  the following four methods of shaping salaries: a managerial  contract, an agreement with a local State Treasury Chamber, a  limit dependent on the previous year's profit-salary ratio in  the enterprise, or salaries determined by a trilateral  commission.</p>

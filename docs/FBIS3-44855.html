			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, January 10 (XINHUA) -- The Government of  Hong Kong [HK] has decided to reduce the total money of the day  (MOD) estimate for the key projects of the on-construction new  airport by 5.5 billion HK dollars (705 million U.S. dollars), a  government spokesman announced here today.    The cost will be reduced from 163.7 billion HK dollars (20.9  billion U.S. dollars) to 158.2 billion HK dollars (20.2 billion  U.S. dollars) due to the significant savings on the seven  government key projects, which lowered by 7.6 billion HK dollars  (974 million U.S. dollars) in the total amount of cost.    The cost-reduction has been made possible mainly by savings  stemming from highly competitive tendering on a very  cost-effective program, the spokesman said.    The local government has awarded 34 contracts worth a total  of about 31.4 billion HK dollars (four billion U.S. dollars),  representing 78 percent by value of the total government key  projects. They have all been let below budget and are  progressing well, he said.    However, the spokesman added, the real cost estimates,  released in March 1991 prices, for the new airport at Chek Lap  Kok and for the airport railway are unchanged because slight  increases have been necessary for the cost borne by the  provisional airport authorities and for the airport railway.</p>

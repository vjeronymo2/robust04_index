			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: LEARN TO STOCK THE KITCHEN FOR POWER OUTAGES  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Every year when winter is fast approaching, I stock up on certain  non-perishable food items I know will withstand power outages during storms.  </P> <P> All of these foods can be prepared quickly, with only a few needing water  added. My list includes canned fish, corned beef, chicken, vegetables, fruits,  milk, prepared chili and soups; also non-refrigerated cheese spreads, peanut  butter, dry and instant cereals, crackers, dried fruit, tomato juice, dry  powdered milk, bottled water, instant tea and coffee.  </P> <P> With these foods in my pantry and my propane camping stove (in case of power  outage), I feel I am prepared.  </P> <P>  -- J. S., Minot, N.D.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: After grocery shopping, I unwrap the fresh meats and re-wrap them  in freezer paper. I then cut the label off the original packaging and tape it  to the newly wrapped package. The label contains all the information needed  such as the type of meat, date of purchase and weight. No more guessing at how  much meat there is in a package.  </P> <P>  -- CHARLOTTE, Winston-Salem, N.C.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: The other day I was in the middle of mixing cake batter when I  discovered I had only one egg and the recipe called for two. After checking my  cookbook substitutions, I found that I could add two tablespoons of mayonnaise  to the cake batter as a substitute for the missing egg.  </P> <P> The cake turned out great and my husband said he could not taste any  difference.  </P> <P>  -- MARY, Canton, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I use oil and grease for frying, and to tell if the oil is hot  enough I just drop a kernel of popcorn in it. If the popcorn pops, then I know  that the oil is hot enough and I can commence frying the food I desire.  </P> <P>  -- FREDERICK, Arlington, Va.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: The other morning after pouring myself a cup of coffee I realized  I didn't have any cream. I started searching the cabinets for a substitute and  found a can of condensed milk that I thought I would give a try. I added a  spoonful and it was delicious. It was both cream and sugar.  </P> <P>  -- A READER, Columbus, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I tear out items from magazines I would never get around to  reading them. Many times I misplaced them or finally threw them away.  </P> <P> Now whenever I tear out a diet or food tip I put it on the front of the  refrigerator. If I tear out a makeup or bathing tip I tape it to the inside of  my medicine cabinet.  </P> <P>  -- MARTHA, Bulverde, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have four children and they are constantly in the refrigerator  for a needed item and it wouldn't be there because one of them had eaten it.  </P> <P> To alleviate this nuisance, I went to a discount store and bought some little  stickers in green and red. Now when I place an item in the refrigerator, I  place a sticker on it--red means do not eat and green means it's OK to eat.  This solved my problem.  </P> <P> --CELIA, Miami, Fla.  </P></p>

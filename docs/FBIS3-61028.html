			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Nikolay Filippenko, GlavKEU deputy </F> chief, Russian Federation, by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent  Yuriy Viktorov: "Apartment Exchange: A Headache for the  Military"; date and place not given]    [Text] Colonel Nikolay Filippenko, deputy chief of the  GlavKEU [Main Billeting and Maintenance Directorate], Russian  Federation Ministry of Defense, answers questions put to him by  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent.    [Viktorov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, if you do not mind, may we  start our discussion by considering a real-life situation, one  in which reader Nataliya Ivanovna Shustova finds herself. "A  disease of the spinal cord has reduced me to group 2  disability," she writes. "It is difficult for me to move around.  There even is no way for me to catch a breath of fresh air,  since my apartment is located on the first floor, and, this  being the case, there is no balcony. My husband, who is in  military service, has submitted a request for exchanging our  apartment for a similar one, but with a balcony. The housing  commission turned down the request. I find it most unpleasant to  face another winter of taking my walks at the window."    What kind of advice to give our reader? Her situation is  indeed unusual.    [Filippenko] Following the letter of the law, based on what  she writes, there are really no grounds for an exchange, since  Nataliya Ivanovna's family is indeed provided with housing.  However, in this case we do not wish to act like formalists.  Therefore, in my view, the garrison's military authorities  should start looking for some kind of other housing for the  Shustovs. This is the humanitarian thing to do.    [Viktorov] It is not my place to tell you that there is  quite  a number of situations similar to the one above throughout the  Armed Forces. It may be a case of someone's being transferred to  a new duty station, or a matter of a person's health not  permitting him to reside in a particular area. And the number of  housing exchange problems caused by withdrawal of our troops  from neighboring countries! What do you think about the  resulting situation?    [Filippenko] The exchange situation is extremely difficult.  The primary cause is that the Ministry of Defense lacks (and  never did have) an agency charged with the mission of exchanging  housing for servicemen. This holds true for the CIS, Russia, and  even the capital garrison. As a rule, all servicemen effect an  exchange independently, via local offices; in Moscow, for  example, they turn to Moszhilservis.    Nonetheless, reality steps into the picture to force  involvement of GlavKEU, especially in the event there is a need  for the Russian side to effect a resolution with a neighboring  country in this kind of matter. In this case, we communicate our  concurrence to the deputy commander or to the chief of the KEU  [billeting and maintenance directorate] of the particular  military district. Please do not consider this to be something  ostentatious on our part; it is simply a case of people's  interests transcending everything else. We try to do our part,  regardless of how difficult a situation may be.    [Viktorov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, is there a legal basis for  exchanging servicemen's apartments within the framework of the  former USSR?    [Filippenko] Yes. In accordance with an agreement reached in  February of last year in Minsk, exchange within the framework of  the CIS is guided by the same rules in effect prior to the  dissolution of the Union.    [Viktorov] How does this pertain to persons who have  remained  in the Baltics?    [Filippenko] A special provision covers that. In essence,  the  Baltics are to be considered distant countries, with whom  housing exchange will be generally impossible after the  interstate agreements are completed. There actually is no such  exchange at present, even though many servicemen and pensioners  wish to return to Russia. On the other hand, there are virtually  no persons wishing to settle in the Baltic countries. Take the  case of Latvia. Even persons of native birth arriving from  Russia to take up residence there are not being granted  citizenship. Who wants to be a second-class person? That is why  no one is settling there.    [Viktorov] If exchange of housing is impossible, could there  be some other arrangement, such as selling?    [Filippov] The last round of negotiations held with the  Latvian side on 15-17 October produced a preliminary agreement  whereby military pensioners would be granted the right to either  sell their housing at auction or receive a guarantee of  compensation for their housing. However, information I have in  my possession indicates that, for some reason, doubt has been  cast over this agreement. We will attempt to clear up this issue  in negotiations.    The situation is about the same in Estonia.    Much simpler is the situation in Lithuania. There it is  permitted to privatize housing, and many servicemen in units  being withdrawn from the area have taken advantage of the  opportunity by privatizing their apartments and then selling  them. Some military retirees have acted in the same manner.    [Viktorov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, what about the "hot spots"?    [Filippov] Let us start with Tajikistan. In essence, we have  the 201st Motorized Rifle Division left there. An order issued  by the Ministry of Defense has rendered the division's officers  and warrant officers eligible for housing in Russian cities.    As far as members of the Group of Russian Forces in the  Transcaucasus is concerned, construction and acquisition of  housing for them and for members of the SKVO [North Caucasus  Military District] and other areas of Russia has already been  initiated. In 1992 and 1993, 976 apartments for the GRVZ [Group  of Russian Forces in the Transcaucasus] were acquired on Russian  soil. Plans call for acquiring 150 additional apartments by the  end of this year.    [Viktorov] That pertains to service personnel. There are  quite a few Ministry of Defense retirees, former SA [Soviet  Army] laborers and white collar personnel in those "hot spots."  What about them?    [Filippov] Believe me, we take the problems of that category  of person to heart as well. It is difficult to expect a rapid  solution to those problems, of course, due to the lean military  budget. Nonetheless, we are not running away from a search for  solutions to this most difficult situation.    [Viktorov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, the mail received by the  editors suggests another question we put to you -- that of the  so-called closed military installations. What is to happen to  those people who have completed their service and have lost  contact with the Ministry of Defense but who would like to leave  those bases?    [Filippov] An order issued way back by the Union government  called for their resettlement in housing to be made available by  local organs of authority. The process is under way, after a  fashion, at a pace that is extremely unsatisfactory. It is  sufficient to say that with last year's requirement for 52,700  apartments, local soviets provided the Ministry of Defense with  only 144. The figures for this year are, respectively, 59,057  and 332.    There is a proposal for permitting exchange of this kind of  housing. This is generally not a good solution, since who would  wish to take the place vacated by a retiree in a closed military  installation?    It happens that additional "punishment" is heaped upon  persons residing on the above installations, in that an  installation is not really closed, but merely enjoying such  status by declaration of the base's military authorities. This  kind of act on the part of commanders may be easily explained:  They fear that new persons will be sent in to occupy the vacated  housing. Nonetheless, it should be understood that there is no  excuse for violating the law, even though intentions may be  good. We maintain a list of closed installations approved for  the districts. In the event we receive a complaint regarding  illegal acts on the part of officials, such as hindrance of  apartment privatization, that is when we step in.    Action can be taken at the local level by appealing to the  district deputy commander for construction and troop billeting.  In the event a serviceman is not satisfied, he can take the case  to court.    [Viktorov] Do you see a major solution?    [Filippov] The problem of housing in closed military  installations must be resolved in a fundamentally new manner.  Being worked out presently is an in-service, the "regimental,"  approach. For example, assume that a unit's table of  organization is such that 500 apartments are required. They are  built, and they belong to the unit and to none other. Further  assume that a man completes his active duty and is to depart. To  go where? To his own apartment, one a lieutenant starts to build  beginning with his first day of duty. To work toward this end, a  certain amount of money is deducted from his pay during all the  years of his active duty and placed into a bank account. The  necessary amount of money is accumulated in 20 to 25 years, with  bank interest added.    Two or 3 years before leaving the service, the serviceman  designates the city in which he wishes to settle. The bank  transmits to that city the particular sum of money for  application to the housing construction. The military quarters  thus vacated now become available for a new person joining the  unit.    For this purpose, we wish to organize a special bank, with a  military insurance company involved. The arrangement is being  worked out with the apparatus of First Deputy Minister A.  Kokoshin, the Combined Committee of Apartment-Seeking Servicemen  of the Moscow Garrison, and the Military Insurance Company.    It will require time, of course, to effect a fundamental  change, to dispense forever with the housing distribution  system; that is, to do the same as the rest of the civilized  world. It should be understood that the plan can be possible  only in the presence of economic and political stability in  society.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 4 ITAR-TASS -- The archival documents  containing records indicating that the father of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party of  Russia, was a Jew, "were fabricated by the special services of  Kazakhstan, probably on personal instructions from Nursultan  Nazarbayev". This was announced by LDPR press secretary  Grigoriy Serebrennikov in response to ITAR-TASS request to  comment on the report of the ASSOCIATED PRESS news agency.    According to AP, Zhirinovskiy appealed to the Alma city  executive committee for a change of his original surname of  Eidelstein and was permitted to assume his present surname in  June of 1964.    "Vladimir Volfovich's enemies cannot rest in peace. This  time they launched a lie about Zhirinovskiy's bearing the  surname of Eidelstein until the age of eighteen, and that,  consequently, he is a half-Jew. As evidence, an archival record  is cited, which must have been concocted by the special services  of Kazakhstan, maybe on personal instructions from Nazarbayev  who recently did not allow Zhirinovskiy to come to Almaty to  attend the burial of his aunt," Serebrennikov said.    Any person who is versed in Russian law in the least knows  that first of all, to change one's name one must submit a  request in writing. No one has a copy of such a request  because they do not know whose handwriting to forge,  Serebrennikov said. Secondly, every Soviet citizen is obliged  to receive a Soviet passport at the age of 16. Consequently, if  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy changed his surname after graduating from  school, when was eighteen, he was obliged to get a new passport.  No archival records of a new passport have been found  anywhere," he stressed.    "In the circulated Xerox copies of a record in the register  of civil status in Almaty there are many discrepancies. For  instance, a wrong address is indicated. And in the so-called  archival reference, the year of birth is wrong".    The press secretary of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said the main  evidence of the falseness of the document was the fact that  "three days before the alleged change of name, Zhirinovskiy  arrived in Moscow to enter a higher school."</p>

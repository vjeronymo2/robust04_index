"In essence, Croatia and Ukraine  were one state 80 years ago, noted Onesin Cvitan, ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Croatia to Ukraine.  "Friendly links connected our countries during the time of  Soviet power. I hope that Ukrainian-Croatian cooperation will  grow stronger and reach a qualitatively new level by the end of  the 20th Century." Valentyn Lipatov, deputy minister of foreign  affairs of Ukraine, who took part in the signing of the document  from the Ukrainian side, supported this opinion too. He  emphasized: "The agreement between our countries on a visa-free  entry procedure extends the possibilities of Ukrainian-Croatian  cooperation in the area of trade links, exchanges of tourist  delegations, and so on."    The ceremonial opening of Croatia's embassy and trade  mission  in Ukraine will take place in Kiev today.</p>

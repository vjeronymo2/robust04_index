			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MY BEST RECIPE: FRESH CLAMS OVER RICE A MEXICAN FAVORITE THAT'S SOLID MAIN DISH  </P> <P> "Tito Higuera de Davis in Loreto, Mexico, served me the following dish and I  pressed her for the recipe, which she says is a regional dish," Burt Sauer  writes. "She used huge fresh clams, known locally as callos, that are found in  shallow water around the nearby island of Catalina. Any chopped clam, conch or  mussel can be used, but I use canned minced clams as an economical substitute  that I can always have ready for a delicious main dish on short notice."  </P> <P> ARROZ CON CALLOS DE CATALINA  </P> <P> 1/2 pint fresh clams or 2 (6 1/2-ounce) cans minced clams (reserve juice)  </P> <P> Reserved clam juice  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste  </P> <P> Black pepper  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro or to taste  </P> <P> 1 Anaheim or jalapeno chile, roasted, peeled, seeded and diced  </P> <P> 1 tomato, chopped  </P> <P> 1 onion, chopped  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules  </P> <P> 2/3 cup long-grain rice, washed and drained  </P> <P> Chop clams, reserving juice. Add water to clam juice to make 1 cup liquid. Pour  liquid into 1 1/2-quart or 2-quart saucepan. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add  garlic, cilantro, diced chile, tomato and onion. Bring to boil over high heat  and add chicken bouillon concentrate. Simmer until vegetables are tender. Stir  in rice and bring to boil once more. Stir in clams.  </P> <P> Cover tightly and simmer 20 minutes or until rice is done and fluffy, with all  moisture absorbed. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P>  -- BURT SAUER  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Times pays $10 for readers' recipes published.

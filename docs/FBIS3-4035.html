Dr Philip Cheng Hui-ho returned to the territory last  night after having been kept in China for seven months in  relation to an investment dispute with his Chinese partners.    A Chinese American, Dr Cheng said yesterday he wanted to  clear his name with the Hunan court for detaining him for six  days under horrid conditions and withholding his passport until  last Tuesday [22 March]. Dr Cheng, 62, head of the Journalism  and Communications Department of the Chinese University of Hong  Kong before he went into business in 1991, said he would sue the  Hunan court for "illegal detention" for the sake of improving  China's judiciary system.    Dr Cheng said he would seek legal advice in Hong Kong before  pursuing the case in China. "My case is a cumbersome one, but I  think a legal issue is at stake. I will pursue it through legal  proceedings," he said.    His wife Marie said yesterday the fact the authorities had  allowed her husband to leave the country did not mean the case  was finished. "The authorities have been wrong in this case,"  said Mrs Cheng, adding it was the couple's "legal right" to seek  justice. Dr Cheng said he would pursue the battle until justice  was done. "I hope I can do something for the (legal) system. I  hope my case would make people aware of the problem." he said.    Dr Cheng is chairman of Zhuhai Golex, a bicycle-helmet  factory in Zhuhai. The company was in partnership with a  mainland company the Hunan Arts and Crafts Import and Export  Company. Dr Cheng's nightmare started last August as he was  re-negotiating a business deal with his mainland partner in a  hotel room in Changsha. Court security guards burst into the  room and arrested him. His mainland partner accused him of  misappropriating funds and demanded his investment of US$165,000  (HK$1,273,000) back.    During a three-day interrogation in a guest house which  doubled as a detention centre, Dr Cheng was told to return the  sum immediately or face a jail term. His family said Dr Cheng  was interrogated for three days and nights by as many as a dozen  officials in a detention centre run by the brother-in-law of Dr  Cheng's business partner. Dr Cheng, who is diabetic, was denied  sleep and fainted repeatedly, according to his family.    He was released on September 1, six days after his arrest  but  was told not to leave Changsha. The US Embassy in Beijing  intervened on his behalf and Dr Cheng was allowed last October  to leave Changsha for Zhuhai, where his factory is located. Dr  Cheng said at one point he was told his passport would be  returned to him on condition he was to "forget all about the  months of ordeal" and pledge not to take legal action against  the authorities. He refused to take up the offer.    Last Friday [18 March], the Intermediary Court of Hunan came  to the conclusion that the Hong Kong businessman "had been  wrongly arrested". Dr Cheng said his passport was returned to  him on Tuesday after a civil court in Hunan had examined other  evidence.    The American citizen admitted that he was able to get back  the passport because of guanxi, a special relationship with the  authorities. Sounding cheerful yesterday, Dr Cheng said, "I  feel great. Finally I am free and can be back home."</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Nordic threat to EC moves on oil drilling A NORDIC alliance of Norwegians and Danes is threatening to postpone approval of European Community measures to increase competition in North Sea oil and gas exploration and drilling. The meeting of 12 EC energy ministers in Brussels today could become the first council to bow to objections to Community legislation raised by a member of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which includes Norway. Norway has had no direct part in negotiations on the EC directive and will not be represented at the meeting. But some EC countries are worried that Norway and the six other Efta countries could try to veto the EC legislation next year under the terms of the European Economic Area (EEA), the 19-nation free trade zone which comes into force on January 1. Germany, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands have suggested a three- or four-month delay to win over the Norwegians. But Britain, which holds the EC presidency, will press for political agreement on the substance of the measure today. Denmark, like Norway, has fundamental objections to the directive, because it would outlaw discrimination against applicants for drilling or exploration licences on grounds of nationality. Norway wants to continue to give Statoil, the state company, 50 per cent of every licence granted, while Denmark's state-owned group, Dansk Olie og Naturgaz, currently has an automatic right to be included in any licence. Denmark could be outvoted, but influential Danish opposition parties want their minister to use the 'Luxembourg compromise' veto on grounds of overriding national interest if a deal seems likely. Mr Ove Fich, energy spokesman of the opposition Social Democratic party, said: 'This is more important for Denmark than the Gatt accord is for France.' Natural resources companies are also worried that the legislation might affect long-running licences for exploration and drilling, although British officials claim that existing licences will be safeguarded. Ministers are also set to discuss controversial plans for liberalisation of gas and electricity networks. But Britain, the strongest supporter, is not going to push for a decision.</p>

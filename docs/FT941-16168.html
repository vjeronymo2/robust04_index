			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Clinton in Europe: Serbs continue to express resistance to west's demands Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday rejected a Nato call for the opening of the airport in Tuzla, the biggest stronghold of the Moslem-led Bosnian government outside the capital Sarajevo. At the same time, however, Mr Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state, said he expected that Serb forces would comply with the Nato demand to allow the rotation of Canadian United Nations troops stranded in Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave. In a telephone interview, Mr Koljevic said: 'We have always rejected the opening of the Tuzla airport,' adding that his government would refuse to discuss the matter until an overall peace agreement was signed. Bosnian Serb chiefs are against the opening of Tuzla airport, vital to the survival of the government enclave inhabited by some 380,000 people, on the grounds that their Moslem rivals would use the airfield to smuggle weapons. Serb forces have blocked off multi-ethnic Tuzla, a key urban centre where much of the industry is still intact, since the outbreak of war. Croat troops have banned all commercial traffic to the city. Privately, UN officials on the ground feared that the Nato communique would fail to stop the conditions in the UN 'safe areas' from deteriorating. 'It is just sabre-rattling,' said a seasoned UN worker. Stressing the importance of air links, UN officials pointed out that the airport in Sarajevo helped keep alive the city's 380,000 trapped inhabitants. 'The Sarajevo airport on many occasions is the main route in,' said Miss Lyndall Sachs, spokeswoman of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. She said the eastern enclave of Srebrenica had changed from 'a living hell' to 'survivable' after it was designated last spring as one of six UN 'safe areas'. Srebrenica, in the Drina valley, remains a symbol of Moslem resistance against the onslaught in eastern Bosnia by Serb forces in April 1992.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Firefighters are awarded 4.9% rise GOVERNMENT plans to hold down public sector pay were challenged yesterday with the announcement of a 4.9 per cent pay increase for firefighters who work for local authorities. The increase was made under a formula which lifts the pay of Britain's 42,000 firefighters retrospectively in line with the growth in earnings received by the top 25 per cent highest-paid adult male manual workers. These earnings grew by 6.2 per cent in the year to April according to the government's recent New Earnings Survey. But the formula projects this figure forward to November to take account of more recent pay awards in the private and public sectors. The Local Government Management Board, which negotiates on behalf of local authorities, described the 12-month deal, which will come into effect on Saturday, as the last of this year's public-sector pay round. The government, however, is likely to see it as among the first of next year's pay agreements, and thus a test of its resolve to hold down public-sector pay rises to about 2 per cent in 1993. The government cannot intervene directly to stop local authorities paying the firefighters' increase but it might not make full allowances to local authorities in next year's Rate Support Grant to cover the costs from April 1993. The management board said the award was the lowest ever produced by the fire pay policy, established in 1977. The major policy committee of the Civil Service unions yesterday discussed speculation that the government may want to impose a public-sector pay freeze. Mr Bill Brett, chairman of the committee, said union members would 'react strongly' to any such proposals. 'Any attempt to single out public sector pay, or Civil Service pay, will be grossly discriminatory,' he said.</p>

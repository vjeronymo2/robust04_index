			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Flexible Manufacturing sold to Giddings &amp; Lewis The UK subsidiary of Giddings &amp; Lewis, the US machine tool producer, has bought the key assets of Flexible Manufacturing Technology, the Brighton-based machine tool builder which called in the receivers last month. The sale effectively ends the presence of UK-owned companies in the production of big machine tool cells and systems. Mr Mike Bright, former chairman and driving force behind FMT, is not included in the deal. The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, was clinched last Thursday with Ernst &amp; Young, the receivers. G&amp;L, which has its UK base at Knowsley, Merseyside, fought off bids from a number of potential buyers. It is buying the FMT name and that of Kearns-Richards, the Altrincham-based FMT unit, along with engineering and patent rights, and the service, spare parts and machine rebuild businesses. The acquisition does not include any of FMT's facilities, nor FMT's Noble &amp; Lund unit, which makes big milling machines. G&amp;L said on Friday it would be taking on about 30 FMT service engineers and other staff. This would leave between 50 and 60 employees at FMT, but the receivers are making some further redundancies at Brighton. Work in progress is being completed there over the next few months. G&amp;L said the acquired businesses would ultimately be moved to Knowsley. The deal would expand its customer base and underline its financial strength through its ability to acquire struggling businesses. If it wished, G&amp;L would be able to manufacture machining centres under the FMT name, although observers consider this unlikely. But it will in any case be gaining a profitable spares and service business. The deal is another twist in the chequered history of FMT, whose predecessor companies employed thousands in the 1950s and 1960s. A deal in 1973 created Kearney and Trecker, Marwin, which became a subsidiary of Vickers in 1977. In 1988 Mr Bright led a management buy-out of what was then still called KTM.</p>

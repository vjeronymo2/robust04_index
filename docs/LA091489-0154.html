			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL'S SHARON DEFENDS CALL FOR ARAFAT ASSASSINATION  </P> <P> Israeli Trade Minister Ariel Sharon on Wednesday defended his call for the  assassination of Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and  drew a comparison with what he said was former President Ronald Reagan's  attempt to kill Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi.  </P> <P> "There are certain people whose activities cannot be tolerated by the free  democratic society," he said. "Therefore, they should be removed in order to  enable normal life to free society."  </P> <P> Sharon, speaking at a news conference sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for  International Peace, said Reagan "took a step like that. Kadafi is one of these  people, and the United States tried to kill him."  </P></p>

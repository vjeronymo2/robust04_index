			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: NOT TO WORRY -- HER CHECK'S IN THE MAIL  </P> <P> "April is the cruelest month" is a silly thing to say, even if it was mouthed  by that eminent grump, T. S. Eliot.  </P> <P> Everyone knows the cruelest month is March. The only thing good to be said  about March, besides the jubilant observance of St. Patrick's Day, is that  there is the occasional smog-dispersing breeze. For the rest of the month, it's  hair shirts and ashes and prepare your income tax.  </P> <P> For the past couple of months, I have been receiving little bits of paper  telling me how much money I have made during the year. Obviously, as usual, the  IRS has my records mixed up with someone else's. I certainly didn't make all  that money. Not that it's so much, but if I had I would be spending the winter  in a white villa on Mykonos, or, maybe, the Smeralda Coast. I certainly  wouldn't be sitting in Pasadena watching the begonias freeze.  </P> <P> My accountant is a tall, good-looking man with a shock of white hair and his  name is Richard Martin. I don't have enough money to need an accountant and if  I had the mathematical aptitude of a newt, I wouldn't have one. But I don't and  I do.  </P> <P> Dick has worked out a grand little system for me to keep track of things and if  I did it throughout the year instead of starting March 14, it would probably  work very well.  </P> <P> I want Dick to know that I speak grandly of my accountant when I am with the  smart people, just as I speak very largely of my stock broker, Chuck Waterman.  Chuck is also broker to a number of people who never have had to ask, "How  much?" in all their lives. I think he keeps me as a client just to stay humble.  </P> <P> They are both, Dick and Chuck, kind, patient and long-suffering and I never  know one word they are saying. Through the years, I have worked out a method of  leaning back in the chair, gazing at them, and nodding my head rhythmically,  like one of those Oriental birds.  </P> <P> Then I thank them and get up and go out and they do whatever they do.  </P> <P> This is what I do for Dick's system. He has numbered every category of possible  expenditure for me -- utilities, medical, travel, entertainment, business,  miscellaneous. The last category is always the largest.  </P> <P> I go through my check registers and write the appropriate number on every check  notation. There are always several notations of quite large amounts of money  made to people whom I don't know. Names like Farquarson Brothers. These checks  will be in amounts as large as $300. Unfortunately, there is never a notation  to remind me of what the Farquarson fellows did for me.  </P> <P> Now, this is obviously the result of secret hypnosis or mind control. I would  certainly remember writing a check for $300. Right. That's more money than I  ever saw at one time until I was 23 and my husband came home from World War II  with $1,000 in cash in the bottom of his duffel bag. He had won it in an  extended crap game coming home on the Queen Mary. (We used it to put a down  payment on a house, in case you're wondering.)  </P> <P> There are usually six or eight of those checks for large amounts that I do not  remember. I am sure these renegade hypnotists operate in your checkbook too.  Surely, I am not the only one singled out for such chicanery.  </P> <P> I take the check registers to Dick, and he looks at them for a long time,  saying nothing. Then, he gently suggests that I read the contents of my check  registers into his tape recorder so his assistant can "punch them in." That's  because his assistant can't read my impeccable Palmer method handwriting. When  he says "punch in," I have enough sense to know that we are moving into the  computer area, and it is time for me to leave before he asks any penetrating  questions.  </P> <P> Then, in a few days, I get a great heap of neatly printed pages and two stamped  envelopes. Then I send two checks, one to the feds and one to the state.  </P> <P> In a few weeks, many of my friends are nattering happily about their income tax  refunds and what they are going to do with the money.  </P> <P> I either don't get any back or I already owe it to the Farquarson Brothers.  </P></p>

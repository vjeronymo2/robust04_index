			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FATHER OF SCHOOL STRATEGY TELLS HOW TO INVOLVE PARENTS  </P> <P> Dr. James P. Comer came from a poor black family struggling to survive in the  grimy steel town of East Chicago, Ind., after his father died when he was 6.  Yet he, along with his brothers and sisters, made it through high school and  beyond to garner 13 college degrees.  </P> <P> Success came in large part because of their mother, who Comer says worked  terribly hard to nurture a learning environment at home. She was also dogged  enough to figure out the school's way of doing things and work with teachers to  boost the school's expectations for her children.  </P> <P> Yet Comer remembered three close classmates from elementary school who fell  short along the way -- one who died early of alcoholism, a second who ended up  in jails most of his life, the third who has spent much of his life in mental  institutions.  </P> <P> Using his own experiences, the professor of psychiatry at Yale Medical School  asked what could be done to help the large number of minority parents who --  unlike his mother -- have been unable by themselves to give their children the  tools to be good learners, despite innate qualities of caring and a desire to  want to help.  </P> <P> Today he can point to the "Comer Model" as the fruit of his long research. It  is a deceptively simple prescription for educators to bring parents and  children into the school culture and boost academic achievement by making them  feel welcome, in large part, through a comprehensive social program.  </P> <P> First tried in New Haven, the Comer plan has taken root in a half-dozen  communities around the nation and will be a key part of renewal plans at three  San Diego Unified District schools beginning in the 1990-91 school year: Baker  Elementary in Southeast San Diego, Valencia Park Elementary, and Jackson  Elementary in East San Diego.  </P> <P> Comer talked about the ABCs of his model while in San Diego last week to  address graduates at the UC San Diego Medical School. The plan, now part of  Yale's School Development Program that he oversees, was chosen in January for  $3 million in annual funding by the Rockefeller Foundation over the next five  years.  </P> <P> At its heart is the fact that parental support is critical to academic  achievement of children.  </P> <P> "Children attach first to their own parents and to the social network that the  parents are part of, and they carry those attitudes and values and ways as they  develop, and they interact with school people based on these norms they take  from home," Comer said.  </P> <P> "When those norms are in line with the mainstream culture of the school --  mainstream or middle-class values and attitudes -- then there is no problem.  But, when those attitudes are marginal, or antisocial, you've got a problem  when those kids go to school."  </P> <P> Many low-income minority parents did not have successful experiences in school  themselves, Comer said. Therefore they need help to see how they can sustain a  teacher's efforts at home and give realism to those same dreams they hold for  their children as do middle-class parents.  </P> <P> "The school has to understand that learning is not simply a mechanical process  based on ability, but that it grows out of the quality of relationships that  the teacher has with the child, that the teacher has with the parents, and that  the parents have with the child," Comer said.  </P> <P> "Teachers have no power if they don't deal with the home-school relationship  issue."  </P> <P> But how to get at the problem, when many teachers already feel overworked and  overwhelmed by the social problems of many children who show up in their  classes?  </P> <P> In essence, the school needs to reach out to parents through social  interactions, beginning with potluck suppers, welcome-back nights, Christmas  parties and the like, at which genuine respect between the two groups can begin  to develop.  </P> <P> Once that rapport takes root, the school can move to seminars at which teachers  and parents talk about the math program, about the English program, about ways  that parents can help at home, ways parents can talk with their children at the  supermarket, "about all sorts of ways parents can mediate," or expand, on  learning experiences that happen in school. There can be sessions on  child-rearing techniques and related activities.  </P> <P> "Rather than teaching parents per se, you create the programs that allow them"  to bring those skills to school that they may already have "and which the  school can take advantage of," Comer said.  </P> <P> "The parents find out that the climate of the school is supportive" and they  begin to emphasize behaviors at home that will integrate with those behaviors  required of children at school, Comer said. "And then the children see that  their parents aren't dumb, that their parents represent the same kinds of  models being pushed in the classroom."  </P> <P> The key mechanism for integrating the many activities is called the governance  and management team, a group of parents, teachers and school support employees  headed by the principal. The team receives support from two other bodies: a  parent team and a mental-health team composed of a social worker, psychologist,  special education teacher, nurse, and counselors.  </P> <P> The management team draws up the social calendar for the year, a listing of all  the parent-school activities with which the school can draw parents gradually  into its web, Comer said. But these activities must relate to the academics as  much as possible, and not just deal with things on the periphery of school  programs.  </P> <P> As one example, Comer cited a field trip planned to a Jackie Robinson exhibit  in New York for a New Haven school. "We talked to children about the skills  they would need on the trip and we practiced them, such as what to say to Mrs.  Robinson, how to ask questions about the exhibit, how to conduct yourself going  down on the bus, where you stop for lunch, all these things relating to social  skills but also to language skills, the curriculum as well," Comer said.  </P> <P> Many parents attended as well, picking up on these skills "but without ever  having to say, 'I don't know how to do this' and being reluctant to  participate."  </P> <P> In another case, the mental health team noticed that students transfering into  a school often displayed anti-social behavior, such as hitting teachers or  other students.  </P> <P> "Out of those cases, the team recognized that the school needed a transfer  policy, and so it developed an orientation program for new students and helped  prevent that problem from" remaining prevalent.  </P> <P> Comer said that, although many parts of his model sound simple, "I'm not saying  that this is very easy, since there are difficult times, but I'm not saying  it's all that tough either.  </P> <P> "The major difficulty can come if you have people (at the school) whose  personalities won't allow them to share with or respect people who are poor, or  different."  </P> <P> Comer also is worried that representatives from the three San Diego schools may  not have spent enough time in New Haven observing how the model operates,  although at one school in Texas, teachers successfully put the plan into effect  merely from reading about Comer's work.  </P> <P> "Also, there has to be agreement that you don't focus on faults of teachers or  parents, that there has to be consensus decision making, and that there can't  be winners or losers, in that the principal is ignored or that the principal  ignores other people," Comer said.  </P> <P> Under average conditions, Comer said three years may be necessary to see  significant improvements in a school.  </P> <P> In the beginning, a school might have only five or six parents who participate,  but Comer said educators should not panic. Comer gave the example of one parent  in New Haven who initially could not understand why the school had any interest  in having her show up.  </P> <P> "She felt she had nothing she could contribute to professionals, but after a  period of time, after getting involved in some activities, she recognized she  had some ability," Comer said.  </P> <P> The woman eventually finished high school, went to college and is now a dean of  a community college.  </P> <P> "But, in general, we're talking about parents simply becoming better teachers  of their children, giving skills that make them succeed in school academically,  by having the school create experiences for them that will lead to that.  </P> <P> "Otherwise, when you have parents who stay away from school, that is a model  that says to children that 'schools are dangerous for us, that they are not  like us.'

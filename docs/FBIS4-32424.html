			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Miroslav Prchal: "Czech Transformation </F> Experiences Are Attracting Interest in Economic Relations"]    [Text] Czech experiences of successful and rapid economic  transformation are attracting interest in developing economic  and commercial cooperation with our country. This was confirmed  by the series of meetings held by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  and Ministers Ivan Kocarnik and Karel Dyba at the end of last  week, during the international economic forum in the Swiss town  of Crans-Montana.    Economy Minister Karel Dyba described his exchange of views  with Vietnamese representatives as very friendly. "Vietnam,  which will obviously be the next `tiger' in Southeast Asia, with  a market of almost 100 million inhabitants, is an enormously  interesting country for all industrially advanced states. There  is an uninterrupted flow of Taiwanese and Japanese businessmen  who are making their way there. The Vietnamese officials  emphasized our longstanding cooperation, and I had the feeling  from our talks that they would be happy for it to continue," he  told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. In reply to a question from  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on whether the Czech Republic has a chance of  asserting itself there, in a situation where various advanced  states are now investing heavily in his country, the secretary  general of the Vietnamese Council for Foreign Trade, Nguyen  Trung [name as published], said: "Absolutely certainly. Our  economic relations have a good tradition, and the prospects for  our cooperation, even after the recent turbulent years, are  promising. Our two countries have distinct comparative  advantages. We have a very cheap labor force, and your  technology, because of its low cost compared with Western  states, is capable of competing solidly. Together we can  produce high quality products, and, given our lower overheads,  we can assert ourselves well on world markets."    Following his talks with his Croatian counterpart, Nikica  Valentic, V. Klaus said that Croatia is immensely interested in  expanding economic relations with the Czech Republic, especially  in increasing the exchange of goods. "This country returns a  number of positive results, which, irrespective of the state of  war in the region, indicate that the situation there is  consolidating," he added. Prime Minister Nikica Valentic  expressed his conviction that this year's anticipated invasion  of Czech tourists in Croatia will certainly have a favorable  influence on the development of economic relations with the  Czech Republic.    Apropos his talks with Ukrainian Economy Minister Roman  Shpek, Minister K. Dyba told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that they mainly  discussed the possibilities for capitalizing our outstanding  claims and for our entry into the privatization process in  Ukraine. The Ukrainian representative promised to provide our  government with a data base of the enterprises that are open as  shareholding companies for the entry of foreign investors.  "This could be an interesting offer for some of our large  companies, although there are certain risks there that anyone  interested in investing must weigh. There was obvious interest  from the Ukrainian side," he stated. In an interview for  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Shpek expressed his hope that our economic  and commercial relations will flourish and that their volume  will increase. According to him, "it is true, obviously, of all  countries transferring to a market economy that, during the  first phase, they break off their economic relations with their  former partners and strive to assert themselves on Western  markets. We are also seeking good fortune in the West, but,  even so, during the course of reform, we should take advantage  of the fact that there used to be traditional cooperation  between us on various levels, including the enterprise level,  and we should base it on mutual advantageousness and  productivity. Ukraine and the Czech Republic, for example,  cooperated well in engineering and the metallurgical industry.  Your technology for the consumer industry had a large market in  our country. I think that words like `East' and `West' should  not be decisive in trade; after all, the important thing is its  advantageousness."    Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus held meetings in Crans-Montana  with leading representatives from some of the countries of the  former Soviet Union--Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Belarus. He  said: "It is remarkable that these countries see a model for  themselves in the reform path along which the Czech Republic is  going. We even reached a firm agreement on sending to Moldova  and Georgia a mission of our experts who will give advice there  on the whole logic of the transformation process." He added  that he received an official request for this from the Moldovan  president and the Georgian prime minister. "I think it can only  be in our interest to make use of it," said V. Klaus.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Multimedia sewer trip offered A computer company is offering 'surrogate' trips into dirty, difficult and dangerous environments as its contribution to the multimedia revolution. The Rothwell Group of Hampshire is offering the service on standard personal computers. The company, which has an annual turnover of more than Pounds 20m, is expanding into providing applications for business. Under the title BeingThere, Rothwell is offering tailor-made interactive packages costing between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 70,000. Possibilities include detailed visual tours around oil rigs for new employees, an introduction to Wembley stadium for special constables, and detailed guides to the London Underground and sewer system for emergency workers. BeingThere, produced in a partnership with CyberGraphics, offers the user the choice of, for example, which way to 'walk' around an oil rig, or which piece of machinery to zoom in on. CyberGraphics, which specialises in surrogate travel, has produced trips around oil rigs and a destroyer for the Royal Navy as well as geographical profiles of border areas in Germany for the British army. The company uses a former BBC producer, Mr Don Selwyn Gilbert, whose work includes documentaries on the Tudor ship the Mary Rose, to carry out detailed filming before his work is turned into digital software. Mr Mark Compton-Hall of Rothwell admitted that so far the sale of multimedia products in the UK had been 'singularly unspectacular'. He said the main reason was that 'suppliers have spent too much effort demonstrating how technically clever their products are and failing to focus on pragmatic business solutions'. BeingThere, which so far has attracted expressions of interest rather than sales, is the first of what Rothwell hopes will be a series of multimedia applications for business.</p>

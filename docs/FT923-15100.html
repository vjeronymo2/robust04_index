			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / S African workers ponder role as shock troops: Philip Gawith looks at the strengthsof the unions asthey defy thePretoria government A ROAR of approval swept through the crowd as the slim figure on the platform denounced President F W de Klerk and pledged an unprecedented campaign of 'mass action' to bring about majority rule. If the enthusiastic response in Boipatong on Monday to Mr Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), was anything to go by, Mr de Klerk's days may be numbered. But there are several reasons for believing that South Africa's white government will be a tougher nut to crack than Mr Naidoo and his audience at the funeral for victims of Boipatong's massacre last month may believe. As an alliance partner of the African National Congress and South African Communist Party, Cosatu is lending its enthusiastic support to their mass action campaign aimed at speeding the transition to democracy. Indeed, with its 1.3m membership spread across 17 affiliates - mining, metalworkers, food and clothing and textiles are the largest - Cosatu is pivotal in the plan to bolster the alliance's position at the negotiating table through people-power on the street. The high point of this campaign will be a Cosatu-led general strike, as yet of unspecified duration, set for August 3. The extent to which unionised workers are ready to be used as political shock-troops, however, is unclear. Few doubt Cosatu's ability to organise a short-term mass stayaway. In July 1990 and again in November last year, more than 3m workers heeded such a call. But many doubt whether an extended national strike is possible. Mr Brian Allen, a director at Andrew Levy and Associates, a labour research group, says he is 'doubtful there will be a genuine national strike' which would last more than 'a day or two'. The youth and the unemployed among the crowd who cheered Mr Naidoo so enthusiastically can be expected to lend their support to protest activities. For unionised workers and their leadership, however, the equation is more complicated. With an estimated 40 per cent unemployment rate in South Africa, unions now represent an elite constituency, only too aware of the perils of joblessness. Many have already been involved in strikes this year and will be wary of politically motivated action which almost certainly lays them open to dismissal. Attitudes among employers to political strikes have hardened. This is partly because of violence which often accompanies such events - about 100 people died in violence following November's stayaway in protest at the taxing of staple foods with the introduction of VAT - and partly the weak state of the economy. The Reserve Bank noted in its quarterly bulletin last week that gross domestic product decreased at an annualised rate of nearly 2 per cent in the first quarter. Mr Bokkie Botha, human resources director at the chemical group AECI, says: 'It is absolutely clear that some employers will be forced to dismiss workers if their businesses fold. There simply isn't the sort of slack we had in the past.' The level of industrial action is already high. Figures from Andrew Levy show that 650,000 working days were lost in the first half of the year compared to 375,000 in the same period in 1991. Ongoing strikes at the South African Broadcasting Corporation, in the state health service and at Toyota, the local assembler of Japanese cars, remain unresolved. The National Union of Metalworkers, is also balloting for strike action. There is quiet optimism in the mining industry, however, that wage negotiations will be settled without resort to strike action.</p>

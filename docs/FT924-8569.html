			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (2): IT put firmly in its place - Wholesale Banking TO THE Information Technology directors of financial institutions, money is now a serious subject. Since the stock market crash of 1987, the advance of IT has stalled. Too many organisations believed competitive advantage was the only goal worth achieving and the route to that goal lay in signing up for ambitious and often unproven systems. Vast outlays on state-of-the-art dealing rooms looked a poor investment when banks started sacking dealers by the hundred. Developments were still needed, but the emphasis was on cutting IT spending. Ambitions have been curtailed, but IT can still prove a powerful weapon in the competitive trading battle. If the order of the day is cost-consciousness, some institutions have learned to use their bedrock of IT experience as a revenue earner. At Barclays Bank expertise in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) has proved attractive to third parties. The bank has spent Pounds 4m on establishing Barclays Trading Master. This is a service that allows corporates to out-source receivables and payables. Messages are received in industry standard EDI format and full settlement is achieved via Barclays' Cheshire computer centre. The need for customer intervention is eliminated. For Barclays, this kind of service has more promise than high-profile adventures in the retail banking sector. 'Issues like smart-cards are on the back-burner now,' says Mr Tim Earles, Barclays senior product manager for EDI. 'We want to reduce overheads for corporate customers, to take that responsibility off them.' Of the 1m UK businesses Barclays has identified, so far only 5,000 are using EDI. The aim is to establish a global EDI infrastructure that reduces the administration burden for clients while keeping Barclays' computer operations busy. The Trading Master software was written internally in conjunction with systems house EDS. Mr Ranald Bain, director of financial services at EDS, is familiar with the drive to squeeze every last penny of value out of an IT infrastructure. As a prominent third party contractor, his company stands to benefit. But Mr Bain has words of caution. 'It can't just be about costs. Its got to be cost allied to service quality and value.' Mr Julian Wood, a City IT consultant and visiting lecturer on banking at the City University Business School, has seen institutions vent their anger on the IT department after technology spending failed to yield proportionate results. However, he thinks the vengeful mood has had its day. 'That's given way to a more mature level of understanding. Money's definitely tighter and the renewal cycle has expanded. But physical factors like relocation will still demand new IT projects.' City dealers go out looking for new dealing rooms, but they have become cautious. Telerate, the market data feed company that ventured into dealing room software to manipulate price information, is well aware of the sea change that came after the 1987 crash. 'In the roaring '80s they bought everything on the market. Now they want to fit the products to their needs,' says Mr Bruno de la Riviere, Telerate's regional manager for systems and markets. He has just sold a 48-position trading room to merchant bank Schroders for around Pounds 750,000. It was no easy deal, he says. From the first contact with the customer to securing a signature on the contract took over 12 months. It would never have happened in the old days, when banks set up shop in purpose-built high-tech offices and clamoured for any new technology that would put them one month ahead of the pack. In the post-deregulation euphoria that swelled the coffers of financial technology outfits there would have been no question of building the entire dealing room for client approval before receiving payment. But that is what Telerate had to do to before Schroders would accept its Trading Room Product (TRP). 'We're a live dealing room. We didn't want to install a new system and go through software testing on site. I wasn't happy doing that unless I could see the whole system up and running. It had to be right and then installed over one weekend.' Mr Lester Gray, head of treasury support at Schroders, recognises that IT enthusiasm went too far during the mid-1980s, but is keen to distance Schroders from these excesses. 'We never got caught up in keeping up with the Joneses.' Mr Gray got what he wanted, a treasury dealing room using digital data feeds that allow his staff to mix, match and manipulate information from different market data providers. He is reluctant to admit to driving too hard a bargain, stressing the need for banks to maintain a cordial relationship with suppliers. But one technical watershed has played a critical role in returning power to the customer. Open systems - enabling the running of software across a range of hardware platforms without worrying about compatibility - is important to the IT industry. And open systems has actually delivered on its promise. This means Schroders was able to concentrate on software, the real tool its dealers would work with. In a recent speech to an international banking conference in Brussels, Mr Shigenori Nagata of the Nomura Bank research institute was cynical about the workings of the computer industry. Pointing out that only 20 per cent of Nomura's IT costs went on developing systems to support the business, Mr Nagata blamed the large number of proprietary systems used at Nomura for its inability to reduce the size of operations and the large number of in-house experts needed to keep diverse systems running. He concluded that cost efficiency would come 'via the route of standardisation'. The policy of standardising equipment within one bank was not enough. 'Only the application of industry standards will provide full satisfaction,' he said. Nomura has discovered that the era of competitive advantage through unique IT projects was no more than an excuse for suppliers to write their own script. Adventurous developments will continue, but with the IT industry put firmly in its place.</p>

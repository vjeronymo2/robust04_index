			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / False start in export insurance race: The sale of an ECGD unit appears in disarray EXPORTERS, who have long campaigned against the proposed privatisation of the short-term insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, believed they finally had the government on the run as the deadline for bids passed yesterday. Three responses were received to the invitation to tender, but only two  - from Italy's Assicurazioni Generali and NCM of Holland - constituted bids in the formal sense. Trade Indemnity replied with an offer of collaboration, but did not put any money on the table. It was a sorry end to the first lap of a race started less than two months ago with six supposedly keen bidders. The private and public explanations given by some who dropped by the wayside have added to the impression of chaos and disarray in the government camp. The government has long seen privatisation as essential if ECGD is to compete in the 1992 single European market for credit insurance business. Few guessed before the bidding began quite how difficult the sale was going to prove - or how much harder the government would make it by refusing to give a commitment to reinsure credits to developing countries where the political situation was seen as risky. For example, when Cobac of Belgium dropped out it warned that this policy was putting British exporters at a structural disadvantage. Sun Alliance felt the prospective net annual premium income of Pounds 22m was inadequate given the investment needed to build up the business. Other bidders were worried about the fragility of the customer base and overmanning at the Cardiff-based division. The impression is that the professionals who have looked at the government's offer document concluded that the business, once expected to command a purchase price of Pounds 100m or more, is not worth very much. The force of their reaction has even caused the government's nerve to falter slightly. Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, who has been studiously dismissive of industry worries about political-risk insurance, is seeking fresh consultations with exporters. The government has postponed until June putting the privatisation bill before the House of Lords, where it may face a revolt among its supporters. Exporters have been slow to take Generali seriously as a potential buyer. It has a 22 per cent stake in SIAC, the private-sector Italian credit insurance concern, but it is a newcomer to the niche market of credit insurance and has no track record. From the government's perspective, Generali is appealing in a number of areas. It is a well-established international insurance company with a long-term outlook, a strong balance sheet and profits equivalent to Dollars 450m (Pounds 250m) in 1989. This gives it ample resources to develop the business and clout in the re-insurance market whose involvement is seen as vital as Whitehall progressively withdraws support. Generali also has a tradition of allowing its subsidiaries a considerable degree of managerial autonomy. Some industry experts believe it would mandate ECGD's existing management to use the support of its existing operations to develop a pan-European credit insurance more or less from scratch. This is potentially more exciting than the prospect offered by NCM, which has also said it would grant the Cardiff-based ECGD group considerable autonomy. But, with NCM in ultimate charge, the scope for developing a European business out of Cardiff would inevitably be limited by the new owner's aspirations to do the same out of Amsterdam. NCM has impressed exporters with the professionalism of its management. Though it has only limited financial resources compared with Generali, exporters say it has a sound track record in credit insurance. Yet NCM needs to expand out of the limited Dutch market if it is to grow large enough to cope with 1992. Many believe its interest lies primarily in acquiring a base from which to attack the UK domestic credit insurance market, now dominated by Trade Indemnity, rather than to expand Cardiff's export credit business. Trade Indemnity argues that a marriage of its expertise in domestic credit insurance with Cardiff's skills on export credit would create a powerful UK force in the broader European market. An underlying motivation has always been defensive, however. It fears that any other owner of Cardiff would attack it on its home ground. The chances of the government taking up its proposal looked slim last night. The force of its arguments have been dented by its unwillingness to put money behind its proposals, by negative market reaction to its Pounds 29m loss for 1990 and by the apparent reluctance of its shareholders to back its expansion with extra cash through a rights issue. Whatever happens, none of the UK players will come out looking good. Trade Indemnity, once the keenest potential bidder, has overplayed its hand and risks attack in its home market. The government has manifestly misjudged the market. And ECGD's managers now have to explain to their staff why they have been trumpeting their success in building up a dynamic computer-driven business which no right-minded British company actually wants to buy.</p>

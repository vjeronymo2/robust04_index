			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E Oelofse] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 9 SAPA -- The National Hostel  Residents Association [Nahora] says that from today it will be  deploying its "own military" at hostels throughout South Africa  and that the South African Defence Force [SADF] will "no longer  be welcome at the hostels". In a telephone statement to SAPA on  Saturday [9 April], Nahora spokesman Thulani Simon Mlotshwa said  the decision had been taken because of events on March 28 in  Johannesburg where Zulus were "butchered by Umkhonto We Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation, ANC armed wing] members who were assisted  by security forces".    Moreover, hostels had been raided after the March 28  massacre  but not the African National Congress Johannesburg HQ which  building had been at the centre of the violence, Mr Mlotshwa  noted. "This, proves the partiality and bias of the so-called  security forces," he said.    On Friday the East Rand Buyafuthi hostel was targeted by  SADF  troops who allegedly shot and killed Inkatha Freedom Party  leader Jeff Sibiya, who, said Mr Mlotshwa, was involved in  promoting peace in the area.    With this in mind, Nahora had decided it would be better to  deploy its own military structures in defence of hostels and  hostel residents. "From today our enemies had better be on  their guard because we will be replying to all letters sent to  us. We cannot sit with our arms folded while our heels are  being bitten by mice."</p>

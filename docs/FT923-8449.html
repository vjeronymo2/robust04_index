			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World Trade News: German rolling-stock maker puts hopes in Russia - But the Treuhand-owned company wonders how long the good luck will last DEUTSCHE Waggonbau AG (DWA), Germany's largest producer of rolling stock, is rare among western companies for remaining stubbornly optimistic about the Russian market. DWA continued exporting its long-distance passenger carriages and freight cars to Russia in the first half of this year as most German companies reported falling sales to the east. Even more remarkably, its Russian customers were able to pay for the deliveries. But the Treuhand-owned company is wondering how long the good luck will last. Russia until now has allotted hard currency for passenger and freight car imports as they are regarded as top priority items. In a vast country with only minuscule road transport, virtually nothing moves except by rail. With its headquarters in east Berlin and five factories in east Germany, DWA was Comecon's leading producer of rail passenger carriages and special-purpose freight cars, and a major supplier of the Soviet State Railway since 1948. Some 70 per cent of its projected total sales this year of DM2.2bn (Pounds 780m) are to Russia and other republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Mr Kurt-Friedrich Ladendorf, a west German member of the executive board of DWA, spoke of the risks remaining for the company in the second half of this year. Despite 100 per cent coverage by the German government's Hermes export credit guarantees, and payment guarantees by the Russian government, there was no way of knowing whether the Russians would continue to pay their bills. Meanwhile, DWA has purchased the raw materials and semi-manufactures to fulfil the Russian orders, incurring heavy costs, Mr Ladendorf said. For the entire year the Russians contracted for 1,300 passenger carriages and 150 refrigerated trains consisting of five wagons each. Next year, the Russian Railway wants to buy 830 passenger carriages and the other CIS republics 100-150 units, an overall drop of 22 per cent. Interest was expressed in buying 100 refrigerated trains but Mr Ladendorf said the number was expected to be reduced to 30. This was less than tragic, though, as DWA was barely earning money on its sales of refrigerated wagons. Over the next three years, exports to the CIS were likely to drop to 50 per cent of total sales, with the German Federal Railway and regional commuter systems taking most of the remaining half. 'It makes no sense trying forcefully to reduce the eastern business. We are making money on the sales and are contributing to the transport sector of the CIS,' he explained. DWA's undisclosed earnings last year included a significant portion set aside as reserves in anticipation of more difficult times ahead. To ensure it remains competitive in the Russian market, DWA is negotiating with Russia's biggest producer of long-distance passenger carriages, Tver Railway Wagon, to set up a joint venture based in Tver. The Germans have already installed new machinery at the Russian factory to boost its poor output. A new plant to produce up to 1,000 rail waggons would be erected and an existing factory producing rail equipment for the armed forces converted to civilian production. Mr Ladendorf estimated DWA needed to invest up to DM300m in the new plant, while the Russians would invest an equivalent amount in roubles. While DWA could come up with its share out of earnings, the Russian government would have to subsidise the investment by the Tver company, which sells its entire output to Russian Railways. 'The question is whether the Russians can finance such a development. We believe the west will have to provide help,' Mr Ladendorf says. . Such assistance in the critically-important transport sector was more beneficial than selling computer plants to Russia. The uncertainties of trading with the CIS republics has a direct influence on DWA's prospects for privatisation. Mr Ladendorf envisages that 51 per cent of DWA will be sold to an investor (Siemens, ABB and AEG have shown interest) while 49 per cent would remain with Treuhand. This would allow the agency to achieve a 'fair price' whenever it chose to sell its share. All three bidders have expressed concern about the risks involved in DWA's strong CIS business and for this reason are not interested in a majority share. For its part, Treuhand is under no great pressure to sell DWA, as it is one of the few former state companies which until now has made a profit. Meanwhile, DWA has somewhat lessened its reliance on the CIS market by its DM500m contract with the Bundesbahn and east German Reichsbahn; it hopes shortly to land a Dollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m) contract from Amtrak in the US for 50 viewliner passenger cars with options on another 170 units. But the deal would not be profitable with the dollar below DM1.50. Mr Ladendorf, like other German exporters, hopes the dollar will strengthen soon. The mood in east Germany, Page 12</p>

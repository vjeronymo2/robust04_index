			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Caldera opts for middle road: Joseph Mann on economic plans of Venezuela's new president Mr Rafael Caldera, a 78-year-old specialist in labour law, began his second term as president of Venezuela yesterday by underlining his rejection of both neo-liberal economic policies and their populist alternative. Mr Caldera, who arrives in office with Venezuela facing a combination of deep economic, social and political problems. rejected the need for a 'war economy' or a series of 'dramatic economic adjustments'. Instead, he said there would be a 'dialogue for solidarity'. In a speech generally light on specific policy proposals, he said his government would send a package of bills to Congress calling for repeal (at least at the retail level) of a value added tax imposed last year; new levies, including a selective tax up to the wholesale level and a luxury tax; and reforms of existing income tax laws. It will also try to reduce income tax evasion estimated at about 70 per cent of potential revenue. Mr Caldera said he would raise the minimum wage (now at the equivalent of Dollars 83 per month), and denied that his government was planning a large devaluation of the bolivar or the imposition of exchange controls. Other priority initiatives included reforms of the constitution, stiff penalties for those guilty of causing bank failures, particularly stockholders and managers, new efforts to assist agriculture, improvements in public services and aid for slum dwellers. He outlined seven priority areas for the economy: A commitment to control inflation (which reached 46 per cent last year) over the short to medium-term; A policy of austerity in public spending to achieve fiscal equilibrium 'without affecting the social area, to which I attribute priority', he said. There would be cuts in spending by the president's office and better co-ordination between fiscal and monetary authorities; An opening of the economy and promotion of competition 'within a framework of (international) reciprocity; An economic stability programme that took into consideration the average Venezuelan family rather than macroeconomic indicators; Efforts to control waste and inefficiency in the public and private sectors; Continued privatisations, but ones in which workers would play a more important role; A new tax policy under which 'those who earn more will pay more'. Mr Caldera takes over with the economy in recession, persistently high inflation, a large fiscal deficit, and an estimated 43 per cent of the nation's 21m people live in 'extreme poverty'. He has taken over a huge inefficient government bureaucracy, whose militant employees are expected to seek more money and which provides among the poorest health and education services in Latin America. The country's military has been in turmoil ever since rebellious officers led two unsuccessful coups attempts in 1992. Violent crime, often drugs related, remains a prime concern. His ability to deal with these issues is constrained by low prices for the country's main export, oil, and a financial system weakened by the recent failure of the country's second largest bank. Yet Mr Caldera won the chief executive's job last December with only 30 per cent of the popular vote in elections where abstention reached a record 40 per cent. He is viewed as Venezuela's last caudillo, a man who appeals to many as a strong and charismatic leader. This quality of leadership, combined with his experience, will be necessary if the president is to gain the support he will need from a congress divided into four blocks. The two main parties that supported him in the presidential campaign, National Convergence and the socialist party MAS, together lack a majority in either the upper or lower house. He must therefore hammer together a working majority with the help of the Democratic Action party or Copei - the Christian Democrats - both of which are officially in the opposition. This attempt will be complicated by Mr Caldera's break with Copei, which he helped found in the 1940s, last year during his sixth campaign for the presidency. Causa R, a militant leftist party that holds an important share of congressional seats, has given signs that it will be a critical opposition force and seems an unlikely ally for the new president. During his presidential campaign, Mr Caldera focused on the injustice of unpopular free market reforms that began to be implemented in 1989, and said he would change them. Recently, however, members of the new government have signalled to businessmen that the new government will be in favour of private investment and will not return to heavy government intervention in the economy. In spite of this, investors and businessmen remain worried about the presidents traditional commitment to labour and his self-confessed inexperience in economic affairs.</p>

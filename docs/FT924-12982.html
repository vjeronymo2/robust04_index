			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Community agrees to hasten aid to former Yugoslavia EUROPEAN Community leaders agreed last night to speed up their help to the hundreds of thousands of people in the former Yugoslavia facing death and starvation as winter approaches. A draft declaration to be adopted by the 12 heads of government underlined the importance of providing winter shelter and of ensuring the delivery of relief supplies. It said Ecu213m (Pounds 167m) of EC aid was ready for immediate disbursement. This includes 120,000 tons of food, medicines, shelter and 40 trucks. Member states said they would immediately provide further staff and resources, practical and financial, to strengthen the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' capacity in the region. The Community would also immediately establish a task force to support the efforts of UNHCR to deliver humanitarian aid. In order to increase the effectiveness of such humanitarian assistance, the European Council called on the UNHCR to set up, next week, a meeting of technical experts on emergency aid and, next month, a stock-taking conference to assess the effectiveness of the operation and recommend further measures. The heads of government called on other international donors to make a commensurate effort to support the UNHCR appeal and to speed up the delivery of aid already pledged. The summit condemned 'the continuing widespread violence and cruelty and the savage breaches of international humanitarian law' in the former Yugoslavia, which were now the main constraint on the delivery of essential aid. It expressed its full support for the 'unremitting efforts' of Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance to bring about an end to hostilities. The summit also endorsed the recent UN Security Council resolutions on war crimes and the introduction of a 'no-fly' zone in Bosnia. The leaders noted the recent undertaking by the Bosnian Serbs to remove their military aircraft into Serbia and agreed, that in case of violations of the relevant UN resolution, the Security Council should be asked to consider urgently further measures to enforce the ban on military flights. Stressing that international sanctions and the arms embargo against Serbia and Montenegro should be maintained, the leaders also stressed the need for measures to prevent the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia from becoming the unintended victim of UN sanctions. Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Mr Dobrica Cosic, the federal president of Yugoslavia, yesterday called for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's resignation, intensifying the pressure on the controversial socialist leader. Mr Cosic, a writer who has wielded tremendous influence in Serbian politics, for the first time appears to have drawn battle lines between Serbia's ruling socialists and the federal government. He followed his unprecedented criticism of Mr Milosevic with a state-of-the nation address in which he lashed out at Serbian leaders for criticising his peace talks with Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman.</p>

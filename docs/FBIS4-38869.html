			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The Federation Council  today failed to give its backing to an appeal by the Russian  president concerning the peacemaking operation in the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict area. This information leaked out  of the Council chamber where the question is being debated  behind closed doors today.    Boris Yeltsin's letter to the Federation Council stresses  that the cessation of hostilities in Abkhazia and the signing of  a cease-fire agreement and on separating the warring sides was  achieved through the active involvement of Russia. However, the  situation in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict area remains  "explosive". It has become clear that "without the deployment  of peacemaking troops it is not possible" to effectively monitor  observation of the agreements and the return of refugees, the  letter says.    The request to conduct peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia  is  contained in appeals by Shevardnadze and Ardzinba to the Russian  Federation president in his capacity as chairman of the Council  of CIS Heads of State. Boris Yeltsin's opinion is that  peacekeeping would conform to the UN standards for this kind of  action. The CIS heads of states' decision will be conveyed to  the Security Council, which is being offered a UN observers'  mission with the peacekeeping forces. It is remembered, the  letter says, that "the basis for the CIS peacekeeping forces  will be a reinforced contingent of Russian troops deployed at  units already located in Georgia."    Boris Yeltsin said he hopes that the Federation Council  "will  support Russia's peacekeeping efforts within the scope of its  authority." However, according to preliminary figures, when the  decision was put to the ballot it gained one vote less than the  required number.</p>

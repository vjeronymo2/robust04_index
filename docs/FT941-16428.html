			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Scandal strikes at pinnacle of Brazil's national life As if Brazil did not have enough trouble sorting out its huge economic and political problems, scandal last week hit the pinnacle of national life when Rio de Janeiro's football federation fell to pieces. Three of the city's most famous teams, Flamengo, Fluminense and Botafogo - names which recall as many past glories as Europe's Liverpool or AC Milan - quit the Rio federation and announced plans to set up a rival championship. 'It's too late now, we can't go back,' announced Botafogo's president, Mr Carlos Montenegro. There had been rumblings of discontent from several club presidents for many months as allegations of corruption and mismanagement swirled around the Rio game. But the crisis hit in mid-December when the Rio-based newspaper, O Globo, published allegations from three referees that the Rio federation was planning to fix matches in this year's state championship, one of the most prestigious annual competitions. According to the referees, who repeated their allegations in hearings this week, officials from the Rio federation told a meeting of about 70 referees early in December that some results should be decided 'in line with' the federation's wishes. They were told of a special 'Rule 18,' even though the rule book only contains 17 orders, which calls for referees to act in the federation's interests. Claiming the Rio championship was no longer credible, the three clubs announced plans to split. They have now started talking about inviting leading teams from the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo to start an 'Eastern League'. All of this has left the Rio federation facing the prospect of farcical state championships in which only one of its four main teams is still involved. The federation's leaders are also being investigated by the state sports body and even the Rio legislature. Mr Eduardo Viana, federation president, has spent the last week dashing around Rio trying to avoid the press and has refused any comment. Described even by his advisers as a 'poor communicator,' he was quoted recently as saying: 'I hate public opinion. The people could all be shot with machine-guns for all I care.' Optimists among Rio's football fans say the current problems could lead to a long overdue professionalisation of the game, which is rife with cronyism.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Nintendo loses US patents case Nintendo of America, the US arm of the Japanese video game manufacturer, has been ordered by a US court to pay damages of Dollars 208m for patent infringement. The award, to Alpex Computer, a defunct technology company, follows a jury trial in New York. The case was filed in 1986 after Alpex had declared bankruptcy. The company subsequently ceased operations. Alpex claimed that Nintendo violated its patent, which expired in May, for technology that helps video game characters move and interact. Nintendo, which has an estimated 80 per cent of the US market for home video games, denied that it had used Alpex-patented technology. 'Nintendo considers the jury's damage award and its previous finding of patent infringement to be preposterous and flat wrong,' said Mr Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America. 'It's going to be tossed out on its ear.' He said the verdict would have no effect on Nintendo products because the patent had expired. Nintendo said it would ask the judge to overturn the jury decision and, if necessary, file an appeal with the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specialises in intellectual property rights cases. Mr Lincoln asserted that the jury misunderstood the complex technical issues raised during the four-week trial and was misled by 'inflammatory statements of Alpex counsel'. The jury did not find 'wilful' infringement by Nintendo of Japan but ruled that the US subsidiary had deliberately violated Alpex patent rights. Nintendo, however, charged that the 'irrational verdict against a Japanese company and its US subsidiary, together with a damage award which literally defies belief . . .lends substance to foreign distrust of the American legal system'. Alpex, which had sought Dollars 413m in damages, will ask the court to increase the award, said Mr John Strauch, a lawyer for the company. He said the verdict would send a message to large companies that 'where there's a valuable piece of intellectual property held, you cannot ignore it even though it may be held by a small economically strapped company. 'We are pleased that, after eight years of hard-fought litigation, we were able to achieve a substantial award for Alpex's shareholders and creditors.'</p>

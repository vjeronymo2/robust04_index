			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: C&amp;N's Thai tiger devours its parent - How the construction group was taken over by its far-eastern subsidiary NOTHING illustrates the dynamism of Asian companies compared with their European counterparts as clearly as the recent reverse takeover of Copenhagen-based Christiani &amp; Nielsen, the construction and engineering group, by its Thai subsidiary for the equivalent of Dollars 80m. Founded in 1904 by a civil engineer and a captain in the Danish navy, C&amp;N has long been a name to conjure with in the international construction industry; the company pioneered the use of reinforced concrete at the beginning of the century and went on to develop other innovative techniques,, including immersed tube tunnels. C&amp;N carried out projects in 70 countries and, at its peak, had 35,000 employees. 'They were really the golden years, the late 1970s and early 1980s,' says Mr John Millard, the group's chief executive and managing director. Today, the C&amp;N group employs only about 5,000 people, of whom 4,500 are in Thailand. Disaster struck the rest of the company in 1986 and 1987, when currency chaos in South America devalued the group's substantial assets there and eight big projects around the world all went wrong at the same time, Mr Millard said. In 1987, Mr Arne Groes, a Danish property developer, stepped in and bought the company's A shares, which meant control of C&amp;N passed from the Christiani family. But Mr Groes had a stroke two years ago, leaving the company in the hands of an attorney who was not allowed to move assets freely within the group. Wholly-owned subsidiaries in the UK and Germany were therefore in a 'corset', according to Mr Millard. C&amp;N Ltd, the UK company, is expected to report a loss for 1992, while the Hamburg-based German company and C&amp;N A/S, the Danish parent, have been barely breaking even. Mr Millard, a Briton who joined the group in 1985 and was asked in 1988 'to look after a project called Canary Wharf', says the Pounds 40m (Dollars 61m) of foundations for the project's waterside buildings sharply increased C&amp;N Ltd's turnover and virtually saved the group. 'We did get paid,' he said. The situation in Thailand could not have been more different from the troubles in Europe. With the economy growing at an average 10 per cent a year since 1987, C&amp;N (Thai), or CNT, has prospered and outgrown its European parent. Turnover and profits have risen more than tenfold in five years. It was listed on the local stock exchange in 1991. 'From there on, it has really gone from strength to strength in Thailand,' says Mr Millard. The order book is worth Dollars 270m and the company is active on Thailand's eastern seaboard, the focus of new industrial investment. 'We saw a situation where the assets, human and practical, of the European companies were being stifled,' he says, 'whereas this (Thai) company was in rather a strong position to release those restraints and put their resources to profitable use.' Stockbrokers say CNT was worried that anyone smart enough to see the value of the Danish parent's 42 per cent stake in the Thai unit might launch a takeover bid. So CNT made its own offer for the parent company in September, when the C&amp;N A/S share price in Copenhagen reflected only just over half the value of its CNT stake. The outcome of negotiations with Mr Groes's attorney is that CNT is buying the A shares, representing control, but only 25 per cent of the capital, for DKr260 (Dollars 43.3) per share. Holders of B shares were offered DKr130, more than double the price at which the shares were suspended in Copenhagen. And CNT effectively bought 42 per cent of itself for Bt108 (Dollars 4.2) per share, against the Thai suspension price of Bt129. When trading in the shares resumed in Bangkok, the shares were being bid at Bt141, but have since risen to above Bt170. To reduce the crossholding to an acceptable 10 per cent, existing CNT shareholders, the largest of which is Thailand's Crown Property Bureau, will be offered 32 per cent of CNT at Bt108 per share in a rights issue without dilution. With 98 per cent of CNN A/S shares already secured, CNT has succeeded in keeping the internationally known Christiani &amp; Nielsen name and can make plans to inject life into the group's European operations from the new headquarters in Bangkok. C&amp;N Ltd, the UK company, is expected to carry out design and construction for a Dollars 200m joint venture in northern China. 'The UK company is in need of profitable work,' says Mr Millard. 'We can redirect those resources.' This does not mean C&amp;N is abandoning Europe, Mr Millard emphasises. These days, however, it is the Thai company which is calling the shots.  ----------------------------------------------------- CHRISTIANI AND NIELSEN (THAI)  -----------------------------------------------------                   Sales*          Net profit                                      (loss)*  ----------------------------------------------------- 1987                 229                   4 1988                 289                 (11) 1989                 954                  32 1990               1,194                  49 1991               2,426                 104 1992**             2,650                 350  ----------------------------------------------------- * Baht million ** Estimate  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Christiani &amp; Nielsen (Thai)  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

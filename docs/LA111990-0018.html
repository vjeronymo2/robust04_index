			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: WHOSE 'FAMILY VALUES' DOES BURGER KING SUPPORT?  </P> <P> I am one of the American people to whom Burger King's recent newspaper ads were  addressed -- the ads in which they promised to spend their TV ad budgets only  to support "traditional American family values on television, especially the  importance of the family."  </P> <P> My parents have been happily married for more than 40 years. I have the warmest  feelings for my brother and my sister, and my wife and I are having the time of  our life with our 3-month-old daughter Katie. I share Burger King's enthusiasm  for the family, but I have a terrible feeling that the values of my family are  not the values Burger King was referring to.  </P> <P> Apparently Burger King took this ad, not because of a sudden wave of sentiment  coursing through their corporate headquarters, but shortly after having  meetings with the Rev. Billy Melvin of the pressure group CleaR-TV who had been  engaged in a boycott of Burger King because the fast-food chain was sponsoring  TV shows that Rev. Melvin didn't like.  </P> <P> One of the programs that CleaR criticized was a TV airing of the Oscar-winning  film "Platoon." My family considers "Platoon" a work of the highest moral  caliber, brilliantly expressing the horror of war. Our values lead us to  appreciate sponsorship of such a broadcastand to seriously doubt the moral  center of anyone who would agree that the film should be shunned.  </P> <P> CleaR also criticized the NBC drama "People Like Us" for its positive portrayal  of two gay characters. I didn't see this particular show, but I was raised to  respect the humanity and potential for good in everyone, not just  heterosexuals. My parents taught me to detest a narrow-minded philosophy that  would require negative portrayals of millions of people just because of their  sexual preference. I am raising my daughter to have respect for every human  being.  </P> <P> Rev. Melvin told Howard Rosenberg that "traditional American values" are  defined in part by "a man and a woman not engaging in premarital sex until they  are married, of a man and a woman committing to this relationship the rest of  their lives."  </P> <P> I wonder how Rev. Melvin feels about former President Reagan, who was divorced  before he married Nancy. According to Nancy Reagan's book "My Turn," she was  pregnant before they got married. I guess that CleaR would object to a  dramatization of the Reagans' marriage. This seems pretty nutty to me.  </P> <P> I just can't understand why Burger King would be intimidated by a group like  this.  </P> <P> CleaR-TV also accused Burger King of sponsoring TV shows with anti-Christian  bigotry. I have not noticed this theme on prime-time TV.  </P> <P> Considering the fact that the vast majority of Americans describe themselves as  Christians, it's hard to imagine that a program with "anti-Christian" bigotry  would get any ratings. One must assume either that Rev. Melvin is inventing a  bigotry that does not exist or that his perception of what constitutes bigotry  is out of step with most Christians. Surely Burger King must know that there  are hundreds of Christian denominations in this country and that no reverend or  group of reverends has the authority to speak on behalf of all American  Christians.  </P> <P> When my family wants to think about religious values, we go to church or  synagogue or we talk or pray or meditate. When we watch television, it's for  entertainment not for religion. I think that most Americans watch TV as an  escape from day-to-day pressures. What's so bad about that?  </P> <P> According to American tradition and law, Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, Hindus,  members of other religions, atheists and agnostics are just as much American  citizens as Christians are. Are these various groups still welcome at Burger  King or are they only interested in selling food to people with the exact  religious beliefs as Rev. Melvin?  </P> <P> Americans are realists and they know that the purpose of Burger King's TV  commercials is not to "support" certain moral themes -- the purpose is to sell  burgers. Unfortunately, it appears that Burger King has been fooled into  believing that Americans expect fast-food chains to be spiritual leaders.  Because of the meetings that Burger King had with CleaR-TV and the subsequent  newspaper ads about their "values," they have left the impression that they now  will only sponsor programs that appeal to Rev. Melvin and the families of his  followers.  </P> <P> In light of this my family will certainly not be eating at Burger King any time  soon.  </P></p>

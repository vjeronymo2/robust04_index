			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 15 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry and the  farm ministry made a secret arrangement last year to take  special relief measures for debt-ridden agricultural cooperative  financial institutions with low-interest loans from the Bank of  Japan (BOJ), financial sources said Sunday [15 May].    Financial institutions affiliated with agricultural  cooperatives are saddled with bad loans provided to housing loan  companies.    Admitting the existence of the secret arrangement, a senior  Finance Ministry officials said two bureau chiefs of the  ministry and the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry  exchanged a memorandum in February 1993 promising that the  central bank would extend necessary loans to the governmental  Norinchukin Bank.    In return, agricultural cooperative-affiliated financial  institutions under the umbrella of Norinchukin Bank agreed to  lower or exempt interest on their loans to housing loan  companies. The financial institutions had been reluctant to  take such action in view of its impact on their business.    The bureau chiefs made the secret deal in the process of  drawing up a relief package for Nippon Housing Loan Co., the  nation's largest housing loan company, which has been ridden  with large nonperforming loans. The deal was not announced at  that time.    The memo agreed to provide reductions and exemptions of loan  interest to help the farm cooperative-affiliated financial  institutions, the sources said.    Such institutions provided 5.5 trillion yen in loans to the  seven housing loan companies, accounting for about 40 percent of  the total amount of borrowings of the housing loan companies.    The memo said the BOJ would provide necessary loans to  Norinchukin Bank because it was feared interest reductions and  exemptions for housing loan companies could negatively affect  farm cooperative-affiliated financial institutions.    The seven housing loan companies -- Nippon Housing Loan Co.,  Japan Housing Loan Inc., Jyuso Inc., Diichi Housing Loan Co.,  Housing Loan Service Co., Sogo Jukin Co. and Chigin-Seihio  Housing Loan Co -- are suffering due to bad loans worth 13.6  trillion yen to realtors.</p>

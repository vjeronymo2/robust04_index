Part A of Chapter 1 provides financial assistance through State educational agencies (SEAs) to local educational agencies (LEAs) to meet the special educational needs of educationally deprived children in school attendance areas with high concentrations of children from low-income families and children in local institutions for neglected or delinquent children. Part D of Chapter 1 authorizes a Migrant Education Program (MEP) that provides financial assistance to SEAs to establish and improve programs to meet the special educational needs of migratory children of migratory agricultural workers or fishermen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These amendments afford flexibility to States that have developed assessment systems that support their systemic education reform efforts but that are inconsistent with the national evaluation standards in Subpart H of 34 CFR Part 200 and Subpart E of 34 CFR Part 201. These regulations contain less prescriptive national standards that enable States to request an exception to the generally applicable national evaluation standards in order to use their own assessment systems to evaluate the effectiveness of their Chapter 1 and MEP programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These regulations take effect either 45 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments, except that compliance is not required with the information collection requirements in &sect;200.90 until the information collection requirements contained in that section have been submitted by the Department of Education and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

Under the NPRM, the Secretary could have approved a State's request for an exception to the generally applicable Chapter 1 national evaluation standards if the State had an assessment system that had been developed to support the State's education reform efforts, the assessment system provided information about the yearly performance of each Chapter 1 school and could be aggregated for the LEA as a whole, and that information was from at least one grade level in each school, and measured student achievement in basic and more advanced skills and challenging subject matter. The same standards were proposed to apply to the MEP, except that the assessment system would have to provide a statewide estimate of the yearly performance of migratory children in the State, rather than information on individual schools. The NPRM also proposed to permit States to request exceptions for particular LEAs and operating agencies that, absent State systems, have local assessment systems in place that support their education reform efforts and meet these same standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final regulations make the following changes to the NPRM. Most significantly, &sect;&sect;200.90(b) and 201.57(b) have been revised to require that, in addition to the conditions in the NPRM, a State assessment system for which an exception is being requested (1) must yield consistent results that accurately reflect what the assessment system was designed to measure; and (2) does not impair an SEA's or LEA's ability to account for results under Chapter 1 or the MEP. The Secretary has added these standards to ensure that State assessment systems being developed to support systemic education reform efforts are of high quality and that exceptions under these regulations would only be granted if evaluation results provide meaningful indicators about the effectiveness of Chapter 1 and MEP programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, &sect;200.90(b) has been revised to make clear that a State assessment system must provide information from at least one grade level in each Chapter 1 school. Sections 200.90(c) and 201.57(c) have also been revised to clarify that an SEA may seek an exception for LEAs or operating agencies that have assessment systems linked to local reform efforts that meet the same standards that apply to State assessment systems. Finally, &sect;200.80(a) has been revised to correct an erroneous cross-reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations support the efforts of those States that will be voluntarily implementing reform plans under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Goals 2000). Section 306(c) of Goals 2000 requires the reform plans to include a description of the process States will use to develop State assessments aligned with the State's content standards and that the assessments be for all students, including students with diverse learning needs. These regulations will allow States that have assessment systems tied to statewide education reform, developed under Goals 2000 or another reform effort, to avoid duplication by using their statewide assessments for Chapter 1 and MEP purposes if they meet less prescriptive national standards contained in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

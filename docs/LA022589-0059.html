			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICTIM'S KIN ASSAIL DEAL ON SHORTER TERM FOR RAPIST  </P> <P> The family of a USC rape victim blasted the Los Angeles district attorney's  office Friday for negotiating what they called an "outrageous" plea bargain  with the admitted rapist.  </P> <P> The agreement forced Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ernest M. Hiroshige to  choose a prison term of 16 to 22 years for Maurice J. Cornett. The judge  sentenced Cornett to 20 years. Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Sitkoff  said Cornett would have faced up to a 56-year prison term for the rape had he  gone to trial and been convicted.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said the plea bargain was a result of Cornett's full cooperation --  at considerable risk to his own safety -- as a key witness in two gang-related  murder cases.  </P> <P> Before the sentencing, the rape victim, who turned 23 on Thursday and returned  to Los Angeles from Maine for Friday's proceeding, asked to address the court  outside Cornett's presence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refused to Leave  </P> <P> But Cornett, 19, refused to leave the courtroom. Hiroshige then invited the  woman -- the granddaughter of a former USC law dean -- up to the bench for a  private conference.  </P> <P> Outside the courtroom afterward, the woman said she simply wanted to impress  upon the judge "how it put a lot of fear into my life." She said she did not  want Cornett to gain any satisfaction from hearing about her lingering  emotional trauma.  </P> <P> Accompanied by her parents, the woman said afterward that she hopes Cornett  will "experience some of the same fears in prison" that she has endured in the  last 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> The woman, now married, was raped by Cornett at knifepoint in her Troy Hall  dormitory on the night of Aug. 8, 1986. Cornett had been living in the dorm  illegally for six weeks.  </P> <P> Over a two-day period, he burglarized five rooms, in addition to committing the  rape. He was caught by security guards while trying to drive away in the  woman's car, which had a stick shift. He did not know how to drive such a  vehicle.  </P> <P> In another unusual development, a former prosecutor in the murder cases and now  a Los Angeles Municipal Court judge, David Milton, was called to testify on  Cornett's behalf.  </P> <P> Milton explained that the plea bargain was reached because of Cornett's  cooperation as an "indispensable" witness in the two murder cases. Milton  called the plea bargain agreement fair.  </P> <P> Hiroshige also barred a news photographer from taking pictures of Cornett,  saying there is ample evidence that he faces possible retaliation for his  cooperation with prosecutors in the murder cases.  </P> <P> Sitkoff said he too would have preferred to prosecute Cornett but added that it  is paramount that the murderers be brought to justice. Cornett was the sole  eyewitness to one of the shootings in which a mother and her 14-year-old son  were gunned down in their home in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suspect Convicted  </P> <P> Hiroshige had presided over the trial of one of those cases, in which the  killer was convicted and sent to state prison for life without the possibility  of parole. The second case is still pending.  </P> <P> On Friday, the rape victim's uncle addressed the court, speaking on behalf of  her family. The woman's parents also were in the courtroom, as was a woman who  later identified herself as Cornett's girlfriend.  </P> <P> The uncle, David Evans, a Los Angeles attorney, said his family considered the  plea bargain "an outrageous deal." He called Cornett "a racist, Nazi thug."  Evans said Cornett, who is black, had confessed to police that he had wanted to  "do a white girl."  </P> <P> Evans asked Hiroshige to impose the maximum 22 years "to make a gesture that  will help ease our pain."  </P> <P> The judge said he was "very touched" by the plight of the Evans family. But he  said it was "unfortunate" that he now was put "in the middle" of the Cornett  plea-bargain controversy.  </P> <P> In the end, Hiroshige said, "The D.A.s are supposed to know . . . the value of  a case," adding, "When a prosecutor gives me a range (of sentences), I have to  consider it."  </P> <P> Because of his age, Cornett will probably serve most of his term in the  California Youth Authority but will go on to state prison after he turns 25,  Sitkoff said. He could be eligible for parole in about 10 years.  </P> <P> Last month, the Evans family reached a $275,000 out-of-court settlement in a  civil suit against USC.  </P> <P> The rape victim was an honors student in accounting and, at graduation, was  recruited by every one of the country's Big Eight accounting firms, Evans said.  But because of her lingering trauma, the woman has chosen to live in a small  town in Maine.  </P></p>

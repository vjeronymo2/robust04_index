			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANYON DUMP  </P> <P> A dump in Gypsum Canyon would cover 500 acres, or one-half, of Orange County's  rare Tecate cypress forest. Plans shown on county conceptual landfill maps  would cause Tecate cypress to diminish by a significant amount as a species.  </P> <P> Additional rare plants and animals, some of them candidates for federal  endangered-species listing, would also dwindle considerably if this plan were  put into effect.  </P> <P> If the Orange County supervisors are serious about preserving the Tecate  cypress forest, they will reject the proposed Gypsum Canyon landfill in its  entirety.  </P> <P> CONSTANCE SPENGER  </P> <P> President,  </P> <P> Friends of the Tecate Cypress  </P></p>

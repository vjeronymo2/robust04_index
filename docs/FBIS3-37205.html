The anthems of Great Britain and Russia were played. A guard  of honour and a military band marched past the tomb.    The traditional wreath-laying ceremony was an expression of  the British people's gratitude to their ally under the  anti-Hitlerite coalition, to the country that had saved mankind  from fascism.    Duddley Pound, First Lord of the Admiralty of Great Britain,  wrote to Admiral King, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy, on  May 18, 1942, that he deemed it necessary to render every  possible aid to the Russians at that difficult time. These  words attested to the British people's deep realisation of their  allied duty.    The British have contributed immensely to the aid rendered  the Soviet Union in those years. It was marked by unprecedented  scope, courage and solidarity. As many as 78 famous northern  convoys, totalling about 1,500 transport ships, had sailed  thousands of miles to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk through extremely  dangerous waters during the four years of the Great Patriotic  War. They delivered food and military hardware, ammunition and  medicines to the Russian people. Russia will never forget that  Great Britain had sacrificed the lives of many of its sons to  help its Russian allies.</p>

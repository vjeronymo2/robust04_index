			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (18): East Midlands focus was on open system - Utility application / An asset database which would otherwise have needed separate investment, is an extra benefit. Other applications are emerging, from network analysis to project management The need for a GIS evolves, it doesn't happen overnight, says East Midlands Electricity. Like other electricity suppliers, a lot of the information East Midlands Electricity uses in its day-to-day operations is held on maps. Once fully operational, its new system will serve around a thousand end-users via 350 workstations, eventually spreading to 2,000 users including managers, writes Claire Gooding. The company supplies electricity to 2.2m customers in its area, and has a turnover of Pounds 1,570m. Information on cables, voltage, and other assets was spread around different departments, held on paper-based systems including 30,000 different maps, accessed typically 400,000 times a year. Digitising the maps was one option, but the review team in 1992 started with the business need rather than technologies. What emerged was the need to link and network various information, some of it geographical, so that it was truly integrated in all its forms. One priority was an open system, running on several platforms of hardware. 'It took us 12 months to do the evaluation,' explains GIS business manager Alan Wright. 'Above all the products we looked at, Smalltalk linked with other systems, and went beyond mapping and other systems to an integrated information system.' The accent is on distributing the data, with local accessibility. 'Data capture is a massive part of the project,' adds Wright. 'Purification and data accuracy is a vital part of the process, when you're taking data from a number of different sources and different systems: they don't always stay in step.' The company is currently using Ordnance Survey digitised maps as a basis. Once all other information is in place, it will be able to do detailed analysis of the efficiency and stability of its network. The cost benefits are difficult to quantify. Wright sums them up as 'avoidable investments': the effort, and manpower otherwise expended on keeping maps up to date. An asset database is a welcome spin-off that would otherwise have needed a separate investment. Other applications are emerging, ranging from network analysis to wayleave payment management, resource management, planning and scheduling, project management and teamwork. End users have already identified 1,200 specific needs, in every different department. Some Wright dismisses as 'Star Wars' ideas but the majority deal with practical requirements. 'We aim to hold that information in one place and present it as the user wants to see it. The relational database is handy for storing large amounts of data, for instance, types of switch gear, who uses it.' The applications go well beyond the mapping of associated data with the electricity network. 'The advantage is that we put the data where the user is,' says Wright. 'It will grow from an engineering-based to encompass finance and marketing.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay </F> Gur by Razi Barqay; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Barqay] Good day Deputy Defense Minister  Mordekhay Gur.    [Gur] Good afternoon.    [Barqay] Have we gone back to a succession of attacks and  counterattacks?    [Gur] Listen, Hizballah never halted its attacks for even  one moment, day or night. Fortunately for us, some of their  activities fail and the Israeli public never learns about them.  Our soldiers, however, have to suffer them on a permanent  basis. Therefore, we will strike back at them with all the  measures at our disposal.    [Barqay] Have they, in other words, failed from the very  beginning to uphold the famous agreement not to fire Katyushas.    [Gur] They kept the agreement and so did we. The agreement  stipulated that Israel would not shell civilian areas and they  would not shell Israel's borders. We did not fire at any  civilian settlement. We operate against Hizballah in the  framework of the understandings reached after Operation  Accountability [late July 1993]. Today's launching of Katyusha  rockets at Israel was definitely a provocative act by Hizballah  which contravenes the agreement and we will have to examine how  to deal with this matter.    [Barqay] In other words, Mordekhay Gur, today's air force  raid did not infringe upon the understandings?    [Gur] Definitely not, today's attack on enemy targets  without harming civilians is within the parameters of our rights  as part of the war currently being waged there. The attack was  directed purely, completely, and fully against enemy soldiers  belonging to Hizballah. Each one of these soldiers had either  participated in operations against Israel already, or was  preparing to participate in such attacks in the near future.  Therefore, this was a pure military operation which scored an  impressive success.    [Barqay] Did we have prior intelligence information that  dozens of Hizballah personnel would be meeting there?    [Gur] You surely do not expect me to give you an  intelligence briefing now. I can only recommend that all the  Arab armies, especially Lebanon and Syria, take a good look at  how the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] performs not only at  roadblocks or during occasional and regrettable incidents, but  rather when it decides to act and concentrates its capabilities,  know how, intelligence, and technology. When that happens the  IDF knows how to win and it will always emerge victorious.    [Barqay] Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan has proposed expanding  the security zone to preclude the launching of Katyusha rockets.    [Gur] First of all, the Katyusha rockets could always have a  longer range. Second, they can move in long-range artillery and  there is no limit to this. I see absolutely no point in  expanding the security zone. What I most certainly hope for is  that both the Lebanese and the Syrians stop placing obstacles on  the road to peace with Lebanon. The Syrians must also  understand that the time has come for Lebanon, and its citizens  in the southern part of the country, to enjoy some peace. Our  citizens in the north also deserve to have some calm and  tranquility. This could become achievable within a very short  time if the Syrians and Iranians stopped preventing the Lebanese  from reaching an agreement with us.    [Barqay] Do the Katyusha barrages obligate Israel to react?  Perhaps even a ground offensive?    [Gur] I leave that for the government to decide.    [Barqay] But you said that the Katyushas constituted a gross  violation of the agreement.    [Gur] Undoubtedly.    [Barqay] So the region is going to heat up?    [Gur] I did not say what will happen there because Israel  reserves its freedom of action. Last night's operation achieved  tremendous results. Now we can carefully examine what we have  to do. There is no rush. We are not making off the cuff  decisions. We are acting according to the clear and supreme  security interests of the State of Israel.    [Barqay] Did we inform the United States in advance of the  operation?    [Gur] Permit me to ignore any political questions connected  to this affair.    [Barqay] Did we receive any negative feedback from the  Americans following the operation?    [Gur] Not that I know of. Perhaps it is still early. The  entire world knows about Hizballah's activities and is aware of  the support the organization receives from Syria and Iran. The  reaction coming in corresponds to this. The entire world  recognizes Israel's right to protect its sovereignty and enable  its citizens along the northern border to live in peace.    [Barqay] Thank you, Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur.</p>

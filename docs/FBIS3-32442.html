			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 3 Feb (EFE) -- Luis Donaldo Colosio,  the official presidential candidate for the Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI), has said the presidential elections  scheduled for August in Mexico are being threatened by political  forces aimed at "marring the process."    "If we do not work to hold clean elections, there will be  those ready to mar the process and set the stage for conflicts  and negotiations outside the law," Colosio has told his party  members in Colula, a town in Puebla State, central Mexico.    The presidential elections assumed a new meaning after the  Indian uprising that took place on 1 January in Chiapas State,  southeastern Mexico.    The Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) declared war on  the government to demand solutions to poverty and other matters  of political concern related to the presidential elections.    In the 21 August elections, approximately 42 million  registered Mexican voters will elect the president, 300  deputies, and 126 senators among the candidates of nine  political parties.    Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, spokesman of the third  parliamentary  bloc, the opposition PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution],  told EFE today the electoral environment "is weak, given an  outdated legislations was enacted to favor the government party."    Ramirez added: "The current legislation approved in 1993  allows electoral manipulation by the government and its party."    The spokesman has reiterated the need to convene the Mexican  Congress to special sessions to revise the rules on which the  elections are based and to sign an agreement that will guarantee  calm elections.    According to Ramirez Cuellar, the financial ceiling set for  the electoral campaign, fixed at $40 million for each candidate,  "is still too high; besides, there is no strict control" of this.    Another aspect that contributes to the weakening of the  electoral environment, he said, is the media's partiality "to  the extent that we want the media to be regulated so that equal  access" is allowed to all political parties.    PRD President Porfirio Munoz Ledo has said the debate on  political reforms would help the negotiators in Chiapas achieve  true and lasting peace, based on clear and open elections.    Meanwhile, PRI Deputy Juan Ramiro Robledo says his party is  willing to discuss the possibility of holding special sessions,  because "we have a responsibility, and we must find points of  consensus."    The deterioration of the electoral environment increased  after the daily LA JORNADA received anonymous threats from an  anticommunist front for being considered an EZLN mouthpiece.    After the threats, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari expressed his solidarity with the daily.    The Mexican presidential candidates are Luis Dolando  Colosio,  PRI; Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, National Action Party;  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD; Pablo Emilio Madero of the National  Opposition Union; and Cecilia Sot, of the Labor Party; Rafael  Aguilar Talamantes, Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction  Party; Jorge Gonzalez Torres, Mexican Green Ecologist Party;  Marcela Lombardo Toledado, Popular Socialist Party; and Alvaro  Perez Trevino, Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution.</p>

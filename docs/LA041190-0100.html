			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG MAN DIES IN SHOOTING; GANG RIVALRY BLAMED  </P> <P> A young man was shot and killed Tuesday, apparently by a rival gang member, as  he stood on the sidewalk of a residential neighborhood, authorities said.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred about 6:20 p.m. at the corner of Myrtle and Baker  streets, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Bob Clark said.  </P> <P> The victim's name and age were not released. Authorities said he was standing  on the southwest corner of the intersection when a car drove past and a  passenger jumped out and shot him in the chest and neck at close range. The  attacker then ran back to the car, which sped away.  </P> <P> Simone Placentia said she was inside her home with her children when she heard  the shooting.  </P> <P> "I heard the gunfire," Placentia said. "I was running out when a neighbor said:  'Call the paramedics. They shot someone.' By the time I got out there, there  was a crowd around him."  </P> <P> She said the victim had been helping her next-door neighbors clean their house.  </P> <P> An officer at the scene of the shooting said the victim was a known gang  member.  </P> <P> "The two gangs have been fighting recently," said the officer, who requested  anonymity.  </P> <P> Residents of the area said that several gang members have been known to loiter  on the streets but that there have not been many gang-related problems.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lanie Jones contributed to this story.  </P></p>

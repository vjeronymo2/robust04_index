			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Big rise reported in receiverships BRITISH companies are continuing to close down in record numbers, according to new figures from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants. Reporting a further big rise in the number of companies going into receivership, Mr Tim Hayward, KPMG head of corporate recovery, said there was still no sign of the economy emerging from recession. According to KPMG, 1,059 companies were placed in the hands of receivers in the three months to the end of September. The total represented a jump of nearly 12 per cent from the 948 recorded in the previous three months. South-east England took the brunt of the closures, accounting for about 52 per cent. The least affected regions were south Wales and Scotland. The sector worst affected was manufacturing, followed by construction, financial services and retailing. Mr Hayward said a 'dramatic cut' in interest rates was needed to help to stem the tide of business failures. He added: 'Unless the government risks its commitment to reduce inflation and introduces a dramatic reduction in interest rates in order to bring about an increase in consumer confidence, I cannot see recovery happening in the near future.' Mr Hayward warned that exporters would continue to struggle throughout next year.</p>

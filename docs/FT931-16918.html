			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Groups lift share in care homes LARGE profit-making groups of care-home owners increased their share of the long-stay residential home market last year, according to figures published today by Laing &amp; Buisson, the healthcare publisher. A study of private home provision for elderly and physically disabled people shows that large groups provided 13.6 per cent of places last year, compared with 12.1 in 1991. That represents continuing penetration by large corporate and charitable operators in a market once dominated by single-owner homes. The Laing &amp; Buisson study shows that Takare, with 29 homes and 3,607 beds, is the largest corporate provider, followed by Westminster Health Care with 38 homes and 2,478 beds.</p>

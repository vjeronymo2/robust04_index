"Certainly there isn't any extraordinary movement for  refugees across the Durand line (which divides both countries),"  Nayyar Agha, Commissioner Quetta Division told THE MUSLIM.    He said the Home Department did not issue orders to seal  borders or turn back refugees across the country's southern  flanks with Afghanistan.    Meanwhile sources in Afghan Commissionerate when contacted  said that till date, not a single refugee crossed into Chaman  from Southern Qandahar Province.    Sources said civilian fleeing fighting in Kabul were mainly  moving or have settled in Jalalabad city and did not turn to  southern parts of Afghanistan for shelter.    Balochistan remained home to nearly a million Afghans,  though  the figures were widely believed to be exaggerated. Many  refugees returned home when Afghan fighters took over Kabul  after President Najibullah stopped down, but their shuttling  across the borders continued due to sporadic factional clashes  among Afghans for gaining power and arms depots.    APP adds: The planned voluntary repatriation of about 85000  Afghan refugees to Afghanistan via Quetta may not start in April  next if fighting continues in Kabul, UNHCR officials told APP  here Thursday.    The repatriation had earlier postponed due to some  misunderstandings between the Iranian government and the UNHCR  regarding the modalities of delivering repatriation assistance  to refugees.    Only recently the Iranian government agreed to allow the  exodus with the repatriation assistance to refugees be given in  Pakistan before their entry to Afghanistan the immediate  repatriation could not be started in view of the onset of  winters and freezing temperatures in Afghanistan.    If fighting in Kabul and northern Afghanistan stops the  exodus may start some time in the month of April.    The Balochistan route for exodus of these refugees was  chosen  for being safer than those between Iran and Afghanistan.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Highland lifts stake in Remy to 16.1% Highland Distilleries, maker of Famous Grouse Scotch whisky, is to raise its stake in Remy Cointreau, the French cognac, champagne and liqueurs group, from 11.6 per cent to 16.1 per cent through a series of deals, writes Roderick Oram. Highland is achieving this by moving from a 25 per cent stake in a company which had a 46.4 per cent stake in Remy to a 30 per cent stake in a company which has a 53.7 per cent stake. Highland said it would benefit from closer ties with Remy in distribution and other areas of co-operation, and from gaining a more direct stake in the company. The relationship between the groups, which has benefited drinks brands from both companies in a number of country markets, dates back to 1990. The trigger for the deals was the desire by the Heriard Dubreuil family to consolidate its direct and indirect stakes in Remy into a stake in Orpar, Remy's controlling company. Highland will increase its stake in Orpar from 25 per cent to 30 per cent at a cost of Pounds 22.5m. It has also spent Pounds 19.4m to buy Remy shares in the market to maintain its stake when Orpar lifts its investment in Remy from 46.4 per cent to 53.7 per cent. Highland is increasing its stake in Orpar by buying the 50 per cent of HRB Investments it does not already own. The company's sole asset is convertible bonds in Orpar. The seller of HRB is Robertson &amp; Baxter, which will receive 5.42m Highland shares in exchange. This will lift Robertson's stake in Highland from 14.7 per cent to 18.2 per cent. Highland and Robertson, both founded by the same family, have cross shareholdings dating back more than 100 years and operate essentially as an informal group.</p>

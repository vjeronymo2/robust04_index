			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / BT boosted by Japanese link-up A joint venture of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the largest Japanese telecommunications operator, has agreed to distribute international services for British Telecommunications and MCI, the second-largest US long-distance carrier. BT hailed the deal as an advance for Concert, its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) joint venture with MCI launched last month, which is geared to providing multinationals with a one-stop service - global telecom networks from a single supplier. However, regulatory barriers will restrict the range of services Concert can offer in Japan, and the arrangement with Nippon Information and Communication, a small joint venture between NTT and IBM Japan, is far short of the tie-up with NTT which many analysts were seeking to give BT credibility in Asia-Pacific. 'It is not the deal with NTT that people were looking for, although it appears moderately encouraging for BT,' said Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming. The arrangement is non-exclusive, and involves no equity exchange or joint investment. NTT indicated that it did not preclude agreements with BT's rivals. 'We are not aligning ourselves with BT against AT&amp;T or the French and Germans,' said one NTT executive. Concert also announced what it claimed was the first one-stop international corporate telephone service for multinationals, giving it an edge over the other two international telecoms alliances formed in the last year - led by AT&amp;T and by Deutsche Telekom, the German state operator. Mr Alfred Mockett, BT's international director, said the deal reinforced BT's head start on its international competitors, claiming that Concert was six months ahead of its two rival alliances in terms of technology and 12 months ahead in terms of marketing and regulatory approvals. The Japanese deal marks Concert's first notable entry into the Asia-Pacific market, which is critical to its ability to sell itself as a one-stop provider to multinationals. About 20 per cent of the 2,000 multinationals being targetted by Concert have facilities in Japan. AT&amp;T's Worldsource venture, launched at the same time as Concert, has partnerships with KDD, Japan's international operator, Singapore Telecom and Telstra, the Australian national operator. The third of the alliances - between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance operator - has no formal links with Asian operators. Concert said its one-stop international 'voice' service would be available immediately in Australia and the larger EU states, and in the US and Canada later this year. It will be followed this year by a Concert calling card. Lex, Page 18</p>

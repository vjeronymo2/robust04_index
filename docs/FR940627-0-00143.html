			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is also requiring that vehicles and engines used for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing of <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> F/FAs be unaltered from original equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer (OEM) specifications (with the exception of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications in aftertreatment devices as described in Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VI.A). Rebuilds and alteration kits will only be allowed upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's approval, when a F/FA manufacturer demonstrates to EPA that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OEM equipment suitable for their F/FA product's testing is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unavailable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed in the NPRM (57 FR 13192&hyph;13193), vehicle and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine selection must follow the criteria outlined in &sect;79.57(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the accompanying regulations. The selection method is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in detail in a memorandum entitled, ``Vehicle Selection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures for the Proposed Fuels and Fuel Additives Rulemaking''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see Item No. II&hyph;B&hyph;6 in the public docket of this rule). As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed, the final rule does not differentiate between light- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Thus, vehicles/engines are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separated into two classes: light-duty and heavy-duty. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or engine selected must be a new vehicle or engine of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year in which testing begins. However, vehicle selection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria are to be based on technology characteristics of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous model year. Any one of the top five selling models  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (based on sales figures from the year prior to testing) with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate technology in a fuel group may be chosen. Each test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or engine must be equipped with all of the normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required and functioning emission control equipment, with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception of aftertreatment devices, when applicable (see Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VI.A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Considering the practical constraints of the rule, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring that only one vehicle or engine model be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generate emissions for these tiers. Although EPA recognizes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission composition is somewhat dependent on vehicle models and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may even vary in replicate tests of the same vehicle/fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination, the use of untreated exhaust in the testing program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will greatly reduce the significance of these potential sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of variability. The purpose of the testing program is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine potential health effects of <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> F/FA emissions and not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish in-use fleet average emission levels for different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of vehicles. However, EPA reserves the right to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the testing of F/FAs in additional vehicles or engines, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 3, if there is concern for technology-based differences in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicological effects. Furthermore, EPA could require the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyzed exhaust to perform tests under Tier 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although EPA is routinely requiring only one vehicle or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine for the testing of F/FAs, EPA foresees that at least one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backup vehicle/engine of the identical model may be needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace vehicles/engines that wear out or malfunction during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course of testing. The probability of needing a replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or engine increases in the case of testing F/FAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing atypical elements that require additional mileage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulation (see next section). The decision concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timing of vehicle and engine replacements is the responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the F/FA manufacturer seeking registration. EPA recommends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that backup vehicles/engines (if present) accumulate mileage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> along with the primary test vehicle, so as to minimize testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interruptions if the backup vehicle/engine is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers may, at their own discretion, alternate between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backup vehicles (or engines) during testing to further decrease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the probability of problems or interruptions. Similarly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioned vehicles/engines (i.e., primary and backup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle/engine) would be expected to generate comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. Emissions from backup vehicles/engines must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their emissions characterized prior to use in the biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies. Wide discrepancies between the emissions of primary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backup vehicle/engine emissions may be cause to void a test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During emission generation, vehicles and engines must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained in good condition by following the OEM recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for service schedule and parts replacement. If unscheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance becomes necessary, the vehicle or engine must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repaired to OEM specifications, using OEM or OEM-approved parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the manufacturer is required to measure the basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions (as described in Section VII.B.2.a) after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unscheduled maintenance and before resuming testing, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that the post-maintenance emissions are within 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of pre-maintenance emission levels. If the basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions cannot be brought within 20 percent of their previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels, then the manufacturer must restart testing using a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or engine. Provisions in the regulations allow for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited amount of emission generation disruption without voiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the biological test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Mileage Accumulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New vehicles (or engines) to be used in emission generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the testing of F/FAs are required to undergo a break-in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period in which the vehicle (or engine) is run exclusively on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel or additive/base fuel mixture to be tested. The mileage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulation requirements of this final rule follow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches discussed in the Reopening Notice. These requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve the purpose of stabilizing the emissions from the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

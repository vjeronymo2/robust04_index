			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Credit where credit is due: The UK's foreign loan deal Britain's plan to borrow some Pounds 7.27bn worth of foreign currency to support the pound was completed, where it began, in the Bank of England last night. The agreements for the UK to borrow Ecu 10bn worth of foreign currencies over the next seven months were signed in the Bank at 5 o'clock yesterday. For once, the choice of venue turned out to be a case of giving credit where credit was due. For the first proposals for the large-scale currency borrowing that was announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, on Thursday, were crafted by officials of the Bank's markets division less than three weeks before. The markets division is the pride and joy of Mr Eddie George, the Bank's deputy governor, who represented the Bank at yesterday's ceremony. Sir Terry Burns, the permanent secretary to the Treasury, deputised for the chancellor. Also in attendance were the chief executives of the banks that have agreed to provide the funds. Although some of the euphoria that greeted the plan in financial markets on Thursday subsided following the announcement of yesterday's extremely poor US employment figures, it still proved its worth. Sterling, which only a few days before had been heading towards its DM2.7780 floor in the European exchange rate mechanism, closed in London last night at DM2.80, unchanged from Thursday evening's level. Officials involved in crafting the plan said it would be wrong to see the borrowing as a crisis response to the extreme weakness of sterling in the ERM in the week beginning August 24. The Bank first put forward the idea of a large-scale borrowing in Deutschmarks and other currencies that would be converted into sterling during the previous week with medium-term problems in mind. It wanted to build in a cushion of support for the pound ahead of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20 and to protect it from further weakness of the dollar - a contingency that arose again yesterday. The idea was taken up in the Treasury by Mr Paul Gray, undersecretary in change of the monetary policy group. Mr Lamont took up the proposal immediately on his return from holiday on August 24. It was around this time that the Bundesbank was advised of the UK's wish to borrow D-marks. But by this time sterling was spiralling downwards. The monetary authorities responded by intervening in its support but this proved ineffective, as did the chancellor's attempt to 'talk up' the pound on the Treasury steps on August 27. 'The plan was not born out of a feeling that we were looking over an abyss,' recalled one of the officials closely involved in the borrowing. 'In fact that week of fire-fighting was a bit of a distraction.' At the Bank, Mr Ian Plenderleith, an associate director responsible for managing the UK's foreign currency reserves, was the prime mover behind the scheme, although the Bank was reluctant yesterday to discuss details of its involvement. Executives of the four clearing banks, Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds and Midland, were called in to see Mr Plenderleith on Wednesday August 26. Though the governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, was not present at the meeting, he was kept closely informed during his summer holiday of developments on Friday. The telephone wires to his country estate, Torry Hill, were 'humming', in the words of a Bank of England official. The clearing bankers present at the initial meeting were Mr Peter Wood of Barclays, Mr John Davies of Lloyds, Mr Roger Byatt of NatWest and Mr Keith Whitson of Midland. They were told that the government wished to borrow Ecu 5bn and that the proceeds would be drawn in D-Marks. 'There was no hesitation on our part about whether the money should be made available,' said a clearing banker involved in the talks. However, three days of negotiations were required to establish the terms of the deal. These negotiations were quite complicated because there were no precedent for a Ecu bank loan to a government on this scale. 'We all felt that the key consideration was the the deal should receive a favourable reception in the market,' said another banker. 'On the other hand, we were not going to roll over and do the deal at the price chosen by the government.' Another banker said: 'There was a free and frank exchange of views.' Detailed negotiations began the following day and were not completed until Friday last week. Banks argued they needed a wider margin over the benchmark London rate, Libor, than that paid on a recent European Community loan, because many banks had refused to participate in that EC loan. In the event they got a more generous interest rate of  3/32 of a point over the Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate. Although satisfactory to the government, bankers were concerned that it might face accusations that the money was too dear. Having reached agreement, the Bank of England then had to get the Treasury's agreement to the deal, which it received over the weekend. With the Treasury's assent, the four clearing banks then sought out other banks to join the deal. In the event, the four clearers provided Ecu 850m each. Another eight banks  -J P Morgan of the US, Union Bank of Switzerland, Credit Lyonnais of France, Bank of Tokyo, and four German banks, Deutsche, Dresdner, Commerzbank and Westdeutsche Landesbank - each provided Ecu 150m. A final group of six UK banks - Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale, TSB, Abbey National and Standard Chartered - each provided Ecu 50m. The deal was completed by Wednesday evening. 'I have no idea why the Treasury waited till Thursday afternoon before announcing it,' said a banker. In fact, the Treasury wanted to announce the deal when the markets were relatively calm. It also wished to keep its impact separate from Wednesday's disclosure of a Dollars 1.3bn drop in UK gold and foreign currency reserves in August. This was to stress that the latest borrowing was qualitatively different from previous foreign borrowings, made to boost the reserves. Thursday's enthusiastic reception for the plan on the markets showed that it had achieved this objective. Yesterday's new tribulations surrounding the dollar showed that the Treasury was right to move when it had the chance.</p>

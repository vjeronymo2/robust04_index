			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Move for Polish watchdog Mr Leslaw Paga, head of Poland's securities commission, is leaving to join Deloitte Touche Komatsu, the international accounting firm. Mr Paga was one of the authors of Poland's stock market legislation and has headed the commission since it was established three years ago. Under his supervision the Warsaw stock market has been free of the scandals which have bedevilled Poland's private banking sector. The commission has policed the market in conjunction with the stock exchange council and taken the number of companies quoted on the bourse from five in 1991 to the current 32. Mr Paga's successor, yet to be appointed, will have to face the problems of developing a market with a mass of individual investors but few domestic institutional participants and no investment banks. Yesterday Mr Paga said that he was leaving because he felt 'my mission has been fulfilled'. Bilfinger und Berger, one of Germany largest construction companies, has agreed to pay Dollars 7m for 70 per cent of Hydrobudowa 6, a Polish construction company with experience in gas pipeline work in the former Soviet Union. PBR, the Polish development bank, is to take a further 10 per cent share and both investors will put DM14m (Dollars 8.9m) into the company.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finland and apparently also the other countries  seeking membership in the European Union [EU] are still trying  to bring about a solution in the EU negotiations. An hour ago  the Finnish delegation met the EU representatives, who are due  to convene any minute now. Overall, the situation in Brussels  is really confusing. At about 0800 it was still being indicated  that extra time would be allowed for the membership talks. It  was said that the talks have been suspended and are due to be  continued in a week's time.    After long and difficult negotiations, the candidate members  and the EU have not been able to reach an understanding.  Greece, the current EU chairman, had already announced in the  early hours the EU is seeking to reach agreement with each  candidate member in parallel.    The Finnish EU negotiating delegation has announced that,  unless the situation clarifies in the morning, the negotiators  will have no other option but to return home. The Finnish  attitude to the situation is not yet known. At about midnight,  empowered by the government, Finland put forward a new  negotiation offer to the EU. In this offer Finland compromised  somewhat on its original demands. The EU rejected the offer and  the government, which had convened in Helsinki, dispersed. The  Finnish Government has just met to receive the latest  information about the negotiations in Brussels. The government  is studying the situation at the EU membership negotiations in  the Council of State banqueting suite.</p>

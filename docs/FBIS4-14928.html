			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 14, 28 Mar - 3 </F> Apr 94]    [Text] A consortium of US firms (TFPS) is reported to have  drafted a comprehensive program for US industrial applications  of Paton-designed electronic-beam vapor-coating spray  technologies. This technology is said to be a dual-purpose one  allowing both civilian and military applications.    The program is divided into two parts, each embracing a  two-year period, and provides for acquisition of Paton  technologies through the agency of the US University for Unified  Research Partner Relations.    The Ukrainian Institute's technology is preliminary  evaluated  at 10 million dollars. Its application financial effect on  seven branches of the US national economy, as American experts  believe, may be in excess of 7 billion dollars within a decade  with total implementation costs estimated at 10 million dollars.    The impressive project's implementation is supposed to  require establishment of several joint ventures for promotion of  Paton's technology in the US engineering, shipbuilding,  aerospace and automaking industries, as well as in the nuclear  power and medical industries and sport accessories manufacture.    In April 1993, the Paton Institute signed an agreement with  Pratt &amp; Whitney (United Technology Corp.'s division) to set  up a  joint venture [jv] for space manufacture of metals and ceramics,  which is hardly feasible under the earth conditions. The jv's  aggregate authorized fund is stated at one billion US dollars  with each party's 50 per cent share in it. The Ukrainian  party's contribution is expressed in its specialized equipment,  production areas and intellectual property.    Pratt &amp; Whitney, whose main speciality is aircraft,  particularly, Boeing, engine design and construction, supplied a  part of the equipment and did the bulk of financing.    Within the project's framework a research center will be set  up in Kiev to develop new space material manufacture  technologies based on the processes underlying electronic-beam  vapor-coating spraying. Originally the US side contemplated its  participation in the center's work during a five-year period.  After it scrutinized the center's R&amp;D the US party signed an  agreement in February 1994 extending the period to another five  year term.    In January 1994, the jv's R&amp;D center, which employs  about 30  fellow researchers in Kiev, was complemented with a pilot  production facility staffed by over 50-strong personnel, which  is a former workshop of a special electric metallurgical  factory, Mikhail Koklyuchenko, jv C.E.O., disclosed in an  interview to UKRINFORM.    This pilot facility has embarked on specimen manufacture of  some materials intended for spraying metallic and ceramic  durable coatings.    According to Mr. Koklyuchenko, their serial production will  start in 1994 to continue in several years to come. As he  maintains, they will find broad and versatile applications in  both Ukraine and the USA, in view of which the jv expects  numerous contracts to be signed shortly for their supplies.    The Yevgeniy Paton Arc Welding Institute under the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences was founded back in 1924, and has been among  the world's leaders in this field ever since.    The electron-beam technology has been developed and improved  for over two decades by now.    In addition to its numerous and broad fundamental studies  the  Institute has performed minor applied researches in arc welding  engineer, as well as equipment and material manufacture for its  multitudinous domestic and foreign customers.    The Paton Institute's ramified substructure includes the  Institute per se, which focuses on major research and  fundamental theoretical studies, a pilot plant for arc welding  equipment manufacture and specimen trials, a pilot plant for  welding materials and technology testing, a pilot plant for  special electric metallurgical engineering applications, a  design and technological bureau with a pilot facility, and six  engineering centers.    Initially, the jv's authorized fund amounted to about 60,000  dollars with each party's share of 50 per cent.    Patonweld experts suggested four marketing directions to  sell  Ukrainian technologies internationally. In late 1993, AT&amp;T  made  and delivered specifically ordered 18 tons of powder for  tear-resistant coatings to the partners.    To implement the jv's projects the Ukrainian party resorted  to the services of the Torez factory of fusion coatings in the  Donetsk region. (There were only two such factories in the  former Soviet Union. The other one was located in Russia's Tula  near Moscow).    Presently, Patonweld is said to have manufactured 40 tons of  special powders.    However, as Petr Kuznetsov, the jv's spokesperson, tipped  off  to UKRINFORM, recently changed export procedures and  introduction of the so-called specifically designated exporters  hamper powder shipment to the jv's customers abroad. Averaged  world market prices for such powders based on high-carbon  compounds are about 1,200 USD per ton.    As Mr. Kuznetsov tends to believe, the jv's future activity  will hinge on precisely exports of domestically designed and  manufactured materials and products.</p>

Political work -- in its noblest form -- seeks to create the  opportunities and conditions to achieve the basic human  aspiration of true happiness.    This higher objective of politics becomes more evident in  countries like ours, where government actions many times play a  decisive role in people's destiny.    Yesterday, I became the president of all Chileans  [applause],  and I now announce the way in which I will conduct the national  community in this march toward solidarity, justice, and freedom.    My position stems from Chilean history, and I will seek to  answer the following question: On what foundations should we  base the new meaning of our mission? It is essential to listen  to our heroes, to our poets, and to our saints.    General Bernardo O'Higgins is behind me; Minister Diego  Portales is in front of me; Captain Arturo Prat is further away,  near the sea. They are the nation's liberators, the builders of  the Republic, and the heros of the Republic. They remind us of  our tradition of honor, dignity, sacrifice, and the impersonal  nature of power.    Can you here the noise of the boys and girls of Elqui [a  region in Chile], preaching to the kingdom of children around  the earth? Do you know that in every language and in every city  of the world a poet is singing verses of love for the women and  men of all races and cultures?    Can you see Father Eduardo Hurtado [whose canonization has  been requested] crossing Mapocho River bridges, gathering the  children who choose hope and the city as their home?    We have many heroes, poets, and saints in whom we can find  the inspiration to give dignity to our lives and to the lives of  all our fellow countrymen. There are many, and they belong to  us all.    Chile has recovered its tradition. We are the children of a  single historical adventure, the heirs of a single, powerful  will to be.    A stage ended yesterday: Under President Aylwin's patriotic  leadership we achieved national reconciliation. [applause]    Now we can look each other in the eye and shake hands with  peace in our spirits.    In all collective tasks, the director should indicate his  style of work. With even more reason, a president must explain  the exercise of power to his assistants, to the citizens who  support him, to those who oppose him, and even to those who are  indifferent.    First, I will exercise authority, that is, legitimate  democratic power. I will respect the principle of authority,  the majesty of the law, and the impersonal nature of power, and  I will have them respected.    I make an appeal for order to avoid confusion. I will speak  little, yet I will act firmly. [applause]    I must be very clear concerning authority. I will exercise  the powers of president in the presidential system of government  under the rules of which I was elected. Reforms in the  political system, if there are any, will take place in the  future. It is necessary, however, to end the illusion of  reducing authority.    In nearly all countries of the world the public is demanding  an increase in authority, in light of the large number of  corporate interests, the rule of parties, and the de facto  powers of individuals and groups.    As always, Chile requires authority above individual  perspectives and the interests of groups.    I will be the president of all Chileans and the supreme  commander of the Armed Forces, as a symbol of national unity.  [applause]    Second, under a democratic system, the opposition has the  double task of achieving consensus and exercising criticism. I  call upon the leaders of the opposition parties to fully meet  their responsibilities. Our country requires both their  cooperation, in drawing up the state's policies, and their  supervision in order to correct mistakes and failings.    I call upon them to persevere in the quest for civilized  dialogue, in which mutual respect, civic friendship, and joint  patriotism prevail.    My heart is free of resentment and rancor, it is open to all  spiritual and political families of our nation.    New time brings new demands. Broad transformations in our  country and in the world have made democracy and development  face a superior phase of evolution.    New times compel us to rethink our style of government. That  is why this evening, rather than outlining the specific  objective of our program -- which has been widely publicized and  made known to all Chileans during the electoral campaign -- I  wish to concentrate on the style of work that I will demand of  myself and of all my assistants within the government.    I want my government to be particularly alert to the needs  and concerns of the people. The people's needs should be our  needs. The heart and the eyes of this government should focus on  the routine life of Chilean people. [applause]    Let us not allow government work isolate us in our offices.  Let us not assume that things must be handled in the way a  small group of people say. Let us go meet people, listen to  them. Let us not be afraid of criticism. Let us check offices,  schools, enterprises, hospitals, and administrative methods.    Let us invite people and the broader sector to participate.  Let us cast off any traces of sectarianism, bureaucracy, or  statism. Let us join efforts to solve the real problems of each  Chilean.    I will be the first to do this, and I call upon my  assistants  to adopt the same style. I will be a president in-the-field, on  a permanent campaign, not to gain votes, but to be up to date  with the concerns of my country and to make government action  dynamic. [applause]    Another attitude that must be adopted all over the nation --  in the central, regional, and municipal governments -- is that  of devotion to work. This means to do things well, with  diligence, and with special care for detail.    All sluggishness should be eliminated, from the most  important to the most insignificant. No streets with garbage,  no place without ornaments, no dead trees.    In the fight against uncivilized apathy, the government must  be the example.    I want those in charge to know every detail of the services  for which they are responsible, to identify their weak points,  and to adopt measures to correct deficiencies.    I do not want study and analysis to become an excuse for  indefinite postponement of decisions. I do not want perpetual  delays to projects that are vital for entire cities. [applause]    You have many times seen teams working and achieving fine  results for people, and others -- with the same resources --  simply dragging their feet and accumulating problems. I want  this difference to stop. The entire administration should  become a working mechanism that systematically improves the  quality of its operation and its decisions.    I want relations between citizens and the administration to  be based on maximum respect for people, especially if they are  old, poor, weak, or sick. [applause]    Routine administration service is the minimum that a  democracy should offer its citizens, whose dignity stems from  the mere fact of being fellow countrymen. A well-completed job  considers details, respects citizens, and -- above all --  efficiently serves them.    Our work must be transparent, without nebulous or dark  corners. Let us work with our faces toward the country, and with  frankness. Let us tackle problems instead of burying them. Let  us maintain our style of never promising what we are unable to  fulfill. This will be our best guarantee for the people.  [applause]    I want an honest fulfillment of public functions. Our  society fully disapproves of public officials who profit by or  misuse resources that belong to all Chileans. [applause]    We need to convert this consensus into a will for action. I  expect officials to be accurately aware of what is happening in  their respective services, departments, and units, because it is  part of their responsibilities.    As president I will strictly counter any action that  perverts  the true sense of public service. In this field I do not want  any indulgence, no matter how difficult it will be to face  bitter realities. It is better to act firmly today than to be  swamped tomorrow by a nationwide practice of corruption.    I want to clearly say that I will not yield to any type of  pressure in order to stop these nefarious practices. I will be  a president with a firm hand against corruption. [applause]    In this task, the practice of the impersonal nature of power  will be very useful. In everyday practice, Chileans must be  equal before the law, in big and small issues, in paying taxes,  and in paying traffic fines. If power is not impersonal, we  will be building the foundation of corruption, a scourge that  once unleashed ravages all possibilities of properly running a  state.    The style of this new administration stems from the  spiritual  meaning of our action.    The objective of the fight against poverty, which faces the  danger of becoming rhetorical, must be clearly outlined. This  is an all-encompassing fight. It calls for advanced science and  technology. Yet above all it calls for sound ethics.    The poor who demand immediate action are the poorest among  the poor. They are spread in the countryside and in the  outskirts of our cities. They have been punished, generation  after generation.    Their dignity must be returned to them, and the price of  this  work is constant, systematic sacrifice. It is not enough to  allocate subsidies to eliminate poverty. Routine practice,  procedures, priorities, and policies must be modified.    I call upon all Chileans -- especially women and the youth  --  to devote their best energies to free the poor from their  slavery, thus making their own life more noble by fulfilling a  noble mission. [applause]    Chileans: I am aware that this style of government is  demanding. Yet you, who were elected to accompany me in this  task, were chosen to work for the good of people.    You were elected to break barriers and problems, and to  tirelessly work.    To govern is a nice task in which our energies are used for  serving our fellow countrymen, and this is our main reward.    I think I have clearly outlined the style that I want for my  government, and -- within this framework and in this long effort  -- my team will always have my confidence, support, and  encouragement.    Let me now say a few words about our relations with the  international community.    From time immemorial, we Chileans have lived with the  mentality of island dwellers. Now the world is one, and we must  trade products and services with all nations.    Likewise, our culture is exposed to all the influences of  the  international centers of power. Our nation can no longer seek  refuge between the mountains and the sea. We have unavoidable  requirements and international obligations.    The globalization of the economy requires from us an  effective performance in all our world's markets, under all  skies, within all cultures, in all languages.    The entire world was very generous with Chile at a time when  Chile was in pain and division. We must return what we have  received, with increased solidarity. [applause]    Our main duties involve the Latin American community, our  neighborhood in the international community. My administration  will dedicate its best efforts to enhancing ties with countries  in our region. The key to success lies in transforming the  diversity of the Latin American peoples into unified goals, in  order to bolster our economies, improve our sovereignties, and  have a say in the community of nations.    We call ourselves brothers, and we will prove it with  friendship and mutual cooperation.    Fellow countrymen: Being president is not an easy task. I am  aware that as president I will face disappointments, that many  times I will feel the heavy burden of major decisions, and also  the distress of being unable to do anything else.    To overcome the loneliness of power, I want to recall the  faces of thousands of Chileans who have accompanied me in  countless days.    I want to recall the peasants who have expressed their hope  to me, the youth who have talked to me about their dreams, the  humble housewife who opened the doors of her house to me. I  want to recall the workers who in factories and mines told me:  You can always count on our support.    This will be the great force that will accompany me during  these years, the force to which I will always return for  strength.    This nation, these people have given me multitudinous,  systematic support. I opened that door [he points at La Moneda  Palace] with overwhelming electoral support. I have received  all types of expressions of support, backing, and confidence. I  heard my name being said on streets and squares. I have reached  a very high position.    But from this high position I can hear my father's voice, 30  years ago, repeating an old proverb: You placed me in a very  high position, but you have abandoned me.    This evening, with deep humbleness, I ask you: Do not  abandon  me, always accompany me, at the service of the nation. Thank  you very much. Long live Chile! [applause]</p>

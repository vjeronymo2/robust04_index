			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Vote cheers Nordic business and political leaders THE DANISH referendum result was welcomed by Nordic politicians and business leaders, who believe it will speed up their countries EC membership talks and have a positive influence on sceptical public opinion. Sweden, Norway and Finland are all due to hold referendums on EC membership in the next two years. 'With a Danish No it would have been very difficult to get a Yes in Sweden,' said Mr Bengt Westerberg, Sweden's deputy prime minister. The result was also welcomed by Norwegian prime minister Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland although she warned that 'the issues we face are very different from those faced by the Danes. We are preoccupied with energy, fish and regional policy.' However, with popular opinion in both Sweden and Norway against membership, politicians in both countries face a difficult task in taking their countries into the community. Some believe they may be forced to seek Danish style opt-outs to take their electorates with them. An opinion poll published in Norway yesterday showed 51 per cent of the electorate against membership, four percentage points more than in April, with only 30 per cent in favour. A recent Swedish opinion poll showed 44 per cent of voters against the EC, with 34 per cent in favour. The anti-vote in the country has ranged between 41 and 53 per cent since Denmark's first vote on Maastricht last June. Relief over the outcome of the vote was underlined by Mrs Kaci Kullman Five, leader of Norway's pro-EC opposition Conservative party. She said: 'If the Danes had voted No, opposition in Norway would have been irreversible.' Business leaders reacted positively to the news. Mr Magnus Lemmel, director general of the Swedish Federation of Industries said: 'EC membership is very important for us. We need to have exactly the same terms as our competitors. We cannot afford to be discriminated against.' But those opposing membership were not disheartened by the vote. Ms Eva Britt Svensson, chairwoman of Sweden's 'No to the EC' group, predicted that the Danish vote would further swing Swedish public opinion against the community. 'People will realise that its political, monetary and economic union they are voting for and not the EC,' she stated. Sweden and Finland began negotiations on EC membership in February, and are hoping to join the community in 1995. Norway, which rejected membership in 1972, began fresh negotiations on membership last month. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the leader of Sweden's opposition Social Democrat party, said the Danes had taken a 'wise decision' which would open the way 'for a common European fight against unemployment and social and union rights'.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO CONTEMPORARY RAP  </P> <P> Fat gold chains, expensive track suits and major-league egos -- once the  stereotypical trademarks of rap music -- are rumbling in the face of a fresh  ainflux of creative young rhymers whose styles are as varied as their  birthplaces. They flaunt humor, intelligence and style without losing a step on  the dance floor.  </P> <P> Here are 10 introductions to what's happening now in rap -- in order of  preference:  </P> <P> De La Soul's "Three Feet High and Rising" (Tommy Boy) -- This Long Island trio  launches its self-proclaimed "Daisy Age" with this madcap masterpiece. Throwing  together samples of early '70s soul, imaginative dance-inducing drum beats and  even Steely Dan riffs in a kind of psychedelic collage, rhymers Pos and Dove  deliver smart, sometimes cryptic verses about everything from gardening to sex.  </P> <P> The Jungle Brothers' "Straight Out the Jungle" (Idlers) -- From romance to  racism, the JB's tell it like it is with a charismatic and suave funkiness.  "Behind the Bush" is a lush, seductive groove that rivals Marvin Gaye's most  persuasive efforts and "Black Is Black" discourses on black unity over a  seriously funky soul beat.  </P> <P> Tone Loc's "Loc'ed After Dark" (Delicious Vinyl) -- Imagine the shock in New  York: The biggest-selling rap single ever (the irresistibly danceable "Wild  Thing") comes out of Los Angeles. The follow-up, the equally infectious "Funky  Cold Medina," is also rocketing up the charts.  </P> <P> Boogie Down Productions' "By All Means Necessary" (Jive/RCA) -- BDP's Chris  Parker, known as KRS-One "teaches but never preaches," with themes of  positivity and non-violence. The single "Stop the Violence" initiated a new era  of community involvement for fellow rappers, and rocked dance floors and  airwaves throughout urban America, while "My Philosophy" lays down some South  Bronx-style truths.  </P> <P> Shinehead's "Unity" (Elektra) -- Shinehead was born in Jamaica and bred in the  Bronx, personifying a newly emerging hip-hop style that blends Caribbean  "toasting," an early '60s rap predecessor, with New York-style beats. "Who The  Cap Fits" tips its hat to Bob Marley and "Unity" borrows a chorus section from  the Beatles' "Come Together."  </P> <P> Public Enemy's "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back" (Def  Jam/Columbia) -- Public Enemy took the rap scene by storm with their radical  political line and hard-driving beats. Selling hundreds of thousands of records  with little or no radio airplay, rhymer Chuck D and sidekick Flavor Flav have  their fingers on the pulse of urban youth, reflecting rage, rhythm and  discontent.  </P> <P> N.W.A's "Straight Outta Compton" (Ruthless) -- This five-man posse from Compton  spins some shockingly intense tales of life in the "panic zone." Songs like  "Gangsta Gangsta" and "Dopeman" may make parents squirm, but the group does  present a steely-eyed vision of reality that's a blast to dance to.  </P> <P> Eric B. &amp; Rakim's "Follow The Leader" (Uni/MCA) -- In terms of pure  technique, all the rap world looks up to the smoothly sophisticated style of  Rakim. This latest album finds the two at their best with superbly produced and  performed selections like "Follow the Leader," "Lyrics of Fury," and "The R."  </P> <P> Gang Starr's "No More Mr. Nice Guy" (Wild Pitch) -- The son of a municipal  court judge, this New Yorker lays down the law for kids who see rap as "black  America's radio station." Songs such as "Knowledge," "Positivity," and "Cause  and Effect" are more concerned with educating and relating than with egos and  bragging; using hot soul-flavored dance beats and infusions of jazz.  </P> <P> The Wee Papa Girls' "The Beat, the Rhyme, the Noise" (Jive/RCA) -- The  fashionable English duo pioneered the use of disco-style "house" music beats in  rap with "Heat It Up" and also flaunt reggae, funk, and even acid styles.  Producer Teddy Riley, who broke acts like Bobby Brown and Keith Sweat, produces  the girls' rap version of the George Michael hit "Faith," which was a major hit  overseas. Disco rap? Why not?  </P></p>

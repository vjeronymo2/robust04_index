			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UN chief accepts resignation of Somalia envoy MR BOUTROS Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday accepted the resignation of his outspoken special envoy in Somalia, Mr Mohammad Sahnoun, further complicating already difficult international peace-making efforts there. Mr Ismat Kittani, a retired official from Iraq, is the secretary-general's nominee to replace Mr Sahnoun, diplomats disclosed last night following a closed meeting of the Security Council. A Kurd, Mr Kittani is a former president of the UN General Assembly who served earlier in his long diplomatic career as chief of staff in the UN Secretariat under Mr Kurt Waldheim. Mr Sahnoun, a highly regarded former Algerian ambassador to Washington and Paris, incurred the UN chief's displeasure for his critical remarks about the alleged mishandling of the Somalia tragedy by the international community. In a recent television interview, he said the tardy UN response as Somali children were dying by the thousands in a country racked by famine, anarchy and civil war, should be the subject of a full-scale investigation. UN relief officials protested at his remarks and Mr Boutros Ghali, who has himself criticised the delays, was forced to reprimand his representative. With the US, Britain and France, all admirers of Mr Sahnoun's political skills, eager to defuse the row it had been hoped that he would withdraw his resignation. Mr Sahnoun confirmed his departure at a tearful news conference in Mogadishu and left for Kenya after eight months as special representative. Relief workers in Somalia mourned his departure and said he was a casualty of the very bureaucracy he blamed for failing to save hundreds of thousands of lives. 'It was no wish of mine to leave Somalia and all the wonderful people who have given, and continue to give, at great risk to themselves, their time and energy to save the lives of the starving populations of Somalia,' Mr Sahnoun said on departure from Mogadishu. He said he had vainly offered 'despite bitter experiences with the UN' to stay on temporarily to help deployment of UN relief guards in Somalia and a national reconciliation conference he was organising. He said he would continue to work with private relief organisations.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Why Wall Street lost its balance - Perhaps the only puzzle is that it did not happen sooner With one foot on firm economic ground and the other on a drifting bond market, Wall Street finally lost its balance and took a ducking this week. The only puzzle, perhaps, is that it did not happen two or three months ago. Regular readers will know that I have been pursuing two or three distinct but connected capital market themes for most of this year. Wall Street's correction takes the story into a new chapter. One regular theme has been the worrying imbalance between the yields on fixed-interest bonds and equities as bonds worldwide have plunged into a severe bear market but stock markets have been reluctant to follow. Wall Street has stood out as a gravity-defying phenomenon: at the beginning of this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was still showing a gain of 2 per cent on the year thus far. A second strand has been the impact of rising US short-term interest rates on the dollar bond market which, by the beginning of this year, was inflated dangerously by credit-financed speculation and massive positions in derivatives. At the beginning of February, US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said he would cease pumping up the financial economy with cheap 3 per cent credit, and would raise short-term interest rates progressively to a normal level. So far, he has got to 5 1/2 per cent and, with the US economy still booming, plainly he has not finished yet. Bonds have been weak all year as the leveraged positions have been unwound, and the recent drift up in the US Treasury 30-year bond yield from 8.0 to 8.2 per cent has finally cracked in the equity market. Third, international flows of funds have been following a perverse pattern. Long-term investors around the world have been refusing to finance the extravagant habits of the Americans, reflected in a balance of payments deficit likely to be Dollars 150bn for 1994. At the same time, Americans have been trying to diversify their pension and mutual fund portfolios by buying foreign equities, notably in the fashionable emerging markets of the Far East and Latin America. This has added greatly to the overall external capital needed to balance the US books. The Japanese - who, obligingly, financed the US deficits in the 1980s and lost a lot of money by doing so - have sat on their cash at home. So, the dollar financing gap has been plugged largely through intervention by Far Eastern central banks anxious that their currencies should not appreciate too fast: they have been big buyers of US Treasury bonds. Even so, the apparent one-way bet at the beginning of the year - that the dollar would climb along with interest rates - has gone seriously wrong. The further the dollar has fallen, the cleverer the Americans feel they are to push money overseas, and the more reluctant are the Japanese to throw good money after bad. From a low point in the summer, however, some of the stock markets around the world have tried to rally. The emerging markets, for instance, completed their shake-out in June and, by September, the IFC index of 24 national markets was showing a recovery of 22 per cent. Even Wall Street got back to within about 1 per cent of its all-time high as recently as October 28. But this second minor bubble in equities has now blown up: Hong Kong lost 4.3 per cent on Wednesday alone and even Tokyo, normally resistant to international trends, dipped to its lowest levels since January. Markets are being teased by the surprising strength of the global economy which, led by the US and the Asian tigers, is heading towards growth of something like 4 per cent. The implications for profits and dividends are plainly good, but interest rates and inflation may go up. So, the relationship between gilts and equities has been stretched, and this week reached breaking point. There is, however, something very odd about this recovery: it is not being stimulated by bank lending. (In most countries, banks are struggling to find new business; in the UK, for instance, the housing market is remarkably sluggish as mortgage lending stagnates). Instead, the finance is flowing through the capital markets. This, especially in Europe, is leading to a lop-sided expansion, with companies full of cash but consumer spending relatively subdued. This absence of credit stimulation is a good reason for believing that inflation will stay low. But there is an accompanying worry that the recovery will be short-lived. Exports and capital investment cannot keep the economy booming healthily on their own without buoyancy in consumer spending. The immediate reason for the crack in US equities might thus be that investors cannot any longer believe that profits' growth in the next few years will be high enough to justify the enormous income gap between shares (yielding under 3 per cent) and government bonds (around 8 per cent). Looking a little further out, moreover, a structural shortage of demand for US equities seems likely to develop. As interest rates rise, mutual-fund buyers will drift back to their normal safe haven of savings deposits (this has already happened with bond funds). The US bond markets will continue to absorb a disproportionate share of the available capital flows as the national taste for borrowing collides with a low savings rate. Eventually, money for equities will appear from somewhere: foreign buyers will probably move back into Wall Street stocks, which they have shunned for several years because they have been too expensive. British pension funds, for instance, have only 4.8 per cent of their portfolios in US equities, compared with 9.7 per cent in the Far East and 8.1 per cent in continental Europe. But US equities will have become quite substantially cheaper before this shift will seem attractive to foreigners. Wall Street has taken a plunge. Now we shall see if it can swim.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- China produced 240  million tons of coal in the first three months of this year, up  6.5 percent over the corresponding period last year.    An official from the Ministry of Coal Industry said that in  the first quarter of this year, state-owned key coal mines  yielded 110 million tons, whereas local and township mines  turned out 130 million tons, 12 percent more than in the same  period last year.    He said that in general, the overall coal production of  state- owned mines remained at the same level as last year;  however, the developments of these mines varied in different  regions.    The coal output went up in the regions with relatively  developed industries and advantageous transport, but showed a  downward trend wherever the railways were clogged, he explained.    He said the output of the local and township mines continued  to grow, but there remained a lot to be done to "rectify,  transform, unite and upgrade" the township mines.    Coal has been the main energy in China, accounting for over  70 percent of the country's consumption of primary energy  sources. Fierce competition in the coal markets has been waged  by producers since the government lifted price controls at the  beginning of this year.    It is expected that the total output of coal will reach 1.16  billion tons this year.    The coal ministry said that it would exercise control over  the aggregate production, restructure coal products and raise  the economic efficiency of the industry.</p>

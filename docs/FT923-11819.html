			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Ex-king may be tempted back Michael of Hohenzollern, the former king of Romania, has said he will consider initiatives aimed at bringing him back to the country as sovereign, writes Virginia Marsh from Bucharest. The ex-king's statement appears to rule out the possibility he will run for president in elections due September 27 and comes as a blow to the National Liberal party (NLP), one of the country's main political parties, which last week-end nominated 'Citizen Michael Hohenzollern' as its presidential candidate.</p>

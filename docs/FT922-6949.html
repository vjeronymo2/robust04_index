			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Polygram, Universal in film venture POLYGRAM, the London- based music and entertainment company which is 80 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, has formed a joint venture with Universal Pictures of the US for the distribution of films in North America. The North American distribution venture marks a further step in the company's efforts to increase its presence in the film industry. The joint venture, to be called Gramercy Pictures, will be based in Los Angeles. It is aimed at marketing medium-budget films supplied by both Polygram and Universal. The company intends to handle the release of an initial eight films a year, with more expected as the joint venture grows. PolyGram and Universal, which is part of MCA, the US film subsidiary of Matsushita of Japan, will continue to handle their own distribution in markets outside North America. The new company was formed because the partners believe the marketing of medium-budget films requires a different approach than the saturation advertising often available for big-budget, blockbuster films. 'Many good movies, with enormous box office potential, require a more nurturing marketing and distribution process. This new company was especially created to do just that,' said Mr Tom Pollock, chairman of the MCA Motion Picture Group. PolyGram said the joint venture was part of the company's Dollars 200m programme of investment in the film business. The investment programme was announced in September, when Polygram took majority control of two film production companies, Propaganda Films and Working Title. At the time, Polygram said that its plans for distributing medium-budget films in the US might involve setting up such a joint venture company.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (2): Cellular systems given new impetus - European subscriptions are up in spite of the launch of digital networks THE advent of new advanced digital cellular telephone networks, far from undermining the growth in subscribers to traditional analogue systems, appears to have given the market added impetus. Just a few weeks before the commercial launch of Europe's first digital (GSM) networks earlier this summer, the number of subscribers to western European existing cellular networks pasted the 5m mark for the first time. According to figures compiled by the Mobile Communications FT newsletter, this milestone was achieved in spite of a marked slowdown in growth rates in several markets last year, including the UK, partially offset by particularly strong growth in 1991 in the German and Italian markets. Meanwhile in the US, the world's largest cellular market, the number of cellular subscribers grew by almost 40 per cent to 7.5m last year and could top 10m by the end of 1992, according to analysts. By 1996 EMCI, the Washington-based international telecommunications consultancy, estimates that the world cellular market will have grown to 53.6m, with analogue systems still accounting for 76.2 per cent of the total. Although a growing proportion of new subscribers will be using digital systems in the US, Europe and other markets, as EMCI notes, 'the complete migration to digital cellular will take many years'. Indeed digital systems are likely to suffer from some drawbacks initially, including bulkier and, in some markets, more expensive handsets and the fact that in Europe at least, it may be the mid-1990s before many national GSM networks are fully operational. This means that early subscribers will not be able to use one of GSM's most attractive features - the ability to 'roam' across national borders. Even where GSM networks are in place, this feature will be available only when commercial agreements are reached between national operators and once other technical and administrative problems have been resolved. In some countries - such as Germany, which is quickly becoming the most dynamic market in Europe - the imminent commercial launch of the GSM digital system by Mannesman Mobilfunk has prompted Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned operator of the C-Netz cellular network launched in 1985, to step up its marketing. This has helped produce a remarkable surge in subscriber figures in the past year. Another factor which has helped boost analogue system subscriber numbers recently has been economic liberalisation and the opening up of new markets, particularly in Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe In places such as the former east Germany, cellular systems have provided an attractive and rapidly installable alternative to the overloaded fixed telephone service. For example, Deutsche Telekom launched the DAL project (Drahtlose Anschlussleitung - meaning wireless subscriber line) based on network equipment supplied by Nokia and designed rapidly to increase the number of telephone lines in economic centres in eastern Germany such as Leipzig, Dresden and Berlin. Although the focus of DAL project is short term, the use of cellular technology as part of a traditional fixed network marks an important trend in telecommunications and illustrates how cellular communications have become a feasible alternative mass market approach to providing a phone service. Similarly, Hungary's cellular network, launched in October 1990 by Westel, a joint venture between US West and the Hungarian Telecommunications Company, has provided companies with an alternative to the fixed network, which is unreliable and frequently unavailable. In some countries, however, capacity constraints on cellular systems have begun to hinder growth. One of the reasons for the slow growth in Belgium, which recorded the lowest growth in Europe last year, was the saturation of the NMT-450 network ahead of the launch of the Belgian PTT's GSM system. Similarly in France, the shortage of frequencies has been a major problem for the two networks run by France Telecom and its private sector rival, Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone. In other markets such as the US - where the debate over which technology cellular network operators will use to digitalise their services is still raging - operators needing additional capacity immediately are using, or planning to use, new methods for expanding old analogue networks. Among these methods, Motorola has developed a technology known as Namps (Narrowband Advanced Mobile Phone Service) which can increase analogue network capacity three-fold, thereby delaying the need for digitalisation. Operators that have placed orders with Motorola for Namps systems include CRM, the consortium which operates a cellular service in Buenos Aires, cellular operators in Israel, Thailand and Bell Atlantic Metro Mobile, Centel Cellular and US West in the US. Meanwhile AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, and others have developed the Microcell concept which can be used in tandem with any network technology. Microcells can dramatically increase network capacity and, according to AT&amp;T, enable big savings to be made by operators of small to medium-sized cellular networks that had previously thought they would have to digitalise their networks. Where sufficient capacity already exits ahead of the launch of digital systems, analogue cellular network operators are also proving adept at devising marketing and pricing strategies designed to reposition their services as cheaper, consumer-orientated products. For example, in both the Swedish and Norwegian markets, which have had cellular systems for 10 years and have the highest penetration levels in the world, operators have launched special cut-price services aimed at consumers who cannot afford the high price of normal cellular services but want to use mobile telephones in the evenings and at weekends. Most of the early cellular pioneers have long since recouped their original investment, so the task now is to maximise return on investment before digital services become established. One of the boldest marketing moves has come from Cellnet, one of the two UK cellular network operators. Cellnet has invested more than Pounds 700m in its network, including Pounds 4m a week in 1990 to alleviate the then growing problem of congestion and dropped calls caused by the surge in demand in the late 1980s. Since then, however, network growth in the UK has slowed dramatically and Cellnet, like its rival Vodafone, now has surplus capacity. In a move which rocked the UK market in June, Cellnet said it would launch its new 'LifeTime' tariff, cutting the cost of subscribing to its analogue service in an attempt to tap the low-use consumer market. The new tariff package will be sold through high street outlets and will be available later this year. Subscribers to the new package will pay a low connection charge and half the usual Pounds 25 monthly charge, but calls will be twice as expensive as the normal business users' tariff. Announcing the initiative, Mr Stafford Taylor, Cellnet's managing director, said: 'There is a huge potential demand for mobile phones. Our research indicated that up to 10m people are seriously interested, with 1m simply waiting for the right price to buy.' Cellnet's initiative - which has subsequently been matched by Vodafone announcing a similarly structured low-user tariff package called LowCall to be launched next month - will partly be judged on its success in attracting new customers while minimising the number of its existing business customers who simply migrate to the new scheme. Cellnet itself is predicting that its new low-user tariff will attract 200,000 new subscribers in the first year while Vodafone is somewhat less bullish. These customers will also require the low price handsets for sale in the high street such as the model - at under Pounds 300 - which Sony has said it will manufacture for use with the LifeTime service. Cellular services such as LifeTime and LowCall, aimed at domestic consumers, will rely on handset manufacturers bringing out new low-cost hand-portables. These are unlikely to involve the same level of new connection payments from network operator to service supplier and then to dealers - payments which dealers in the UK have traditionally used to subsidise the retail price of handsets. Ultimately, however, the success of analogue network operators in broadening the appeal of their services will depend upon their ability to differentiate services and fine-tune tariff structures and charges to address different markets - something which will be crucial for those operators who will have both analogue and digital services.</p>

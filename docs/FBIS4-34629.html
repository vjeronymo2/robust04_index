			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Dr. Alberto Volonte yesterday expressed his personal  belief and commitment to "coordinate and agree upon the  formation of a great team," based on people from the National  Party with others from parties like the Broad Front or the  Colorado Party. He said this is a basic priority for success if  he wins the elections scheduled for November.    These were the initial political remarks by the presidential  candidate who represents two important National Party factions  (the Herreraist-Wilsonist Sector and the National Proposal)  following his resignation as UTE [General Administration of  State Electric Power and Telephones] president.    The Herreraist-Wilsonist faction candidate wants the  National  Party to have a single candidate for the post of Montevideo  mayor. Among his proposals, Volonte mentioned priorities like  managing the country like a large enterprise, keeping the  current macroeconomic policy, assigning priority to the Mercosur  [Common Market of the South], pushing ahead with area policies,  and promoting a broad social agreement similar to the one  implemented during his tenure at UTE, which yielded very good  results. Dr. Volonte added that he will promote a meeting with  other National Party candidates for the presidency of the  Republic (Pereyra, Ramirez, and Aguirre). He admitted that Dr.  Juan Andres Rodriguez is a "great candidate" who "will honor his  nomination" because he is "an exemplary National Party member."    It was not easy to talk with Alberto Volonte yesterday. He  was surrounded by a great number of friends and officials who  worked with him at UTE and who went to his office to express  their appreciation for what they consider a "brilliant  administration."    Volonte quickly replied that he could not have succeeded had  it not been by his "team." He said he had great affection for  UTE and its people. It is very difficult to leave," he added.    Volonte said his campaign began yesterday with a "great  meeting with his family," his wife, and his four children."    Asked about his personal opinion of an eventual single  candidacy for Montevideo's city hall, Volonte said he was "a  fervent supporter of the idea" but made it clear that we should  give priority to "proposals" in the social area. Volonte added  that he did not fear multiple candidacies.    Reiterating a constant opinion during his administration,  Volonte stressed that Juan Andres Ramirez was "a great  candidate" who "will honor his designation" because he is "an  exemplary Blanco Party follower."    Asked about his opinion on surveys, Volonte stressed the  professional work of survey companies and surveyors. He said he  took them as a "reference" adding that he did not feel he was a  survey "slave" and that he did not worry about surveys or how he  fared in them.    He emphasized that the greatest survey "will be conducted on  the last Sunday in November [election day]."    Asked if he would introduce changes in current economic  policies, Volonte without hesitation said that he agreed with  current macroeconomic policies oriented towards Mercosur. He  added that these policies were supported by all political  parties -- unlike any previous economic policy.    Volonte added he would only to change the emphasis on some  aspects, that he would like to emphasize social programs such as  education, health, and public security."    Reporters questions forced Volonte to compare his  administration at UTE with an eventual administration as  president of the country.    "Countries are large enterprises in today's world. Uruguay  is  an enterprise full of illusions, an enterprise moved by our  entire society. We believe the country can become a great  enterprise. I think we can use the experience of a great  enterprise like UTE on a national scale."    Volonte mentioned the need to promote a great social pact,  perhaps with characteristics like the pact promoted by his  administration at UTE.    "I have no doubt that there must be an agreement between  those responsible for production and those in leadership  positions. At UTE, we had more than a pact; we had a 24-month  agreement that established labor relation rules on the way to  improve workers' salaries through productivity. I think the  formula can be applied to the entire state apparatus to obtain  better salaries, and thus achieve agreement and understanding  among all Uruguayans."    The former UTE director does not agree with remarks by some  political and social quarters that his group lacks the support  of a technical apparatus. He said those remarks were incorrect  because the "apparatus and the organization are the people. The  willingness is derived from the people. Uruguayans have an  opinion and can distinguish very well. No one has to be led by  the hand to vote....    The presidential candidate said: If elected president on 27  November, he will try first to reach an agreement with his party  and then with other political parties. He said he would thus  define his cabinet and form a great team. He said he will  discuss with other leaders -- those now in government and others  -- if they will be part of the team. The team will be formed  following an agreement and discussions with other parties,"  Volonte said.    Volonte told EL PAIS that his first steps in the political  arena will be to meet with the other National Party candidates,  that is, with Senator Carlos Julio Pereyra, Senator Juan A.  Ramirez, and Gonzalo Aguirre.</p>

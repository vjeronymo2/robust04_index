			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Over 40 hurt in Warsaw Airbus crash A GERMAN Airbus A320 airliner crashed in bad weather at Warsaw's Okecie airport yesterday, injuring at least 40 people and, according to late reports, killing two of them. The twin-engine Lufthansa aircraft, carrying 70 passengers and crew on a flight from Frankfurt to the Polish capital, caught fire after running off the runway seconds after it touched down. It is the fourth crash involving an Airbus A320 since the airliner entered service in 1988. Airport director Maciej Kalita said late last night: 'I can officially confirm that there were two fatalities - one of the pilots and a second person who is currently being identified.' Lufthansa sources in Warsaw said they had been informed by Polish officials that two people had been killed but they were still checking the report. A Lufthansa spokesman in Frankfurt said earlier that the airline was having to delay issuing a casualty list as injured passengers had been dispersed to hospitals throughout the Warsaw area. One survivor told Polish radio: 'After landing, the plane started speeding up again rather than braking. It tried to start but the tarmac ran out and the plane broke into pieces.' Airbus last night said it was still too early to say what caused the crash. But first indications suggested a possible cause was aquaplaning. Heavy rain and a water-logged runway appear to have made the aircraft skid on landing and overshoot the runway before bursting into flames. Although the A320's sophisticated computer systems have regularly been the subject of controversy, the 150-seater aircraft has now logged nearly 2m flight hours since its introduction and 1.3m take-offs. There are currently a total of 409 A320s in airline service throughout the world. In all three previous A320 crashes (two in France, one in India), the aircraft were cleared by accident investigators of any malfunction. Lufthansa has one of the best safety records in the airline industry and was preparing to celebrate the opening of its new Warsaw offices before the crash occurred. Mr Hans-Willi Blum, Lufthansa's manager for Eastern Europe in Warsaw for the opening ceremony, said last night: 'We do not know if the pilot tried to take off again; we do not know if it was a brake failure or pilot error; or the rain and the bad weather. We will have to investigate carefully'. Lufthansa had sent a special team of crash investigators from Frankfurt who would be working with Polish accident investigators, he added. Crash investigators were still trying to recover the 'black box' cockpit recorder to identify the cause of the accident.</p>

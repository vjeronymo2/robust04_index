It Will Advocate  `Moderate Reformist' Positions"]    [Text] Each political crisis in Russia over the past few  years has invariably been accompanied by rumors, talk and  "fairly authoritative" statements about the creation of a  certain pro-reform "super-party" led by Boris Yeltsin.  Moreover, the president himself has repeatedly stressed the  need for forming such a structure. As a rule, things did not  move beyond the talking stage. Now, however, rumors about a  "presidential party" seem to be materializing.    The formation of the "super-party" will be the concern of  regional "committees in support of the Russian Federation's  first president," advocating "moderate reformist-democratic  positions," and structures of the President Foundation led by  well-known democratic movement activist Lev Shemayev. No doubt,  the president's administration and some executive power  structures will also make a contribution to creating a  presidential party. According to Nikolay Medvedev, chief of the  Russian Federation presidential administration's Directorate for  Liaison with the Territories, some time at the end of February  the groups taking the initiative on founding a presidential  party will hold their first meeting in Samara. It will be  attended by representatives from Samara, Ulyanovsk, Saratov,  Penza, Volgograd, Ryazan, and Moscow. In particular one of the  delegates from the Moscow branch will be the president's  representative in Moscow, Vladimir Kamchatov, who was  unsuccessful in contesting a seat in the Federation Council. In  Shemayev's opinion, the Samara conference will become the first  stage in the formation of grass-roots structures of the  presidential party.    According to Shemayev, the main task of the future party is  to look for an idea capable of rallying all the healthy forces  in Russia. This idea will serve as a basis for the party  program, while the program itself is most likely to be of an  economic rather than political character, presenting a concept  for the country's economic development for the next 10 to 15  years.    It is expected that along with rank and file members,  representatives of the enterprise directors corps and of banking  and commercial structures will also join the party. Medvedev  did not rule out that the centrist-minded members of  democratically oriented parties and movements, including  Russia's Choice, may "insist that their programs be adjusted in  line with the current political and economic realities," as a  result of which part of the pro-reform association participants  may affiliate with the presidential party. At the same time Lev  Shemayev said he doubted that such politicians as Gennadiy  Burbulis, Sergey Shakhray, or Arkadiy Volskiy will have anything  to do with the leadership of the future super-party.    According to Lev Shemayev, the emerging party is going to  nominate Boris Yeltsin as candidate in the next presidential  elections.    The leadership of the majority of democratic parties and  movements has so far not reacted in any way to the possible  appearance of a presidential party. Meanwhile Sergey Shakhray,  chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, noted that  the only way to ensure the speedy creation of the presidential  party is to organize the entire vertical executive structure as  a party structure. According to Shakhray, such a course of  events can lead to "purges" in the state apparatus and a  weakened executive branch.</p>

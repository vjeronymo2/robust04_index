			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BISHOP QUITS COLORADO FOR EASTERN SEMINARY  </P> <P> Episcopal Bishop William C. Frey has shocked members of the Colorado religious  community with news that he is leaving to take the helm of a small, financially  troubled seminary in a former steel town near Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Frey has been a leading voice in Colorado since he was named bishop nearly 17  years ago and was one of four candidates in 1985 to become the Episcopal  Church's top bishop nationwide.  </P> <P> He leaves the episcopacy more than a dozen years before the mandatory  retirement age of 72 to become dean of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry in  Ambridge, Pa., an evangelical school of about 70 students where one of his sons  is a freshman.  </P> <P> In an interview at St. Stephen's Church in suburban Aurora, Frey said he  agonized over the decision to leave his position and called the time he spent  considering the offer 24 hours "of the worst depression I've ever gone  through."  </P> <P> Ultimately, he decided to take the job "because of a sense of vocation."  </P> <P> "I felt a call," explained the bishop, who prefers to be addressed simply as  Bill. "It just came from left field."  </P> <P> Frey called Trinity "the Cinderella of American seminaries," noting that it is  "poor, new, in an abandoned steel town and has offices in a converted Safeway  building with no air-conditioning and classes in a former Presbyterian church."  </P> <P> The bishop said he will probably begin his new job in the fall of 1990 after  relocation to Pennsylvania in the spring.  </P> <P> Frey is an evangelical and charismatic who believes in speaking in tongues. And  he believes abortion is homicide. But he has a distinctively liberal side also  and has been denounced by church conservatives for his opposition to the  nuclear arms race, capital punishment and the proliferation of handguns.  </P> <P> On the divisive issues of ordination of women and revision of the Book of  Common Prayer, Bishop Frey has sided with liberals.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUSANDS RALLY IN SUPPORT OF TWO SOVIET PROSECUTORS  </P> <P> Soviets rallied Tuesday by the tens of thousands in Moscow and Leningrad in  support of two embattled prosecutors whose anti-corruption inquiry has become a  lightning rod for popular resentment of Communist Party privilege.  </P> <P> About 10,000 people gathered in the shadow of Moscow's Kremlin, and journalists  said at least as many met in front of the former czarist Winter Palace in  Leningrad as the Supreme Soviet (national legislature) in Moscow considered  lifting the legislative immunity of the two, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov.  </P> <P> "Gdlyan and Ivanov Are Our Conscience!" read signs carried by the Moscow crowd.  The two gained fame uncovering a trail of bribery and corruption in Uzbekistan  that involved the son-in-law of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev.  </P> <P> Soviet officials accused the two of abusing their power and making unjustified  public accusations against senior leaders in an effort to increase their  popularity.  </P> <P> Populist Communist leader Boris N. Yeltsin criticized as incomplete a nearly  yearlong investigation of Gdlyan and Ivanov by a legislative committee and  urged the legislators to keep their immunity intact.  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet made no decision Tuesday.  </P></p>

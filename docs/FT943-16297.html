			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: No hatchet job on a bright jewelled crown - Andrew Baxter on a Pounds 55m merger which doubled group size and filled new niches The performance of Carclo's Arthur Lee steel and plastic products division inevitably dominated yesterday's results. But Mr John Ewart, Carclo's sprightly 70-year-old chairman, says last summer's Pounds 55m merger means much more than a short-term boost to profits. The agreed takeover of Arthur Lee has nearly doubled the engineering group's size and raised its profile in the City. In the long term it will be the company's most important move since it took over the English Card Clothing Company - a rival producer of card clothing, the consumable teeth used in carding machines to comb fibre - in 1979. Mr Ewart sees the merger as a key move in Carclo's strategy of increasing the real value of assets and earnings per share by owning and developing niche engineering businesses. He gives a number of reasons why Carclo spent three years stalking Arthur Lee. First, he says, 'it is extremely difficult to find good niche businesses, and Arthur Lee was the jewel in the crown of Yorkshire business'. Also, Lee had a specialist wire rope business, John Shaw. This and Bruntons at Carclo were the UK's two biggest manufacturers after Bridon, the market leader. The sector had suffered in the recession and it made sense to bring the two second runners together, says Mr Ewart. And, along with the specialist steel strip business for which Lee was best known, it had also built up a good position in plastics. The hunt for Lee began in 1990. Carclo had sold Jonas Woodhead's springs and forgings business to Hoesch of Germany for Pounds 21.3m and began buying shares in Lee. Two years later, it took its stake to 29.9 per cent, thus clearly signalling its intentions without having to make a full bid, by buying a 22 per cent stake from GM Firth. After some three months of tough bargaining an agreed deal was announced in May last year. The 7-for-9 share offer with a cash alternative was carefully structured to keep both sides happy. It also compensated Lee shareholders for losing control just as market conditions were picking up. 'Arthur Lee had gone through a bad patch but was recovering rapidly,' says Mr Ewart. The bidder also had to recognise it would be buying Lee after the bulk of much-needed restructuring work had been completed. 'We had done an enormous amount of rationalisation,' says Mr Peter Lee, former chairman at Lee and now deputy chairman at Carclo. On the steel side, Lee sold its bright bar business to United Engineering Steels in 1992, and over the past two years has completely revised wages and incentives. The plastics side has also been rationalised from four to two businesses, serving the medical and consumer electronics sectors. The rationalisation explains why the merger has not been followed by heavy wielding of the hatchet. The two companies employed a workforce of 2,822 before the deal, and the combined total now is down by only 70. This was partly due to the transfer of wiremaking from Bruntons in Edinburgh to Smiths in Halifax. The rest of the cuts mainly resulted from moving Carclo's head office into Lee's Sheffield headquarters. The merged company is already benefiting from such savings and from its increased buying power for steel and energy. Analysts believe the company is likely to see further benefits emerge over the next two years from closer working arrangements between the reorganised businesses. Carclo is also starting to reap the benefits from capital investment which had been implemented or planned before the merger. Gill's Cables, part of the general engineering division, is a recent beneficiary, while ECC's manufacturing efficiency has been increased by moving from its old site in Huddersfield to an adjacent building. The move did cause some disruption, however, which contributed to the fall in the division's 1993-94 profits. The Lee steel strip business has spent some Pounds 5m since 1990 on new equipment. That excludes a Pounds 2.25m 'stretch bend leveller' which was rolled into place this weekend. This is crucial to Lee's plans to expand its presence in markets where near-perfect flatness of strip steel is paramount, such as the springs on floppy disks. In the medium term, the Lee takeover is also important because growth prospects look stronger in its businesses. In steel strip, world demand for stainless steel is expected to grow at 5 per cent a year into the next decade, with growth in flat cold-rolled stainless exceeding that. Stainless accounts for 61 per cent of Lee Steel Strip's 'prime' sales (excluding tonnage processed for other companies). The remaining 39 per cent of the business is in a specialised form of high carbon steel, with which Lee has become world leader in the production of steel for seat belt springs. Elsewhere, immediate prospects vary. Card clothing may not have been 'jumping ahead' recently, said Mr Ewart, but it is a relatively high margin business where entry costs are high and Carclo is one of a handful of world competitors. In the wire division, companies such as Joseph Sykes are thriving by concentrating on speciality wire. Sykes has become one of the world leaders in nylon-covered wires and is very export-oriented. Still to come, Mr Ewart hints, could be one or two add-on acquisitions in the core businesses, possibly in continental Europe where possible candidates have already been visited. Some tidying up is also likely, and the company could raise Pounds 15m from sales of surplus property and non-core businesses such as steel stockholding.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / VAT may apply to more snacks TORTILLA CHIPS, pistachio nuts in their shells, packets of poppadums and other savoury snacks may become liable for value added tax. A consultation paper issued by HM Customs and Excise calls for a comprehensive review of the VAT exemption of savoury snacks. VAT is paid on potato crisps and salted peanuts, but many of the more exotic nibbles introduced in the last few years fall outside the legal definition of what constitutes a snack. The Customs paper does not specify that VAT will be extended, but says that if the borderline between snacks and food is made 'too generous' it could lead to 'an unacceptable loss of revenue' and increase distortion of competition. Mr Keith Nightingale, director-general of the Snack, Nut and Crisp Manufacturers' Association, said snacks incurred far lower VAT rates in many other EC countries than in the UK, and called for them to be zero-rated. Tax on snacks was first levied in 1969.</p>

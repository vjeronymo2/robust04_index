			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong advance at Kleinwort Benson Kleinwort Benson yesterday confirmed high expectations for UK investment banks by disclosing that its 1993 pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 111.7m (Dollars 168m), compared with Pounds 45.1m the previous year. Kleinwort's 2,770 employees gained heavily from the strong trading conditions in financial markets, and a rise in underwriting and advisory work. After excluding a Pounds 9.2m profit from selling Sharps Pixley, its bullion and metals business, earnings per share rose to 56.4p, compared with 26p, and the pre-tax return on equity rose to 26 per cent, compared with 11 per cent.</p>

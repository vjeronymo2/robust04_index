Box 1233, Charleston, West Virginia 25324 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.503 (permissible electric face equipment; maintenance) to its Federal No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01456) located in Monongalia County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to increase the maximum length of its trailing cables supplying shuttle cars, loading machines, and roof bolters to 900 feet from a nominal 480 volt, 3-phase alternating current system during longwall development; to have the cables for shuttle cars and loading machines not smaller than  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2 AWG with the maximum setting at 800 amps; to have the roof bolter cable not smaller than  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4 AWG with the maximum setting at 500 amps; and to have the trip settings of these circuit breakers sealed or otherwise fixed so that the unit settings cannot be set above the maximum allowable value. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 9.

Box 386, Hamilton, Illinois 62341 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 56.6131(a)(1) (location of explosive material storage facilities) to its Gray Quarries (I.D. No. 11&hyph;00073) located in Hancock County, Illinois. The petitioner requests a modification of the mandatory safety standard to allow the storage facility to remain in its present location until a new location can be established. The petitioner states that the only other location that is within the mine site that would not create a hazard cannot be used until mining is complete in that location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 10.

No. 38&hyph;00052) located in Aiken County, South Carolina. The petitioner requests a modification of the mandatory safety standard to allow the use of a different type of parking device for its Case W&hyph;11B loaders because the operator is not able to pull the handle into position when the parking brakes are adjusted tight enough to hold on a ramp. The petitioner proposes to park this mobile equipment between two mounds (speed brake type) to ensure the safety of employees, equipment, and surrounding area; to train designated loader operators in job requirement and safe work practices; and to post a sign in each loader and at each designated parking area stating the requirement for parking in the designated area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Persons interested in these petitions may furnish written comments.

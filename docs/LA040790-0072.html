			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR DEADHEADS, BYPASSING IRVINE WILL BE NO BIG DEAL  </P> <P> So it's on to Carson . . . bye-bye, Irvine. ("Grateful Dead Tour to Bypass  Orange County," April 3.)  </P> <P> As a Grateful Dead fan, I have danced in the sunshine in Eugene, Ore., along  the beaches in Ventura . . . and, yes, under a bright, full moon at Irvine  Meadows.  </P> <P> The settings change -- as do the seasons -- each show becoming its own unique  slice of life. We come for the band and for each other. The venue matters  little.  </P> <P> My hat's off to the city of Irvine, shivering in the dark behind guarded gates,  peeking warily through cracked blinds and nodding in silent approval over their  ingenious solution to bring people together and make the world a better place  to live.  </P> <P> JEFF KAHL, Corona del Mar  </P></p>

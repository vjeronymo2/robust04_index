			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Graham Hutchings in Hong Kong: "Patten Hits at </F> Asian Leaders Who Oppose Democracy"]    [Text] The Governor of Hong Kong, Mr Chris Patten, stepped  up his battle with Beijing yesterday by attacking opponents of  democracy and human rights in Asia.    Mr Patten said the view that democracy was unsuited to Asian  societies was patronising and racist. He also described  communism as "wicked" and "a failure".    His remarks will infuriate Beijing, which opposes his plans  for democratic reform in Hong Kong.    Mr Patten, who is visiting Sydney, asked in a speech: "Are  some Asian leaders really prepared to argue that respect for  human dignity is an exclusively European or North American or  Australian concept"?    "I don't believe for a moment that human rights stop at the  borders of Asia, and nor, I believe, do most Asians".    "If you argued outside Asia that human rights weren't really  appropriate for Asians, or for Latin Americans or for Africans,  that would rightly be regarded as a deeply patronising argument  -- not to say a racist one."    On Sunday, Mr Patten told reporters he would not be using  his  visit to Australia to canvass support for his political reform  plans. He was mainly concerned to promote trade and investment.    But following yesterday's remarks, China will see the visit  as another attempt to internationalise an issue it believes  should remain a strictly bilateral affair between London and  Beijing.    More to the point, it will regard the Governor's speech as  an  attack on its own human rights position, which was restated in  yesterday's Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily.    The paper accused foreign critics of trying to impose alien  values on China, and of failing to live up to their own lofty  standards at home. All factors should be taken into account in  any dialogue on human rights, and the developing world should  not blindly accept doctrines handed down by the West.    "The human rights philosophy of the European capitalist  revolution has made historical contributions ... but the world  has gone through great changes, and we should make our choices  with judgment," People's Daily said. "Outside Europe, there are  other, even older glorious civilisations with which to compare  and make choices."    Mr Patten said the argument about cultural relativism and  human rights did not stand up, and denied that those who stood  up for individual freedoms were interfering in the internal  affairs of other countries.    "The truth is that those who try to sweep human rights under  the carpet tend to do so for baser motives -- to stamp on  opposition and keep a tight grip on political power," he said in  an address to the Australia-Asia Society.    "Communism failed because, in attempting to crush initiative  and suppress individualism, it went right against the grain of  human nature. It collapsed because of its wicked and expensive  failures."    He dismissed arguments that Asia was barren ground for  democracy. "First, there is nothing inherent in Asian society  that makes democracy a non-starter. Japan is evidence enough of  that".    "Second, there is no evidence to support the claim that  while  rising living standards in Europe, in Latin America, in Africa,  may lead to rising political aspirations, the same does not  apply in Asia".    "I accept there may not be a mechanistic relationship  between  growing prosperity and an increasing demand for participative  government. But the evidence is that in Asia, as in other  places, people who have more in their wallets sooner or later  want more say in the way they are governed."    Mr Patten's remarks amounted to further evidence, if any  were  needed, that his approach to problems inside and outside of Hong  Kong is fundamentally at variance with China's, and that the  prospects for cooperation between Britain and Beijing over the  territory seem virtually non-existent.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / South Africa takes hard line on rent strikes In an attempt to ensure its national programme to build 1m houses over the next five years will be financially viable, South Africa's government has warned that people who boycott rent or mortgage payments will be evicted from their homes. Addressing a national forum on housing in Botshabelo, near Bloemfontein, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Mr Joe Slovo, housing minister, said housing targets would not be met unless rent and service boycotts, which started as a way of opposing apartheid in the 1980s, were ended. 'Those of you who continue to think positively of the boycotts are stabbing in the back, not what you can call the enemy, but your brothers and sisters,' Mr Slovo said. The decision is politically controversial as it may require the African National Congress-led government to act against many of its political supporters. But it is regarded as essential if the government is to have any hope of meeting the huge backlog in formal housing, estimated at 1.5m houses. At present, only about 30 per cent of township residents meet their bond or rent payments. Mr Slovo used the summit to launch a national housing accord calling for a partnership between the private and public sector to help increase capacity in the construction industry and recommending that the government increase the Housing Ministry's share of the national budget from its present level of 1 per cent to 5 per cent. The accord was endorsed by a broad range of township civic associations, trade unions, big banks and construction companies, as well as representatives from local, regional and national government. The declarations follow the announcement last week that the government had struck a R2bn (Pounds 350m) deal with the private sector that will open up mortgage loans to the lower end of the housing market and appears to signal the government is at last ready to release its final blueprints for the housing programme, expected to be submitted as a White Paper to parliament shortly. Several regional ministries have vigorously promoted a policy of building four-room houses for the country's homeless. Given its tight budgetary constraints, the government is expected to endorse a more limited 'incremental approach' to the problem. The government will focus on building fully-serviced, single-room houses that people can then expand by taking advantage of private-sector initiatives.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Prospects rise for steady growth - There have been productivity improvements / The Economy CANADA'S Liberal party inherits a domestic economy in vastly better shape than the one it left when it was last in office in the early 1980s. After more than two years of severe recession, a gradual economic recovery has begun. The Conference Board of Canada recently predicted GDP will rise by 2.4 per cent in real terms this year, accelerating to 3 per cent growth in 1994 and 3.5 per cent in 1995. Inflation is below 2 per cent, well ahead of the targets set by the outgoing Progressive Conservative government two years ago. Meanwhile interest rates have tumbled to their lowest levels in two decades. While the recession and free trade with the US have brought pain to many Canadian businesses and their workers, they have also encouraged significant improvements in productivity. Mr William Macdonald, Toronto lawyer and economic consultant, says Canada is 4-5 years into a 12-year restructuring which, if successful, could give it one of the best combinations in the industrial world of mutually reinforcing monetary, fiscal, exchange rate and trade policies. The Business Council on National Issues, which represents 150 chief executives of the country's biggest companies, said yesterday that its judgment of the Liberals would depend on their handling of four issues: government spending, free trade with the US and Mexico, tax reform and monetary policy. All major parties promised in the election campaign to contain or cut the federal government's CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.4bn) budget deficit. The Liberals said they would bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP, from its present level of 5.2 per cent. However, economists are nervous that with two regional parties on opposition benches and the threat of Quebec secession, the Liberals will be hard-pressed to resist demands to loosen the purse-strings. One of the most crucial decisions facing the new government is whether to reappoint Mr John Crow, Bank of Canada governor, to a second seven-year term. Mr Crow's first term expires early next year. Mr Jean Chretien, Liberal leader, suggested before the campaign began that Mr Crow, whom many Canadians blame for the recent tough times, would have to go, but party officials have showed an appreciation recently of Mr Crow's value in bolstering foreign investor confidence. The Liberals are more pragmatic and business-oriented than they were under Mr Pierre Trudeau in the 1970s and early 80s. But the party also still contains an interventionist and nationalist wing. The degree to which the new government will be willing to accommodate business's - and especially foreign investors' - preferences in economic policy will become clear when it tables its first budget and decides on Mr Crow's future.</p>

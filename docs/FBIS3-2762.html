			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Cao Min: "Zou Demands Major Industrial </F> Safety Drive"]    [Text] Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua has called for a nationwide  campaign to protect workers following a horrific increase in the  number of people killed in industrial accidents last year.    More than 60,000 people died in thousands of incidents  across  the country between January and October.    And Zou described the toll in lives and damage as  unprecedented.    Governments at all levels should make every effort to stem  the rise, he said on Tuesday to the third national  tele-conference on industrial safety since July.    He also called for new laws to protect workers and to punish  firms which put them in danger.    Protecting workers has an important role in China's economic  development, said Zou, adding that governments and enterprises  must do all they can to solve any problems.    "While the workers are making contributions to our country,  we must bear responsibility for their safety," said Zou.    The tragic rise in the number of accidents was particularly  marked in foreign-funded firms and collectively-run mines.    Zou called for new laws on industrial safety to be drafted  as  soon as possible and for the powers of watch dog groups to be  strengthened.    And he stressed that any accident caused by negligence or  bureaucracy must be punished severely.    Safety inspections should be carried out regularly, he said,  adding that they should target accident black spots such as  foreign- funded or township enterprises.    He also hoped the press could improve public awareness of  the  importance of industrial safety by high-lighting major accidents  which claim many lives or cause severe damage.    Labour Minister Li Boyong blamed the accident figures on  poor  discipline, management, and operation and lack of proper  supervision.    Li also accused some managers of going for higher output at  the expense of their workers' safety.    He also attacked the illegal practice of dismantling firms  safety supervisory departments as they restructured their  managements.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TESTS PROVE REINFORCING COULD HAVE SAVED NIMITZ  </P> <P> Engineering tests on a still-standing segment of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland  have confirmed that a relatively simple strengthening of a mile-long elevated  section could have prevented its collapse in the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake,  Caltrans officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The technique, which involves attaching steel reinforcement to the  double-decked structure's concrete columns, was never applied to the Nimitz  because engineers considered the structure to be one of the safest in the state  until the 7.1-magnitude earthquake turned it into a stack of concrete pancakes,  killing 42 people.  </P> <P> But now California Department of Transportation engineers are preparing plans  to use the retrofit technique on five Bay Area freeway segments similar to the  Nimitz which remain closed because of fears that they, too, might collapse in a  major quake. Information gleaned from the testing also may be applied to other  freeways throughout the state.  </P> <P> "We now have physical proof that the retrofitting concept works," James  Roberts, chief of Caltrans' structures division, said in a statement released  by the department. "We can move forward confidently to apply this seismic  strengthening to the other structures."  </P> <P> The test results and recent comments by Caltrans officials appear to undercut  what the department said in the immediate aftermath of the disaster: that the  Nimitz Freeway columns were never strengthened because the theoretical  technology to do so did not exist. In October, Caltrans officials said  repeatedly that any such retrofitting was expected to take years to evolve out  of research under way at UC San Diego.  </P> <P> That claim was disputed by engineers in the private sector and at universities,  who said the technology existed to strengthen the Nimitz but the state had  never thought of applying it. And now, after the quake emboldened Caltrans  engineers and prompted state officials to provide more funds for research, UC  Berkeley professors have applied existing technology developed by Caltrans to  confirm that the structure could have been saved.  </P> <P> Three different retrofit schemes were designed to strengthen the joints  connecting the upper and lower portions of the concrete columns. Engineers  agreed that the joints were the weak link that caused the columns to break  apart and fall, leaving no support for the massive upper deck, which fell upon  the lower lanes.  </P> <P> In the testing, engineers attached steel bars, plates and beams to the columns  and then subjected the structure to the kind of vibrations and movement that  could be expected in a major quake. They used hydraulic jacks to apply more  than 4 million pounds of lateral force to the structure, moving it more than 10  inches. The force applied in the test was greater than that caused by the  earthquake, Roberts said.  </P> <P> "The structure did suffer some cracking, but did not collapse under the extreme  forces," Roberts said in the prepared statement.  </P> <P> Development of this kind of retrofit was not planned before the Bay Area  earthquake, when Caltrans was focusing its effort on elevated structures  supported by a single line of columns. But even if the research had been  envisioned, Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said, it would have taken much longer  to complete without the availability of an existing structure to use for the  testing. Without a chunk of the Nimitz to act as a guinea pig, engineers would  have had to test their theories on a model.  </P> <P> Officials said plans for retrofitting the closed Bay Area freeways should be  finished by the end of the month, when they will know how much it will cost.  The work is expected to be done this spring.  </P> <P> Caltrans officials said the Nimitz Freeway testing was the biggest experiment  of its kind ever conducted. In addition to confirming the retrofit technique,  UC engineers were able to collect information that they will use to develop  advanced mathematical models for further theoretical studies on elevated  structures statewide.  </P> <P> "The knowledge we have gained from these tests may be applied to other bridges  across the state built before 1971," Roberts said. Structures built after 1971  have more advanced designs developed after a major earthquake in the San  Fernando Valley.  </P></p>

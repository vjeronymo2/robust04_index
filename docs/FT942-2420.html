			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / International Press Review: Pyongyang's charm offensive - North Korea The North Korean nuclear dispute has not diverted the Pyongyang media from reporting other weighty matters, such as the fifth congress of the North Korean Juvenile Corps. The 3m children, age seven to 13, who are members of North Korea's version of the scouts and guides, were called upon to serve and protect their 'graceful father' and Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, the son and designated successor to the Great Leader, President Kim Il-sung. 'Away from his side, members of the corps are not able to be happy or even laugh,' declared Mr Choe Ruong-hae, the league's head, as quoted by the (North) Korean Central Broadcasting Station. 'If the 3m members of the Juvenile Corps, like the 5m (older) members of the League of Socialist Working Youth, become guns and bombs, there will be no power to beat them,' he added. In explaining the importance of the juvenile congress, Chollima, a monthly magazine, noted that the Soviet Union and east European socialist countries had collapsed because the 'third and fourth generations of the revolution spoiled' the revolution's achievements. 'To complete the great tasks of socialism in North Korea, the rising generation must be educated to become a revolutionary successor loyal to Kim Jong-il,' the magazine stressed. The education campaign for revolutionary successors includes such stimulating television programmes as a quiz show which questions children on the achievements and sayings of the junior Kim. The forthcoming transfer of power from the 82-year-old Great Leader to the 52-year-old Dear Leader is a dominant theme of the North Korean state-controlled media. That is when reports are not condemning 'American imperialists and their South Korean puppets' and, lately, the 'International Atomic Energy Agency puppets'. 'It is my great pleasure to see that Comrade Kim Jong-il is respected, loved and praised by the people as the leader to continue the revolutionary tasks,' KCBS recently quoted his father as saying. The junior Kim is portrayed in the west as spoiled and unbalanced, with a taste for foreign women and Hollywood movies. He appears to have an image problem in North Korea as well, according to defectors. While his charismatic father is respected, the public blames his pudgy son for the country's mounting economic problems. The rhetorical overkill displayed by the North Korean media on the nuclear dispute, with its threats that Seoul will taste 'the flame of war,' may be an attempt to create a crisis atmosphere at home that will suppress public discontent over the worsening economy and unite support behind the junior Kim. Listeners are continually reminded by KCBS of his 'military genius' and told that he 'began to teach the North Korean People's Army as early as in 1963, when he was 21 years old, to make it the strongest in the world.' Kim junior's support within the military is believed to be questionable, leading to speculation that the army might overthrow him in a coup once his father dies. Kim senior rose to power after his guerrilla activity against Japanese colonial rule in the 1930s, but his son is distrusted by the army because he lacks military experience. There is consequently great emphasis placed by the media on the Kim Jong-il's relations with the military as teacher and guide. The media also warns North Koreans, isolated from foreign sources of information, that things are much worse in the former Socialist countries that have chosen capitalism. 'The world is in a food crisis. Especially, the soil in Russia, the Ukraine and Hungary has become desolate due to the private ownership of land, resulting in worse food conditions facing these countries,' said Rodong (Labour) Shinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Korean Workers' party, in apparent attempt to console North Koreans who are suffering food shortages. Mr Kim Jong-il no doubt is hoping that propaganda offensive on his behalf will succeed and enable people to continue singing what KCBS says is the country's most popular song, 'Without you, there will be no fatherland.'</p>

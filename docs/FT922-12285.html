			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / GPA shareholders revolt over sale GPA Group, the aircraft lessor, is facing a shareholder revolt over the terms of the sale which could jeopardise the Pounds 1.7bn flotation scheduled for June. Japanese investors and airline companies commanding almost a third of GPA's shareholding have refused to give the aircraft leasing company details of the amount of shares they plan to sell in the float. Advisers to GPA say the sale of new and existing shares cannot go ahead until they have a 'lock-up' agreement preventing existing shareholders from selling more than an agreed amount during and immediately after the sale. The advisers are trying to create an orderly market for six to 12 months after the float. To this end Hambro Magan, the specialist merchant bank advising Mr Tony Ryan, GPA's chairman, wrote to investors asking them to indicate the amount of shares they wanted to sell. However, GPA's biggest shareholders have ignored the deadline of midnight last Wednesday. Only Mr Ryan and Mr Maurice Foley, chief executive, have agreed not to dispose of their holdings in the float. Air Canada and Aer Lingus, which command 24.8 per cent of GPA's shareholding, want to sell a big proportion of their shareholding. The two airline companies, which are being advised by Warburgs, have refused to accept a limit, proposed by GPA's advisers, of between 5 and 15 per cent of each shareholding. GPA hopes it can reach an agreement with the airline companies since they want the sale to go ahead. More worrying for GPA is the attitude of its Japanese investors, who have no incentive to see the sale proceed, since they bought much of their stock at Dollars 32 a share. The flotation price, which still has to be agreed, is likely to be about Dollars 22, which would confirm a loss on some Japanese investors' shareholdings. The Japanese investors, which include Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation with 12.8m shares or 13.4 per cent of the stock, have said they are unhappy with the sale terms. According to one of GPA advisers the Japanese position is causing the group 'serious concern'. GPA's advisers include Japan's Nomura International as global co-ordinator, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs in the US and Schroders in the UK.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: FILM ASKS, 'WHAT IF ADS TOLD THE TRUTH?' MADISON AVE. DOESN'T LIKE  IT  </P> <P> Suppose you turned on your TV and saw this commercial: "We know we're not sexy.  But being sexy today is not such a great idea with so many new diseases around.  Be safe instead of sexy. Buy Volvo. Boxy but good."  </P> <P> Of course, Volvo's not running that advertisement. But beginning April 11 this  parody-commercial -- and several other outlandish, make-believe ads for Jaguar  and John Hancock life insurance -- will be seen on movie screens nationwide.  </P> <P> The Jaguar commercial promises men who own Jaguars that they will receive  sexual favors "from women you hardly know." And the John Hancock ad notes: "We  know you love him, but if he dies, we give you a summer home and two  Mercedes-Benzes. Wouldn't that be nice, too?"  </P> <P> To the burned-out ad executive played by Dudley Moore in the upcoming Paramount  Pictures comedy "Crazy People," such commercials are examples of something few  ad executives ever consider creating: honest ads. But before the film has even  been released, West Coast advertising executives are generally reacting with  outrage.  </P> <P> "The idea that advertising isn't truthful is a fabricated concept," said  Clifford J. Einstein, president of Dailey &amp; Associates, which creates ads  for the California State Lottery. "Advertising is more truthful than the news."  </P> <P> "This movie might upset people in the advertising business," said Mitch  Markowitz, who wrote the screenplay about an ad executive who is committed to a  mental institution by his co-workers for creating truthful ads. "But what some  advertisements do is unconscionable."  </P> <P> Markowitz, who has never worked at an agency, said he is not condemning all  advertising. But he comes down hard on certain categories -- such as  automobiles and liquor. His original script included a whiskey ad that said:  "Having tax problems? Get drunk."  </P> <P> "I wish I hadn't let them talk me (into) taking that one out of the script,"  said Markowitz, who also wrote the hit film "Good Morning, Vietnam." "Why do  most people drink whiskey? To get drunk."  </P> <P> How will the rest of Madison Avenue react to this film? "I think ad people will  love it," said producer Thomas Barad. "These characters do what we all want to  do -- tell the truth."  </P> <P> Not surprising, these "truthful" ads in the film have wildly successful  results. And that is not without precedent. One of the first American ad  executives to practice truth in advertising on a grand scale was Bill Bernbach,  who in the 1960s created the famous Volkswagen ad that flatly stated: "It's  ugly, but it gets you there."  </P> <P> "Crazy People" is hardly the first film to take a poke at the advertising  business. Last year, the British film "How to Get Ahead in Advertising" struck  a nerve when it depicted an ad man so obsessed with a pimple medication  campaign that he developed a boil on his neck that ultimately took over his  body. And in the 1986 film "Nothing in Common," Tom Hanks played a Chicago  advertising whiz kid who realized he was no less a huckster than his dying  father -- a salesman for a children's clothing manufacturer.  </P> <P> Although "Crazy People" won't be released for several months, its basic premise  -- that most advertising is dotted with deceit -- is already hitting some top  ad executives where it hurts.  </P> <P> "Most advertising creates its own reality, so in that sense ads do lie," said  Nancy Shalek, president of Shalek Agency, which creates ads for Speedo  swimsuits and Teleflora. "That bothers me. But it also gives our agency a great  competitive advantage. Most advertising goes off the deep end when it tries to  sell. We never tell people to buy our clients' products. We give them  permission to do what they want to do."  </P> <P> Some advertising can be unintentionally deceiving. Ken Mandelbaum once worked  for Hal Riney &amp; Partners, which created the original Bartles &amp; Jaymes  spots that feature the two fictional pitchmen for the Gallo wine cooler. When  Mandelbaum went to open an account at a major California bank, the branch  manager was convinced that Bartles &amp; Jaymes were not actors but the  winery's founders.  </P> <P> "When I told her they were actors, she thought I was putting her on," said  Mandelbaum, now president of Mandelbaum Mooney Ashley. "But I've never worked  at an agency where you sit and figure how to dupe the consumer."  </P> <P> Two ad executives objected strongly to the premise of "Crazy People."  </P> <P> "People don't realize it, but advertising is the most policed, safeguarded  industry around," said Einstein of Dailey &amp; Associates. "Every claim has to  be substantiated with reams of documents."  </P> <P> And Vic Olesen, president of Vic Olesen &amp; Partners, which creates ads for  Chevrolet, wonders if the film "Crazy People" will be advertised truthfully. He  suggested this ad: "This is an average movie with an aging star who spends most  of his time sulking in his own restaurant. And it was written by a guy with no  agency experience who is also a pessimist."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disney Theater Ad Ban a Boon for Slides  </P> <P> Walt Disney has given Bob Martin a new lease on life. His company, National  Cinema Network, places slide-show advertisements in theaters. When Disney  recently announced that it would no longer tolerate commercials broadcast in  theaters showing its films, it did not rule out slide shows.  </P> <P> Now Martin, president of the Kansas City company, says he plans to "upgrade"  his slide shows and sell them to more chains. Although each tray of 81 slides  will still have about 25 ads, the remaining slides will be more entertaining,  he said.  </P> <P> "I can sit here with a great deal of confidence and tell you that people won't  boo at our programs," he said.  </P> <P> Currently, the extra slides often feature film trivia. But the new shows --  which will begin screening in Los Angeles by April -- will also feature an  array of "Memorable Moments" from recent films and "Classic Clips" from older  films. Said Martin: "If you're on a date and you don't know what else to talk  about, these slides will stimulate conversation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suzuki Runner-Up Appeals to Dealers  </P> <P> The Los Angeles agency that finished second to Asher/Gould in the race for the  Suzuki advertising business late last year continues to snatch various Suzuki  dealer association accounts throughout the state.  </P> <P> Hakuhodo Advertising won a combined $1 million in annual billings from Suzuki  dealer groups in Seattle and San Francisco. It already handles about $1 million  in annual billings from Suzuki dealer outfits in San Diego, Phoenix and Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Said Hakuhodo spokeswoman Jo DeLyon, "We're demonstrating our capabilities to  do automotive advertising."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Smoking on Flights Sparks CigArrest Ads  </P> <P> Peter Stranger happily marked Feb. 26 on his calendar. That's not his birthday,  his anniversary or, for that matter, a day off from work.  </P> <P> It is the day on which a regulation banning smoking takes effect on all  domestic flights lasting six hours or less. And the new client that his Los  Angeles ad agency recently picked up is counting on that day as a major  marketing tool.  </P> <P> The client: Advantage Life Products, a Laguna Hills maker of CigArrest  stop-smoking products and chewing gum, which the company claims helps stop the  tobacco craving. The company's annual billings are estimated at $4 million. And  Stranger, who is president of the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee  WCRS, believes that as more people are told that they can't smoke in places  such as airplanes and office buildings, they will turn to products such as  CigArrest.  </P> <P> "This is not just for those who want to quit," said Stranger. "It is also for  smokers who are stuck in places where they are not allowed to smoke."  </P> <P> He said his agency will create some humorous ads depicting these situations.  Stranger himself quit smoking about 10 years ago. But not because he wanted to.  </P> <P> "I met a woman who didn't like my smoking," he said. "My wife."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bank Offers Depositors a Waldorf Weekend  </P> <P> Some banks will do almost anything to get your money. A New York bank is even  waving a weekend at the Waldorf Astoria at its big-ticket customers. Commercial  Bank of New York, an 18-month-old bank with assets of $278 million, offers two  (taxable) weekend nights and breakfasts at the Waldorf (estimated value: $425)  to customers who purchase 30-month, $100,000 certificates of deposit. Interest  rates on these CDs have recently varied between 8.5% and 8.875%.  </P> <P> A recent newspaper ad showed a photo of a Waldorf room key under this headline:  "We're offering this particular CD with some reservations."  </P></p>

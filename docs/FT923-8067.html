			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Schools chief to resign over opt-out scheme THE CHIEF of England's largest metropolitan education authority has announced his resignation in a protest against the government's policy of breaking local-authority control over state schools. Mr David Hammond, chief education officer at Birmingham City Council for the past 10 years, will not renew his contract when it expires in March. 'I don't want to be part of a system which will have local government taken out of education,' he said yesterday. The government's education white paper, published last month, encourages schools to opt out of local-authority control and receive their funding directly from Whitehall. 'I don't believe that I want to be part of this process,' said Mr Hammond, after reflecting on his position for the past two weeks. His move adds to the controversy over education in general and the arguments about the state of the Birmingham education system in particular. When Mr John Patten, the education secretary, introduced his white paper, he alleged that Birmingham was 'one of the worst education authorities' in the country and accused it of 'kidnapping' Pounds 55m from its education budget. The city council rejected the charges, arguing that many education services are not run out of the education budget. This financial year, Birmingham City Council's gross spending on education will be Pounds 571m, or Pounds 54m more than in 1991-92. So far only three state schools have opted for grant-maintained status outside local-authority control, in spite of three years of oppor-tunity. In the six remaining months of his appointment, Mr Hammond will conduct a review of the city's education service, looking at, inter alia, cost-effectiveness and quality. He said that his departure would mean that 'in offering a vision of the future to the city council I am as impartial as I can be'. Although Mr Hammond sees some merit in the white paper's suggestions on, for example, the provision of education to children with special needs, he is worried about the future of specialist services in the education system under Mr Patten's planned regime. Mr Hammond also predicts five years of chaos in the system, noting that there might be three authorities working in Birmingham. They would be the city council itself; the funding agency that serves those schools no longer under local-authority control; and the educational associations planned by the government for problem schools.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Wall Street's ebullience inspires Pacific Rim Reports of the development of an advanced plastic optical fibre prompted investor interest in telecommunications companies and optical fibre makers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average closed 36.41 up at the day's high of 20,628.53 on index-linked buying and purchases by some domestic institutions. The index fell to a low of 20,533.51 in the morning, but it was supported in the afternoon by small-lot buying on reports of the optical fibre development, and of a consortium of 45 companies planning to commercialise it. Volume totalled 264m shares, against 181.2m. Some investors bought telecom stocks ahead of Japan Telecom's listing next Tuesday. The Topix index of all first section shares edged ahead 3.02 to 1,640.39 and the Nikkei 300 gained 1.09 at 299.25, but declines led rises by 519 to 389, with 224 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.80 to 1,338.66. Mitsubishi Rayon, the day's most active issue, advanced Y47, or 11 per cent, to Y472. As the leading plastic fibre manufacturer, it will be participating in the consortium. Brokers and investors piled into the stock, which did not trade during the morning due to a lack of sellers. Other beneficiaries included NEC, ahead Y20 at Y1,220, Fujitsu, up Y10 at Y1,090, and Sumitomo Electric Industries, a leading telecom cable company, which firmed Y10 to Y1,500. Other telecommunication stocks were actively traded. Nitsuko climbed Y40 to Y1,620 and NTT moved ahead Y13,000 to Y912,000. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 20.56 to 22,852.05 in volume of 43.5m shares. Roundup The bullish trend in New York was echoed and, in some cases, amplified. Kuala Lumpur was closed for Malaysia's National Day holiday. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index finished above 9,900 for the first time since mid-March, rising 242.83, or 2.5 per cent, to 9,929.39. Turnover climbed again, from HKDollars 5.19bn to HKDollars 6.50bn. Brokers said the visit to Beijing by US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown rekindled American investors' interest in Hong Kong as well as in China. Jardine Matheson surged HKDollars 4.75 to HKDollars 72.75 and Jardine Strategic advanced HKDollars 2.90 to HKDollars 32. They had lagged behind the recent market rise, and news that share trading of the companies will shift to Singapore from January 3 after delisting from Hong Kong boosted interest. BOMBAY hit an all-time high, the BSE 30-share index adding 62.91 at 4,588.16 on good company results and a normal monsoon. Brokers said this bull market had more virtues than its predecessor which peaked over two years ago; the latter, they added, was fuelled by money which came from the inter-bank securities market and led to the country's worst ever, Dollars 1.28bn financial scandal. The scandal involved brokers and bankers who colluded to divert money from the securities market to the then booming Bombay bourse. Share prices crashed after the scandal was exposed in April 1992. BANGKOK posted its fourth consecutive gain on foreign buying of banking and communications blue chips, and on active speculative trade. The SET index closed 32.30, or 2.2 per cent, higher at 1,524.83. Turnover increased from Bt14.2bn to Bt18.6bn. Banks rose 3.3 per cent in Bt5bn of turnover, and communications by 4.3 per cent in Bt2.7bn. SYDNEY's golds gained 1.4 per cent as the All Ordinaries index put on 5.6 at 2,122.1. The Perth-based Orbital Engine jumped 19 cents, or nearly 11 per cent, to ADollars 1.94 on its development of a cheap fuel injection system for motorcycle engines, claimed to cut pollution by 95 per cent and boost fuel efficiency by 45 per cent. WELLINGTON was lifted by well received results from Fletcher Challenge, which appreciated 13 cents to NZDollars 4.18, a 1994 high for the industrial conglomerate. The NZSE-40 index moved up 15.67 to 2,148.48. KARACHI remained under pressure due to political uncertainty, the KSE 100 index falling 34.56 to 2,186.90.</p>

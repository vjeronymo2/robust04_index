			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Kiev] </F>   [Text] North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam  threatened that South Korea will be devastated if a war between  North and South Korea breaks out. Prior to his departure after  winding up his visit to Ukraine, Kim Yong-nam asserted that  South Korea will face a calamity if a war breaks out because  South Korea blindly follows the U.S. policy to enforce sanctions.    Kim Yong-nam said North Korea has the will and sufficient  capability to defend itself from sanctions. Kim Yong-nam also  stressed that North Korea will continue to pursue missile  launching tests.</p>

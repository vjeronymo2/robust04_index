			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Australia bank sells 4.5% stake in its NZ rival National Australia Bank said it had sold its 4.5 per cent stake in local rival Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), AP-DJ reports from Melbourne. National Australia said in a statement it sold 30.6m ordinary or common shares at ADollars 5.635 each, representing about 2.3 per cent of ANZ's issued shares. The bank has entered into a call option arrangement for the sale of the balance of its ANZ stake. National Australia bought its 50m shares in ANZ in 1989 as part of a strategic link-up or possible merger between the two commercial banks. However, in 1992 the Australian government declared it would oppose any merger between the four leading local commercial banks in the interests of maintaining competition in the financial sector.</p>

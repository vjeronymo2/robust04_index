			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> PERU DEVALUES CURRENCY HURT BY DRUG TRADE  </P> <P> Peru moved to wrest control of exchange rates from the drug trade Thursday,  devaluing the inti by about 1% as the start of a plan to bring order to its  currency markets.  </P> <P> The devaluation was the first in a government program of daily  mini-devaluations aimed at easing the instability of exchange rates caused  mainly by infusions of dollars from the narcotics trade.  </P> <P> "I cannot allow exchange rates to remain in the hands of the drug trade and  those who do not care about the country," Economy Minister Cesar Vasquez Bazan  told Congress in speech on Tuesday announcing the plan.  </P> <P> He said the so-called parallel or informal exchange rate had become "driven by  supply and demand from the drug trade" and speculation. Peru is the world's  biggest cocaine producer.  </P> <P> The 0.99% devaluation brought the official exchange rate to 2,045.25 intis to  the dollar from 2,025.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Artificial Stress  </P> <P> The parallel dollar rate seesawed on the program's first day, reflecting  uncertainty among speculators despite Vasquez Bazan's goal of stabilizing  currency markets. The inti fell to 2,900 to the dollar by early afternoon from  Wednesday's closing rate of 3,125 intis.  </P> <P> Economists praised the mini-devaluation plan as a tool to bring order to  exchange rates that have fluctuated widely since late last year. A large  infusion of drug dollars puts artificial stress on the banking system.  </P> <P> "We should move towards a realistic exchange rate, not one set by the drug  trade or oligarchic groups," said economist Manuel Lajo, quoted by the local  Andina news agency.  </P> <P> But Lajo and other economists said Vasquez Bazan, President Alan Garcia's sixth  economy minister, was too sketchy on what he would do to hold back inflation  after it hit nearly 500% in the first four months of the year.  </P> <P> The illicit cocaine trade is virtually the only economic activity currently  thriving in Peru, where industry has fallen into its worst slump of this  century, economists say.  </P></p>

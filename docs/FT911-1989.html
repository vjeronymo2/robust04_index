			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Utility to seek new source of uranium ONTARIO Hydro will soon start looking for substantial new supplies of uranium in the wake of its decision to cancel a contract with Denison Mines of Toronto covering 40 per cent of its current needs. Mr Douglas Smith, Ontario Hydro's director of fuels, said talks on new long-term contracts would probably begin later this year, with deliveries starting in 1994. A large portion of the purchases are likely to come from new high-grade mines in Saskatchewan. The Denison Mines contract was for 1.4m lbs a year rising to 5.4m lbs in 1994. It was cancelled after price negotiations collapsed. Denison has been supplying the material from a low-grade underground mine near Elliot Lake, northern Ontario, where production costs are about three times higher than current market prices. Ontario Hydro declines to reveal pricing details of its contract with Denison, which was signed at the peak of the uranium market in the late 70s. It is understood to be paying Denison more than USDollars 50 a lb, compared to current spot market prices of USDollars 9-10 a lb. The utility, which operates three nuclear power stations, is also reviewing its contract for uranium supplied from northern Ontario by Rio Algom, a subsidiary of Britain's RTZ. Ontario Hydro has the option of giving notice on the 1.2m lbs-a-year Rio Algom contract this year, to take effect in 1993. Rio Algom's production costs are understood to be lower than Denison's. The cancellation of the Denison contract is a severe blow to the town of Elliot Lake. It will mean the loss of 1,050 jobs, coming on top of 2,300 layoffs in the past year as a result of earlier cuts by Denison and Rio Algom. Rio Algom has closed two of its three mines in the area.</p>

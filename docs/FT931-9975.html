			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Commonwealth Bank climbs 5% on lower write-offs COMMONWEALTH Bank of Australia yesterday reported a 5 per cent improvement in operating profits for the six months ended December, confirming that it has managed to steer clear of the worst of the problems besetting some of Australia's big banks. The bank, 70 per cent owned by the Federal government, is holding the interim dividend steady at 20 cents a share after an increase in operating profit from ADollars 225.1m to ADollars 236.4m (USDollars 158.2m) for the six months. In contrast to rivals like Westpac and the ANZ Bank, Commonwealth got through the six months with reduced bad debt write-offs, no property provisions and slightly lower problem loans on its books. The bank reduced its charge against profit for bad and doubtful debts by 14.5 per cent to ADollars 346.5m while gross non-accrual loans carried eased by 1 per cent to ADollars 3.69bn. A further less serious problem loan category, reflecting loans in arrears, fell from ADollars 1.23bn to ADollars 974.7m. Mr David Murray, managing director, said valuations of the bank's commercial property portfolio, covering exposures of about ADollars 7.2bn, indicated that no further provisioning was necessary. The performance allowed the bank to improve its risk weighted capital adequacy ratio from 10.02 to 10.66 per cent, comfortably exceeding the Reserve Bank's minimum 8 per cent requirement. The bank's total assets eased from ADollars 88.9bn to ADollars 88.3bn. Mr Murray said a key reason for the bank's improved earnings performance was a a 3.6 per cent fall to ADollars 1.47bn in operating expenses. The bank reduced its staff by just over 5,000 to 44,174 in the half. 'Further falls in operating expenses will be achieved as the integration of the former State Bank of Victoria is completed,' he said. 'The banking industry is likely to experience continuing low demand for credit which, combined with the low household savings ratio, will maintain pressure on margins. By far the biggest contribution to the bank's profit came from banking operations, up 1 per cent to ADollars 212.7m. Commonwealth's finance arm, CBFC, remained profitable, more than doubling its contribution to ADollars 23.7m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Investigation" article by Sergey </F> Pluzhnikov, Sergey Sokolov, and Mikhail Morozov "prepared from  materials from more than 100 open Western and Russian  publications": "Will Kim Il-song Explode Our Atom Bomb?"]    [Excerpts] There has long been a debate over North Korea's  preparations for a nuclear attack on imperialism -- a debate  which, with time, has been attracting more and more new rumors  and facts. For a long time this problem remained overshadowed by  the real nuclear threats to the world posed by the superpowers.  But now that a relative lull has ensued in the years-long arms  race between the United States and the USSR, readers have been  swamped by a wave of information about North Korea's hush-hush  nuclear program from the pages of many countries' respectable  publications. Grandfather Kim Il-song, whose "chuche" ideas  elicited only a wry smile, was instantly transformed by  journalists' pens into a maniac capable of pressing the nuclear  button at any moment. The current surge of interest, mixed with  fear, in North Korea's nuclear affairs has also been occasioned  by the proximity of this "preserve of socialism" to Japan, the  only country to have experienced the nightmare of nuclear  bombing raids. Recently all the arguments have boiled down to  one question -- does Kim Il-song have a bomb, with whose help he  could smash to smithereens a very strong mainstay of the world  economy? [passage omitted]  <H5>  Hand of Moscow </H5>   An unprecedented scandal, connected with the improvement of  missiles and of the DPRK nuclear program as a whole, erupted in  October 1992. Security Ministry staffers detained 36 Russian  scientists at Sheremetyevo-2 Airport. They had been intending  to fly to Pyongyang along with their families.    It later came to light that prominent representatives of the  Russian military-industrial complex had wanted to get jobs in  the DPRK and had already drawn up contracts: Professor Arkadiy  Bakhmutov, specialist in rocket engine building and winner of  the Komsomol [All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League] Prize;  Doctor of Sciences Valeriy Strakhov, department head at the  Scientific Research Institute of Special Machine Building in  Bochkovo; Yuriy Bessarabov, one of the creators of the Zyb  rocket and a Komsomol Prize winner; and other specialists in the  sphere of rocket building. The organizer of this work landing  force on the Russian side was Anatoliy Rubtsov, a specialist in  the sphere of solid state physics well known in the circles of  scientists working for the military-industrial complex. The  organizer on the DPRK side was Major General Nam Chae-uk, who  was declared persona non grata by the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Security.    Anatoliy Rubtsov told journalists that a plan had existed to  send 200 Russian scientists to the DPRK to create the scientific  base of North Korean rocket building. "I did not initiate it,"  Rubtsov maintained. "In August 1992 Stepanov, chief of the  Russian Federation Industry Ministry Machine Building  Administration, visited North Korea and signed a general  agreement in this regard. It was proposed that I form a group.  But South Korea promised Russia aid of $1 billion, and the  Russian Government abruptly changed the state policy and agreed  to restrictions in relations with the DPRK." At the same time  Rubtsov said that the North Koreans had "approached" him back in  April 1991, when he was lecturing in Beijing: "I was made a  suitable offer of permanent work, and I accepted it. I was  elected a member of the North Korean Academy of Sciences and  appointed director of a scientific research institute. My  younger sister passed dollars to someone at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and in exchange obtained from the First Consular  Section clean passports for 200 people to travel abroad. The  money had been passed to me by a representative of the North  Korean Embassy in Moscow, and my receipt was sent to Pyongyang."    Almost all the scientists detained at Sheremetyevo-2 told  journalists the same thing: "It is all the same to us for which  political purposes our knowledge might be used; we only wanted  to carry on doing our favorite thing."    According to data in some respectable publications, more  than  20 Russian scientists nonetheless managed to get work in the  DPRK (mainly through China). They live there under aliases,  make $3,000-4,000 a month, and want for nothing. According to  press allegations, however, some of our scientists no longer  need to risk and negotiate border checkpoints in order to work  on the North Korean nuclear program. They sit at home and send  their calculations to Pyongyang by computer mail, which it is  not yet possible to monitor.  <H5>  Patriot Games </H5>   Strange though it may seem, the noisy and protracted scandal  surrounding North Korea's nuclear program is advantageous to  almost all the political forces involved in it. Kim Il-song, by  ambiguously denying the existence of the bomb and not admitting  International Atomic Energy Agency experts to certain nuclear  installations, is attracting universal attention to his rotten  regime and probably hoping in the future to secure some  financial injections for the paralyzed economy. Russia is  getting a strong argument in its dialogue with Japan over the  transfer of the northern territories: Forget about the Kurils  for the time that it takes to neutralize all our scientists,  without whom the DPRK nuclear program will simply collapse.  Incidentally, Russia, which is still lagging behind the grand  international politics of the United States, is in the worst  position in this game -- there is a great risk of losing for a  very long time its former influence in this region, as well as  any hope of recovering the multibillion [currency not specified]  debt from the DPRK. China, remaining neutral in respect of  Pyongyang's semimythical nuclear threat, awaits an easing of the  U.S. economic sanctions. The Japanese military is acquiring  authority and influence in its own state, increasingly  insistently demanding that the government increase defense  appropriations. Finally, the United States and NATO,  successfully prompting Japan to create -- with their  participation, naturally -- a costly ABM "umbrella," are  cherishing the hope of securing not only military orders worth  billions [currency not specified] but also access to unique  Japanese technologies, which, as a result, will enable the  Americans to weaken their main economic rival. Seoul with its  10 million residents, keeping calm, as usual, when targeted by  North Korea's 8,400 howitzers and 2,400 missile launchers, is  more concerned about rice prices at present.    All this resembles a cynically conceived conspiracy, in  which  all are at one, but the leading role is, of course, played by  the United States. Only it is of very great concern that in  such games the situation frequently gets out of control.</p>

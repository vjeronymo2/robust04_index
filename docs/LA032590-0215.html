			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWERS VIEWS  </P> <P> I have often wanted to write and tell a television producer exactly how I feel.  </P> <P> However, in the Feb. 25 edition of Viewers' Views, someone beat me to it.  Bernice Bowers is the woman who commented about Deborah Norville's performance  on "Today." I agree with her -- Deborah is a horrible replacement for the  seasoned and even-natured Jane Pauley. I'm glad Bryant Gumbel is there to  improve things.  </P> <P> Cheryl Bailey, Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Feb 07, BNS -- Vytautas Landsbergis,  leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition, urged  Lithuanian authorities to ask NATO for help because "the  military ring around Lithuania does not weaken but strengthens."    Landsbergis said Lithuania should already use the rights  given by NATO's Partnership for Peace plan and must invite NATO  experts to observe the situation in and around the Baltic  region. At a press conference Monday [7 February], the  opposition leader said the step is necessary because Russia  concentrates its military force in the Kaliningrad region,  delays the withdrawal of its troops from the Baltics and creates  its army bases in Belarus.    Landsbergis said Lithuanian leaders have not asked the  alliance for help because they think the step may be interpreted  as a challenge and may be annoying to Russia.    In Landsbergis' words, despite all statements by Western  leaders that they do not want to set new borders in Europe, the  continent is divided into three parts.    The opposition leader said the first and "safe" part of the  continent is Western Europe, which comprises members of the  European Union, NATO and "those on the threshold."    "Russia-dominated Eurasia" makes up the second part, he  said.    The third, "exhausted" intermediate zone may turn to either  side. The countries that belong to this zone are unwilling to be  swallowed by the ruble zone or a military union with Russia, but  they face such a threat, the opposition leader said.    Hence, Landsbergis said, Lithuania and other countries in  this zone must make up their minds on how to regard Partnership  for Peace - as a substitute for NATO membership or as a  prerequisite for it.</p>

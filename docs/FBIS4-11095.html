			<p>BFN     [Text] President Aristide is once again criticizing U.S.  policy toward Haiti. The president-in-exile accused the United  States of lacking political willingness to see the return of  democracy to Haiti, and called their policy racist and a cynical  joke.    Washington's policy of returning the Haitian refugees is a  way of saying they could care less about them; they can die. So  far, President Bill Clinton has shown no proof that he cares  about them, asserted Father Aristide during a news conference on  Thursday.    Aristide came to support the hunger strike of the director  of  the association, Transafrica, Rindall Robinson. Mr. Robinson has  decided to pursue his hunger strike, begun on 12 April to  protest the summary repatriations of Haitian refugees and the  American policy in Haiti that he calls cruel, discriminatory,  and deeply racist.    The United States, said Aristide, set up a sort of  artificial  embargo, but that is not what we are asking for. He reiterated  the need for a total embargo. It should be recalled that  President Clinton asserted on 20 April the willingness of the  United States to pursue the trade embargo against Haiti in order  to achieve the return of democracy to Haiti.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "F-16 Planes Will Be Available Soon"] </F>   [Text] Federal Defense Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani has  said that our relations with the United States are improving.  The supply of F-16 planes and other equipment, which were  withheld due to the Pressler Amendment, will begin soon.  Pakistan has already paid the United States $1 billion for the  F-16 planes. Pakistan is also trying to acquire arms from  France and the PRC to fortify its defense. The possibility of  acquiring F-16 planes and other equipment from the United States  is viewed as an indication of improving relations between the  two countries. Pakistan also can purchase the equipment  necessary for its defense from the open market. However, if  they can be obtained from the United States or any other  friendly country, then their uninterrupted supply can be  assured. Pakistan is not oblivious of its defense requirements  even for a moment and is meeting its defense needs on a priority  basis.</p>

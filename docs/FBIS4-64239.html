			<p>BFN     [Text] The mass exodus of refugees from war-torn Rwanda is  continuing. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red  Crescent Societies issued a statement in Geneva saying up to  half a million people were believed to be heading for Tanzania.  The federation said 300,000 refugees had already arrived in  northwestern Tanzania. It described the exodus as the largest  single movement of refugees in the federation's 75-year history.  The Red Cross said it was sending an emergency aid team from  Kenya to Tanzania, adding that massive amounts of relief  supplies, including blankets and medicines, were needed  urgently. The continuing flood of refugees comes after the UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali appealed for a large military  force to be sent to Rwanda to end the tribal carnage.</p>

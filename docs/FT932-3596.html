			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Business pins hopes on breakthrough in Gatt: Apple chief puts stress on market access deal BIG business in the US is worried about President Clinton's slide in popularity but is pinning its hopes of a revival on a breakthrough in the Gatt world trade talks next month, according to Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer. Mr Sculley said an agreement on market access between the US, Japan, Canada and the EC at next month's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo would give an important psychological stimulus to the world economy, strengthening Mr Clinton's chances of securing congressional support for his tax package. A confidant of Mr Clinton, Mr Sculley added these two successes would leave the president able to take on ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada: 'Then you will see his popularity increasing dramatically in September and October.' Mr Sculley offered his assessment of the US and European political scene during a wide-ranging interview last week in Brussels, where he was attending a meeting of the Transatlantic Policy Network, a new group of industrialists and parliamentarians dedicated to improving transatlantic relations. In the interview, Mr Sculley described Mr Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, as a 'true visionary' in his drive to create the European single market. Now he was the ideal figure to carry a new message: that the EC had to move from the 'old economy' to a new, high skills, information intensive economy dependent on increasing productivity. Higher productivity did not mean fewer jobs, he said. Rather the aim should be to raise productivity through economic expansion by means of greater market access. Mr Sculley was equivocal about the EC's plans for a single currency. He criticised high German interest rates as 'a misplaced policy', adding that it was 'unfortunate that all of Europe is having to pay for the assimilation of East Germany into West Germany'. On trade matters, Mr Sculley drew a distinction between Japan and the EC, noting that the US-European relationship had largely been trouble-free in the context of the overall trade balance. On Japan, Mr Sculley strongly defended the administration's tough approach. Although he rejected the term 'managed trade', he suggested that some numerical measure of market access was justified. 'However you get there, the US can't go on year after year with a huge bilateral imbalance between us and Japan.'</p>

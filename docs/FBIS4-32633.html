Minister Martino is leading a delegation of his government  which is paying a visit to the Republic of Croatia. Tihomir  Vinkovic has a report:    [Vinkovic] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  minister of foreign affairs, had talks at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs in Zagreb this afternoon with Italian Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino. Following the talks Italian Minister  Martino stated that their talks were cordial and informative and  added:    [Martino, in Italian with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation] "I had an opportunity to hear the Croatian  Government's opinion on the situation in former Yugoslavia and  the prospects for peace. This information is valuable to us  ahead of the forthcoming meeting of the G-7 and Russia in  Naples. As regards bilateral relations, I am extremely pleased  with the constructive approach displayed by the Croatian side.  I also hope that these talks will be put into practice."    [Vinkovic] Following the talks Croatian Foreign Minister  Mate  Granic stated:    [Granic] ``We had a friendly and useful meeting which  focused  on the situation in the region, on the situation in the occupied  areas of the Republic of Croatia and prospects for peaceful  reintegration, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  prospects for peace there, on forecasts regarding the proposal  by the contact group, whether it will be accepted or not, and on  prospects for peace or war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In every case  Croatia supports the negotiated peaceful option, as this offers  the chance to restore peace in the entire region.    ``We also had talks about bilateral relations, the process  of  integration of the Republic of Croatia into Europe. We would  like to thank Italy for its support to the Republic of Croatia  in the process of its European integration. This primarily  refers to an economic agreement with the European Union [EU] and  its admission to some EU projects, such as PHARE [Aid to Poland  and Hungary for Economic Reconstruction], the (TEMPUS) program,  and finally, our goal is associate membership of the EU.    "As regards our bilateral relations, i.e. protection of the  Italian minority, Croatia will observe all their existing rights  and the best European standards; we are also ready for a  bilateral agreement with the Republic of Italy."    [Vinkovic] The Italian foreign minister will also be  received  by Cardinal Kuharic. This evening he will be received by  Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTH LAKE TAHOE;  </P> <P> TV SHOW HELPS LOST GIRL SURVIVE FREEZE  </P> <P> A 14-year-old girl who got lost skiing survived a night of subzero temperatures  by using a technique she saw on television.  </P> <P> Maureen Lamerdin of Glenbrook, Nev., told authorities she dug a cave in the  snow, then climbed in and covered herself with pine boughs. She said she  learned the trick from "High Mountain Ranger," a TV show that was filmed at  Lake Tahoe. Lamerdin was skiing at Heavenly Valley when she got lost during a  snowstorm. She said she could not find the trail, and tried to follow a stream  out of the mountains. When darkness came, she fashioned the snow cave. In the  morning, she again started to follow the stream and was found by a search team.  </P></p>

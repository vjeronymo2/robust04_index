The executives were key members of a cartel of 66  contractors  including Kajima in Saitama Prefecture. They attempted to  solicit Nakamura's cooperation in blocking a probe by the Fair  Trade Commission (FTC) into suspected bid-rigging practices.    Prosecutors have questioned some executives of the  contractors as witnesses, the sources said.    Nakamura, after being stripped by the Diet of his  parliamentary immunity from arrest, was arrested Friday on  suspicion of receiving a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima's  former senior vice president, Shinji Kiyoyama, in January 1992.  Kiyoyama, who is now on trial on charges of sending bribes to  former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, 76, was rearrested Tuesday  for reportedly passing the bribe to Nakamura.    The money was allegedly intended as a reward for Nakamura  exerting his influence to help block an accusation by the FTC  against the cartel over the scheme to rig bids on public works  projects in Saitama Prefecture. The FTC announced in May 1992  that it would not file an accusation with prosecutors, and  instead ordered the contractors to stop the collusive activities.    FTC Chairman Masami Kogayu said Friday the commission was  never influenced by outside forces on decisions involving cases  of violating the antimonopoly law.</p>

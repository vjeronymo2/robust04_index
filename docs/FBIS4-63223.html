			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Platkovskiy article: "Kim Il-song Has Not </F> Forgotten Gorbachev's `Treachery,' But Is Not Averse to Giving  Yeltsin a Game"]    [Text] There are certain signs that Russia and North Korea  are overcoming their period of estrangement.    In the opinion of Russian diplomats, a turning point in  Pyongyang's policy emerged during the talks at deputy foreign  minister level held in Moscow.    Dialogue between Moscow and Pyongyang came to a standstill  in  1990, when diplomatic relations were established between the  USSR and South Korea -- a state which is still not recognized in  the North. The DPRK accused Mikhail Gorbachev of "selling out  to the puppets in Seoul for $3 billion and betraying true  friends."    Since the collapse of the Union and the appearance of new  leaders in Moscow the North Korean leadership has maintained the  utmost coldness in relations with Russia. Nina Andreyeva and  Lyudmila Zykina have become the most cherished visitors in  Pyongyang.    Now, when North Korea is under pressure from the United  States and its allies, who are demanding that nuclear programs  be brought out into the open, Pyongyang is solely reliant on the  support of China, its traditional ally. Moscow's attempts to  act as mediator in the nuclear dispute had so far been rejected  by the North Koreans. However, at these recent talks there was  a shift in Pyongyang's stance.    As IZVESTIYA was informed by Valentin Moiseyev, department  leader in the Russian Foreign Ministry, for the first time the  North Korean side made a positive assessment of Moscow's  initiative to hold an international conference on questions of  the security and nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula with  the participation of Russia, the United States, China, Japan,  the DPRK, South Korea, and representatives of the UN secretary  general and of the International Atomic Energy Agency.    Moscow diplomats want to ensure that Russia has the  opportunity to influence the situation. Moscow is very  concerned by the fact that the United States is threatening the  DPRK with international economic sanctions. It will be Russia,  which maintains trading and economic links with North Korea,  which will have to pay the price here, and not the United  States, which has no such links.    It is important, according to our diplomats, to maintain  balanced, friendly relations with both North and South Korea. A  clear tilt toward Seoul has now emerged.    The talks did not touch on questions of military-technical  cooperation. However, according to available information,  Russian Defense Ministry circles do not rule out the possibility  in the first instance of supplying the North Korean Army with  spare parts for its military hardware: The bulk of the  equipment in the DPRK is Soviet-made. Our military experts  think that it will thereby be possible to obtain additional  levers of influence on the North Korean leadership.    Meanwhile Russian diplomats continue trying to persuade the  North Koreans of the need to observe the requirements stemming  from the Treaty on the Nonproliferetion of Nuclear Weapons. The  latest attempts were made during the last consultations. They  were unsuccessful.</p>

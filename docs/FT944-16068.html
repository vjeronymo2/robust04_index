			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Major promises time of stability: Prime minister rebuffs calls for rightward shift in Tory party's direction Mr John Major staked the Conservatives' claim to the centre ground of British politics yesterday as he used his closing address to the Tory conference in Bournemouth to rebuff calls for a rightward shift in the party's direction. In a speech defining the terms in which he intends to confront Mr Tony Blair's Labour party, the prime minister promised a sustained economic recovery, an end to upheavals in the welfare state and a strong but pragmatic approach to Europe. Basing his hopes of political revival firmly on an economy offering steady growth and low inflation, he evoked a pledge made in 1954 by the then Tory chancellor Mr RA Butler to double Britain's living standards within 25 years. Mr Butler's much derided ambition had been met, he said. The Tories offered the opportunity to repeat the achievement over the next 25 years. Mr Major, who gave a hint of tax cuts before the next election, signalled that he would make defence of the British Union - symbolised by his opposition to devolution in Scotland and Wales - one of the main platforms on which the government would fight the next general election. In a confident if unspectacular performance, he left no doubt that he intended to spend the two years or more before that election in rebuilding the government's reputation for competence rather than on embarking on radical new reforms. Ending a conference which had been unsettled by ideological battles over Europe and attempts by the party's right wing to dictate the political agenda, Mr Major declared: 'Change for the sake of change should never appeal to any Conservative. In a world of bewildering change this party must stand for continuity and stability, for home and health.' To reinforce the message of consolidation he coupled a commitment to a large-scale extension of nursery education and to compulsory sport in schools with a pledge that there would be no more significant reforms over the next five years. He offered a similar promise to the chiefs of the armed forces, saying the huge upheavals in their services were at an end. Responding to Labour charges of 'creeping privatisation' in the National Health Service, he insisted the Conservatives would never 'while I live and breathe' take away the security offered by free health care. The consolidatory tone cast doubt on plans to privatise the Post Office, which Mr Major did not mention. But Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, intends to continue to fight for the sell-off. Mr Major's speech, which aides said he had written largely himself, included only a fleeting reference to the issue which overshadowed much of the conference - Europe. But he made clear that Euro-sceptics would not push him into into abandoning his strategy of keeping Britain within a multi-speed, multi-tiered European Union. There was no direct mention of Mr Blair, but the prime minister accused Labour of stealing the Conservatives' rhetoric while sticking to destructive economic policies and promoting the 'politics of envy'. He said: 'Buying Tory policies from Labour is like buying a Rolex on the street corner. It may bear the name, but you know it's not real.' Conference reports, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 8</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Tagging test for curfew criminals Ministers have ordered trials of electronic tagging of criminals covered by curfew orders, the Home Office said last night. The Pounds 1.3m trials will start early next year in Manchester, Reading and Norfolk and will last nine months. Private security companies may be involved in running the three pilot schemes. The tags will be used to ensure that offenders placed under curfew orders - a sanction so far seldom used - abide by them. A previous tagging experiment was abandoned five years ago after difficulties with equipment. The scheme is being resurrected while the Home Office is reviewing non-custodial sentencing to ensure that it is tougher and tightly supervised.</p>

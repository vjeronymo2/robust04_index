			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Significant rise to Pounds 1.3m for Wilshaw Maintaining market share at the same time as tightening cost controls and increasing efficiency enabled Wilshaw to lift pre-tax profit from Pounds 732,000 to Pounds 1.34m in the year ended March 31 1992. Earnings per share rose to 1.07p (0.61p) and the final dividend is 0.3p for a total of 0.4p (0.3p). The group saw turnover decline to Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 24.9m); but operating profit improved to Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 1.81m), including an exceptional credit of Pounds 56,000 (charge Pounds 182,000), and interest costs were cut to Pounds 709,000 (Pounds 1.08m). Specialist metals contributed Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 418,000) to operating profits, primarily because SG Magnets turned from a significant loss to a satisfactory profit.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [APA report: "Chernobyl: IAEA Report"] </F>   [Text] Vienna (APA) -- Exactly eight years after the  "maximum credible accident" in the Ukrainian nuclear power plant  of Chernobyl, the melting of the core, and the contamination of  half of Europe by radioactive substances, the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna is publishing the findings  of eight experts who examined the state of the nuclear power  plant. Partly alarming facts that caused the IAEA to call for  its closure were shown. Ukraine will continue its operation.    In their report, the IAEA experts state that the probability  that the nuclear power plant will break down has been reduced;  at the same time, however, they expressed concerns in the event  that the reactor is operated outside normal conditions as a  result of wrong handling.    In the opinion of the IAEA, the training and safety concepts  of the radiation protection staff should remain a subject of  criticism. The computer program by which operations are  controlled has been improved, but the hardware restricts the  possibilities.    Further shortcomings that the IAEA ascertained are the  absence of a second shutdown system and an emergency control  room for blocks I and II. The three main steam tubes run above  the only control room.</p>

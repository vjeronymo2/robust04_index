Safranov, Geology and </F> Exploitation of Fuel Minerals Institute, Moscow; Petroleum  Geological Prospecting SRI, Dushanbe; UDC553.98]    [Abstract] The study of trace element compositions of crude  oils has long since passed from purely theoretical  considerations and now has heavy practical applications. The  need for studying trace metal content in crudes is important  from the geochemical, metal ore, technological, economic, and  ecological aspects. In the present work the distribution of  trace elements in various crudes of the paleocenozoic  incrustation of the Afghan-Tadzhik basin are discussed in  conjunction with an evaluation of their metal content.  Abnormally high concentrations of a number of trace elements,  significantly exceeding the Clarke contents of the same elements  in clayey deposits, are indicated. Trace element enrichment of  the crudes is largely due to hypergenic transformation  processes, since ore-bearing concentrations of trace elements  are related to high viscosity, heavy, asphaltic crudes. The  crudes of the Afghan-Tadzhik basin may serve as an alternative  source of such metals as vanadium, nickel, copper, chromium,  cobalt, and possibly others. Figure 1; references 10 (Russian).</p>

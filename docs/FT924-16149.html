			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Bribery of BR staff alleged BRITISH Rail officials were bribed with holidays, lavish meals and trips to Continental night clubs over a 10-year period to help Plasser Railway Machinery GB, the rail maintenance suppliers, to win contracts from BR, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday. The widespread bribery was a systematic attempt to corrupt many staff within BR's civil engineering department. The court was told that far more people had been involved than the three men on trial. Plasser Railway Machinery (GB) Ltd, Mr Norbert Jurasek, the company's managing director, and Mr Michael Brooks, Plasser's company secretary, all deny nine charges of offering bribes to Mr David Currie, a former head of BR's civil engineering department, in order to win contracts from BR. Mr Currie denies nine charges of corruptly accepting the alleged bribes, which included air tickets from London to South Africa, Chicago and Dublin, a trip on the Orient Express, a case of champagne and a ticket to watch rugby at Twickenham. All three men and the company also deny one charge of conspiring to corrupt other BR staff. Opening the case for the prosecution, Mr Michael Worsley QC said the nine transactions before the court were only 'a mere sample' of the conduct that took place between 1978 and 1988. A 'mass' of benefits had been offered to Mr Currie and other people in BR's civil engineering division, he said. 'If there were a charge on the indictment for every transaction of giving and accepting, the courtroom would be full of defendants and the indictment would be a mile long,' Mr Worsley told the court. Mr Jurasek and Mr Brooks were being prosecuted because they were 'at the heart' of what had happened. Mr Currie was the only BR employee to be prosecuted, since he had taken more gifts than anyone else and was the most senior BR employee involved. Mr Currie received his first gift from Plasser - which depended on BR for 95 per cent of its business - in 1978 when, on a trip to Malaysia, the company took him out to dinner. 'From that small beginning, the value of the benefits grew,' Mr Worsley said. In 1985, Mr Currie became the head of BR's civil engineering department and benefits to him came in a 'flood'. Plasser paid for Mr Currie to visit Henley and travel to South Africa and New York. The benefits allowed him to live the life of a rich man, Mr Worsley said. Because of the large scale of the benefits from Plasser, the only interpretation that could be put upon them was that they were corrupt, he continued. No company would have paid for as much as Plasser had without expecting something in return. In Plasser's London offices, a confidential list was kept of who should receive Christmas presents. Mr Worsley said that Mr Brooks had told his secretary, a former Metropolitan policewoman: 'These lists are dynamite if they get into the wrong hands.' Mr Brooks also told her that Plasser was able to succeed in business only because of the gifts it provided, Mr Worsley said. The trial continues today.</p>

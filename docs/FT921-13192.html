			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Questions over the Maxwell pension funds: A look at the issues of trustee vigilance and responsibility For anyone running or contributing to a UK pension fund, the Maxwell saga raises some worrying questions. Perhaps surprisingly, the most disconcerting lessons are not the way in which Mr Robert Maxwell appears to have looted pension fund assets, but the way in which he may have manipulated the funds to his own advantage, perfectly legally. By April 1990, for example, more than half the 20 largest investments in the Mirror Group Newspapers pension fund were in companies which had some connection with Mr Maxwell and his own private interests. Those investments represented roughly 20 per cent of the fund's total. From 1985, when Mirror Group Newspapers first came under Mr Maxwell's control, the pension fund evidenced a striking transformation from a fund whose largest investments were almost exclusively UK blue chip companies to a fund in which none of the 20 largest investments fell into that category. So the central question is: in the period before assets began to disappear, were the funds being run in the best interests of beneficiaries or in the best interests of Mr Maxwell? And even if the pattern of investment did make large profits for the fund, did it expose it to undue risk? For instance, in the year to April 1990, the pension fund's investments in overseas unquoted equities - the most volatile and risky category - rose to Pounds 32.1m, roughly 8 per cent of total investments. Investments in unquoted UK companies also rose sharply to Pounds 8.4m from Pounds 1.7m in 1989. Overall, overseas investments totalled roughly Pounds 160m out of Pounds 422m in total investments. That ratio is roughly double the exposure of a typical UK pension fund to overseas investments. But it is the composition of the 20 largest investments that would normally have caused trustees to question the investment managers, according to Mr Robin Ellison, partner at pensions solicitors Ellison Westhorp and a member of the Occupational Pensions Board. 'None of these investments was out of the ordinary for a pension fund,' Mr Westhorp said. 'But the overall picture raises many questions.' The fund's holdings include a Pounds 20.2m holding in Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC). Other - private - Maxwell companies in the list are a Pounds 7.2m holding of the loan stock of Official Airline Guides, a subsidiary of MCC. It also held a Pounds 2.7m stake in Quebecor, an associate company of Mirror Group Newspapers. The fund also held Pounds 5.4m of First Tokyo Investment Trust, an investment trust managed by London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management. This was a subsidiary of Headington Holdings, a company controlled by Mr Maxwell. Also in the fund are stakes in two privately-owned French investment companies, Euris and Marceau Investissements totalling Pounds 17.1m and Pounds 7.1m respectively. The two companies were involved in an unsuccessful effort to secure control of Societe Generale, the French bank, in late 1988, a move said to have had the backing of France's socialist government and the government-controlled bank Caisse des Depots. At the time, Mr Maxwell was reported to have been one of a group of investors who co-operated in purchasing shares, while Caisse des Depots was reported to have purchased a stake in MCC. Caisse des Depots was on the MCC share register at the time of the Maxwell group's collapse. Mr Maxwell may have encouraged the MGN pension fund to take a stake in Societe Generale on his behalf. Indeed, the MGN pension fund accounts for the year ended April 5, 1989 - the period covering the raid on Societe Generale's shares - show that the fund's second largest investment at that date was a Pounds 16.9m stake in Societe Generale. By 1990, the stake had disappeared from the pension fund's 20 largest investments, but Marceau Investissements and Euris had appeared in its place. Maxwell-related investments had begun earlier. In 1986, the pension fund records its first significant Maxwell-related investment, a Pounds 2.2m stake in BPCC which the accounts note is 'related to the employer'. Subsequently, BPCC's name was changed to Maxwell Communication Corporation. By April 1990 the fund had acquired two other Maxwell-related holdings: a Pounds 3.3m stake in Hollis, a company controlled by the Liechtenstein-based Maxwell Trust; and a Pounds 3.6m holding of Hollis's convertible loan stock. Hollis later became Pergamon AGB and a Pounds 3.6m stake in that company is recorded in the fund's April 1989 accounts. Pensions experts say that there is nothing illegal about any of these holdings. However, Mr Ellison notes general trust law forbids trustees from dealing directly or indirectly with the pension fund unless the trust deed specifically allows it. 'Trustees have three obligations,' Mr Ellison said. 'The first is to diversify investments, the second is to avoid exposing beneficiaries to undue risk and the third is to act reasonably.' When a fund invests in entities connected with a trustee, the board of trustees should normally question the pattern of investment, and seek independent valuations. Trustees should also question any significant departures from normal patterns of asset allocation, and any unusual investment decisions - such as weighting the portfolio heavily in unquoted overseas investments. The trustee in the case of the Mirror fund was a corporate entity, MGPT Ltd, chaired by Mr Maxwell. Just what steps the other board members of MGPT took to explore these issues remains unclear, according to Mr Paul Stannard, of Travers Smith Braithwaite, the solicitors advising the new MGN pension trustees. 'These are questions that we are seeking answers to,' he says. Institutions face Pounds 200m losses, First sales expected, Page 18</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Hamas' Partners Support, </F> Oppose, or Wait for Clarifications"]    [Text] Damascus -- The nine Palestinian factions which,  along with the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), form the  Palestinian Forces Alliance [PFA] opposed to the Oslo agreement,  are divided into two groups in their reaction to Hamas' declared  willingness to "call a truce" with Israel on certain conditions  including withdrawal from the occupied territories.    Their different positions on the Hamas initiative, however,  do not negate the fact that all the factions are "very  reproachful" because they were not consulted before that  "sensitive" position was taken, although some factions have  declined to comment, awaiting "clarifications from Hamas  leaders" who will meet with the leaders of the other factions  next week. The meeting of the "central command" of the alliance  of opposition forces, scheduled to be held on 19 April, was  postponed "but that was because Hamas' leaders were unable to  make the journey from Amman in view of the circumstances they  were experiencing," according to Palestinian sources.    The sources told AL-HAYAH that Hamas is targeted by everyone  because of its position and the fact that it is the only party  operating effectively and aggressively in the territories.    Two trends have emerged within the Palestinian factions  opposed to the Oslo agreement regarding the Hamas "truce." They  are basically based on the various factions' positions, nature,  and views on the Arab-Israeli conflict and the extent of their  willingness to accept phased solutions for that conflict. The  factions which support the "Palestinian national program" (the  1974 phased program) have supported Hamas' new position and see  it as "a positive development in the political thinking." They  include the four factions which are PLO members, namely the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] led by  George Habash, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP] led by Nayif Hawatimah, the Palestinian Popular  Struggle Front [PPSF] led by Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, and the  Palestine Liberation Front [PLF] led by Abu-Nidal al-Ashqar  (Yusuf al-Miqdah).    Those opposed to the new Hamas stance are the factions  opposed to phased solutions such as the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFL-GC] led by Ahmad  Jibril, the Arab Liberation Front (Fatah-the Uprising) led by  Colonel Abu-Musa, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement led  by Fathi al-Shaqaqi.    All the factions, however, are unanimous in their "rebuke"  for the Hamas leaders for not contacting them before taking that  position. DFLP sources said "we would have liked to discuss the  matter within the alliance so that we could announce a unified  position by the alliance." The DFLP sources told AL-HAYAH that  its representative in the alliance Qays al-Samarra'i (Abu-Layla)  had suggested to them "in the early consultations before the  announcement of the alliance that we would be prepared to adopt  the points made regarding the questions of full Israeli  withdrawal and the right of self-determination in return for a  truce" with the Israelis. They added "Hamas should have  discussed the matter within the alliance's central command."    DFLP sources stressed that there were "positive points in  the  main position announced by Hamas in an official statement  because it marked the start of a realistic approach to the  current developments and introduced a tangible crystallized  alternative to the Oslo-Cairo agreements," but the same sources  added that the Hamas initiative included three loopholes "of  serious political implications." One, they said, was that Hamas  appeared to be confining its handling of the Palestinian  question to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including its call  for a new leadership from the people of the West Bank and the  Gaza Strip. That is a serious matter, they added, because it  ignores the unity of the Palestinians at home and abroad.    The second loophole, according to these sources, is that  Hamas ignored "the right of self-determination and just talked  about Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank."    They also pointed out that Hamas "also ignored the refugee  problem which is one of the main causes of the Palestinian  people. That was the third dangerous point in the position of  the brothers in Hamas."    The sources reaffirmed the DFLP's rejection of the fact that  Hamas was treating the Palestinian question "as if it was a  question of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, something we do  not accept at all."</p>

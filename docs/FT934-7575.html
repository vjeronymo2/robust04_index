			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Scots hazy on who supplies which service  -Analysis THE BILL to reform Scottish local government and to re-organise the water and sewerage industry brings to parliament an issue that has already generated intense controversy in Scotland. The bill, likely to have more than 150 clauses, will be fought hard by the opposition parties, and parts of it could even attract opposition from Conservatives. The aim of reforming Scottish local government, last reorganised in 1974, is to make it simpler and easier to understand. Many Scots are still hazy about which council - region or district - is responsible for which service. Some of the regions have never supplanted the old counties in the public mind. Opinion polls suggest that there is a degree of acceptance of the idea of moving to single-tier authorities, though there is argument as to whether it will produce the financial savings in the medium term that the Scottish Office expects. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is officially opposed and has refused to co-operate with the Scottish Office, though some councils have breached this embargo. The map of the new councils has aroused intense controversy. It is widely seen as favouring the Conservative party, where possible, in its drawing of the new boundaries, and in some cases ignoring local loyalties. The charge of gerrymandering has been made against the boundaries of South Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire, Stirling and Berwickshire and East Lothian. Some of the new boundaries can expect strong challenge in committee, and the government has hinted that it may be prepared to make some concessions. The government's proposals on water, outlined in the July white paper, back away from the idea of privatising and possibly floating the water industry on the stock exchange. This was one of the options in the original consultation document but would have been difficult to achieve within this parliament. In any case, it provoked such an outcry in Scotland that the government had to back off. There will be objections in parliament to the lack of democratic accountability of the three proposed water authorities, which are seen by the opposition parties as likely to be Conservative-dominated quangos. The government's proposals in the white paper still involve very substantial private sector involvement in the restructured industry. Private-sector companies will, if the legislation goes through, be asked to build, own and operate the new installations required as part of the Pounds 5bn investment in water and sewerage installations over the next 15 years. This system does not involve transferring the installations back to the publicly owned authorities at a later date, since this would count as leasing and thus be counted in the PSBR, which the Treasury wants to avoid. They would instead remain in private ownership. Thus Scotland may still end up with a substantially privately owned and privately run water industry, without privatisation actually taking place.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Warning of animal drug black market A GROWING black market in animal medicines throughout the single European market was predicted yesterday by the UK's National Office of Animal Health (Noah). 'There is a very grave danger that all that has been done to restore consumer confidence in livestock produce and in the safety of medicines will be shattered on January 1 1993,' said Mr George Gunn, chairman of Noah, the trade association for UK animal medicine manufacturers. An EC directive required all animal medicines to be reviewed to modern standards. This should have led to a standard list of products available in Europe, but had in fact resulted in 'a total shambles', Mr Gunn said. In France 2,500 products had kept their licences after review, compared with only 1,400 in the UK. 'Imagine this recipe repeated over and over again between each of the 12 member states of the new European Community and you will understand our concerns.' Different rates of value added tax further complicated the picture, he said. According to Noah, the 'extreme thoroughness' of the UK testing procedures had led UK manufacturers to spend Pounds 60m in the past five years on purely defensive testing. Some products had been withdrawn in the UK which had stayed on the market in France. Useful products with a small turnover had been lost to the veterinary armoury because the cost of reviewing them was too high.</p>

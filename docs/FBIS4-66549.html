			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chandra Bhushan: "The Bihari Babu Against Lalu"] </F>   [Text] The Bihar Vidhan Sabha election scheduled for  January next year is expected to be interesting. Not only  because Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav will go through a real  test of fire, but also because of the rumors floating around  that the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] will run film star and BJP  member Shatrughna Sinha for the position of chief minister.    If true, the next election definitely will be very  interesting. The central BJP leadership has belatedly learned  the fact that the popularity of a Bihari Babu can be cashed in  on only in Bihar. He was embarrassed when he ran against Rajesh  Khanna for the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat.    Despite numerous efforts by Tarakant Jha and the present  state party president, Kailashpati Misra, the BJP could not  achieve the position in that state that it should have. Yes, the  BJP is in good position in the southern part of the state  because of businessmen and industrialists there. However,  because of the activities of some extremists and the Naxalites,  the political atmosphere here is not as favorable to the BJP as  it was in the past. Lalu Prasad organized an tribal conference  in Patna recently to take the initiative in attracting their  vote bank. According to some sources, Lalu had promised the  tribals all kind of support from the Janata Dal. It means that  the Janata Dal can also win a good number of seats in southern  Bihar this time. Thus, southern Bihar will not be easy to win  for the BJP. Political observers believe that Lalu is also  expected to benefit from the breach in the Jharkhand Mukti  Morcha [JMM].    Most of the BJP members elected to the vidhan sabha are from  southern Bihar. Meanwhile, the BJP got a major jolt when Inder  Singh Namdhari, who was considered one of its strong pillars,  left the party and formed a new party of his own. Later,  Namdhari joined the Janata Dal. The Janata Dal made a crack in a  BJP known for its unity. However, one of its candidates did win  the election for a Rajya Sabha seat. This is a good omen, but  cannot be called a solid base.    Major efforts were made to strengthen the BJP in this state  last year. The right atmosphere was created by the rathyatra  [procession]. Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh, and other major  leaders had attracted huge crowds and made speeches to get  support for the BJP. It is noteworthy that huge crowds had  attended these meetings. It seemed at that time that the BJP  would succeed in forming the government in Bihar. However,  Bihar, notorious for caste-related politics, has taken the wind  out of the BJP sail here. Although Tarakant Jha was replaced  with Kailashpati Misra as president of the state BJP, the BJP  still could not get additional support in Bihar.    Now that the politics here are being made more caste-based  by  calling for rallies of various caste groups, what will the BJP  do? Is it finding itself helpless or is it planning a new  strategy? While reviewing answers to such questions, it was  learned that movie star Shatrughna Sinha would be especially  useful in Bihar. That is why when the question of appointing a  new member to the BJP working committee came up, Lal Krishna  Advani's favorite man Yashwant Sinha, who had deserted the  Samajwadi Janata Party and joined the BJP, was considered to be  the front runner. However, Murli Manohar Joshi insisted on  appointing Sinha to this position. Sinha thus was given an  honorable position in the party by making him a member of the  working committee. It can be easily assumed that he will be  asked to play a major role in Bihar's politics. The BJP knows  that if there is anyone who can make the party strong in this  state then it is Shatrughna Sinha.    There are solid reasons behind this line of thought. The  first reason is that only Sinha can counter the popularity that  Lalu Prasad has gained in this state. He is popular in the whole  state. That fact that his popularity is mostly because of the  his movie star glamour rather than of his political involvement  is a separate issue. The truth is that Shatrughna Sinha is a  heavy weight compared to Lalu Prasad when it comes to attracting  crowds. Second, the caste issue is so prevalent in the state  that the next government should be that of the Janata Dal.  Lalu's image is mostly that of a Dalit leader. Sinha has  established himself among all the caste and religious groups as  a movie star. If the BJP announced that Shatrughna Sinha will be  the chief minister in a BJP government, the BJP would definitely  win the next election.    If the BJP gives more publicity to Kailashpati Misra or  Tarakant Jha, it will suffer on two fronts. First, both are  Brahmans and it will not take much time to establish a negative  environment for them in this caste-oriented state. Second,  neither of these leaders have access to the rural population of  the state. Well-educated persons also do not know them very  well. The same is not true of Sinha. Although the Biharis' craze  for him is related to movies, the people are aware of his  political savvy from some of his public meetings.    Anyhow, Shatrughna Sinha is seeing a green flag from the BJP  high command and has decided to join Bihari politics. In a  recent public meeting in Buxar, he had said that the  caste-related mentality in Bihar is a way of life there, but the  people have also learned that the reason for their backwardness  is the caste system. At the same time, Sinha encouraged regional  politics by asking the people to say "we are Biharis" in the  same tune as they say "we are Indians." This makes it possible  that the people will be attracted to him.</p>

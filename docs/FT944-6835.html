			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Salford hits superhighway. . . - Stephanie Flanders explains how the city plans to make the most of broadband cable networks Think of the path-breakers in the information revolution, and your mind probably turns to business moguls like Bill Gates or techno-wizards at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Few would add Salford City police force to the list. Yet the partners in a new venture in north-west England are aiming to do just that. Nynex CableComms, one of the three largest cable operators in the UK, is teaming up with Salford's city council and universities to make the area, near Manchester, a test-bed for exploring the interactive potential of broadband cable networks in the provision of local services. They are not there yet. But the project is already helping to overturn some of the received wisdom about where the first lanes on the information superhighway might lead. The American-owned cable operator, the licensed cable provider for the region, has spent the past six months agreeing the terms of the experiment with local partners. These are: the City of Salford, the University of Salford and University College Salford (which will merge into a single university in the middle of 1996). Provisionally entitled 'GemiSys 2000', the plan is that the three parties will collaborate in setting up local experimental broadband services in a range of public-sector settings. 'We're not talking about the traditional video-on-demand type stuff,' says John Edwards, Nynex's regional director in Salford. 'The five areas are crime prevention, community service, health, education and training and local business development.' The choice of sectors emerged from discussions with public servants from all over the city, held earlier this year. Experiments in the US with a Massachusetts-based interactive medicine channel and various distance-learning programmes have already shown the scope for applying the new fiber-optic technology to health and education. But crime prevention? 'The acting chief superintendent of police was at one of the sessions,' explains Jane Bentley, one of the project co-ordinators at University College Salford. 'Nynex gave a quick technical demonstration, and that triggered a lot of ideas. We were worried at first, because the policeman was the only one not saying anything. But right at the end, he suddenly came out with a whole list of ways he could use the network: everything from sending out high-quality identikit images to transmitting DNA and other records to other stations.' It will be several years before some of the more ambitious ideas are translated into reality, if ever. But the partners are hoping to start early pilot projects in most, if not all, of the five areas by the start of next year. 'There's a number of opportunities that I think could be exploited pretty readily,' says John Willis, chief executive of the city of Salford. 'For example, we can't afford to staff as many council information centres as we'd like. I think we could move fairly quickly towards using the network to supply information about local services more efficiently. We're talking months, rather than years.' For their part the two universities are planning to use the project to build on their established interest in developing commercial and educational applications for the new information technologies. 'The Open University, as currently conceived, has taken current technology about as far as it's possible to go,' says John Squires, principal of University College Salford. 'What we're talking about here, among other things, is the possibility for a kind of Open University, Mark 2, that exploits the benefits of interactivity in an accessible and exciting way.' For the cable operator, which expects to invest around Pounds 20m in the project, it is clearly an opportunity to foster goodwill among the local community. This can be in short supply for a company that spends most of its time digging up streets. But the company also sees a long-run commercial rationale. John Edwards, regional manager for Nynex, admits that the company's earliest encounters with local councils are usually to discuss holes in the road and burst water pipes. 'You try to offer them the carrot of the broadband network that will follow. Initially, they're not that interested: they want to know why the roads are in such a mess. But more recently we've had some very positive discussions.' Cable operators elsewhere in Britain have similarly tried to foster good community relations within their franchise areas. 'The geographical nature of the franchise system means that the operators are very locally focused', says Niall Hickey, press spokesmen for the Cable Communications Association. 'They want to establish themselves as good corporate citizens.' This has led a number of companies to build up links with local schools and other public bodies. In Croydon, for example, United Artists Communications has now cabled up around 85 per cent of the local secondary schools, at heavily discounted prices. The company is now working with local teachers to see how scheduled cable programmes can help in teaching different parts of the curricula. By and large, such projects have tended to look at how schools and others might take advantage of cable services that already exist. But the commercial - and technological - bottom line to all the civic-worthiness is the need to foster demand for fiber-optic services which have yet to be invented. The UK cable industry plans to invest around Pounds 10bn by the end of the decade laying cable networks nationwide. At present, cable providers can earn a return on this investment offering entertainment, a banned segment of the market for British Telecom, as well as standard telephone services. But the ban will be lifted sooner or later - sooner, if BT's lobbying is successful. By then, BT is likely to be able to offer popular video-on-demand services over its existing telephone network. All the cable companies would like to see evidence that they will be able to earn a return from services which are only possible on their (higher-capacity) networks. Nynex has now laid cable for about one fifth of the 2.5m homes, and 150,000 businesses, in its 17 franchise areas. Salford is a little further developed: the company hopes to have 40 per cent of the local network laid by the end of next year. It will be a while before there is a comprehensive network nationwide, so most of the first practical demonstrations will necessarily be geographically confined. But the logic of the Salford project is that finding ways to let people interact, locally, is not merely a stop-gap to them interacting with the world outside. There are two reasons for this. First, local public agencies could be a fertile source of potential fiber-optic applications in their own right, responsible for a wide range of information and activities to which the new technology could usefully be applied. The second reason is that it is not only suppliers of new technology that must walk before they can run. The development of applications must, to some extent, be demand-led. And consumers and businesses are more likely to think of new products to demand if they have already seen the network fill a local niche. 'No-one is denying that broadband networks can allow you to be talking to the world', says Carl Grose, executive director of Nynex for the north-west. 'But when it comes down to it, you're still talking about people. We're not going to make money offering facilities that are somehow 'worldwide', but are actually anonymous at a local level.' Critics bemoan the lack of a 'big picture' in the government's piecemeal approach to re-cabling the UK for the interactive era, since it could mean that some parts of the country get left behind. Yet the Salford project indicates that, for all the worries about universal coverage, some individual communities could benefit from the rather limited horizons of the companies laying cable in their area. Indeed, Salford's first trip down the information superhighway may be just round the corner.</p>

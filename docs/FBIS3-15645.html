Mikhail Umanets,  chairman of the Ukrainian State Nuclear Power Committee, told an  International Conference of Soviet-Made Nuclear Reactor Users,  which opened in Moscow Wednesday, that experts were especially  worried over the condition of the fourth Chernobyl power unit  that had been destroyed by the 1986 explosion. Umanets said  that the unit could be made safe within three to five years if  developed countries helped.    Umanets said that "as long as it is short of energy and cash  Ukraine cannot afford closing the Chernobyl station." He  thought that the station could be transformed into a store for  radioactive waste.    He emphasized that all the processing and storing units were  situated in Russia and that Russia had been refusing to accept  Ukraine's radioactive waste which therefore had to be kept at  Ukrainian nuclear power stations.    Umanets complained of skilled personnel leaving Ukrainian  nuclear power stations where they are paid less than in Russia.  Over 2000 people, about 1000 of whom were highly-skilled  personnel, had quit jobs in Ukrainian nuclear power stations in  1993.</p>

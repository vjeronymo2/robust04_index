			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry on  Monday [17 January] added an additional 130 items to the list of  its deregulation program, ministry officials said.    The 130 items, all concerning permits and licenses, came on  top of 400 items for deregulation the ministry submitted last  November.    The ministry officials said the total of 530 items, if  realized, will help reduce the ministry's work on permits and  licenses by about 15 percent compared with the end of March 1992.    The additional list, which the ministry submitted to the  Management and Coordination Agency on Monday, includes the  scrapping of 50 permits and licenses and easier regulations on  80 permits and licenses.    For instance, a regulation regarding the changing of names  of  ships will be done away with, while airlines and other transport  firms will not have to seek government approval but only report  when they want to introduce discount tickets.    The latest deregulation plans require revision of about 10  laws. The ministry plans to present bills for the legal revision  in the next ordinary session of the Diet starting late this  month for implementation in the summer.</p>

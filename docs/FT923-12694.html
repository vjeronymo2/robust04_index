			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Special Report on Property Management (4): DoE calls for firm bids as the PSA goes private - Christine Moir reviews big changes in the public sector THE UK Government's privatisation of the Property Services Agency is reaching full steam. It is part of its wider goal of reducing the civil service to a few thousand mandarins and subcontracting most executive functions to the private sector. By the time this report reaches the news stands, the Department of Environment and its adviser, accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloittes, will have shortlisted a handful of companies invited to place firm bids for PSA Projects, the PSA's building design arm. Interest in bidding for Projects (which had a turnover of Pounds 190m last year) was strong. Over 150 organisations, including a number of foreign companies, explored the possibility; 90 or so requested application forms ahead of the June 26 deadline for submitting indicative bids. Andrew Jordan of Coopers confidently expects to be able to exchange contracts with a buyer by October this year. In the short term, Project's turnover may be squeezed by the cutback in government spending, and in particular by the diminished needs of the Ministry of Defence, but this belies the group's excellent long-term prospects. At present, less than 1 per cent of Project's architectural design, and Project management work, is for clients other than UK government departments. But in preparation for the competitiveness of the private sector, senior management is already capitalising on its niche specialities. Already, for instance, its expertise in building courtrooms throughout Britain has led to contracts to design one for the Dutch government, in Utrecht; and another for the Seychelles. Robin Gray, Project's director of marketing, reports that staff morale is high because of recent successes in winning design contracts against private sector competition for such prestigious schemes as the new VAT headquarters in Liverpool's Queen's Dock, and the Princess of Wales's conservatory in Kew Gardens. Private sector competition is a daily fact of life for Building Management (BM), the main property management arm of the PSA, also on its way to privatisation next spring. Since 1985, following an analysis by property consultants Jones Lang Wootton, government departments have been free to select private contractors to carry out the regular maintenance and management of their buildings. A number have done so on a case by case, area by area, basis. At the end of 1991 the process of commercialisation was taken a stage further. Building Management was divided into five separate regions and placed under the temporary management of Bovis, which has a brief to lick each one into commercial shape before they are sold on, individually, to five new owners. The upheaval has been significant, but BM has developed a real taste for competition. Nor East, which covers the whole eastern side of the country from the Scottish Borders down to the M25, is raring to compete for the new opportunities in its region as the government relocates up to 30,000 civil servants to the provinces. The Inland Revenue plans to move to Nottingham; the new Prison Services headquarters for 2,000 will be in Derby; the Land Registry moves to Hull; and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is planning a Pounds 60m 15-building complex outside York. Nor East's ambitions do not stop at winning these contracts against private sector competition. Mr Gil Sowden, Its marketing director, also declares that it will be 'open season' against its old stablemate, PSA Projects, on the design front. Mr Sowden and his counterparts in the other BMs - such as Mr Mike Harrison, managing director for Manchester, which covers the whole North West, and Mr Jim Livingstone in Scotland - have their eyes on another goal also. They believe they are now well-placed to win back the contracts lost to private sector surveying firms during the experiments of the late 1980s. Not only are they leaner and fitter - Nor East's staff is now down to 1,500 from 2,000 - but clients have wakened up to their greater expertise in managing public buildings. 'We think our competitors did not fully understand the demands that would be made of them by government departments,' says Mr Sowden. They do now. Hillier Parker, the underbidder for three early areas which went to private firms, believes the successful firms may now regret the keen pricing of their original bids. Not all the advantages lie with a private sector future, however. Some of the BM operations have already found that they will lose a certain privileged status from next year. The Ministry of Defence, for instance, may be prepared for its property management to go private - but not the US defence bases in the UK. They have insisted on civil servants to manage their buildings. In fact, 600 of the 1,000 jobs saved in BM Noreast have merely been transferred to the MoD's Defence Works Service in Sutton Coldfield, mainly to service US forces in Britain. The inexorable shrinking of Britain's overseas interests has meant even further upheavals in the 200-year-old service supplied by the PSA. Its international arm - once the overseer of colonial mansions from the Cape to Rajahstan by way of the Antipodes - is to close. This may be partly balanced, however, by the fact that Projects has opened its own international operation - mainly for Hong Kong, where it has two dockyard contracts and hopes to be involved in the new airport. The only part of the PSA to remain intact as a section of the Department of the Environment is the newly renamed Property Holdings (PH): in effect, the landlord for all government departments. Given the new freedom of each department to choose its own architects, designers, surveyors and managers, however, PH's role may be little more than passive. In the next round of government restructuring, many of its staff fear not the bracing winds of competition but the fatal chill of redundancy.</p>

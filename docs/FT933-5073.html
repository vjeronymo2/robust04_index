			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Part-timers prove shy of unions TRADE UNIONS are finding it increasingly hard to recruit part-time workers, a survey published yesterday by Labour Research magazine shows. It found only 16 per cent of the combined membership of the country's 20 largest unions are part-timers although as many as 28 per cent of the workforce now work part-time, of which four out of five are women. Labour Research calculates only 22 per cent of part-timers are in unions, compared with a quarter of them five years ago.</p>

There are indications that in Cairo  at the beginning of the new year the two sides will sign a more  detailed agreement to implement the Declaration of Principles  smoothly and without any new problems, allowing for an Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on the scheduled date of 13  April.    Although the latest round of talks that opened in Cairo on  28  December is going be tough and bitter, it is clear that the two  sides fully realize that they have no alternative but to resolve  their differences as soon as possible, and to reach a compromise  ending the growing frustration in the occupied territories and  sparing the two sides a desperate confrontation where mutual  violence escalates to a serious point risking the collapse of  the Declaration of Principles.    Rabin should have realized that he cannot, despite his rude  bargains, reduce his agreement with the PLO to a limited  administrative rule that firmly blocks Palestinian hopes for an  independent state, and that he cannot distort the Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho to a redeployment of the  occupation forces in the two regions. [passage omitted]    'Arafat, for his part, should have realized that the  Gaza-Jericho First declaration is nothing more than a limited  partial agreement concerning the first stage of an autonomy that  will be implemented in all the occupied territories for the next  three years before an agreement on the final status of the West  Bank and Gaza is reached. Consequently, there is no need for  mixing positions and stages in a manner that adds to Rabin's  difficulties as he faces an increasingly vicious internal  Israeli opposition.    In the face of Rabin's stubborn reading of the Declaration  of  Principles, 'Arafat tried to offer an alternative reading. But  'Arafat's reading was at the other extreme, so wide and loose  that it went beyond the text of the Declaration of Principles,  mixed the various stages of implementation, and made the  Palestinian state one of the objectives of the Gaza-Jericho  First agreement.    Both 'Arafat and Rabin should have put himself in the shoes  of the other so that they could reach a balanced agreement.  There are limits to what each can accept now in a tense  climate, mutual obsessions, escalating violence, and growing  opposition seeking to foil the agreement so that violence and  tension can prevail.    'Arafat cannot possibly accept a nominal withdrawal from  Gaza  and Jericho, no matter what Rabin's excuses and arguments about  the security of Israel and its settlements. And Rabin cannot  possibly now offer an implicit acceptance of an independent  Palestinian state by agreeing to Palestinian border crossings,  Palestinian national currency, or a Palestinian central bank.  Accepting such points would mean more than an implicit  recognition of the Palestinian state at an early stage that only  offers autonomy in Gaza and Jericho first. [passage omitted]</p>

This came out in a  statement by Gustave Feissel, the UN Secretary General's  alternate special representative, upon his return to Cyprus this  afternoon from Ankara, where he and special representative Joe  Clark held consultations on the confidence-building measures  after similar talks in Nicosia and Athens.    Asked if it is his understanding that the conditions set by  Rauf Denktas through his first letter remain in force, Mr.  Feissel said: I would not say that what is outlined in Denktas'  first letter fall under the category of conditions. Certain  assessments and concepts are outlined. However, I would not  like to comment on them before I discuss them with the two  leaders.    Concerning Denktas' second letter, Mr. Feissel said that it  is brief and deals with substance. Denktas notes in that letter  that he accepts in principle the package of measures as  presented in ?he Secretary General's report.    Mr. Feissel described the talks in Athens and Ankara as  useful. However, he avoided any statement on the substance of  the consultations, saying that he would first prefer to have  another round of consultations with President Glavkos Kliridhis  and Rauf Denktas. He also noted that during his meetings --  which probably will be held tomorrow -- he will outline the  results of the consultations in Athens and Ankara and he will  discuss with President Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas their  appraisals of the situation as it has been formulated. Mr.  Feissel further said that the result of his contacts with  President Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas will help Joe Clark -- who  is going to leave Ankara for New York -- to firm up the  suggestions he will submit to the UN Secretary General.    John Paul Kavanagh also returned to Cyprus with Mr. Feissel.</p>

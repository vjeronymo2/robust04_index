			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liang Chao: "Customs Targets Internal </F> Graft"]    [Text] Customs authorities are cracking down on corruption  by its staff and agencies.    The General Administration of Customs (GAC) has investigated  38 corruption cases involving customs officials and refunded 21  unreasonable charges on customs services, customs sources said.    At least 10 officials from Nanjing Customs, Jiangsu  Province,  have been taken into custody or arrested for graft, embezzlement  of public funds or seeking commissions, according to reliable  sources.    Eight other customs officials working in the province's  Zhangjiagang branch were found guilty of receiving bribes by  local courts.    In addition, the head of Zhangzhou Customs in southeast  China's Xiamen was arrested for smuggling.    The GAC has discovered that some customs officials have  solicited bribes from importers and exporters, claiming the  funds as support of customs work.    Some officials have demanded luxury receptions from host  organi- zations or enterprises, exceeding government-stipulated  standards for work.    Others have used import and export companies' cars or mobile  telephones without paying for them. Still others have submitted  private bills to import/export companies treasurers' offices.    According to reliable sources close to the GAC, the current  crackdown "will focus on major misbehavior liable to draw strong  complaints from the public."    By the end of May, the GAC plans to review existing  standards  and charges on customs services. Charges must be in accordance  with State-regulated price standards. Random charges and  overcharges on services, both illegal, will be eliminated. The  GAC made it clear that customs agencies were not allowed to run  any type of economic entity or invest in any kind of  profit-oriented business.    In addition, companies are prohibited from attaching  themselves to customs agencies to escape government supervision.    By the end of June, customs divisions must divest from any  service industries which they currently hold.    The GAC has made major advances in cracking down on internal  corruption since last June when the central government  intensified its fight against graft.    To date, the GAC has also shuttered a total of 127  customs-run companies that were engaged in service industries.    Thirty other firms were told their businesses had too close  a  relationship with the customs administration and they should  move into another realm of trade.</p>

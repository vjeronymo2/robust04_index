			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Kostyukovskiy report: "Kuzbass: From Strikes to </F> Constructive Actions"]    [Text] Kemerovo -- A. Tuleyev, chairman of the Kemerovo  Oblast Legislative Assembly, and M. Kislyuk, head of the oblast  administration, have signed a treaty on accord and joint actions.    Strictly guided by Russia's Constitution and laws and the  oblast's legislative acts, and steadfastly observing the  principle of the separation of powers, they have agreed to be  guarantors of accord and constructive activity in the Kuzbass,  help boost the revenue section of the oblast budget, and pursue  a coordinated social policy. The struggle against crime and  corruption is regarded as one of the main areas of joint  activity. Paragraph 11 of the treaty is highly indicative in  this regard: "In criticism of one another, to strive to be  completely proper and constructive and to prevent the use of  information based on conjecture and rumor."    The heads of the authorities have urged the Kuzbass  population to civil peace and accord which, as the document  says, "will make it possible to transform the region from  `striking Kuzbass' into `creative Kuzbass'."    But what about the responsibility for observing the spirit  and letter of the treaty? "At the moment it is moral and  ethical," M. Kislyuk acknowledged. Meanwhile, the mechanism of  responsibility for the treaty and documents to develop it in the  future will have to be elaborated by the oblast Legislative  Assembly.    It is well known that A. Tuleyev and M. Kislyuk, men of  differing and in some ways diametrically opposed political  views, opposed each other most strenuously on virtually all  matters of principle in the recent past, a time characterized by  a fierce struggle between the two branches of power. However,  approximately a year ago they agreed to work together in all the  main areas where they have common viewpoints and to seek  compromises in those areas where they do not -- without  abandoning their political standpoints. Thus the present treaty  is not a sensation but rather a further development of that  policy.</p>

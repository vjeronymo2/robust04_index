			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> EX-OFFICIALS TO GET SUBSIDY  </P> <P> The City Council voted 3 to 2 to subsidize health insurance costs for former  council members who do not qualify for retirement coverage under the city's  health benefit policy.  </P> <P> The subsidy, prompted by a letter from former Mayor Dick Brundo, will be equal  to the amount paid retirees who qualify for continued coverage under the Public  Employees Retirement System.  </P> <P> This amount is now about $130 a month, according to personnel director Gordon  Youngs.  </P> <P> Brundo, who does not qualify for retirement coverage because he was under age  50 when he left office, now pays about $350 per month for private insurance  coverage, Youngs said.  </P> <P> "After 12 years of service, anyone who's put that amount of time on the council  has earned some benefit," said Councilman Jim Boulgarides, who made the motion  to subsidize his former political opponent.  </P> <P> But Councilman Paul Jacobs, who voted against the subsidy along with Councilman  Steven Gourley, said that if the city were going to subsidize former council  members, it should similarly subsidize city employees who don't qualify under  the current system.  </P></p>

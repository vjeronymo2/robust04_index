The designation of ambassadors will be done  through diplomatic channels.    The agreement was signed in Taipei on 2 February,  corresponding to the second day of the second month of the [word  indistinct] year of the Republic of China. It was signed for  the Government of Burkina Faso by External Relations Minister  Thomas Sanon and for the Government of the Republic of China by  acting Foreign Minister Chin-Yen Fang.    In line with the resumption of diplomatic relations between  Ouagadougou and Taipei, the Burkinabe Government has issued a  statement, which is read here by Theodore Kilimite Hien, the  communications minister and government spokesman:    [Hien] Today, 2 February, the Government of Burkina Faso and  the Government of the Republic of China, have decided to resume  their diplomatic relations which were suspended in 1973. The  resumption of relations with the Republic of China is based on  the Burkinabe Government's willingness to establish relations  and bonds of cooperation with all countries of the world for  mutual benefit.    At a time when African countries are confronted with  terrible  economic difficulties that are even threatening national unity,  it is imperative for Burkina Faso to widen the circle of her  friendship and to find partners in every part of the world, who  are willing to support her development efforts in a continuous  manner. By resuming normal relations with Taipei, the Burkinabe  Government has obtained the assurance from the Republic of China  that it will help our country on its path toward achieving  progress through the following channels: Self-sufficiency in  food production through a special agricultural development  program, namely rice and soya bean production, the promotion of  the informal sector, the reduction of unemployment, the  revamping of youth employment schemes, the development and  improvement of the health sector, and the building of a sports  infrastructure, including the construction of a sports complex  in Bobo Dioulasso and a sports stadium in Ouagadougou. This  initial program will be pursued through a wider range of  operations in the future.    In resuming relations with Taipei, the Burkinabe Government  remains faithful to the fundamental option of its external  policy, which is based on realistic views and adjustment to the  changes that are now marking international society. It is in  line with the same policy of loyalty that Burkina Faso hereby  reaffirms its willingness to maintain, to pursue, and to  consolidate its relations with the People's Republic of China.    Signed in Ouagadougou on 2 February 1994.</p>

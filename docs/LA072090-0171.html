Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ROSE GOT KENNEDYS INTO POLITICS  </P> <P> Kennedy matriarch Rose Kennedy, not her husband, got the family into politics,  four of her five surviving children say in a story being published Sunday, her  100th birthday.  </P> <P> The children told Parade magazine that their father, Joseph P. Kennedy, a  businessman and U.S. ambassador to Great Britain, had other concerns besides  politics.  </P> <P> "Dad was interested in achievement, not necessarily politics," said Sen. Edward  M. Kennedy (D-Mass.)  </P> <P> Eunice Kennedy Shriver said her mother's "great love was politics" and recalled  that her brother John F. Kennedy credited "all the ladies' teas mother gave"  for winning him his seat in the U.S. Senate before he went on to become  President.  </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / EC says Dollars 23bn pledged to E Europe PROMISES OF financial aid to the countries of east Europe now total Dollars 23bn (Pounds 12.8bn) according to the European Community, which is co-ordinating the aid effort among the Group of 24 donor countries. This includes Dollars 8bn in the form of grants, Dollars 1.7bn in structural loans from EC bodies such as the European Investment Bank, Dollars 11.4bn pledged as capital for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Dollars 2bn in bilateral loans and credits. Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC representative at the inaugural meeting of the EBRD, told reporters yesterday that these promises were in addition to balance of payments support for east Europe. The EC had identified a financing gap of Dollars 15bn for this year, some two-thirds of which would be covered by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. This left some Dollars 4bn of balance of payments support to be provided by the Group of 24 this year. A Dollars 1bn loan had been agreed for Czechoslovakia, a new Dollars 500m loan was close to agreement for Hungary, while efforts had begun to raise Dollars 800m for Bulgaria and Dollars 1bn for Romania. All the loans were dependent on their agreeing economic reform programmes with the IMF. Half this would come from the EC. Last year, a Dollars 1bn currency stabilisation loan for Poland had been agreed (still untouched in the New York Federal Reserve Bank) and a further Dollars 1bn for Hungary. Mr Christophersen also did not rule out assistance for Albania. On top of that, it was estimated that Poland's debt servicing bill would be reduced by about Dollars 5.5bn in the first year as a result of the agreement last month with the Paris Club of creditor governments. He said early estimates for the financing assistance needed next year by east Europe suggested they needed less than in 1991. But that depended on two main factors: the extent to which trade collapsed within the old Comecon trading bloc and the oil price. He said some Ecu400m (Pounds 276m) had been promised this year by the EC in technical assistance for the Soviet Union, and Ecu600m next year.</p>

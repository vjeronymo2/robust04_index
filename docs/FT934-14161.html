			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Georgian rebels make fast advance FORCES fighting for the return to power of the former Georgian president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, have advanced rapidly to within 20km of Kutaisi, the country's second city, with a population of 300,000. It is the last centre in western Georgia still in the hands of the Georgian government headed by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze. Mr Shevardnadze said in a broadcast yesterday that his army 'has practically disintegrated'. His senior ministers have been negotiating with Russian officials, and unconfirmed reports say Russia has agreed to supply advanced military technology to defend Kutaisi, including heavy artillery. In an interview with the Financial Times at his base in Zugdidi in the west of the country, Mr Gamsakhurdia said that 'this conflict will be settled and Georgia will be cleansed of them (Mr Shevardnadze's supporters)'. Mr Gamsakhurdia, who was deposed in a coup in January 1992, said he would resume his 'lawful presidency' by 'all possible means'. Early on Sunday morning, after it was clear the rapid military assault was succeeding, Mr Loti Kobalia, Mr Gamsakhurdia's military commander, stood on the balcony of the building occupied by the former president and whipped up his supporters to frenzied cheering as he shouted: 'Victory is ours. . . soon we will be in Kutaisi.' Mr Gamsakhurdia, who has been in Georgia for one month after almost two years' exile in the north Caucasian Russian republic of Chechnya, ruled out negotiations with Mr Shevardnadze or any of his associates. He said that Mr Jaba Josseliani, leader of the Mekhedrioni group of irregular forces and effectively Georgia's chief-of-staff, was 'a four times convicted criminal. . . He will make an agreement and break it at once.' Mr Gamsakhurdia denies that he is prosecuting a civil war. 'You must not call it a civil war, it is a fight against criminal gangs,' he said. The former president's refusal to negotiate and the higher morale of his forces, which are estimated to number about 10,000, means the country of 5.5m people now faces the prospect of a longer and more intense conflict. Already Mr Vladizlav Ardzinba, leader of the Abkhazian separatists, has said his republic will be an independent state equal to Russia and Georgia. Its borders would be between the rivers Psou in the north and Incuri in the south, cutting off around 15 per cent of former Georgian territory. The offensive by Mr Gamsakhurdia's forces overran the rail junction of Samtredia and the town of Khoni on Sunday after a few hours' resistance from the scattered defenders. Their advance of some 25km towards Kutaisi demonstrates the weakness of the Georgian forces which, apart from the Mekhedrioni irregulars, are composed of national guardsmen and militia.</p>

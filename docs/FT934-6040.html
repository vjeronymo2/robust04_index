			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Fife chairman asks for support Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman of dissent-riven Fife Indmar, yesterday appealed to investors to support current management against attempts by minority shareholders to change the board and announced the appointment of a new managing director. In a letter to shareholders this week, Mr Hepburn said efforts by Mr Guido Crolla, a Scottish businessman, and Mr Charles McDonald, a Fife director, to nominate two board members amounted to an attempt to 'secure control of the company . . . without making a general offer to all shareholders. Mr Crolla and Mr McDonald, who control 10.4 per cent of the company, have requisitioned an extraordinary meeting on December 17 to unseat Mr Hepburn and fellow director Mr Michael Munro. They propose to replace them with Mr Crolla and Mr David Chassels, of BDO Binder Hamlyn. If successful, Mr McDonald would replace Mr Hepburn as chairman. Mr Hepburn said it was 'ironic that the board should face a challenge at this time, just when its strategies are bearing fruit.' Fife had returned to profit at the interim stage. The appointment of Mr Tim Gutteridge, former chief executive of Courtney Pope, would further strengthen the business, Mr Hepburn said. The chairman said he was also puzzled at Mr McDonald's decision to support Mr Crolla, since he had been 'at one with the board in developing those strategies and rejecting earlier approaches by Mr Crolla'.</p>

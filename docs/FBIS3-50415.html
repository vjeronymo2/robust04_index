Unimpex was founded by the Martimex company in 1990. As early  as in 1993, Unimpex turnover reached 4.05 billion korunas [Sk].  Exports of T-72 tanks from the ZTS Martin production provided  99 percent of the total turnover. The value of last year's  exports is Sk3.3 billion. Warecha said that the territories to  which the arms are exported have changed substantially. He  emphasized, however, that the license committee has granted  licenses for all sales realized. In comparison with 1992, when  exports to Russia reached Sk400 million, the volume declined  last year to Sk200 million.    Slovak exports of military technology face numerous problems  on the world market. According to Warecha, Russia, which  produces as many as 10,000 tanks annually, is great competition,  as their prices hover around $500,000, while the Slovak tanks  cost as much as $1 million, and the Slovak engineering  facilities can produce only 250-300 tanks. Another handicap for  the Slovak arms industry is its gradual antiquation. A total  modernization would require tremendous financial means. The  debts from the time of the federation still also work against  the Slovak enterprises. On the other hand, the quality of the  exported goods favors Slovak exports. Customers often prefer  Slovak military hardware to Russian or Polish arms. The  foundation of a new company with state participation mentioned  by Prime Minister Meciar should serve, according to Warecha, the  coordination of Slovak exports. Numerous contracts are signed  at governmental level, and it will depend on the state how it  will fend for the new company, he added.</p>

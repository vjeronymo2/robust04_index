			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: BTR Winter must be fading fast if BTR's sudden spurt of spring cleaning is any guide. The company's declared strategy is to concentrate on industrial manufacturing businesses where it has a strongly focused presence. Owning a majority stake in a lucky dip of Canadian manufacturing operations presumably does not fit that bill. Grahams Builders Merchants is equally surplus to requirements and, by the same logic, BTR's other distribution businesses must be edging towards the door. The disposals also conserve cash, as did the enhanced scrip dividend, though since gearing is expected to fall to 40 per cent this year, that seems unlikely to be the prime motivation. Still, even after tidying up, a large cash bid looks some way off, as does a paper deal given BTR's de-rating relative to the market over the past year. The purchase of Rexnord shows that smaller acquisitions are still possible. Since the group is apparently not yet quite as Mr Alan Jackson, the chief executive, would like it, such smaller scale shuffling may well continue. That seems reasonable. But BTR has made much of its strength in buying and managing businesses. Shareholders made nervous by change may not like to see the company develop too much of a taste for jobbing assets.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Weeding out the weakest links in the chain  -How Boots and WH Smith plan to revamp their lossmaking Do It All DIY business 'HOW do Do It All do it for what they do it for?' the DIY chain's television advertisements used to ask. The answer these days is that they don't. Or rather, for the past year or so, they have been doing it only at a trading loss, and losing market share in the process. Yesterday, WH Smith, which has a 50 per cent stake in the joint venture along with Boots, said its share of losses for the year to May were Pounds 14.3m, with sales down by 7.3 per cent. With some justification, Smith can point to the tough trading environment in the DIY market as an excuse. After enjoying double-digit profits growth in the late-1980s through rapid expansion and pushing up gross margins from about 30 per cent to about 34.5 per cent, DIY chains have had a difficult 18 months. The collapse of the housing market put them under pressure, and a price war which raged for much of last year damaged both profits and margins. Despite the difficult conditions, the two largest DIY chains, B&amp;Q and Texas Homecare, have remained in the black. But Do It All is finding it increasingly difficult to be number three in the market, and suffers from a number of internal weaknesses. The chain was formed in 1990 from the merger of Boots' Payless, acquired as part of the Pounds 900m takeover of Ward White in 1989, and WH Smith's Do It All chain. Profits and margins at both chains had been deteriorating before the merger, which was supposed to create a large, powerful business that would benefit from economies of scale. Instead, the new Do It All was hit by a double whammy. It was born just as the housing market went into decline, and then, before it had time properly to integrate the two chains and to establish a coherent trading formula, it was dragged into the DIY price war. The result, as one analyst put it, was that 'two small, weak chains merged to produce a larger weak chain.' The chain was saddled with some old stores, often in poor locations, and of widely differing sizes. Do It All and Payless also had different ranges. These were later rationalised and standardised, but that led to an increase in items out of stock, and to confusion, particularly among former Payless customers, about Do It All's product offer. Boots and Smith still insist they are committed to turning the business around. First, a full 'portfolio review' is under way, to determine where stores need to be closed or relocated. Distribution is being centralised, which should lead to greater efficiency. Do It All is also trying to develop the strength and identity of its own brand. Mr Steve Russell, Do It All's managing director, is using experience gained as director of merchandise at Boots to try to improve standards of customer service. The chain is also rolling out its 'New Trading Concept', involving refitting stores and regrouping products according to different DIY projects - for example, putting everything for bathrooms in one place, rather than taps in one area and tiles in another. Specially-designed information boards give advice on how to carry out various DIY projects. Refits cost between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 300,000 depending on the age and size of store. Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director, said yesterday percentage sales increases in refitted stores were 'moving towards double figures', with sales per square foot 'moving towards Pounds 100', compared with the Pounds 65 per sq ft for the chain as a whole estimated by Verdict, the retail research group. But, as Sir Malcolm admitted, the roll-out is slow. Only 54 stores will have been refitted by next February - out of 220. The pace cannot be quicker, he says, because 'these are quite big things to do and there is only so much the infrastructure can take'. Given that Boots and Smith admit they exacerbated their original problems by failing to integrate Payless and Do It All quickly enough, the apparent lack of urgency in refitting the stores is causing nervousness in the City. Some analysts believe the real reason is the new format has not been as successful as hoped. But the question preoccupying most analysts is what happens if the reforms do not improve trading, and the housing market does not pick up. Few believe a buyer for the chain could be found, and the cost of closure - estimated at about Pounds 200m - would be prohibitive. 'I can see no solution to the problem that would satisfy both Boots and Smiths,' says Mr Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Morgan Stanley. He draws a parallel with Silo, Dixons' US electrical retailer where losses are still mounting in spite of management's efforts to improve sales, and neither sale nor closure is a realistic option. At least Silo has only one owner. Do It All, on the other hand, looks set to remain a problem child for both its parents.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SHARE OF DIY SPENDING %  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   1986    1987    1988    1989    1990    1991    1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- B&amp;Q               10.4    11.8    12.7    12.8    13.6    14.7    14.6 Texas Homecare     5.9     6.6     7.2     8.1     8.4     9.5     9.6 Do it All*         2.5     3.1     3.5     3.7     6.7     6.0     5.6 Payless*           2.7     3.4     3.8     3.7       -       -       - Homebase           1.8     2.1     2.4     2.6     2.8     3.2     3.3 Great Mills        1.6     2.0     2.4     2.6     2.8     2.8     2.7 Wickes             1.7     2.0     2.4     2.4     2.6     2.7     2.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * = Companies merged in 1990.

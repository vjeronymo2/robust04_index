			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Earth summit to hear demand for environment fund: West urged to be less secretive DEVELOPING countries preparing for the Earth Summit in June in Brazil yesterday demanded the establishment of a special fund for the summit's environmental programmes, and expressed 'serious concern' at a lack of progress in negotiations with the west over financing. The Kuala Lumpur Declaration on Environment and Development, approved by ministers and officials from 55 governments meeting in the Malaysian capital, conflicts with the western view that new money for the environment should be channelled through the Global Environment Facility (GEF) managed by the World Bank and the UN. Yesterday's declaration called for 'a specific and separate fund' to be established to implement Agenda 21, the 1,000-page series of tasks due to be agreed in Brazil to clean up the world for the next century. A predictable flow of money for the new fund should be ensured by assessed (obligatory) contributions from developed countries, the statement said, adding that the organisation should be transparent and democratic and should provide financing 'without any conditionality'. The developing nations have kept their negotiating options open by not specifically ruling out the use of the GEF, although they regard it as unacceptable in its present form. Several western governments which sent observers to this week's meeting accepted the need to reform the GEF by making it less secretive, extending its mandate to include regional as well as global problems, and changing the voting structure to give more weight to the Third World. Both sides agree on the need for an unspecified amount of 'new and additional money' from the industrialised countries. Yesterday's declaration also called for a successful conclusion of the Uruguay round of world trade talks and said developed countries should not impose arbitrary trade restrictions on natural resources (such as timber) on environmental grounds. It said the issue of intellectual property rights should not be used to hinder the transfer of environmentally sound technology on concessional terms to developing countries. The industrialised world should itself increase its forest cover and take steps to change its patterns of production and consumption to help the environment, the declaration said. US officials have resisted the idea of radical changes to lifestyles in rich countries, while Japan has recently sought to take the lead in addressing environmental issues and and in promoting its own en-vironmentally friendly technologies. 'Developed countries should fundamentally change their urban structure, transportation system and lifestyle from the current industrialised culture aiming only at economic growth for its own sake based on 'mass production, mass consumption and mass disposal' to one more environmentally sound,' Mr Shozaburo Nakamura, the Japanese minister responsible for global environmental problems, told the Kuala Lumpur conference.</p>

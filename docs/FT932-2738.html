			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sale of waste arm helps NFC jump to Pounds 87m NFC, the transport and logistics company, yesterday reported slightly lower than expected profits because of losses at its Lynx parcels division. Pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 37.2m to Pounds 86.6m in the 28 weeks to April 17, thanks to a Pounds 50m profit on the sale in January of the company's waste management arm. Mr James Watson, chairman, said economic conditions remained 'difficult' although there were signs of improved confidence in the UK and US. In continental Europe, activity was at 'a low ebb.' The results have been prepared under the FRS 3 treatment and the comparisons have been restated. The company has maintained its 'best view' forecast for the full year of on-going profits of between Pounds 95m and Pounds 100m. However, Mr Watson said the board would review its practice of giving best view forecasts, mainly because of legislative concerns in the US. Turnover increased 11 per cent to Pounds 977m (Pounds 879m), helped by currency factors. Operating profits rose to Pounds 49.9m (Pounds 43.1m). Most of the growth came from Exel Logistics, which increased operating profits by 50 per cent to Pounds 33.5m, helped by acquisitions and translation of dollar earnings. BRS, the transport and truck rental arm which incurred heavy reorganisation costs last year, increased profits by 52 per cent to Pounds 15.4m. Allied Pickfords Merchants, the removals division, saw flat profits of Pounds 7.1m. Lynx was affected by overcapacity and depressed margins in its market, and recorded operating losses of Pounds 6.1m. Despite management changes, the full-year performance would depend on economic recovery, NFC said. Interest costs more than doubled to Pounds 10.9m. The cash inflow from the waste division sale was cancelled by acquisition costs. Net borrowings, affected by currency and seasonal factors, increased from Pounds 181m at the year end, to Pounds 256m, leaving gearing at 73 per cent. Mr Watson said gearing would end the year at about 55 per cent. Earnings were 13.5p (5.2p). A second interim dividend of 1.45p is declared, making a total of 2.8p for the half year. The shares fell 8p to 249p. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ARMY FIRES ON CROWD IN AZERBAIJAN;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: MANY ARE REPORTED KILLED AND WOUNDED AS TROOPS BREAK THROUGH  HUMAN BLOCKADES. ABOUT 25,000 TO 30,000 PEOPLE WERE ON THE STREETS AT THE TIME.  </P> <P> Soviet army troops opened fire on Azerbaijani militants on the streets of the  republic's capital of Baku early Saturday, using tanks to break through human  blockades and killing and wounding many, Azerbaijani activists said.  </P> <P> "They simply opened fire at will, with no warning shots," Leila Unsova, a  spokeswoman for the Azerbaijani Popular Front, said in a telephone interview  from Baku. "At least 13 are dead so far, but we expect more. Our doctors have  been told not to go home."  </P> <P> Initial reports of casualties were extremely sketchy, with figures ranging from  two deaths to 500. But the shooting seemed certain to further inflame passions  resulting from the current ethnic conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia,  which began last weekend. It marked the Kremlin's first use of deadly force  against the Soviet people since army troops killed 20 pro-independence  demonstrators during a protest last April 9 in Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet  Georgia.  </P> <P> Unsova said the shooting started shortly after midnight at the blockades at the  northern edge of Baku and then moved into the city center. About 25,000 to  30,000 people were still on the streets when the firing began, she said.  </P> <P> "The people are very angry. This will not end things. There simply will be more  bloodshed," Unsova declared.  </P> <P> Another Popular Front spokesman, Mahmoud Kesamanly, said the Soviet troops  "pushed right through the blockades with tanks. But people started resisting  right away. There are many dead and injured."  </P> <P> Sporadic and sometimes heavy gunfire continued at least until dawn Saturday,  witnesses in Baku reported.  </P> <P> Both U.S. and Soviet sources have cited the strong negative reaction to last  year's killings in Tbilisi as a key factor in Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's restraint until Saturday in Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> The Georgian incident has posed significant political problems for Gorbachev  ever since. As recently as last month in the Congress of People's Deputies,  representatives from Tbilisi, still angry at Gorbachev over the deaths, walked  out. The president personally ran out into the hall and appealed to them not to  leave.  </P> <P> The confrontation early Saturday came after a day in which Azerbaijani  militants ruled the streets of Baku, trapping some Red Army troops in their  barracks, blocking others from patrolling the city and vowing to set up an  Islamic republic, according to reports from the area.  </P> <P> The city of 1.8 million was in a state of virtual anarchy during the day  Friday, with most factories closed and thousands of people milling around  outdoor bonfires, according to official media and a spokesman at the  Azerbaijani republic mission in Moscow.  </P> <P> For several hours, the Baku activists had appeared poised for a confrontation  with Soviet troops, who were waiting for an order to disperse the crowd. The  Azerbaijanis had vowed that they would not abandon their blockades, creating a  powder-keg situation.  </P> <P> In Moscow, the Kremlin announced that it was sending in more soldiers, but gave  no figures. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev acknowledged that after a week of  fighting and despite the deployment of about 24,000 troops in the region, the  situation had not improved and had worsened in some places.  </P> <P> "We must take tough measures," Gen. Alexei Lizichev, chief of the army's  political section, declared on the evening news program Vremya.  </P> <P> In a nationally broadcast statement, the Soviet government had appeared to hint  that the army was preparing to strike. It warned that the violence would be  stopped "at all costs," for "today's tragedy may turn into tomorrow's national  catastrophe."  </P> <P> The news agency Tass said Azerbaijani nationalists attacked the Armenian border  village of Yeraskh, killing three Armenians and wounding four others.  </P> <P> Armenians struck back at the Azerbaijani village of Tadan, according to press  reports, swooping in aboard stolen helicopters and in an armored personnel  carrier. They reportedly drove many Azerbaijanis from the village.  </P> <P> In a report from Tadan, the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya quoted villages as saying  they had lost faith in Moscow to end the fighting.  </P> <P> "Will the Soviet power ever be able to protect us again?" one villager was  quoted as saying.  </P> <P> Popular frustration is mounting over what is perceived as Moscow's slowness in  dealing with the crisis. Demands were made for the Kremlin to act quickly and  toughly to impose law and order in the area, where about 200 people have been  killed in clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the last two years.  </P> <P> The Interior Ministry reported 72 fatalities in the last week, together with  220 wounded. These figures are believed to cover casualties in Baku for the  most part. Once the dead are tallied in other areas, the toll is expected to be  much higher.  </P> <P> More than 13,000 Armenians have been evacuated from Baku in the last week. A  group of 240 Armenians on a plane that arrived Friday night from Baku refused  to disembark until the Kremlin promised to ensure their safety and provide food  and housing.  </P> <P> The outbreak of violence was sparked by a recent incident in Baku, but the  underlying cause is festering tension over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of  largely Christian Armenians in the mostly Muslim republic of Azerbaijan.  Armenians and Azerbaijanis alike claim the region on historical grounds.  </P> <P> In recent days the most serious fighting has taken place in cities and towns in  Azerbaijan, according to reports from the area. But the official news agency  Tass reported Friday that "militants are being massed around Nagorno-Karabakh,"  where because of sabotage a third of the people in the region's capital were  without water and several blocks were without heat.  </P> <P> Foreign journalists have been admitted to Armenia, but they are not allowed to  enter Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> In Baku, about 10,000 Azerbaijanis paraded through the streets Thursday  chanting, "Azadlyg," or freedom, according to a report in the daily  Komsomolskaya Pravda. The marchers trapped Soviet troops in their barracks, the  newspaper said, and "blocked all approaches leading to Baku with people, buses  and trucks."  </P> <P> It said: "The situation in the city heats up literally by the hour. If the  masses do not calm down, it could soon lead to unpredictable events."  </P> <P> The daily Izvestia reported that troops at the edge of the city fired warning  shots early Friday to extricate themselves from an angry crowd. There were no  casualties then, it said.  </P> <P> According to reports from nationalists in Armenia, supported by news reports on  television, Soviet soldiers at the port in Baku were continuing to help with  the evacuation of Armenians. At the same time, tens of thousands of  Azerbaijanis reportedly rallied in front of the republic's Communist Party  headquarters and demanded that the Soviet troops be withdrawn.  </P> <P> The crowds in Baku also reportedly called for the republic's government to  resign and for Soviet authority to be overthrown.  </P> <P> Much of Baku was said to be paralyzed by protest strikes, with motor traffic  halted and no newspapers being published. According to a television news  report, the crowds blocking the streets to prevent Soviet army patrols vowed  earlier Friday to continue the action through the night. It said civilian  vigilante patrols were performing neighborhood police duties.  </P> <P> "We believe that if Azerbaijan is under a state of emergency, Armenia should be  too," a spokesman at the Armenian mission in Moscow told a reporter. "That is  why our people are expressing so much discontent."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, addressing a conference at the Kremlin, said the fighting served the  interests of "extremists, irresponsible adventurists and representatives of the  shadow economy," or black market.  </P> <P> "Perestroika is a bone in their throat," he said, referring to his program of  social and economic reform. "But they can't oppose it directly, so they clutch  at tension on an ethnic basis. In Azerbaijan, forces have already appeared that  are pressing for the republic's secession from the Soviet Union, for an Islamic  Azerbaijan. But this finds no support among the people."  </P></p>

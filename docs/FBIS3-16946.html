This  is understandable: Some 24 hours before our conversation the  mayor had had a beautiful daughter, weighing in at 4,400 grams.  So even Moscow Spartak's crushing defeat in Barcelona (Luzhkov  did not watch the match, of course) did not have a significant  effect on his mood, as is evident from the photograph [photo  shows him grinning broadly]. Our conversation, alas, focused on  matters far more prosaic.    [Simonov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, Muscovites are greeting spring  not only with joy, but with a degree of apprehension: They all  remember May Day last year, the battle in Leninskiy Prospekt,  and the Moscow militia's sense of total impotence. Have lessons  been learned from this?    [Luzhkov] It is primarily those who organized the riots in  Moscow who should learn the lessons. The lesson is simple:  Extremism no longer works, you will not achieve any objectives  using it. I hope that after the spring clashes last year and  after the October tragedy, the majority of political movements  and structures intend act entirely in accordance with the law,  because no one benefits from blood on the streets. If you want  power, act, but by parliamentary means. Gain people's favor,  win the elections, and form organs of power. But society will  not allow you to implement your slogans through attacks, through  threats, and through bloodshed.    Of course, rallies and marches are unavoidable in our  turbulent times -- but they can and must be carried out in the  capital strictly in accordance wuith the rules laid down by city  hall and the government. We are not against people expressing  their will normally -- peacefully! I would point out,  incidentally, that disputes arose when city hall lifted its ban  on demonstrations following the court ruling. But the leaders  of the masses must show the same respect for the law.    [Simonov] But these are all political conclusions. What  about practical ones?    [Luzhkov] What I will say is that we are making very serious  preparations for possible trouble. The police are equipped.  The law-enforcement organs have been instructed to stop any  activity that poses a threat to Muscovites' safety and peace.    As for last year's confusion... There was confusion. We  were unprepared for the fact that the nature of the  demonstrations changed completely. Basically, what we faced on  1 May was organized thuggery. We are prepared this time.    [Simonov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, what is the situation on the  other front -- the food front? Some analysts are predicting  empty shelves by the spring, linking this to the introduction of  the new customs duties.    [Luzhkov] There will be no empty shelves -- I can assure you  of that. We will not allow any breakdown in food supply, it  will remain stable.    As for prices, I do not understand and do not accept the  government's decision on new duties on foodstuffs. We have  already been through that: We imposed excessive duties on  imported cars -- and prices of "Zhiguli," "Moskvich," and other  cars immediately soared. The same would happen to food. The  struggle here at the moment is not for increased production  volumes, not for economic work by enterprises -- what they are  trying to do is ensure production viability solely by increasing  prices. But this is a dead-end street! This measure will help  for a -- short -- while, and then it falls apart. Look: There  is a surplus of cars on the market at the moment. The plants,  having jacked up their prices, are failing to resolve their  problems because they are unable to sell their cars. People  cannot buy cars at that price, cannot invest their money. This  is a double damper on an already barely warm economy.    But the food situation is even more serious. This decision  hits the big cities first and foremost, and northern areas --  those that do not have their own agricultural base. Take  Moscow. A large proportion of our food is imported. Some 50  percent of our traditional meat and dairy products are actually  produced abroad. You do not have to consult a fortune-teller to  be able to predict that home agricultural producers are going to  raise their prices now -- and again there is no competition.  Will this breathe life into our agriculture? Obviously it will  not, since it is the same old production forces and production  relations in the countryside. On the other hand, the  purchasesing power of the cities, particularly big cities, is  falling. For example, we can already see how much less  Muscovites are eating.    [Simonov] And how much is it?    [Luzhkov] Well, nearly 50 percent less vegetables, for  instance. At this time of year daily sales in Moscow are  traditionally more than 5,000 tonnes. Now it is 3,000-3,200.  Yet people's personal stocks of potatoes and carrots are now  exhausted.    The meat situation is as follows: Not long ago 4,000-4,300  tonnes would go in a day; it is half that amount today. On the  other hand, bread consumption has increased considerably.    Therefore, I regard the increase in customs duties on  imported food as an unfair, unfriendly step against Moscow, St.  Petersburg, Yekaterinburg (Editorial note: As we know, the  three mayors of the aforementioned cities put together an appeal  to the Russian president condemning the government's step), and  the North. I can see this policy having most appalling  consequences for Muscovites.    Let us take a closer look at this decree: What I wonder is  who is it working for if it envisages that there will be no duty  on food coming into Russia from the particularly underdeveloped  countries, the underdeveloped countries will get duty  reductions, while the industrial states will get the full works.  Where do Russia's interests come into it? Is the idea to make  Russians' food worse and more dangerous? It is crass  politicking and stupidity again! So we are supposed to give up  guaranteed high-quality food and support underdeveloped  countries' economies instead. Very Soviet.    [Simonov] It is a very banal question, but there is no  getting away from it. I am talking about Moscow's highways. It  appeared they could not get any worse, then the snow melted,  revealing an absolute nightmare.    [Luzhkov] Yes indeed, in the winter I banned highway repair,  because we were sinking money in mud. The repairs will begin in  April, covering 20 million square meters. It could be more, the  potential is there, but the money is not, and we have to face  this fact. The Ring Road is a very difficult task, but we will  deal with it this year. It has a bad reputation and has become  extremely dangerous. There will be lighting and a median strip  along the entire length of it.    [Simonov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, what was the outcome (did it  have an outcome?) of your dispute with Anatoliy Chubays over  privatization methods?    [Luzhkov] The president instructed Chernomyrdin to sort out  our differences. They are certainly fundamental. It is not me  getting on my high horse and it is not some great-power policy  on Moscow's part. I believe Chubays is not behaving properly in  carrying out the president's direct instructions to enable  privatization to take place in Moscow on our terms. It all  boils down again to the methods of the State Committee for the  Management of State Property. No account at all is taken of  Moscow's mighty infrastructure, banking and exchange network,  and technological caliber, and people's skills. I have said it  before and I say it again: Without taking these facts into  account Moscow will be sold short. I don't want to let this  happen, I don't want my name to be linked to the major mistakes  Chubays and his department are making on matters of  privatization. These mistakes will have repercussions in the  state.    [Simonov] What do you think of the fact that you are  figuring more and more prominently in the political ratings.  You are even being tipped as president...    [Luzhkoiv] I have absolutely no view concerning this talk  and these articles. I follow Pushkin: "indifferent both to  praise and slander." I love my work, but I know what I am  capable of, and I know my limitations as well. My own sober  assessment is that I do not think a mayor responsible for the  Moscow economy can be elevated to such heights.    Anyway, I do not much like the talk about presidential  elections. They are still two and one-half years away. What is  the point of all the fuss about them today? All it does is  undermine the executive power's authority in the state. If  people are talking up the elections, apparently, it means that  everything is unstable and temporary and the president's  decisions and opinion need not be heeded.    But there is an interesting, instructive element in the  latest ratings. The "managers," if you can call them that, are  emerging in the leading roles. They are overtaking the pure  politicians. This is a sign, if you like: Society increasingly  needs people who know how to get things done, rather than people  who talk a load of nonsense. This is a very important change.  A person must be assessed in terms of what he has done, rather  than what he has said, in terms of what he can do, rather than  what he wants to do.    Look how leaders are trained in Japan. There a manager is  obliged to climb the ladder. But a state is not some kind of  office, it is a very intricate system. And that our Russia  certainly is.</p>

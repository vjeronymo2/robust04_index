			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jakarta, 5 January--Private businessmen have been  urged to limit seeking foreign loans, because the total amount  of such debts contracted for up to now is rather large. If this  process were allowed to continue without limitation, it would  affect the national "debt service ratio" (DSR) which, at  present, is 32 percent.    Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad made this statement to  reporters after installing several senior executives in office  at the Department of Finance in Jakarta on 4 January.    Furthermore, he urged private businessmen not to be too  ambitious in carrying out large, capital intensive projects with  funds derived from foreign loans.    According to Minister of Finance Mar'ie, the size of the  private foreign debt strongly affects the national "debt service  ratio" (DSR) which, at present, is 32 percent. About 11 percent  of this figure consists of debts entered into by private  business, while the remaining 21 percent consists of government  debt.    According to BUSINESS TIMES, which was published on 3  January  by Standard and Poor (SP), a U.S. debt rating company, PT  [Company Limited] Indah Kiat Pulp &amp; Paper Corporation and PT  Inti Indorayon Utama, two private Indonesian companies, are on  the list of companies with the highest debt burden in the  private sector. The two companies have succeeded in raising $175  million in commercial paper on the bond market in the United  States.    Mar'ie said that so far the private sector has been too  dependent on funds obtained from the banks. As a result, in  their investments their own private capital has been smaller  than the capital of the State Enterprises Board (BUMN).    In this connection, according to Mar'ie, there has been a  new  development in terms of finding sources of investment funding.  That is, the capital market has become active once again. He  estimates that interest in the capital market, which grew during  1993 will continue into 1994. The minister of finance gave this  warning in connection with the prospect for growing indebtedness  of the private sector in the national development field during  the upcoming Sixth Five-Year Plan.    According to the minister, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan,  which will begin in April 1994, the private sector will have a  larger role in national development, compared to previous  five-year plans. He said: "At present the private sector is  responsible for about 67 percent of national development  activity. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan this role will  increase to at least 75 percent."    Furthermore, foreign-owned private firms will also be given  an opportunity to participate in development projects which are  presently dominated by the government.    As an initial step the government has given the private  sector an opportunity to participate in the construction of the  Paiton electricity generating plant. Later on it may become  possible for the private sector to have a role in the  construction of major harbors under the "build, operate,  transfer" (BOT) system.  <H5>  Changes </H5>   On this occasion Minister of Finance Mar'ie installed T.L.  Yousuf in office as a staff adviser to the minister of finance  in the field of government receipts. Yousuf had previously been  director of customs in the Directorate General of Customs and  Excise. Abdul Kadar, who had previously been chief of the  Jakarta Regional Office of the State Credit and Auctions Board  (BUPLN), was installed in office as chief of the Bureau of  Information and Law of BUPLN. Samsul Chorib, who had previously  been chief of the Medan I Regional Office of BUPLN, became chief  of the Bureau of State Credit and Banking of BUPLN.    Also on this occasion the minister installed in office two  managing directors and one director of government banks. Towil  Heryoto and Sjahrizal, who had been managing directors of the  Bank Tabungan Negara [State Postal Savings Bank] (BTN) and the  Bank Pembangunan Indonesia [Indonesian Development Bank]  (BAPINDO), respectively, exchanged positions. Towil became  managing director of BAPINDO and Sjahrizal became managing  director of the BTN. Furthermore, Dady Efendi, who had  previously been manager of the Jakarta branch of the BRI [Bank  Rakyat Indonesia--Indonesian People's Bank], was installed in  office as a director of the BRI.    According to Minister of Finance Mar'ie, these changes of  position and the installations in office of managing directors  and directors of government banks are part of a process of  consolidation in the banking sector. Mar'ie, a former director  general of taxes, said: "These individuals have now been  assigned to more appropriate positions, but this does not mean  that up to the present they have not been suited to the  positions they held."</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Observer: On parade General Sir Peter de la Billiere, commander of the British forces during the Gulf war, is trading in his beret for a bowler to become a director of Robert Fleming. Though best known for being on less than friendly terms with the Iraqis, it is his close relationships with other Middle Eastern states, especially Saudi Arabia, that is being sought by the merchant bank. As a soldier, he acquired a close knowledge of the region over 30 years. In 1984, Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, hand-picked him for a special mission to prepare for the Queen's visit to Jordan. Robert Fleming is something of a haven for refugees from the forces and prides itself on being managed along army lines - with the stress on planning as much as flair. It already manages billions of pounds of Arab money and won favour with Sir Peter by showing a stiff upper lip during the Gulf war; it kept its Bahrain office fully manned, while other western businessmen based in the Gulf headed homeward. Sir Peter is not planning to take up any other business appointments. Though his main role at Fleming will be to advise on Middle Eastern politics, John Manser, Fleming's chief executive, is also looking for some practical advice. For example, how can Fleming executives negotiate the maze of Saudi airport customs procedures in less than the traditional two hours.</p>

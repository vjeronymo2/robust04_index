			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 20 (AFP)--Mas'ud Barzani, head of the  Kurdistan Democratic Party, Friday appealed for a ceasefire  between his forces and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in  Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.    "I appeal to all the parties to stop the war and end the  Kurdish bloodshed," Barzani said in a statement received by AFP  in Ankara Friday.    The Patriotic Union, led by Jalal Talabani, and the  Democratic Party have both rejected responsibility for the  outbreak of fighting Wednesday and Thursday which broke a  ceasefire agreement signed May 8.    Northern Iraq has been under the control of the two  movements  since an uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army  at the end of the Gulf War in February 1991.    Officials from the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition said  to represent all Kurdish and Arab groups opposed to the Iraqi  leader, Thursday accused the Patriotic Union of breaching the  previous ceasefire agreement.    Barzani called for joint efforts with the Iraqi National  Congress to normalise the relationship.    The May 8 agreement, brokered by the Iraqi National  Congress,  came after two weeks of fighting in which at least 100 people  were killed.</p>

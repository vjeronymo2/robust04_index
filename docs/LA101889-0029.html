			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE / GANGBLAND ON WHEELS  </P> <P> The Show: RollerGames (11 a.m. Saturday, KTLA)  </P> <P> The Setup: Saturday-morning action that's a hybrid of roller derby and MTV.  Every week, two of the total six skating teams battle for points. They're  toughies, with team names that sound like heavy metal bands: The Maniacs, Bad  Attitude, the Violators, Hot Flash, the T-Birds, the Rockers. There are men's  as well as a women's squads. If one team can't conquer the other, there's a  wrestle with real alligators to determine the winner. Half-time entertainment  is provided by the likes of Debbie Harry, Warrant, Expose and Kool Moe Dee.  </P> <P> The Look: Spandex on skates. Three of the teams (the Violators, Bad Attitude  and the Maniacs) wear bad-guy basic black with studs, jagged edges or  disco-queen silver. The other three are the obvious good guys. The T-Birds pose  as Olympic hopefuls in red, white and blue; the Rockers wear terribly trendy  animal prints, and Hot Flash goes for hot pink and white. It may sound as if  they all look different, but the fact is they all look the same -- as if one  unimaginative aerobics instructor designed six sets of outfits for Monday  through Saturday. Undoubtedly, costume designer Rob Saduski has quite a range.  He dressed Madonna, Divine and rockers for music videos before getting into  this game. Part heavy metal, part mall wear, RollerGames fashions consist of  bicycle shorts, crop tops and leggings most likely to appeal to those not yet  old enough for car dates. Slightly more mature home viewers may find sartorial  inspiration in the bevy of cheerleaders prancing and dancing on the sidelines,  dressed in what looks like Calvin Klein underwear.  </P> <P> The Labels: All of the competition wear is custom made by Saduski and therefore  not available in stores.  </P> <P> The Adaptation: The wardrobe components are fairly simple to imitate -- with  protective knee and elbow pads as optional details. To really pull off the look  requires more than a few pieces of Spandex. A close personal affiliation, real  or imagined, with super-heroes or mega-menaces would also help. As would a  moniker, the kind that seems to be popular with underworld figures and heavy  weight wrestlers. "Shifty" Condejas, "Deadly Debbie" Van Doren, "Bamm-Bamm"  May, Paula "The Flea" and "Nasty Nancy" Wilkinson are not available. They've  already been taken by RollerGames teams.  </P> <P> The Payoff: Sidewalks in Venice and Santa Monica may become more populated with  rolling trash as a result of RollerGames wannabes. If they go the whole nine  yards, look out. They'll be dressed to kill. GAILE ROBINSON  </P></p>

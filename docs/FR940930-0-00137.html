			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CAA section 242(c) lists the useful life and in-use testing limitations for purposes of determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use compliance with the standards in section 243. The useful life for CFVs is the same as adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in EPA's regulations for 1994 and later model year LDVs and LDTs, commonly called Tier 1 standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (56 FR 25724, June 5, 1991). For LDVs and LDTs, the standards in section 243 are established at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediate useful life of five years or 50,000 miles (5/50,000), whichever occurs first, and a full useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life of 10 years or 100,000 miles (10/100,000), whichever occurs first (see Table 2). With respect to in-use testing, however, section 242(c) provides that such testing for these vehicle classes would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> done beyond seven years or 75,000 miles, whichever occurs first. The analogous intermediate and full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life levels for heavy LDTs are 5/50,000 and 11/120,000, respectively (see Table 2). Similarly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 242(c) provides that the in-use testing for these vehicles would not be done beyond seven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years or 90,000 miles, whichever occurs first.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the standards described above apply to single fuel CFVs, subsection 243(d) also establishes different CFV NMOG standards for dual and flexible fuel LDVs and LDTs. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  These vehicles are to be certified to two sets of NMOG standards (Table 3). One set contains the same NMOG levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that apply to single fuel CFVs; dual and flexible fuel vehicles must meet this standard when operating on the clean alternative fuel on which they are certified (section 243(d)(2)). The second set of NMOG standards applies to flexible and dual fuel vehicles when operated on conventional fuel for which they are certified (section 243(d)(3)). <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  This second set of standards is, in effect, equivalent to the next less stringent set of standards for the applicable vehicle category and model year. For example, the Phase I NMOG standard for flexible or dual fuel CFVs using conventional fuel is equivalent to the Tier I non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions standard. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  The Phase II NMOG standard for flexible or dual fuel CFVs using conventional fuel is equivalent to the Phase I standard for single fuel CFVs. The NMOG standards for flexible and dual fuel vehicles are listed in Table 3. Flexible or dual fuel vehicles must comply with all other CFV exhaust standards shown in Table 2 and with all other applicable requirements of Title II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Dual fuel vehicle is defined as any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine engineered and designed to be operated on two different fuels, but not on a mixture of the fuels. The term ``bi-fuel'' is often used for this type of design. Flexible fuel vehicle is defined as any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine engineered and designed to be operated on any mixture of two or more different fuels. The term ``variable-fuel'' is often used for this type of design. These definitions are contained in section &sect;88.102&hyph;94 of the regulatory text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CAA section 241 requires that dual and flexible fuel vehicles are to operate on the fuels on which they are certified. As discussed in the CFF credit program and TCM exemptions rulemaking (58 FR 11888, March 1, 1993), dual and flexible fuel vehicles shall operate only on the clean alternative fuel on which they are certified to the CFV standards when operating in a covered area, as provided in section 246(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NMOG and NMHC emissions are essentially equivalent when the fuel combusted is conventional gasoline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

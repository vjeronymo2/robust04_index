			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, Jan 31 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia is  considering a normalisation of the relations with the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.), Slovenian Foreign Minister  Lojze Peterle said on Monday [31 January]. At a press  conference in Ljubljana Peterle underscored Slovenia's official  stand that the normalisation of the relations with the F.R.Y.  was of interest for this former member of the Yugoslav  Federation, especially after the increasingly successful  contacts between Belgrade and Zagreb. The Slovenian Foreign  Ministry has been actively monitoring all recent changes in the  Ljubljana-Belgrade relations, said Peterle but did not elaborate.    Slovenia's Foreign Ministry is studying what should be done  for the setting up of the contacts between Ljubljana and  Belgrade, said the minister and added that proposals would be  submitted to the Slovenian Government in order to examine them  at one of its next sessions. The F.R.Y. recognized Slovenia in  late summer of 1992, as part of the preparations for the London  Conference on resolving the Yugoslav crisis. At that time,  Slovenia did not show any interest in the normalisation of the  relations with the F.R.Y.</p>

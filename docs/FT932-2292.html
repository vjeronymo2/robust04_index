			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Question raised on income products FIDELITY, the fund management group, has written to the Securities and Investments Board expressing concern about the way some high-income products are marketed, Philip Coggan writes. The concerns relate to products which offer a 'guaranteed' income, often at levels as high as 10 per cent. These products can appear highly attractive to investors dissatisfied with building society returns in the wake of the fall in base rates to 6 per cent. While the income is guaranteed on these products, however, return of the initial capital is not. On some products the stockmarket is required to grow at a defined rate for the original investment to be returned. Investors could easily find that the 'income' had been earned only at the expense of their capital, for no real gain at all. Fidelity is worried that the use of the term 'income' in relation to these products may be misleading and that the risks should be made clear to investors.</p>

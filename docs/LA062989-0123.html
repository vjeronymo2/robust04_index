			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> JAIL REUNITES FATHER, SON  </P> <P> A father and son separated since the boy's birth were reunited after 19 years  when both turned up as inmates in the Santa Clara County Jail. Robert Arthur  Magoon was in custody for allegedly violating his parole and his father,  Michael Arthur Magoon, 44, was being held on robbery charges. The elder Magoon  also has warrants pending for investigation of felony child stealing. "When I  first came here, they said, 'Do you have a relative here?' " said Robert. "I  said, 'Not that I know of.' At first, I thought it couldn't be possible. For  all I knew, he could have been on the other side of the world." Robert was  separated from his father shortly after birth when his parents split up, and he  spent most of his youth in foster homes. He ran away from the last one at age  14. Michael also said he tried looking for his long-lost son and had no idea he  was in a foster home.  </P></p>

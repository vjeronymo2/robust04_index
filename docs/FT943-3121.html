			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Advance by bingo clubs helps Vardon to Pounds 1.54m A strong performance from bingo clubs helped Vardon, the leisure group which also owns the London Dungeon, increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 540,000 to Pounds 1.54m at the interim stage. Vardon's visitor attractions also advanced strongly, contributing Pounds 7.52m (Pounds 5.44m) to total turnover of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 6.45m) in the six months to the end of June. The bingo division contributed Pounds 5.16m (Pounds 1.02m) to sales while operating profits rose from Pounds 79,000 to Pounds 946,000. 'Our strategy of developing purpose-built, edge-of-town, high quality facility bingo clubs is proving correct. The new clubs are attracting younger and more affluent players,' Mr David Hudd, chairman, said. Vardon runs 11 bingo clubs, five of which have been specially built on the outskirts of towns, mostly near shopping complexes with parking facilities. The company has plans for four new clubs, including one in Croydon which will be the biggest in the UK with a capacity for 3,200. The attractions division, which includes 15 sea life centres, a Cornish seal sanctuary and the London and York Dungeons, saw operating profits rise from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.3m. Mr Hudd said the new sea life centres in Tynemouth and Newquay were trading well, although the hot, dry weather had led to a mixed performance from indoor coastal attractions. Three new sea life centres are planned, including a Pounds 4.4m aquarium at Brinley Place in the centre of Birmingham which the company expects will attract 400,000 customers a year. The London Dungeon attracts 550,000 annually. Vardon committed Pounds 11m to its development programme in 1994, Pounds 6m of which fell in the first half. The company will end the financial year with borrowings of Pounds 5.5m and gearing of 16 per cent. An interim dividend of 0.375p (0.3p) will be paid. Earnings per share rose from 0.7p to 1.5p.</p>

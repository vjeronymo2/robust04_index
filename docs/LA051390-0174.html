			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH HONORING CHINA'S MARTYRS FOR DEMOCRACY  </P> <P> President Bush signed a proclamation declaring today National Day in Support of  Freedom and Human Rights in memory of those killed in Communist China last year  while demonstrating in support of democracy.  </P> <P> The Senate, which harshly criticized Bush for refusing to impose stiff economic  and diplomatic measures against China in response to the bloody crackdown,  passed a resolution Friday urging the President to sign the proclamation.  </P> <P> In the proclamation signed Saturday, Bush noted that last spring millions of  people in China marched peacefully for democracy, and "tragically . . . lethal  force was used to crush the demonstrations."  </P> <P> "Steps have been taken in recent months that have resulted in some  improvements," including the release of prisoners and the lifting of martial  law, he said. "The United States hopes that these steps will be followed by  others that will demonstrate China's return to the path of reform."  </P> <P> Bush must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's "most favored nation" trade  status. There is a push in Congress to revoke that status.  </P> <P> China is eager to mend fences with the United States as such action could cost  billions of dollars in exports.  </P> <P> Chinese President Yang Shangkun leaves today on a five-nation Latin America  trip that some diplomats say is designed to polish his image and smooth U.S.  ties.  </P> <P> One Western diplomat said Mexico might be the most important stop for Yang. "I  think maybe the Chinese hope Mexico will act as a bridge to the United States,"  he said.  </P> <P> Yang will also visit Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile.  </P></p>

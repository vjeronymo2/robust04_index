			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / DTI takes tougher line over regional aid requests The government is taking a tougher line on applications for regional aid from foreign investors, who are considering England as a location, and indigenous companies wanting to expand. The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday confirmed that it was scrutinising applications for Regional Selective Assistance in England more stringently, as part of the constraints on public spending. The tightening of allocation of RSA grants has not been publicly announced but its effect is arousing concern among many of those dealing with inward investment in England by UK and overseas companies. Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, has been lobbied by development agencies and local authorities worried that the tougher approach will hinder the English regions in their pursuit of economic regeneration, as mobile inward investors shop around internationally. 'If you aren't in the shop window, they won't come in and talk,' one agency chief said yesterday. Mr Sainsbury's response to the complaints has been that, since the recession is lifting, more projects are bidding for funding and that more areas of England are competing, following last summer's redrawing of the Assisted Areas map. The DTI said yesterday this year's RSA budget for England - which includes an undisclosed number of commitments made in previous years - is Pounds 101m, compared with Pounds 89.2m in 1993-94. 'There's no less money available overall, but we're being increasingly careful about who gets the money,' it said. But some economic development bodies are fearful the government's belief that the UK is now a highly attractive location for inward investment - thanks to de-regulation, labour market flexibility and low inflation - is lessening ministers' commitment to a grant regime about which some may be ideologically lukewarm. Their worries have been heightened by the government's decision, unveiled in last month's Competitiveness White Paper, to lay greater stress in granting RSA on the quality of jobs created. This policy may make it more difficult to win grants for projects offering the kind of less skilled work attractive to the jobless in high unemployment areas. The DTI said the move to greater stringency had been introduced gradually. Development agency staff say it has become increasingly pronounced in recent months. Because the RSA system is totally discretionary, and most applications are confidential, agencies in the field are reluctant to cite examples of projects adversely affected. Mr Bryn Sidaway, leader of Sunderland council, is known to have written to the prime minister complaining that the level of RSA offered to Lucas SEI Wiring Systems, automotive components manufacturer, for a proposed Wearside plant, was lower than expected. However, the company recently announced that the project, which will create 650 jobs in its Pounds 10m first phase, will go ahead. In the 40 years to 1991, the UK secured 36 per cent of US direct investment into the European Community and, between 1951 and March 1992, 40.9 per cent of Japanese EC direct investment.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Greece Voting Sunday. There is little enthusiasm for the election in Greece. European issues are scarcely mentioned in candidates' speeches, beyond a statutory mention of the Ecu17bn that Greece will get in EU assistance for infrastructure projects over the next five years. For the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, the election is the first test of popularity since it regained power last October. For the conservative opposition New Democracy, the poll is seen as a test for Mr Miltiades Evert, a former mayor of Athens who took over the leadership after the election defeat. LIKELY RESULT: Pasok looks set to maintain a clear lead over ND, with the nationalist Political Spring gaining ground at the expense of both main parties. One poll this week put Pasok ahead with 41.1 per cent to 36.2 per cent for ND, 7.6 per cent for Political Spring, 4.7 per cent for the Left Alliance and 4.4 per cent for the Stalinist Greek Communist Party.</p>

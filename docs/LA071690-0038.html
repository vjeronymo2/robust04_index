			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MEDAGLIA PICK OFFS WIN FOR WEST ALL-STARS  </P> <P> Like most of his teammates, Joey Medaglia stood along the railing of the West  dugout in the bottom of the ninth inning of the District 20 All-Star Game on  Sunday, trying to stir up a rally.  </P> <P> Medaglia's revelry was broken when West Coach Tom Pedersen yelled his name.  Medaglia looked at Pedersen with a blank stare.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what he wanted at first," said Medaglia, an outfielder from  Agoura who had exited the game in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> What he wanted was for Medaglia to re-enter the game at first base as a  pinch-runner, and in the blink of an eye, Medaglia was picked off by East  pitcher Sean Henson.  </P> <P> Henson's throw, however, was in the dirt and eluded first baseman Robert Flores  and Medaglia scooted to third, where one out later he scored on a double by Joe  Tushnet to hand the West a 6-5 victory at Birmingham High.  </P> <P> It marked a reprieve for both Medaglia and West, which appeared to have the  game in the bag, leading 5-2 entering the ninth. But Harold Turk surrendered a  single to Henson and walked Marlon McKinney and Chris Prince to load the bases  with none out.  </P> <P> A balk, sacrifice fly and Brian Esquival's clutch run-scoring single tied the  game, 5-5.  </P> <P> Kendial Armstrong started the final West comeback, reaching base on a fielding  error then leaving in favor of Medaglia, who scored the winning run.  </P> <P> First-round pairings for the district playoffs, which open Tuesday, were issued  after the game. First, however, Panorama City (17-5) must play Verdugo Hills in  a make-up game today at 5 at Monroe High.  </P> <P> If Panorama City wins, it will play Quartz Hill (18-5) on Tuesday at 4 p.m. at  Birmingham. If Panorama City loses, it plays Woodland Hills East (19-4) at  Birmingham at 12:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Woodland Hills West (19-4) will play Lancaster (16-7) at 4 p.m. Tuesday at  Pierce College. Top-seeded Sun Valley (19-4) plays its first-round game  Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. against Newhall-Saugus (15-8) at Birmingham.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 31 May, the Ernesto Che Guevara Pioneer Center  hosted the first patriotic-military-internationalist education  meeting. The meeting served to demonstrate how this education is  to be conducted at every level.    [Begin Brigadier General Nestor Lopez Cuba, director of the  ideology department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces,  recording] Almost every organization, in one way or another,  conducts patriotic-military education. Yet, we believe there is  still too little and we ought to increase and strengthen it. At  this pioneers' center, we begin with the children, the youth,  who we believe should be at the core of this educational effort.  There is no doubt that although this educational program has  gaps and problems, we are making a tremendous effort. We have  conducted this seminar in all three of the Army's regions. We  are already beginning to expand it to the provinces. Later on,  it will reach the municipal level and eventually, each defense  zone. [end recording]    The main goals of the patriotic-military education program  are to promote the study of Cuban history; boost patriotic  traditions and love for national emblems, heroes, and martyrs;  and consolidate the ethical-political-ideological value system  developed by the Revolution.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tropical timber pact talks resume TROPICAL TIMBER producing and consuming countries yesterday began a third round of talks to try to agree a new international tropical timber accord, amid continuing divisions over its scope and financing. The present pact, adopted in 1983, expires at the end of March next year. Informal talks since the second round of negotiations broke up in June have failed to resolve the differences between the two sides. Delegates were meeting last night to decide whether to extend the negotiations, held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, from one week to two. Producing and consuming countries remain split over producer demands that temperate timber should be included in the new accord. Producers are also insisting on additional financial help to meet the proposed stipulation that by the year 2000 all tropical timber exports should come from sustainably managed forests. This target was set two years ago by the International Tropical Timber Organisation which runs the 1983 pact. Tropical timber producers, which have already lost international market share to temperate woods because of environmental concerns, argue that exporters of temperate timber should be subjected to the same conservation disciplines through inclusion in the treaty. The present accord has 50 producer and consumer members accounting for between 80 and 90 per cent of the Dollars 7.5bn annual world tropical timber trade.</p>

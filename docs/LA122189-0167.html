Central Ave., the site of one of the  most successful franchises in the fast-food chain.  </P> <P> A new restaurant, with a drive-through lane big enough for 20 or more cars to  wait, will be built on the ground floor of the office building, expected to be  completed in late spring of 1991, city officials said.  </P></p>

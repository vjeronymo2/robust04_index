			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru oil refinery sale attracts lone bidder EXPECTATIONS clashed head on with harsh reality on Tuesday when Petroperu, Peru's state oil concern, made its first attempt to sell off a major asset. The oil refinery of Conchan, a few miles south of the capital, failed to reach its Dollars 8m reserve price at auction in Lima and will now be re-offered within a month. Potential buyers were put off by what they considered an excessively high base price. 'In the current political climate in Peru, any investment is risky and the price reflects that,' commented one. The sale was reported to have aroused considerable initial interest - a couple of dozen potential buyers included Chilean and Argentine interests and the Marc Rich minerals marketing empire. Long-controlled fuel prices were freed a week before the auction date, supposedly making it more attractive. Conchan produces less than 5 per cent of all oil refined in Peru - about 8,000 barrels a day, compared with the 100,000 b/d capacity of major refineries at Talara and La Pampilla - but is excellently sited a few miles south of the capital. On the day, however, only one bid emerged, from Chile's Asfaltos Chilenos, a small company interested in Conchan's virtual monopoly over provision of asphalt in the central coastal area. High demand for asphalt is guaranteed in a big repair programme for Peru's road system. The Asfaltos Chilenos bid was for under Dollars 7m, around 15 per cent below the base price and close to what is expected to be the re-offer price. The fact that the only bidder was from Peru's age-old rival provoked a mild outburst of nationalism in the Petroperu auditorium - a union leader, with some support, stood to intone Peru's national anthem. Outside a band of diehards chanted and waved banners accusing the state of giving away the national patrimony. But mines and energy minister Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, who also heads the government's privatisation commission Copri, said the failure to sell Conchan was incontrovertible proof that no special interests were being favoured. He estimated that any buyer for Conchan would have to invest an immediate Dollars 7m or Dollars 8m in modernisation and re-equipment. 'We'll go on auctioning it until we sell it,' he promised. 'But I'm absolutely confident we'll get a buyer next time.'</p>

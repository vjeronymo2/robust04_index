			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / BNF set to win go-ahead for Thorp uranium test THE pollution inspectorate is likely to tell British Nuclear Fuels within days that it can begin testing its controversial Thorp reprocessing plant with uranium. Greenpeace, the pressure group, has opposed the start of testing on the grounds that it prejudges the government's decision on whether to allow the Pounds 2.8bn plant in west Cumbria to start operation. Greenpeace said yesterday: 'If the inspectorate gives permission for testing, then we will go to court and apply for leave for a judicial review.' BNF originally expected Thorp, which will recycle used nuclear fuel, to receive authorisation at the start of this year. Opposition from politicians and environmentalists, however, has led the government to hold a second public consultation on the plant's future, delaying a decision until the end of the year. The inspectorate announced on July 22 that it was 'minded' to allow testing to begin on the condition that BNF paid for decommissioning any contaminated equipment if it did not get the go-ahead for the plant. Since then, the inspectorate has received about 140 responses to its statement, divided roughly equally between those in favour of testing and those opposing it.</p>

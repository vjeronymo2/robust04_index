			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / India urged not to repatriate Tamils The US human rights group Asia Watch says in a report released today that India should cancel its plan to restart repatriation of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees who have fled their war-ravaged homeland, Reuter reports from New Delhi. It alleges that some Tamils living in Indian refugee camps have been coerced into agreeing to return, have no idea what they are going back to and are at risk from both sides in Sri Lanka's fighting. India plans to repatriate another 7,000 refugees from camps in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, starting with a shipload of 1,200 scheduled to depart from Madras today and heading to the east Sri Lankan port of Trincomalee.</p>

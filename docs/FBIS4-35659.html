			<p>BFN     [Text] A source at the General People's Committee for Unity  made the following statement:    The Zionist enemy continues its ongoing aggression against  the Arab nation, thus violating its sovereignty and territories,  using to this end its arsenal and weapons of destruction that  are supplied to it by Western states, at their forefront the  U.S. Government. This represents a blatant defiance against all  international resolutions. What is more, they intensify this  plot whenever they wish to impose more hegemony against Arab  regimes and against the will of the masses that reject defeat  and submission.    The violations and aggression taking place these days  against  the sovereignty of Lebanon and its Arab people should be used as  a means to resist all attempts of submission and the imposition  of the fait accompli. This should be faced up to with a  responsibility as stipulated by Arab charters, foremost of which  the Arab joint defense accord; there should be an end to the  aggression and barbaric attacks of the Israelis that target  civilians as well as undermining the spirit of the fierce  resistance against the Zionist presence and occupation.    The General People's Committee for Unity in the Great  Jamahiriyah, stemming from the pillars of the revolution of the  Great al-Fatih, and in implementation of the resolutions of the  Basic People's Congresses that stressed the need to confront the  continuing imperialist-backed Israeli aggression against the  Arab nation, denounces the Israeli terrorism that is represented  in the continuing occupation of Arab territories stretching from  Southern Lebanon to the Golan Heights and the region of Um  al-Rafrash. It also denounces the practice of hostilities and  kidnap of civilians; yet nobody dares to restrain the Israelis  from carrying out such practices. We call for the  implementation of Arab charters and accords to face up to this  aggression.</p>

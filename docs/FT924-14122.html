			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Michael Prowse on America: Clinton and the new Democrats With Governor Bill Clinton still well ahead in opinion polls, the US seems to be heading for a new era of government activism. Mr Clinton has repeatedly asserted his belief in the public sector as a positive force in people's lives. He is also hyper-active by temperament: 'unless he achieves at least 20 things each day as president,' says one adviser, 'he will not go to bed happy.' The prospect of an energetic 'do-gooder' in the Oval Office will alarm those who believe that governments mostly do harm; it suggests a regression to the 1960s and the 'Great Society' social programmes championed by Lyndon Johnson. Such fears are probably exaggerated. Mr Clinton would be an activist president. But his conception of government's role seems to be enlightened. Following the heavy defeat of Mr Walter Mondale, the old-style Democrat who challenged incumbent President Ronald Reagan in 1984, a small band of frustrated Democrats formed the Democratic Leadership Council to shift the Democratic party into the political mainstream and develop a 'post-liberal' governing agenda. Mr Clinton, then an obscure state governor, supported the DLC during its difficult early days as a southern/western insurgency movement on the conservative fringes of the party. From 1990 up to his bid for the presidency, he chaired the council. To find out more about the DLC's philosophy, I went to see Mr Will Marshall, a former journalist who helped start the movement and now runs the Progressive Policy Institute, the council's think-tank. He explained that the institute was set up following the defeat of Mr Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1988 and was modelled on conservative think-tanks, such as the Heritage Foundation, which successfully laid the ground for Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980. In what ways has the DLC and the institute tried to change traditional Democratic thinking? Mr Marshall rattles off examples. They have stressed the importance of pro-market policies to stimulate growth, arguing that a preoccupation with redistribution makes little sense when the overall pie is no longer growing much. Equally important, they have advocated far-reaching reform of the public sector, advocating 'entrepreneurial government' in place of old-style bureaucracies. Mr David Osborne, an institute fellow, was co-author of Reinventing Government, an influential book that advocates a Thatcherite cocktail of deregulation, privatisation and enhanced customer choice. These 'new democrats' have been innovative in other spheres. The DLC has been at the centre of a movement to redefine the relationship between government and citizens by stressing that rights entail reciprocal responsibilities. The group believes, for example, that welfare payments are justified only if recipients accept training or jobs. On race, Mr Marshall, a southerner, argues for equal opportunity rather than equal outcomes and opposes old-style affirmative action as discriminatory. Finally, on foreign policy, the DLC has sought to reverse the public perception of the Democratic party as soft on defence, arguing that the US can promote principles it believes in, such as democracy, only from a position of strength. In Britain, wet Tories and the social democratic wing of the Labour party would both be comfortable with most of the DLC's policy positions. This would not surprise Mr Marshall who regards himself as pursuing a 'third way', which is neither right nor left. He claims an affinity of views with many on the progressive wing of the Republican party, including, for example, Mr Lamar Alexander,the education secretary, who is promoting 'school choice', and Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary and proponent of urban 'empowerment' and enterprise zones. He jokes, however, that it will be a Democratic administration that actually implements many of their pet schemes. It is hard to doubt either Mr Marshall's sincerity or the merits of many of his progressive policies. The depth of Mr Clinton's personal commitment to the 'post-liberal' agenda, however, remains untested. If he is elected, traditional Democratic constituencies, such as organised labour, will lose no time in pressing their sectional interests. A young inexperienced president could easily lose his way. Worse still, Mr Clinton is a skilled enough politician to have used the DLC as a political springboard without really believing in its policies. The DLC has been useful to him in many practical ways, from locating fund raisers to providing crucial cells of support in many states. Mr Marshall's gut feeling, however, is that Mr Clinton is fully committed to the reformist agenda. In his acceptance speech at the New York convention, Mr Clinton could have pandered to party activists, but instead delivered a ringing restatement of core DLC beliefs. At subsequent testing moments, he has remained solid: for example, he recently endorsed the free trade pact with Mexico despite union misgivings. Optimism about the US is currently unfashionable; but I cannot help thinking that the nation may have found a man and a set of policies capable of addressing its many pressing social and economic problems. The days of domestic drift could be numbered.</p>

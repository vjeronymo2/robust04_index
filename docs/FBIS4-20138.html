			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bonn coalition meeting today put on ice the  controversial Bundeswehr cutbacks planned by Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe. Under pressure from Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel, the meeting decided to postpone a decision and to set up  a working party. This is to devise an alternative plan for the  future of the Bundeswehr, based on Ruehe's proposals. Foreign  Minister Kinkel expressed his opposition to the planned  reduction of the armed forces to 340,000 men.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Moscow weighs up coal restructuring The restructuring of the Russian coal industry is under urgent consideration by the Russian government. At stake is a sector employing nearly 800,000 workers attracting massive subsidies from an impoverished budget - and a Dollars 500m (Pounds 322.5m) loan from the World Bank which would be paid if the government committed itself to the huge redundancy and social programme entailed in making the industry efficient. Though no decision has yet been made in principle to adopt a fully-fledged closure strategy, the state body which oversees the industry, Rosugol, announced last week the closure of nine loss-making pits. This seems to be a move showing that it is willing to undertake a efficiency measures at which it has so far baulked. Mr Alexander Sergeyev, head of the Independent Union of Mineworkers, said Rosugol had no right to make the announcement and warned of a 'social explosion' in the Kuzbass, the main coal-producing regions. However, an analysis undertaken by the World Bank, to be the subject of intensive discussions beginning later this week, points to a much more radical closure programme - which would take out one-third of the industry's capacity and reduce the workforce by over 300,000. It shows that coal consumption in Russia has plummetted from 369m tonnes in 1990 to an estimated 304m tonnes in 1993 and is projected to fall to 217m tonnes by 1997. During 1992, direct employment has remained stable, at 763,000 in 273 pits. The issue is made more delicate by the fact that the miners were the critically important group in the ascent to power of Mr Boris Yeltsin as president of Russia - they made his programme a centrepiece of their demands during the strike waves of the late-1980s. They have remained better organised and more militant than workers in any other industry and have so far forced governments at least to promise compliance with their demands, even if in fact their wages are often delayed from three to six months. The World Bank report, a copy of which has been obtained by the FT, was drawn up with the participation of the government and Rosugol but is not binding. It describes the Russian coal industry as in a 'catastrophic' position, and calls for an extremely rapid reduction of employment and output, to the year 2000, especially in the two large coal basins in the Kuzbass, in Siberia, and the Pechora basin in the Komi Republic in the Arctic Circle. On its most radical projection, it sees a drop of employment to 287,000 in 118 pits by 1997, and on a less radical projection, to 338,000 in 138 pits. However, it stresses that 'employment reduction . . . cannot start until there is an adequate and fully-funded safety net in place'. The Bank report says that coal subsidies account for 1.4 per cent of Russian GDP, and are 'clearly unsustainable'. Nearly half of the subsidies are paid to cover losses and for investment - 'encouraging mining companies to sell coal at prices which are well below the marginal costs of production, which depresses prices and profits for the low-cost, potentially profitable part of the coal industry'. The report recommends that: Subsidies be reduced from 1.4 per cent to 1 per cent in 1995, 0.6 per cent in 1996, 0.3 per cent in 1997 to reach zero in 1998; Rosugol devolve the payment of wages and the setting of prices to the mining companies; The social costs now paid by the mining companies towards housing, medical and other services be transferred to the regional and local governments; The relatively high wage premiums paid to miners be reduced to make employment less attractive and that 'special payments' be offered to miners over the age of 45 to leave the industry. The report is frank on the social upheaval entailed - saying that, to be successful, the level of mining employment in the Kuzbass would fall from around 300,000 now to 70,000-80,000 by the year 2000. It also says miners have little chance of alternative work.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We will open our news bulletin with a sensational  piece of news: The European Parliament's condemnation of the  appointment of any Fascist ministers in the Italian Government  could in fact be false. The affair of the motion approved by  the Strasbourg parliament, which has unleashed bitter argument  in Italy, is shrouded in mystery.    The National Alliance alleges that the Italian translation  of  the motion has inserted the additional sentence -- following the  horrors of Fascism and Nazism. This phrase does not appear in  the French language version of the motion that was approved by  the European Parliament, nor does it appear in the motion  translated into the other official parliamentary languages.    The incriminating passage completes the appeal to the  Italian  Government to respect the values of the European Community.  According to National Alliance spokesman Francesco Storacce, the  insertion of the sentence is not a technical oversight, but a  miserable propaganda exercise. European Parliament President  Egon Klepsch intends to set up an inquiry. We are awaiting  further developments.</p>

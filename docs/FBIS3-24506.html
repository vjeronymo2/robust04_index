A group of experts examined the policy  statement and drew a number of conclusions regarding it. The  group's overall conclusion was that the scales assumed regarding  the development of nuclear energy for the production of power  and heat are based on a single unfounded scenario for the future  development of Russia's economy and power industry. The group  went on to suggest that the policy statement be rejected in its  present form and revised to include a special program of  emergency measures to prevent the possible occurrence and  development of large-scale accidents at now-operational nuclear  power facilities until they are shut down and to reduce the  harmful environmental effects of stored radwaste and spent  nuclear fuel during its storage and reprocessing. Included among  the other points raised in the group's 11-point reaction to the  policy statement were the following:  1) the policy statement does not acknowledge the existence of  alternative, economically sounder versions of covering that  portion of Russia's future power demand that is slated to be  covered by nuclear power;  2) the assessment of the current status of Russia's nuclear  power industry presented in the policy statement significantly  distorts the true state of the industry and paints it in a  manner favorable to the RF Ministry of Atomic Energy;  3) the extensive program of construction of new nuclear power  facilities, including facilities with RBMK reactors, in all  parts of the country called for in the policy statement is  unacceptable;  4) the ecological arguments in favor of expansion of the  nuclear power industry (especially the argument that increased  use of nuclear power will result in decreased burning of fossil  fuel) that are included in the policy statement are not, either  individually or in their entirety, sufficient grounds for  further expanding nuclear power generation in Russia by  2000-2010;  5) the harmful effects of nuclear power generation on the  environment, both because of accidents and because of flaws in  the technology, are well known and eliminate any basis for the  statement that atomic energy is safe on an ecological plane;  6) Russia's unified electric power systems are sufficient to  meet her fuel and power demands for several decades without any  need to increase her nuclear power industry;  7) the projected cost estimates of the proposed plan for  augmenting Russia's nuclear power industry are unfounded  because, as previously stated, the plan only considers one  possible scenario;  8) Russia has a broad spectrum of alternatives to expansion of  its nuclear power industry (including controlling heat use in  the domestic and industrial sectors, redesigning new gas-fired  boiler units to produce electricity and heat in the form of  steam and hot water, equipping existing steam turbine units with  gas turbine-based topping stations, and increasing the use of  coals from the Kansk-Achinsk and Kuznetsk basins;  9) the policy statement largely ignores international  experience in the area of nuclear power plant construction;  10) the policy statement does not provide any mechanism for the  public's involvement in decisions regarding constructing nuclear  power enterprises or for providing the public with objective  information regarding Russia's radiation situation.

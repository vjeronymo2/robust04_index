			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Question mark put over insurers by S&amp;P ALMOST 500 US insurance companies had a question mark placed against their claims-paying ability in a new survey, published yesterday, by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency. Although many of the 489 companies - drawn from both the life and property/casualty sectors - are small, they wrote an aggregate Dollars 18.3bn-worth of premiums in 1989. S&amp;P stressed that not all of these are necessarily in danger, but suggested their financial condition was 'below average' and they 'deserve close attention'. The agency's findings come at a sensitive time for the US insurance industry. The issue of solvency regulation - and whether the state regulatory system is adequate or whether a Federal agency should be set up - has been under scrutiny for many months. It was given a further twist last week when the main operating unit of First Executive, the large Los Angeles-based insurer, was taken over by the Californian state regulators - the largest-ever insurance company seizure. The new S&amp;P survey centres on the large number of US insurers who fall outside its normal claims-paying ranking service. In the past, S&amp;P has concentrated on analysing some 450 insurance companies. This full analysis is done with the companies' co-operation, and they pay for the service. However, the new study looks at a further 1,600 companies on the basis of returns made to the state insurance departments. S&amp;P acknowledges these studies are less fullsome and, therefore, only places companies into one of three broad categories - 'above average', 'average' and 'below'. It said yesterday that, of the 489 companies in the lowest category, 329 were in the life and health industry, and 133 in property-casualty. Another 27 reinsurers also fell into this range. About 150 life companies and a like number of P/C insurers made the top grade. Mr John Garamendi, the California Insurance Commissioner, said yesterday that - on current legal advice - he believed that the state insurance guaranty fund should cover policyholders of Executive Life, the main operating unit of First Executive seized by the regulators last week. However, not all policyholders will be covered for the full amount of the benefits promised by the insurer. Because the Californian fund only came into operation in January, there was a question over whether it would cover First Executive at all if the insurer was deemed to be impaired before that.</p>

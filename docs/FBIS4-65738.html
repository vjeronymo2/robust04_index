			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Merce Beltran report: "Serra Asserts That Aznar Is </F> Unworthy To Be Prime Minister"]    [Excerpt] Barcelona -- [Deputy Prime Minister] Narcis  Serra asserted yesterday that [People's Party Chairman] Jose  Maria Aznar "is not a person worthy of the prime ministership,"  in a tough indictment of the People's Party [PP], a force that,  in his opinion, "lacks the most elementary ethics" and commits  "acts of political effrontery" such as using "statements by  somebody who has fled justice that have been denied," referring  to the assertions by [former Civil Guard Director General] Luis  Roldan, in which he accused the deputy prime minister of  ordering him to conduct an investigation into Mario Conde.    Narcis Serra made these remarks at the presentation of the  Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC) candidates for the European  Parliament. Criticisms of the People's Party, an absence of  references to Convergence and Union, and the Socialists' firm  commitment to the struggle against corruption dominated most of  the speeches. The deputy prime minister began his address with  optimistic remarks about the economic situation. "We are  emerging from the tunnel of the crisis. The economy is  reviving, we are correcting our shortcomings, and new jobs are  being created thanks to the labor reform."    In his opinion, "much remains to be done," because emerging  from the crisis "requires more effort today," and so he  advocated a new "social, trade union, and business culture. And  it will be our involvement in Europe that will help us make this  change of outlook a reality, provided that Europe is guided by a  project of progress that will bar the way to the right."    The Socialist leader warned that all the progress achieved  "is in danger. The gravest threat to Spain's progress is the  policy of the PP and Jose Maria Aznar, and this would be the  case if they were in power, because they have no policy." He  added that "the opposition's gravest threat is its sectarianism;  wishing to attain power without taking the results of the polls  into account. Their sectarianism even prevents them from  acknowledging the effort that Spanish society is making."    He reiterated the Socialists' pledge to combat corruption:  "We will continue to the bitter end, whoever may fall." Serra  stressed that the Socialists have a great deal at stake in this  battle, "and so does society, because the democratic system's  credibility could be at issue unless drastic action is taken,  but it will be very difficult to ease the tension in political  life as long as the PP is there." He pointed out differences  from the PP in explaining that "we are different. Our voters  are more demanding, and we have a higher idea of the political  action that we put into practice. We will relinquish government  responsibility when citizens so wish at the polls."    In the deputy prime minister's opinion, the PP's own  strategy  "helps us surmount the situation. People know that the  implementation of the PP's policy would be very bad for  political stability. It has no arguments and has a lack of  elementary ethics. They demand everything except respecting the  results of the polls. They wish to turn what is their problem  into everybody's problem." In his opinion, the PP's problem is  the censure motion. "It does not submit one because the PP  stands alone, in the solitude of those who persist in error; of  those who for a handful of votes are capable of stirring up a  language war in Catalonia; in the solitude of those who would  like to place in the prime ministership a person who is unworthy  of it. This is the real reason why they do not submit a censure  motion -- not the parliamentary arithmetic."    He added another reason to these arguments: "When a censure  motion is submitted, an alternative government program must be  presented, and they have none. Aznar would have to confront  Gonzalez, and he cannot win that battle. The Spanish people  will never be able to trust somebody who, in an act of real  political effrontery, used statements by somebody who has fled  justice that have been denied. Nobody will ever trust those  ethics."    Serra concluded with references to Europe, expressing his  conviction that the Socialists will win the elections because  "Europe has always seemed very distant to the PP; they do not  believe in the social Europe, they are a danger to the  structural funds, and their European partners defend interests  detrimental to us."

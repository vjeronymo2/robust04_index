			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Four Maxwell pension funds to close FOUR MAXWELL pensions funds, covering about 4,000 people are to be wound up. They are the first to be closed since the collapse of the Maxwell empire. The decision was taken by Mr Alan Fishman, of Clay &amp; Partners Pension Trustees, because of the large sums of money missing from the funds and because 'the chances of them being made up are negligible'. The funds involved are for employees and management at AGB Research, the market research group, which was bought by Mr Robert Maxwell's private interests, and the employees of his cable television interests. Winding up will take some time and Mr Fishman said the trustees would 'ensure, as far as we are able, that benefits continue to be paid'. It was clear last night however that many of the employees are likely to lose the money they have paid into the funds. There is little chance of any money for deferred pensioners, who left the company but still had some pensions rights, or those currently employed by the companies involved. The position is unclear what priorities there will be for block transfers, groups of employees who have moved in or out of the schemes as a result of purchases or disposals in the Maxwell empire. Present pensioners have the first priority and continue to receive their pensions. However the value of their ultimate pensions will depend on the financial state of the funds when the windings up are complete and all assets realised. Mr Fishman declined to discuss numbers last night but it is clear there may not be enough for all pensioners to receive their full entitlements. The funds being wound up are the AGB Research Group Retirement Benefits Scheme, the AGB Pension Scheme, the Maxwell Media Pensions Plan (covering cable) and the Directors Pension Plan. Mr Fishman said last night it had been his duty to make a ruling on the four funds. He had decided to end the speculation and uncertainty although inevitably there were human tragedies involved. A member of the consultative committee on the MCC pension fund said: 'In the absence of any recovery of money missing from the MCC pension fund what has happened at AGB must be a matter of great concern for members of the MCC fund.'</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFUNDS FOR RECYCLING  </P> <P> In response to the letter from Jill Renton on raising the redemption value of  bottles and cans (April 3):  </P> <P> If the refunds were raised to 5 cents, rather than fearing more scavengers, an  easy solution would be for residents to recycle bottles, cans, etc., and donate  good reusable items to charity.  </P> <P> Also, why not have a garage sale? Then trash would become just trash with  nothing left to scavenge.  </P> <P> Scavenging has always been a means of salvaging usable material from trash.  </P> <P> In today's society with a shortage of landfills, a growing homeless population,  and many people at the poverty level, scavenging provides a means of making  money -- albeit a small amount.  </P> <P> Either let the scavengers help themselves and the environment, or solve the  noise problem by doing something positive.  </P> <P> EVELYN FERGUSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

In his exclusive interview with INTERFAX he underlined that  the joining of new members, Azerbaijan and Georgia, confirms  this fact.    Shushkevich hopes that in 1994 politicians will pay major  attention to the strategy "but not to tactical conveniences and  raising of definite political groups in different countries."    "If we decide to build the Commonwealth and want that the  Russian-speaking population be respected in all its states, as  it is in Belarus, then let us behave adequately! Any protest  against separate moves of several Russian politicians can grow  into an anti-Russian policy," declared Shushkevich.    He believes that principles of economic relations and  primarily issues related to fuel and energy deliveries from  Russia are the most important issues which have not been  resolved yet.    At the same time, Shushkevich emphasized that those "who  accuse him of anti-Russian moods" are guided by poor instincts  and not by sound sense."    The head of the parliament awaits a new democratic  parliament  and, perhaps, presidential elections in 1994.</p>

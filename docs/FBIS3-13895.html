			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India today expressed its desire for an early  resumption of foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan. This  was conveyed by the foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, to the  Pakistan's high commissioner, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, in New Delhi  today. Seeking an early positive response from Pakistan, the  foreign secretary said the talks can either be held in New Delhi  or Islamabad at the convenience of Pakistan. Mr. Srinivasan  conveyed New Delhi's formal reply to Pakistan's comments and  counterproposals on the six Indian nonpapers.    Regretting Pakistan's negative approach, Mr. Srinivasan  reiterated India's desire for a dialogue with Pakistan under the  Simla agreement on all outstanding issues. The foreign  secretary conveyed to the high commissioner that India's  proposals were formulated in absolute realism and flexibility,  signaling its preparedness to carry forward the process of  normalization of bilateral relations.    According to External Affairs Ministry sources, Mr.  Srinivasan touched upon each of India's nonpapers and gave an  assessment of Pakistan's counterproposals. On the proposal to  maintain peace and tranquillity on the Line of Control, the  foreign secretary said it is aimed at eliminating tension in the  relations and is prepared without any prejudice to the positions  taken by the two governments on larger issues.    On Siachen, India regretted that Pakistan has disavowed the  understanding reached at the talks in New Delhi during November  1992. However, New Delhi is prepared to hold talks on Siachen  based on pre-1992 talks.    Regarding Sir Creek maritime boundary issue, the foreign  secretary requested Pakistan to reconsider India's proposal.  Regarding Tulbul navigation project, Mr. Srinivasan reminded  Pakistan that its comment is factually incorrect. Indian  proposal was in the form of a draft agreement which New Delhi is  prepared to ratify and wanted Pakistan's response to that.    Regarding India's proposal to initiate confidence-building  measures, he said Pakistan's response was not forthcoming.  Hoping that Islamabad will respond, Mr. Srinivasan said these  measures will help reduce tensions and improve bilateral  relations. India welcomes Pakistan's suggestion to include more  areas in the ambit of joint commission.    On Pakistan's nonpapers regarding the modalities of  conducting a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir, India dismissed  that there is nothing new in the proposal and New Delhi's stand  was made clear during the foreign secretary-level talks.    Mr. Srinivasan also took up with the Pakistan high  commissioner the restrictions imposed on the Indian Consulate in  Karachi by totally blocking the access to the consulate for the  local public. He hoped the Pakistan authorities will allow the  Indian Consulate to carry out its functions normally.</p>

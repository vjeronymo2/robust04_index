			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Lloyds Bank eyes Midland's riches: The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank attempt to buy a UK clearer may be thwarted by the Black Horse - The bid for Midland may become a two-horse race Lloyds Bank will this week decide whether to make its biggest gamble since it tried and failed to acquire Standard Chartered, the international bank, in 1986. On Friday, Lloyds' board is expected to discuss whether the clearing bank should challenge Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's attempt to buy Midland by making its own takeover offer. Banking sources say that opinions within the board on whether to enter the battle are evenly split. If Lloyds were to intervene, it would merely state an intention to bid rather than put a price on Midland. Any detailed offer would have to get past the competition authorities in the European Community and the UK. According to his colleagues and advisers, Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, will be disappointed if Lloyds holds back. He has been planning such a takeover attempt for more than a year and has been working on it, with the help of the merchant bank, Barings, since last December. Senior bankers at Lloyds say Mr Pitman has no doubts about the huge incremental profits it can make by combining its UK operation with Midland's. Most of that profits growth would come from cutting overheads, especially staff costs. At the end of December, Midland had 57,640 employees, of which 51,000 were based in the UK, while Lloyds' staff, excluding those employed by its life insurance subsidiary, Lloyds Abbey Life, numbered 57,877 and most were UK based. Another big running cost in any bank is incurred in maintaining a network of high street branches. Midland has 1,830 branches, whereas Lloyds has 2,000. Lloyds would plan to combine the branch networks and close adjacent outlets. Over a three-year period it would expect to close more than 1,000 branches and reduce staff numbers by more than 20,000. There would also be large savings from merging the two banks' head offices and sacking a group of senior managers. Lloyds estimates this would lead to cost savings of more than Pounds 500m, and perhaps close to Pounds 1bn. Those savings should be compared with the two banks' combined profits for 1991 of just under Pounds 700m before tax. That target for cost savings is not particularly ambitious. In the US, Chemical Bank estimates that its recent merger with Manufacturers Hanover will lead to cost savings of Dollars 750m (Pounds 428m), even though the two banks had much smaller branch networks than either Lloyds or Midland. No one on the Lloyds' board doubts the financial merits of making a takeover bid. Lloyds would have to offer much more than the Pounds 3.1bn at which the Hongkong Bank bid values Midland. But Lloyds can afford to offer more. Hongkong Bank would not be able to reap cost savings at Midland equivalent to those available to Lloyds, as Hongkong Bank does not have a UK branch network. Lloyds has been assessing the attitude of its shareholders and those of Midland to a bid and it has little doubt that they would like it to enter the fray. Some of the big investors in the two banks confirm this view. However, a contest for control of Midland between Lloyds and Hongkong Bank would not be decided by the stock market alone. The UK and European Community competition authorities would wish to examine in detail whether the combination of two big UK banks would operate against the public interest. At the Department of Trade and Industry, Lloyds has sounded out Sir Peter Gregson, the permanent secretary. It has also had discussions with Sir Gordon Borrie, the soon-to-retire director-general of the Office of Fair Trading. Lloyds is concerned that the two banks' combined share of the small business loans market would be big enough to persuade the DTI that any proposed deal would be subject to detailed and lengthy scrutiny by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Because of the vital role which would be played by the small business sector in any economic recovery, the government would be concerned that a deal between Lloyds and Midland might reduce the supply of new finance to this sector. Lloyds' worst fear is that a bid from it would be referred to the MMC, though one by Hongkong Bank would not. If that happened, Midland's shareholders might opt to back the Hongkong Bank bid, for fear that an offer from Lloyds would be blocked. Bankers at Lloyds also admit it would be difficult to persuade the MMC that there would be adequate competition in the small business market if it were dominated by just three big banks - Barclays, National Westminster and the combined Lloyds/Midland. If Lloyds does bid, it will lobby the Brussels authorities and the DTI to inquire into Hongkong Bank's bid for other reasons, such as the need to assess competition within the UK banking market in general or the threat to Midland's depositors were there to be economic upheaval in Hong Kong after China regains control of the colony in 1997. Lloyds' case would be helped if it had the support of the Bank of England, but the Bank is expected to remain neutral in the struggle. Members of Lloyds' board are therefore divided about whether they should enter the fray given the risk that any bid would be blocked by the authorities. Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, is believed to be more concerned about the risks of failure than Mr Pitman. However, Sir Robin Ibbs, Sir Jeremy's heir apparent, is said to be broadly in favour of making an offer. Some Lloyds' bankers see little shame in trying and failing. After all, it is an open secret in the City that Lloyds held detailed talks with Midland about making an offer in March. Indeed, there would be a significant cost in not trying at all. In an interview earlier this year, Mr Pitman said he expected banks' income growth in the 1990s to be sluggish and therefore profits growth would have to be generated by cost cutting. Lloyds has cut its overheads further than its rivals. To keep up its superior profits record it needs to make an acquisition. It has evaluated making bids for TSB Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered. But it is convinced that the spoils available from buying one of these would be trivial compared with Midland's riches. Editorial Comment, Page 18; Letters, Page 19</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ying Qian (2019 6197)] </F>   [Text] Washington, 2 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a  gathering of businessmen hosted by the U.S.-China Business  Council on the afternoon of 2 May, Chinese Vice Premier Zou  Jiahua, who is paying an official visit to the United States,  said: International economic competition, as seen in fierce  rivalry for market shares, has become increasingly heated. New  opportunities and new challenges keep presenting themselves one  after another. Under these circumstances, it behooves both  China and the United States to seize the opportune moment by  pushing vigorously for exchanges and cooperation in the fields  of economy, trade, and science and technology.    Introducing China's current state of reform, opening up to  the outside world, and economic development, Zou Jiahua said:  Last year saw China's reform, opening up to the outside world,  and modernization drive move forward rapidly. The gross  domestic product of the year was up 13.4 percent over the  previous year in comparable prices, and it was the highest  annual increase since 1985. The rapid growth of China's economy  has driven reform and opening up to accelerate and overseas  investment in China to soar. In 1992, overseas investment  actually used increased 160 percent and the figure in 1993 was  up 91.5 percent over 1992.    He said: In developing its economy, China should rely on its  own strength as well as on international cooperation. Opening  up to the outside world has long become China's basic policy.  Henceforth, China will keep unswervingly to the policy of  opening up to the outside world. He quoted Deng Xiaoping as  saying: China's opening up policy will not change this century,  nor in the first or second 50 years of the next century. It is  hard for anyone to attempt a change. China's door is sure to  open up even wider and we will do a better job.    Zou Jiahua said: An all-directional pattern of openness  linking the coast with the hinterland across China is taking  shape. "We are ready to develop economic and technological  cooperation and exchanges with all friendly countries and people  from all walks of life on the basis of equality and mutual  benefit."    He said: Cooperation can take many forms. We welcome people  of insight to develop trade with China, but hope to see more of  them come to China to invest and set up their own factories, to  enter into partnership with Chinese enterprises or to transfer  technology, and to jointly explore China's market.    He expressed the hope that foreign investment would conform  to the requirements of China's general direction for economic  development, adding that China welcomes investors to invest in  the fields of energy, transportation, telecommunications,  agriculture, and water conservancy for now and in the years to  come.    Zou Jiahua pointed out: An outstanding feature of the  changed international situation is that all countries have given  their top priority to economic development. The Asia-Pacific  region, by maintaining the best growth records for years  running, has caught attention in the world. At the same time,  international economic competition, as seen in fierce rivalry  for market shares, has become increasingly heated. New  opportunities and new challenges are everywhere. Under such  circumstances, China and the United States should seize the  opportune moment by vigorously pushing for exchanges and  cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, and science and  technology. This is not only in the fundamental interest of the  peoples of the two countries, but will help promote peace,  stability, prosperity, and progress in the world.    He said: In recent years, Sino-U.S. relations have  encountered many difficulties. However, through the cooperation  and efforts of business circles of the two countries, the  bilateral trade, mutual investment, and economic and  technological cooperation have maintained a powerful developing  trend. In 1993, Sino-U.S. trade volume reached $27.65 billion,  increasing more than 10 times over 1979, when the two countries  established diplomatic relations, with China's imports from the  United States up 20.1 percent over the previous year. The  United States has continuously maintained its place as China's  third largest trade partner. In terms of investment volume, the  United States still leads other foreign countries. By the end  of last year, the cumulative value of U.S. investment in China  had totalled $11 billion, and the number of U.S. funded projects  surpassed 8,000. Most of those investment items have achieved  success and produced good economic benefits. Facts have shown  that it is entirely possible for countries of different social  systems and ideologies to actively develop economic and  technological cooperation to the benefit of both sides.    Zou Jiahua pointed out: There are broad prospects for  further developing economic and trade relations between China  and the United States, and there is great potential in bilateral  trade. Every year China imports from the United States large  quantities of wheat, aircraft, computers, chemical fertilizers,  cotton, paper, pulp, machinery, electronic equipment, and  equipment for the chemical and petroleum industries.    He said: With the continuous development of the economy, the  demand of China's domestic market will expand further. It is  expected that from now to 2000, China will import $1 trillion  worth of commodities. However, competition among various  countries in the Chinese market is very intense. Advanced  technology and equipment and fine service alone are far from  enough. They must be accompanied by a long-term, stable, and  friendly environment for cooperation in the economic and trade  field.    He emphatically pointed out: The annual dispute over the MFN  status indeed seriously obstructs [yan zhong gan rao 0917 6850  1626 2371] the development of economic and trade relations  between the two countries. The mutual granting of MFN status is  the foundation for developing economic and trade relations  between the two countries. If this is undermined, it will do  harm to the economies and trade of the two countries and to the  interests of their consumers. The governments of the two  countries have the responsibility to encourage and support  business people of the two countries to conduct mutually  beneficial cooperation, thus creating favorable conditions for  expanding economic cooperation and trade between the two  countries.    Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's speech was enthusiastically  welcomed by some 100 people attending the meeting.    On 2 May, Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the national  committee of the United States-China Business Council, met with  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and hosted a reception party for his  Chinese guest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rank van Zijl and Milja de Zwart: "It Was a </F> Progressive Emasculation of Men"]    [Excerpt] On Thursday [26 May], the formation of the new  government was pushed to the background for a day at the  Netherlands Parliament. Politicians and journalists were  preparing for what was generally considered to be unavoidable:  The imminent resignation of Interior Minister Van Thijn of the  Labor Party and of Justice Minister Hirsch Ballin of the  Christian Democratic Appeal.    Back in April, Hirsch Ballin stayed at his post for  so-called  reasons of "national interest." National interest again seems  to be the only term which could be used to explain Ministers Van  Thijn and Hirsch Ballin being allowed to keep their jobs in the  outgoing government.    In the deciding motion during the IRT [Interregional  Investigation Team] debate on Wednesday evening, it seemed that  the Parliament felt that Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn had only  made the situation worse. They cast doubt on the credibility of  politicians and the police. As the government itself is to  leave office (the members have already offered their resignation  to the Queen) there was no motion of no-confidence. [passage  omitted]</p>

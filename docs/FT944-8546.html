			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Maker of Reliant in receivership: Bad debts cripple Beans Industries Beans Industries, the automotive component maker and manufacturer of the three-wheeled Reliant Robin car and Scimitar sports car, has run out of cash. The directors of Beans on Thursday evening asked their bankers to call in Mr Mark Hopton and Mr Roger Oldfield of KPMG Peat Marwick, Birmingham, as receivers. The group's failure comes when demand for its products had increased to the extent that it recently introduced overtime working at its car plant in Tamworth, Staffordshire, and its engineering works in Tipton, West Midlands. The receivers plan to sell Beans as a going concern. Beans, founded in 1919, won a place in motor history with its pre-second world war construction of a world land speed record holder, the Thunderbolt. It acquired Reliant from the receivers in 1991 and produced a restyled Scimitar in 1992. It was once part of the old British Leyland group, Rover's precursor. Mr Oldfield said yesterday that Beans had bad debts of nearly Pounds 2m which had 'a dramatic effect on cashflow'. In the year to December 1992, the last for which accounts are available, Beans had a turnover of Pounds 15.1m. The debts date back three years and stem from the failure of AWD, the Bedford truck manufacturer, and Leyland Daf Vans, both of which called in receivers. Although these companies have since been resurrected, there were not sufficient funds to pay unsecured creditors such as Beans. 'Beans had been working for nothing,' said Mr Oldfield. He added: 'The directors went to the bankers for more money. They were unable to comply with the request.' Mr Oldfield refused to name the bankers. The 1992 accounts show that Beans had long-term debt of Pounds 3.37m, however. Mr Hopton said he had received half a dozen inquiries from people who had already been in preliminary talks with the company's management. Beans is making up to 15 Reliant cars a week. Its 95 employees at Tamworth also turn out five Pounds 15,000, two-seater Scimitars every week. Beans' customers for automotive components include Rover, Automotive Products and GKN. Yesterday both customers and suppliers telephoned the Tipton works 'seeking comfort', as Mr Oldfield put it.</p>

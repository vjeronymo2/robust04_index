			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets ended a busy week with a calmer session yesterday although stock index futures trading was characterised by volatility writes Joel Kibazo. A squeeze at the opening sent the March Footsie contract forward to touch the 2,600 level, encouraged by firm gilts and currencies markets. Sellers then emerged mid-morning causing March to give up earlier gains. The contract continued to drift lower, paying no heed to UK inflation figures that were in line with market expectations, until early afternoon. Sporadic buying was then noted as dealers anticipated a firm opening on Wall Street. When this did not materialise, March once again retreated. March closed at 2,576, up 8 on the previous session and some 17 points above its fair value estimated premium to cash of 23. Turnover reached 6,837, down on levels seen for most of the week. In traded options, turnover reached 36,554 lots. Marks &amp; Spencer was the busiest stock option trading a hefty 5,241 contracts with the April 300 calls the busiest series. Analysts have come to the view that the Christmas and post-Christmas sales figures at the group are likely to be ahead of earlier predictions.</p>

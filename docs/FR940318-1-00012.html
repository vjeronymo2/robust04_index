			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This commenter states that, when these items are taken into consideration, service data gathered on this ball valve are ``unambiguous,'' because if the valve passes a leak check, it means that the valve did not leak before the check was conducted. However, the subject Shaw Aero valve is located in the service panel and is accessible to maintenance personnel; moreover, it is common practice for those personnel to change the seals in the panel valve prior to leak check intervals. Therefore, the leak check service data that have been presented relative to this Shaw Aero valve are ``questionable,'' due to the lack of reporting and the fact that seals can be changed out during servicing and prior to the leak checks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with either commenter's request. The FAA has reviewed the design improvements and service history data of the Shaw Aero valves having part number 10101000C&hyph;N (or higher dash number) and has determined that a leak check interval of 1,000 flight hours is justifiable, based upon the best available data to date. The FAA does agree with the latter commenter to the extent that justification for any further extension of this leak check interval beyond 1,000 flight hours must be based on unambiguous data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Kaiser Expander Valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters submitted service history data on the Kaiser Expander valve, part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8, and request that the proposed rule provide for a leak check interval of 4,000 or 4,500 flight hours for this valve. As currently written, the proposed rule would place the Kaiser Expander valve in the category of valves requiring leak checks every 200 flight hours. These commenters state that the Kaiser Expander valve has the same positive bore sealing inner flap as the Shaw Aero valve, and has a service history to prove it is as safe, rugged, and reliable as the Shaw Aero valve. Some of these commenters consider this Kaiser valve to be the ``best that is currently available,'' and note that it had been approved previously as terminating action for AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs that the leak check interval for the Kaiser Expander valve, part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8 (or higher dash number), may be increased from the proposed 200 flight hours. The FAA has reviewed the service history data for the Kaiser Expander valve and finds that it is sufficient to justify a 1,000-flight hour leak check interval proposed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2)(ii) of this supplemental NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Brands of Valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other commenters suggest that the proposal be revised to increase the leak test intervals to 400 flight hours for the ``other valves'' referred to in proposed paragraph (a)(3) of the previous supplemental NPRM; and to allow that interval to be increased up to 5,000 flight hours (an average ``C'' check). These commenters consider that a 200-flight hour interval is too frequent and would create an undue economic burden on affected operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For many of the same reasons previously discussed, the FAA does not concur. The FAA does not consider that valves without demonstrated high reliability should be used without frequent leak checking. Frequent leak checking provides assurance that the valves will be returned to a non-leaking condition. The FAA has recognized that some valves in the ``other'' category (such as the earlier Shaw Aero valve models) do have better service history than others regarding failure and leakage; therefore, as described previously, the FAA has singled out these valves and has extended their leak check interval. However, for valves that are known to be more likely to leak, specifically the ``donut'' and ``taco'' valves, a 200-flight hour leak check interval is essential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to grant other brand name valves extended leak check intervals. However, these commenters did not furnish sufficient service history or leak check data to substantiate their requests. The FAA cannot determine if extensions of leak check intervals are warranted without being able to review significant service history data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Operators With No Record of Leakage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggests that the proposed rule include a provision for an extended leak check interval for operators that have had no record of waste water leakage, regardless of what hardware configuration is used. The commenter considers that the proposal penalizes operators who have had an excellent service history due to proper maintenance and servicing. While the installation of additional hardware will improve the waste system and reduce the likelihood of leaking, it should be used as an incentive for those operators that have had a history of leaking waste systems and blue ice foreign object damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not agree that an extended interval is warranted for the reasons suggested by the commenter. Blue ice frequently is not traceable to the particular airplane, operator, and waste system that produced it. Incidents of leakage usually are not reported; only the relatively serious leakage incidents become known to the FAA. Previous attempts to rely solely upon increased maintenance while using lower reliability hardware have not proven to be successful. Therefore, a system to prevent incidents of blue ice in the fleet must be based upon assurance. The FAA considers that such assurance is provided by frequent leak checks to ensure that the drain systems do not leak; more reliable valves may be subject to less frequent leak checks, while less reliable valves must be subject to more frequent leak checks. As discussed previously, the FAA considers that maintenance and training are also important factors in determining appropriate leak check intervals, and has provided in this supplemental NPRM an option for either increased leak test intervals, or obtaining approval for less frequent intervals when hardware is demonstrated to be reliable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for No Leak Tests for Some Valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requests that, in cases where a ball valve is installed with a service panel valve that has no inner flapper, the proposed rule not require a leak check to be done on the service panel valve. The commenter also requests that the proposed rule be revised to require that, when a service panel valve with an inner door having a second positive seal is installed with a ball valve, only the inner seal be tested, and the outer cap seal be visually inspected and replaced as necessary. The commenter notes that the proposed rule would call for a pressure differential to be applied across both the ball valve and the service panel cap valve. However, on many ball valve installations, the service panel cap has no inner flapper. Applying a pressure differential across this cap would require spilling a substantial quantity of fluid on the ramp in order to service the system after completion of the leak check. The commenter recommends that the service panel cap valve only be leak checked if it incorporates a dual seal design, and that the outer cap be visually inspected for wear or damage, and replaced only as necessary or at predetermined intervals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not agree with the commenter's request to delete the leak check requirement for service panel valves that have no inner flapper. This would be disadvantageous to operators who had a superior hardware configuration (the dual seal), since it would require that they perform a test that is not required of installations with only a single cap. However, the FAA does agree with the suggestion to require a leak check of only the inner flapper for service panel valves with a dual seal design, and the performance of visual inspections/seal changes of only the outer cap. This will ensure that one seal downstream of the ball valve is returned to a ``no-leak'' condition. This supplemental NPRM has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

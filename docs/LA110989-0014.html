			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS ISN'T KID-GLOVE TIME  </P> <P> Senators are entitled to respect for what they are -- moving parts in the  machinery of democracy. But they are not entitled to kid-glove treatment for  just anything they do. There are now enough serious questions about precisely  why four senators met with the chief savings and loan regulator on April 2,  1987, for the Senate's Select Committee on Ethics to abandon the kid gloves and  get answers to those questions. If it requires appointment of an independent  counsel, the committee should not hesitate.  </P> <P> Two elements have honed the edge on the questions the committee needs to ask.  One is testimony by Edwin J. Gray, who was then chairman of the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board. The other is some apparent shifting around in the recollection  of one participant in the meeting, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), of what went  on during the meeting.  </P> <P> Gray contends that the senators wanted him to withdraw a regulation that was  opposed by Charles H. Keating Jr., former head of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan or  Irvine and a major campaign contributor to Cranston, and Sens. Dennis DeConcini  (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio).  </P> <P> Cranston originally said he was astonished that Gray would say such a thing;  later he said that there might have been some such discussion. Cranston also  said the Gray either misunderstood what happened at the meeting or made up his  version.  </P> <P> What is involved here goes beyond the question of who is telling the truth and  who is not. What is wanted is a far sharper picture of the relationships  between politicians and savings banks during years when the banks squandered  billions of dollars, money that taxpayers will spend years making up. We may be  old-fashioned, but getting that picture would seem to be worth any trouble the  Ethics committee might have to go to.  </P></p>

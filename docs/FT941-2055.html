			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Japanese rate of growth at 20-year low Japan's economy stagnated last year, with a 0.1 per cent rise in gross domestic product, the government announced yesterday. This was the worst performance since 1974, just after the first oil price shock. The figures follow a 2.2 per cent decline in the final quarter of 1993 compared to the same period of the previous year. This decline was not as bad as the market expected. Private sector economists in Tokyo said the quarterly drop might be the bottom of an economic downturn which has lasted since mid-1991, the longest in post-war history. GDP rose by a revised 1.1 per cent in 1992, down from 4.3 per cent in the previous year. The Economic Planning Agency, the government's official economic forecaster, was cautious yesterday. There were bright signs, such as an increase in personal consumption, but it was too early to say for sure whether the recession had come out of the trough, said Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, the agency's vice minister. The EPA's caution is understandable, given the criticism it attracted early last year, when it declared an upturn and was proved wrong. 'This is at least the end of the decline, but there is still no sign of an upturn because of a continued decline in investment in plant and equipment and the strength of the yen,' said Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute. 'I am prepared to bet this is the bottom of the cycle,' said Mr Jim Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. Mr Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of the Japan Renewal party, which is the main influence on government economic policy, believed the economy would recover in the second half of this year to stabilise at a growth rate of around 3 per cent for the rest of the decade. However, analysts warned that recovery prospects could be damaged by the political impasse over the 1994 budget, which could delay extra government spending and income tax cuts. Recent increases in Japan's long term interest rates could also hamper recovery, warned Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo. Personal consumption rose by 1.1 per cent last year, or by 0.7 per cent between the third and fourth quarters, indicating that consumer spending has been relatively resilient to the weak labour market. In another bright sign, private housing investment grew by 3.7 per cent during the year, or 1.8 per cent in the last quarter, helped by cheap government-backed mortgages. On the gloomy side, corporate investment fell by 8.4 per cent last year, of which 3.5 per cent was in the final quarter. The continued strength in the yen, which hit a record high of nearly Y100 to the US dollar in August, has hit exports, which were down 2.2 per cent from the third to the fourth quarters.</p>

In your assessment in what aspect  Vietnam's relations with Malaysia can be further improved: Are  you satisfied with the current state of relations between the  two countries? What are the obstacles to enhancing the  relationship, if any? In conjunction with your visit can we  expect Vietnam and Malaysia to sign new agreements for new areas  of mutual cooperation to enhance the already excellent ties  between the two countries?    [Do Muoi] In the past time, the relations of friendship and  multifaceted cooperation between our two countries have seen  fine developments. I'm satisfied with the harmonious  developments in economic as well as political relations between  our two countries. The two countries have exchanged many  high-level delegations and signed many cooperative agreements,  creating favourable political and legal basis for the  development and expansion of cooperation on various fields in  accordance with the potential of each country.    At the invitation of H.E. [His Excellency] Dr Mohamad  Mahathir, prime minister of Malaysia, I'Il conduct an official  and friendship visit to Malaysia. The main objectives of this  visit are to study Malaysian precious experiences in  socio-economic development, to consolidate and further  strengthen mutual understanding and trust, thereby contributing  to the more effective development of the cooperative  relationship between our two countries. This will create  favourable conditions for concerned agencies of the two  countries to strengthen and expand the existing cooperation in  various fields, meeting the aspiration and interests of the  peoples of our two countries. My visit this time doesn't aim at  signing concrete cooperative agreement, which is under the  competence of the two states.    [Correspondent] Your Excellency, you were once quoted in a  newspaper article that you encourage party and government  officials to travel abroad and bring home experience to turn  Vietnam into a strong country with rich people.    In this context, do you think Malaysia can also play a role  towards helping Vietnam achieve that objective?    Can we also reverse the scenario. In what way can Vietnam  help Malaysia share Vietnam's expertise in certain fields?    [Do Muoi] Vietnam attaches importance to the research and  proper application of good experiences of the world under our  own circumstances in order to build a Vietnam of `rich people,  strong nation, just and civilized society'. The achievements in  the renewal process of Vietnam over the past years recognized by  the world community have also proved that we have combined  harmoniously the national self-reliance and the trend of  cooperation for development in the present era.    Vietnam and Malaysia are geographically close and share many  similarities in culture as well as traditional practice and  customs. Malaysia has carried out excellently its strategy of  socio-economic development and has drawn many precious  experiences, which are highly appreciated internationally. At  present, Malaysia ranks second among ASEAN investors in Vietnam.  I am fully confident that, provided with these factors,  Malaysia will play a deserving role in helping Vietnam build and  develop the country in accordance with the good relationship  between the two countries. On our part, we're ready to exchange  views with Malaysia on questions of Malaysian concern in the  spirit of friendship, trust and cooperation for the prosperity  of our respective country and for the common wealth of Southeast  Asia.    [Correspondent] Finally, Your Excellency, what is your  vision  of Southeast Asia and Asia as a whole in the near future?    [Do Muoi] Peace and development which are the age-old  aspiration of nations are now becoming more and more imperative  need of all countries in the world. Southeast Asia has never  enjoyed favourable conditions as it does at present for the  cooperation among countries in the spirit of understanding and  friendship in an effort to achieve their common goal of  maintaining peace stability and creating an international  environment favourable for the development of their individual  countries and the region as a whole. Prompted by this spirit,  Vietnam has signed the Bali Treaty of Amity and Cooperation,  become an ASEAN observer and is now participating in a number of  ASEAN commissions and projects, preparing for its admission to  ASEAN when conditions are ripe. Vietnam will also participate  in the ASEAN Regional Forum on Security held in Bangkok. We  support the Malaysian initiative for the East Asia Economic  Forum.    A prosperous Southeast Asia is not only an indispensable  condition for the construction of each country but also a very  important factor for peace, stability in Asia-Pacific as a  whole, a centre which is drawing much attention from the world  community for its dynamics and great prospects in the 21st  century.    For Vietnam, strengthening its cooperation with other  countries in Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific is of special  importance. Our foreign policy enjoys warm sympathy and  response from Malaysia and other countries. We are striving for  a consistent objective, that is to maintain durable peace for  national development cooperation, making considerable  contribution to prosperity of the region and of the world as a  whole.</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / 'Threat' to advertising industry ADVERTISING agencies could face an exodus of key staff, off to find richer pickings from competitors once the recession lifts, according to a study of the industry by accountants Arthur Andersen. The survey - which questioned 180 individuals in 18 UK agencies - said 73 per cent of agencies believed their employees understood their 'benefits' yet only 26 per cent of employees could put a cash value on them. 'More than 80 per cent of employers claim to use personal interviews for communicating about pay and reward, but only 42 per cent of employees say they participate in these'. A further finding is that only 16 per cent of agencies made a direct link between individual performance and reward while 87 per cent of employees who felt there was no link would like one. Andersen warns that staff may switch to agencies where terms of employment are better explained. Even though agencies' profitability have suffered badly in the recession, the company car is still a dominant feature of agency life, with more than 90 per cent of those participating in the survey driving one.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- China's steel giant, the  Capital Iron and Steel Works (Shougang), employs 207 foreign  professionals from Russia, Ukraine, the U.S., Japan, Canada and  Germany.    Some 85 percent of them are senior engineers or experts in  metallurgy, mechanics, architecture, finance, management and  environmental protection.    Shougang is a pioneer enterprise in China's economic  restructuring. It has developed into a transnational  conglomerate, with 260,000 employees.    It provides a good working and living environment for the  experts. It has built special apartments for them, their  spouses and children. Offices, research equipment, testing  facilities and computers are all available for them. There is  also a special entertainment center for them.    The foreign professionals have made great contributions to  the development of Shougang. In 1993 foreign experts completed  35 programs for the works, producing nearly 100 million yuan in  earnings.    In order to raise its management level Shougang intends to  hire prominent foreign entrepreneurs, financiers and bankers in  the near future.</p>

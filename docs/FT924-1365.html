			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Letter: Prof Godley's uncanny record of economic forecasting Sir, Professor Wynne Godley's forecasting record stretches beyond having been uncannily right about Britain's balance of payments, unemployment and growth in the 1980s (Monday Interview, December 14). In 1972, when editor of the OECD's Economic Outlook (and hence responsible for forecasting), I was visited by Prof Godley, who predicted that the OECD area would soon face a massive term of trade deterioration, with serious consequences for inflation and real incomes. The hypothesis struck me, and several of my colleagues with whom I checked it, as utterly implausible - the terms of trade had hardly moved for some 15 to 20 years and even if they were going to worsen on this occasion, the impact of any change could only be small. I wish I had listened to him - the OECD secretariat would have been able to warn member countries more forcefully of the impending 1973 inflation instead of underestimating it by the then very large margin of nearly 4 percentage points.

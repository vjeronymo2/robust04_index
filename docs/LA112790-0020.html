			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: CONTEMPO CASUALS CEO TO HEAD THRIFTY DRUG CHAIN  </P> <P> Thrifty Corp. has named Eve A. Rich, chairman and chief executive of Contempo  Casuals women's clothing stores, to lead its Thrifty Drug chain, which has  faced stiff competition in recent years.  </P> <P> Rich, 49, will assume the position of president at the 577-store drug chain on  Dec. 3.  </P> <P> The position is a new one at Thrifty, whose stores are located mostly in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Rich had been at Los Angeles-based Contempo Casuals, a division of Neiman  Marcus Group Inc., for 10 years. Her duties will be assumed by Bernard  Zeichner, Contempo's president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> "We are extremely pleased to acquire an executive with such experience, a  successful track record in the retailing industry and extensive knowledge of  the Southern California specialty retailing market," said Daniel A. Seigel,  president and chief operating officer of Thrifty Corp. in a statement.  </P> <P> In August, Seigel replaced Richard G. Eils as president of Thrifty Corp., which  also owns Big 5 sporting goods and other retailing operations that total nearly  1,000 stores and about $3 billion in revenue. Eils, who had been president for  10 years, resigned to "pursue other interests," the company said.  </P> <P> Profit at Thrifty Corp., which is a subsidiary of Pacific Enterprises, has been  hurt in recent years by various factors, including price-slashing wars with  such rivals as Sav-On drugstores.  </P> <P> To improve earnings, Thrifty has said it will close 50 to 100 poorly performing  drugstores and sporting goods outlets during the next two years. As a result of  these and other cost-cutting moves, Pacific Enterprises wrote down $100 million  in Thrifty assets in the second quarter of this year. JESUS SANCHEZ  </P></p>

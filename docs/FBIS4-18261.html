			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Eyup Asik, Motherland Party [ANAP] whip, said  that the tricks and fraud involved in the local elections of  last Sunday [27 March] had not been seen in any elections since  1950, and that the justice minister is mainly responsible for  this.    At a news conference in parliament, Asik charged that just  before the election schedule was announced, the justice minister  replaced the leaders of the Justice Committees in 49 provinces.  The Justice Committees appoint election officials.    Asik pointed out that in all the places where there was  fraud, the Social Democratic Populist Party and the Prosperity  Party contested the positions. The great majority of the votes  found in garbage dumps, he charged, were votes for ANAP.    Asik stressed that the government parties lost close to 15  percent of their vote. This shows that the people do not like  the government policies, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

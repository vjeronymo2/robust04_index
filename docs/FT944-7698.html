			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market 'could absorb' IMF sales The international gold market could easily absorb sales from the International Monetary Fund of the order recently proposed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, a leading gold banker said yesterday. Mr Robert Guy, a director of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, said Mr Clarke's plan for the IMF to sell up to 10 per cent of its gold stocks to create a fund to ease the debt burdens of poor developing countries was practical. 'The gold market could easily absorb an additional supply of 320 tonnes from the IMF provided the sales are spread over a reasonable period,' Mr Guy said. He told the third City of London Central Banking Conference, that the chancellor's proposed sales would be easier for the market to manage than the last IMF gold sales in the 1970s. The last IMF gold sale programme was larger, totalling more than 700 tonnes, and the Fund was competing as a seller with the US Treasury and some other IMF members who had gold returned to them by the Fund. This time 'there would be no parallel sales either by the US Treasury or as a consequence of restitution', Mr Guy said. Moreover, the gold market has since become much larger, coping last year with total supply of 3,257 tonnes, compared with 1,765 tonnes in 1979, and more sophisticated, with a greater number of professional dealers able to handle an auction process, he added.  --------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium         -19,625  to  1,888,550 Aluminium alloy       +40  to     26,720 Copper             -1,500  to    321,725 Lead               -1,750  to    359,875 Nickel                +30  to    150,462 Zinc               -1,625  to  1,210,500 Tin                   +50  to     29,045  ---------------------------------------</p>

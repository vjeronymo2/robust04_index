			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRATE WITH CORN AND CHILES  </P> <P> Celebrate Cinco de Mayo with a dish that glorifies two staples of traditional  Mexican cooking: corn and chiles.  </P> <P> The city of Puebla is the site of the battle commemorated by this Mexican  holiday. Therefore, this festive dish employs poblano (Puebla style) chiles.  The chiles are stuffed with corn kernels combined with Mexican style cheeses.  Cinnamon and cloves add a delicate spice flavor.  </P> <P> For accompaniments, choose foods that are typical of Mexico -- beans and rice,  salsa and tortillas.  </P> <P> CORN-STUFFED CHILES  </P> <P> 1/4 cup butter  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, finely chopped  </P> <P> 5 whole cloves  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 4 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups plus 1/3 cup Mexican cream (crema) or sour cream  </P> <P> 14 ounces queso fresco or ricotta  </P> <P> 6 ounces asadero cheese or mozzarella, cut into small pieces  </P> <P> 12 poblano chiles, roasted and peeled  </P> <P> 3 to 4 ounces Chihuahua or mild Cheddar cheese, grated  </P> <P> Heat butter in medium saucepan. Add onion, cloves and cinnamon and cook gently  until onion is tender but not browned. Remove and discard cloves. Add corn  kernels and salt. If using fresh corn, add 1/3 cup water. Cook over medium heat  20 minutes for fresh corn, 10 minutes for frozen corn. Add 1/3 cup Mexican  cream and cook 10 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.  Combine queso fresco, asadero cheese and 1/3 cup Mexican cream. Add half the  corn mixture, mix well and set aside.  </P> <P> Cut a small slit in one side of each chile. Rinse carefully to remove seeds and  veins. Do not remove stems. Stuff chiles with corn-cheese mixture. Chiles  should be plump but must close at slit. Heat remaining cream. Place chiles side  by side in round baking dish 12 inches in diameter and 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep  or in other shallow baking dish. Pour cream over chiles and sprinkle with  Chihuahua cheese. Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees until chiles are  heated through and cheese is melted, about 45 minutes. Reheat remaining corn  mixture. Use to garnish chiles or serve on the side as a relish.  </P> <P> Makes 12 servings.  </P> <P> Food styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miroslav Mikuljanac: "A Stall on the Brotherly </F> Soil"]    [Text] The Russians have returned. Two Russian  parliamentary delegations are traveling around Serbia, taking  stock of the situation and making promises. The larger  15-member delegation is visiting officials without much pomp,  keeping company with the communists, and, at least publicly,  does not seem to have any major ambitions. The other  five-member delegation has been visiting all the Serbian lands  in the company of local non-parliamentary right-wing parties  with considerable media attention, promising everything that  could please the Serbian ear.    To make matters more confusing, the smaller delegation  actually represents the forces that won the majority at the last  elections but not the power. It consists of two vice presidents  of Aleksandr [as published] Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia, one communist (an astronaut), and two  independent deputies, one of which is a veteran from  Afghanistan. The malicious people would also add that they only  lack a fire eater and a trapeze artist. Those who are more  cautious know that the party representatives that won the  majority of the several millions of votes in Russia should not  be compared to a circus, regardless of the reception held for  them and their preferred style of appearance.    However, the treatment that this small group from a large  country is receiving in Serbia is truly worldly. The media  follow them carefully, halls packed with people greet them with  ovations, they have comfortable cars, and allegedly an airplane  as well. If only the official authorities would have paid a  little more attention to them.... They are much more prepared  for public appearances than their colleagues who, equally well  received, have visited "the brotherly Serbian land" in previous  years. Now they know precisely what we need and what would be  good to promise.    The most active member of this group, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy  (the first man after Zhirinovskiy), is a decent stand in for his  chief. "You are the first line of our defense," he said in  Pirot. "Russia is a great market for your products," he  announced in Bijelo Polje. "We will stop the supply of gas to  Europe and bring it to you," he promised in Zemun. To the  ecstatic Serbs in Pristina, he explained that Kosovo is "an old  Serbian land and that a plan for its defense and protection is  being prepared in Russia together with four brigades of  soldiers."    Besides all the nice promises, there are also some other  ambitions: "Our visit is a sign that Russia is returning to the  Balkans and that we will never leave it again," was stated in  Belgrade. Beside the four brigades for Kosovo, naval support  from Boka has also been proposed, while the aforementioned gas  would arrive at the Serbian borders in tanks, it was said.    As opposed to the larger delegation, this smaller one is  pronouncedly anti-Yeltsin in its orientation; perhaps here lies  the reason why the official authorities, at least at first  glance, do not ascribe much importance to it. However, knowing  that the host of the five-member group is the Serbian National  Renewal party (which has been accused for years of having close  relations with the police) and that (unconfirmed) Braca Karic  (which also helped the Serbian Radical Party until Seselj's  break with Milosevic) is financing their visit, things look a  little different.    The chronologists of political events, prone to fantasy,  have  a simple explanation: The Serbian authorities need support,  even if only verbal. However, it is not appropriate to  officially host the most fervent of Yeltsin's opponents at the  same time. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy needs money for the  realization of his visions outlined in the Last Jump to the  South (a book promoted in Zemun during the visit) in order to  carry out the actions of matching the executive power to the  electoral results. Belgrade, in this sense, represents a  crossroad on the way to the Indian Ocean, and a crossroad  without stalls is not much of an attraction.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  We Only Need Love </H5>   As opposed to Zhirinovskiy's visit, when Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia President Mirko Jovic and Zeljko Raznjatovic  Arkan arrived at the reception with Patriarch Pavle unannounced  and with the help of their elbows, the visit to the Serbian  church head the day before yesterday passed much more  peacefully. Witnesses emphasize that the patriarch was much  more balanced than the hosts of the Russian delegation and that  to the announcement of all-encompassing brotherly aid, he  diplomatically replied that the biggest assistance that could be  given to Serbia is -- love.    However, incidents were not in short supply. At the news  conference, Vengerovskiy said to a correspondent of the Russian  NOVOSTI that upon his return to the country, he will check his  report and that "perhaps there will be no need for him to return  from Yugoslavia at all."

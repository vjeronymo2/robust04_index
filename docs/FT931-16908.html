			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Strong growth at Lloyd's continues INSURANCE rates and premium income continued to move strongly upwards at Lloyd's of London during the final quarter of last year, the latest survey of trends in the insurance market reports. The increases are expected to continue over the next three months, according to the quarterly survey of a sample of 25 leading underwriters. Over the past quarter, 85 per cent of the sample recorded a rise in rates, and none said rates fell. There were also no falls in premium income among the sample - 83 per cent said income rose over the quarter and 17 per cent said it stayed the same. Looking forward to the first quarter of this year, 87 per cent of the underwriters expected rates to continue to increase, while the other 13 per cent predicted that they would remain stable. A total of 89 per cent expected income to rise, and 11 per cent said it would stay the same. None of those surveyed expected a fall to the end of the year. However, syndicate expenses also rose in the final quarter of 1992. Forty per cent of the underwriters recorded increases, 49 per cent no change and only 11 per cent a fall. Some 43 per cent expected the rise to continue into the first quarter of 1993.</p>

LARRY WAN  SPENT $32,674 AND WAS ELECTED, THE SECOND-HIGHEST VOTE GETTER.  </P> <P> A land-use attorney who spent $33,700 of his own money topped the list of  campaign spenders in a losing bid to gain a seat on Malibu's future City  Council.  </P> <P> Paul Shoop, who declined to accept campaign contributions en route to a  10th-place finish among 30 candidates in the June election, spent nearly three  times as much as top vote-getter Walt Keller, according to records filed with  the county.  </P> <P> Keller, the former co-chairman of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation, spent  $11,400 in the campaign.  </P> <P> The group's other former co-chairwoman, Carolyn Van Horn, who finished fourth  to claim a seat on the five-member council, spent only $6,703, the least of any  of the winners.  </P> <P> The disclosures, required by law, showed that many of the candidates dipped  heavily into their own pockets in a bid to win a seat on the council at the  same time voters overwhelmingly approved Malibu becoming a city.  </P> <P> Besides Shoop, only two other candidates spent more than $20,000 on the  campaign, and about half the candidates spent $1,000 or less, records show.  </P> <P> Larry Wan, the former head of the Malibu Township Council who finished second,  was the second-highest spender, with $32,674, including $24,000 from his own  pocket. Real estate broker Richard Idler was the other big spender, with  $28,399. He finished 12th.  </P> <P> The other winners, third-place finisher Mike Caggiano, and Missy Zeitsoff, who  was fifth, followed Idler on the spending list, with $18,824 and $13,679,  respectively.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, as of last week, the only organized group to oppose incorporation  had not filed campaign disclosure forms that were due July 31, county election  officials said.  </P> <P> An official of Concerned Citizens for the Protection of Malibu's Future called  the matter an oversight and said that the group intended to submit its records  soon.  </P> <P> "I've been out of town for about a month and, as a result, we haven't filed,  but we fully intend to do so soon," said Margaret Richards, the group's  treasurer.  </P> <P> Richards said the group, which organized about three weeks before the June 5  election, "probably spent something on the order of $2,100. It wasn't much  money."  </P> <P> Cityhood supporters had accused the group of engaging in a last-minute campaign  of deception and said it was a front for real estate developers concerned that  cityhood would restrict growth.  </P> <P> Its cause was not helped by disclosures that neither Richards nor Glenn Heller,  the group's chairman, were eligible to vote in the election.  </P> <P> Heller, a caterer, moved to Malibu three months before the election and said he  was registered to vote in Los Angeles. Richards, a Malibu resident for 15  years, is a citizen of Canada. She owns a Santa Monica advertising agency.  </P> <P> Although opponents of cityhood had little success attracting money or votes,  the Malibu Committee for Incorporation had little trouble with either in  sailing toward cityhood.  </P> <P> The group reported having spent $99,715 on behalf of incorporation. In the  election, 84% of the voters supported cityhood.  </P> <P> Among those donating money to the group were celebrities Herb Alpert, Mel  Brooks, Olivia Newton-John, Henry Mancini, Bob Newhart, Carroll O'Connor,  George C. Scott, James Whitmore and Burgess Meredith.  </P> <P> Despite spending enough money to give them high name recognition, Shoop and  Idler were targets of negative newspaper ads by cityhood supporters, which  portrayed them as having something to gain by Malibu's remaining an  unincorporated part of the county.  </P></p>

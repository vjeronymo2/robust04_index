			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Stepping in where others fear to tread: Richard Lapper examines the rationale behind Zurich Insurance's latest deal in the UK market Senior British insurance managers are prone to scratch their heads when asked about the logic behind the latest deal in the UK by Zurich Insurance of Switzerland, completed last week after months of negotiations. Zurich, Europe's fourth-biggest insurance company, has taken over much of the business of Municipal Mutual, the insurer owned by local authorities which withdrew from the market last year. It had been hit by claims arising from cases of arson in schools and accidents involving council employees injured at work. Zurich is setting up a subsidiary, Zurich Municipal, to handle the accounts of more than half Britain's councils. On the surface, there might not seem much to commend the deal to the financially strong Swiss group. But closer examination shows the business logic behind the painstaking talks. Neither side is prepared to disclose the price, but in return for what, in the context of some recent European deals, appears to be a relatively modest sum, Zurich has won access to about Pounds 300m a year in premium income, and perhaps as much as 3 per cent of the entire UK insurance market. More significantly the takeover gives Zurich the chance to develop its innovative approach towards commercial insurance in the UK market. Rather than the 'all products to all men' attitude favoured by traditional insurers, Zurich focuses on the development of long-term relationships with particular groups of commercial customers. The company aims to provide a range of services to reduce risks and thereby the likelihood of insurance claims. If successful the MMI deal and could serve as a model for expansion in areas of the insurance market long regarded by British companies as their private fiefdoms. MMI turned to Zurich after being disappointed by potential UK rescuers. Last year, the company stopped underwriting after posting losses of Pounds 240.3m in 1991. A succession of UK companies examined its books and rejected any link-up on the grounds that the risks were too high. 'We've been involved in council business over the years and we're still paying for it,' said the manager of one UK company. UK companies initially refused to offer even the most minimal emergency cover to local councils without insurance. Underwriters at the Lloyd's insurance market sold short-term cover at emergency rates. More recently, brokers have persuaded some companies to accept council risks, at much increased rates. 'We've picked up a few councils but we wouldn't want too much of it. I just don't see the point in getting involved sorting out the staff and everything,' says another senior insurance manager. Zurich came to the rescue in October, after other options - such as the little-known French mutual, Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires - had evaporated. Several months of negotiations, during which Zurich carried out a searching examination of MMI's business, have paved the way for the takeover. The arrangement is relatively simple: Zurich will take on to its staff the 1,500 employees of Municipal Mutual as well as all new insurance contracts. It has bought MMI's Bournemouth offices and taken out leases on several other properties. Through the rump of MMI, local authorities will retain control of the reserves they have set aside to meet claims arising from old policies and Zurich will simply administer old claims. Zurich will pay MMI a percentage of all new premiums it earns over the next three years. Mr Rolf Huppi, the 50-year-old chief executive of Zurich, has no doubts about stepping into an area where the domestic market and others fear to tread. But his enthusiasm for the deal has little to do with market share. For Mr Huppi, the opportunity to acquire the insurance business of most UK local councils offers Zurich an 'enormous opportunity' to develop his company's approach to commercial insurance business. 'Very rarely do you get such a focused group of customers,' says Mr Huppi, who has had two long spells in charge of Zurich's US operations and is responsible for developing much of the strategy. As well as insurance, Zurich Municipal will develop a range of customised services for councils - from advice on how to reduce incidents such as workplace injuries and minor road accidents to improvements in the physical security of schools and other municipal buildings. Zurich will also advise councils on how they can fund many small claims through self-insurance schemes which can reduce costs. 'You have to be flexible enough to recognise that other services and products are as legitimate as insurance products,' says Mr Eddie Hester, general manager Zurich International (UK), the Zurich subsidiary which originally developed this approach in the mid-1970s. While traditional insurers sell a narrow range of insurance policies - such as property insurance, liability insurance, accident insurance - often on the basis of price to any customer, Zurich has adopted a targeted approach. 'It is best to focus on needs and risks of a particular group of customers rather than trying to do everything,' says Mr Hester. Zurich's international division, which directs its marketing to multinationals, specialises in insuring chemical and pharmaceutical companies. Its London subsidiary alone employs 15 loss advisers, trained as engineers, many of whom have had first-hand experience in the chemical industry. They provide technical advice on how companies can reduce their risks. Elsewhere, the group has developed profitable business in such unlikely niches as Californian rice farmers, Wisconsin meat packers and US motor dealers. A common feature is that Zurich aims to develop an intimate knowledge of its customers' business. Mr Steve Smith, chief executive of Universal Underwriters. a Zurich subsidiary based in Kansas City, which sells insurance policies to 25 per cent of US motor dealers, says that nearly 50 per cent of the company's account executives have worked in motor dealerships themselves. 'People live, sleep and breathe the customer,' said Mr Smith. Universal has taken several measures to retain its customers. Its insurance policies are specifically tailored, providing cover for many risks - such as possible legal action from customers over faulty repair work - which might not be covered in normal policies. Universal is providing its clients with a computerised link-up with its Kansas City head offices, which allows motor dealers to pay their premiums - adjusted monthly to reflect the changing value of stock - and make claims electronically. The development makes life easier for dealers but also makes them more likely to stay with Universal. 'It makes the cost of switching very high for the customer,' says Mr Smith. Motor dealers are also tied to Universal by being invited to become agents to sell credit insurance and extended warranties to car buyers. Mr Smith says dealers can increase their income significantly in some cases. Zurich's strategy looks likely to become more popular in the industry during the 1990s. With investment returns less reliable, insurers are likely to come under increasing pressure to make their basic underwriting operations profitable. The successful management and control of claims may be one of the best ways of doing so. As insurers draw closer to their existing customers to manage risk, they are also more likely to be able to retain them. These developments could pose a challenge for the increasingly 'risk averse' UK insurers. Stung by record losses of Pounds 2bn in 1990-91, UK companies have begun to put safety first, with the most successful company, Commercial Union, directing its expansion towards low-risk and less-volatile life assurance business, for example. If Zurich Municipal proves successful it could encourage similar forays both by Zurich and by other international groups in the UK market, further eroding the grip of UK insurers over 'big ticket' business - the riskiest, but sometimes the most profitable.  ------------------------------------------------- Zurich: a risky business  ------------------------------------------------- Market Capitalisation (poundsm)  ------------------------------------------------- Zurich                                 3697.3 Royal                                   865.1  ------------------------------------------------- Sun Alliance                           2417.0 GRE                                 1299.0  ------------------------------------------------- General Accident                       2325.8 Commercial Union                       2395.0  ------------------------------------------------- Source: FT top 500  -------------------------------------------------</p>

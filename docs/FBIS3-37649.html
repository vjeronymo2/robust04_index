This was one of the main ideas of the recent visit to  Brussels by Algirdas Brazauskas, the country's president. At  the same time the head of state stressed in particular that in  beginning to participate in the "Partnership for Peace" program  Lithuania's clear ultimate goal is to become a full-fledged  member of NATO.    However, he said, more and more people in Lithuania are  coming to realize that the desire alone is not enough. "We  ourselves are obliged to create in our country not only the  military basis for integration but also the political, economic,  and psychological basis corresponding to the level of the NATO  states," he stated.    Meanwhile time some interesting details of the visit have  emerged. The leaders of the supreme headquarters of the armed  forces in Europe were particularly cautious in talking about  Lithuania's possible full membership of NATO. Lieutenant  General Klaus Steinkopf, special adviser to the armed forces in  Europe, called the "Partnership for Peace" program an invitation  to take part in a common security system. He noted that this  was the first time that NATO had gone outside the limits of its  traditional territories to cooperate closely with other states  in Europe.    Gerhard von Moltke, policy adviser to the NATO secretary  general, said that the organization does not want a new division  of Europe or new lines drawn on the maps. "We want to cooperate  with Russia, Ukraine, and other states," he stressed.    By signing the main document of the invitation to  "Partnership for Peace," according to its president, Lithuania  is expressing a readiness to start work on exercising democratic  control of its defense structures and on a process of openness  with respect to the defense budget, joint planning, exercises,  and maneuvers. "We are working toward the creation of  opportunities for cooperation with NATO forces in such spheres  as peacekeeping operations, search and rescue operations,  humanitarian aid, and so forth," he said. "Lithuania sees its  integration with NATO as a complex evolutionary process which  will require great intellectual and material resources."    In the president's opinion, Russia's statements on its  special interests in the neighboring foreign countries or on the  territory of the former Soviet Union do not fully accord with  the spirit of international law and the "Partnership for Peace."  He is particularly alarmed by the statements on Russia's  special interests in the Baltic states. A. Brazauskas expressed  the view that the admission of the Baltic and other Central  European states into the European Union and NATO would be a  powerful incentive to economic and political reforms in those  countries. He is convinced that this would also give  significant support to the strengthening and continuity of the  democratic processes in Russia. The Lithuanian leadership  approves the Western states' efforts to help Russia implement  its political and economic reforms and create a democratic  Russia.</p>

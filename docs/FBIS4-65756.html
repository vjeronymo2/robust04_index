			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today  reiterated Athens' firm decision to insist that the human rights  of the Greek minority in Albania be respected in order to  improve relations with Tirana. Venizelos reminded the Albanian  Government about the recent demarches that Greece made to  international organizations about the issue.    The spokesman made this statement after [Albanian President  Sali] Berisha's regime accused six individuals from North  Ipirotes of serious charges following the border incident in  Episkopi. Venizelos stressed that the Greek Government has  always linked the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations, an  improvement that it wants and pursues, to full respect for the  Greek Albanian's human rights. He added that Greek-Albanian  relations as well as Albania's relations with the European Union  [EU] depend on this prerequisite.    Venizelos concluded: Greece will lodge new diplomatic  demarches with all the international organizations and third  countries. It has already lodged demarches with the United  Nations, CSCE, the EU, and the U.S. Government. [passage  omitted]</p>

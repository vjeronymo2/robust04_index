			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said yesterday  that in light of the new global situation it is necessary to  review the cooperation treaty Honduras and the United States  signed in 1954 in order to redirect relations between the two  allies.    He said: "We are in the post-Cold War period and priorities  have changed. For this reason Honduras, through its legitimate  authorities, must point out to the United States the new areas  on which we must work."    These new areas, he said, are basically the struggle against  drug trafficking and the control of illegal immigrants --  something that can be checked under the circumstances of free  economies, employment opportunities, and democracies capable of  guaranteeing the human rights of the Central American people.    He noted that, personally he has always struggled to keep  Honduras from becoming the backyard of a superpower. "We said  this in the 1980's, and we say it now in the 1990's," he  explained.    For the first time, he affirmed, the interests of the United  States and those of Honduras and the rest of Central America  coincide because there is a new government in the North American  country and it has a new foreign policy.    The minister added that Honduras is now a mature nation  ready  to engage in a new relationship with the United States, adding  that it is also ready to decide whether there is any sense in  today's world for Palmerola Air Base to remain a platform for  military operations at the regional level.    "On the contrary," he said, "it is necessary to turn  Palmerola into a regional center for fighting drug trafficking,  something that would benefit the United States as well as our  countries."    The civilian utilization of the airstrip, which was designed  for military purposes, cannot be ruled out. Minister Paz  Aguilar said, "The only thing we would have to do to turn  Palmerola into an airport in the country's central region is to  invest in construction of a terminal."    The minister said such changes must be based on new  attitudes. "We have to discuss the problem of immigration,  because the Honduran people have quotas restricting their entry  into the United States, and Eastern European citizens are  finding it easier than the Latin Americans to enter the United  States."    In conclusion, Minister Paz said no specific date has been  set yet for reviewing the treaties, because the new phase of  relations with the United States is just beginning.</p>

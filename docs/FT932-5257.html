			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Export progress for ABI Leisure REFLECTING progress in export markets, turnover of ABI Leisure Group rose 3.7 per cent to Pounds 29m, compared with Pounds 28.1m, in the half year ended February 28 1993. After slightly higher interest charges the profit before tax was marginally up at Pounds 1.27m, against Pounds 1.25m. Earnings per share were 3.1p (3p). Mr George Shiels, chairman, said the composition of sales was changing, with a larger proportion of revenue earned from sales of leisure homes. Other operations include the manufacture of touring caravans. At the end of the period stocks of completed caravans were at the lowest levels consistent with adequately servicing the dealer network. Dividend policy is to pay one-third as an interim and the balance as the final. An interim of 1.25p (1.57p) is declared, with an unchanged total of 3.76p forecast.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / France's welfare deficit worsens The financial hole in France's welfare system will reach FFr57bn (Pounds 6.5bn) this year and, despite tax increases and cuts in medical and pension payments, will still be around FFr43bn next year, a government commission reported yesterday. France's welfare funds are still largely funded off-budget by employer and employee contributions, though the state is now having to dig into its own pocket to provide about one-fifth of this year's estimated FFr1,027bn welfare spending. Thus, the government has been able to keep this year's budget deficit at its original target of FFr317bn, while the welfare funds sink deeper into the red. Recession, rising unemployment and stagnation in salary levels has meant that this year's increase in total receipts of the pensions, family allowances, health and accident insurance funds rose only 2.3 per cent, barely matching inflation, while payments increased by 6.4 per cent. 'The social security system is suffering the biggest financial crisis of its history at the very time when it is most needed,' said Mr Jean Marmot, head of the social security accounts commission. The long-term strategy of the government is to shift more of the welfare tax burden off company payrolls and on to the national budget funded by general taxation. To this end, it has already doubled the 'generalised social contribution', a form of income tax, and is being urged by some of its backbench deputies to raise value added tax as a means of bailing out the welfare funds. But, clearly nervous that further tax increases might kill off the incipient economic recovery, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, said this week that introduction of a 'social VAT' was premature. The unemployment insurance fund is counted separately from other welfare funds. But it, too, is in the red. In a move to combat rising joblessness, the Patronat employers' federation, which together with the trade unions finances and manages the nation's dole fund, set its member companies the goal of hiring up to 200,000 young people by the end of 1994.</p>

Are you surprised,  disappointed?    [Vranitzky] There was some indication that our objections  had been taken into account and that guarantees would not be  provided so easily. I am certainly disappointed.    [Edlinger] Do you think that the federal government's  efforts were sufficient or that, maybe, you started your  activities in the United States too late?    [Vranitzky] This argument has long since been settled and it  was refuted by all those who were there. So that is not  relevant. The point probably was that the U.S. side was less  interested in Austria's position and gave precedence to  considerations of economic and industrial policy, which were  more important for the Americans than our justified objections.    [Edlinger] Will you continue the struggle or will you simply  accept the decision?    [Vranitzky] As far as I can see there is not much we can do  about this decision. Still, I do not yet know the arguments  used in favor of the credit. Still, it has been partly the  result of our efforts that future nuclear projects will be  subjected to stricter examination standards. Therefore -- and I  have always said that -- in the future we will not sever any  relations but maintain a dialogue on energy -- with the Czech  Republic and others. Still, our basic position has not changed.  Even when we do not have to hide our disappointment now, our  arguments led to a rethinking process and to reflection on the  part of many Americans.    [Edlinger] Thank you very much for the interview,  chancellor.    [Vranitzky] Not at all.</p>

However, regardless of notification, an employee is still obligated to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to seek reemployment within the time limits provided by chapter 43 of title 38 of the U.S. Code, for reemployment after military service or as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;353.105  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Maintenance of records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each agency shall identify the position vacated by an employee who is injured or leaves to enter on military duty. It shall also maintain the necessary records to assure that all such employees are preserved the rights and benefits granted by this law and this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;353.106  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Personnel actions during employee's absence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Agency promotion plans must provide a mechanism by which employees who are absent because of military duty or compensable injury can be considered for promotion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) An employee whose position is reclassified while he or she is absent because of military duty or compensable injury shall be considered for that position in accordance with the provisions in part 335 of this chapter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;353.107  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Status upon reemployment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon reemployment, an employee who was absent on military duty or because of compensable injury is generally entitled to be treated as though he or she had never left. This means the entire period from the time the employee entered military service or was injured until he or she was reemployed is creditable for purposes of rights and benefits based upon seniority and length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, completion of probation, and leave rate accrual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;353.108  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Effect of performance and conduct on restoration rights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The laws covered by this part do not permit an agency to circumvent the protections afforded by other laws to employees who face the involuntary loss of their positions. Thus, an employee may not be denied restoration rights because of poor performance or conduct that occurred prior to the employee's departure for compensable injury or military duty. However, separation for cause that is substantially unrelated to the injury or to the performance of military duty negates restoration rights. If during the period of injury or military duty the employee's conduct is such that it would disqualify him or her for employment under OPM or agency regulations, restoration rights may be denied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;353.109  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Transfer of function to another agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the function of an employee absent on military duty or compensable injury is transferred to another agency, and if the employee would have been transferred with the function under part 351 of this chapter had he or she not been absent, the employee is entitled to be reinstated to a position in the gaining agency that is equivalent to the one he or she left. It shall also assume the obligation to restore the employee in accordance with law and this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;353.110  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> OPM placement assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Employee returning from military duty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Sole authority to invalidate directive  -European Court Where a national law implements a European Community directive, EC law does not prevent a national court from examining whether that national law should be applied if it is found that the provisions of the directive are invalid. However, it is for the European Court of Justice to determine whether the directive is valid or not. This finding was the outcome of a case concerning the sale in Germany of a product - Setaderm - used to combat hair loss. The product contained a substance - 11 alpha OHP - which was banned under German law. The company marketing Setaderm took the product off the market, but brought proceedings in the national courts for a declaration that it could lawfully manufacture and market the product on the basis that 11 alpha OHP was not harmful to human health and that its use in cosmetic products should not be banned. The national court commissioned an expert's report, which found that 11 alpha OHP was not harmful to human health. However, prior to the delivery of the report, the 12th Directive on Cosmetic Products was published. Article 2 of the directive provided that the marketing of products containing 11 alpha OHP was to be prohibited from January 1 1991, and that sale to the final consumer was to be prohibited from December 31 1991. The directive was implemented in Germany by a law passed on March 21 1990, more than six months before the expert's report was delivered. The German court was convinced by the findings of its expert and thus took the view that the national legislation banning 11 alpha OHP was invalid, but recognised that this would have the effect of rendering ineffective the relevant provisions of the directive. It referred the issue to the European Court of Justice. The ECJ was asked three questions. First, whether a national court was prevented from regarding a national law as invalid or void if and insofar as that law consisted only of provisions implementing a directive. Second, if a national court could not carry out this exercise, whether a directive had direct effect. Third, if the answer to either of the two previous questions was in the affirmative, whether the prohibition of 11 alpha OHP under the 12th Commission directive was valid. The ECJ decided that answers to the first two questions would only be relevant to the national court if the relevant provisions of the directive were found to be valid. It thus examined the third question first. The manufacturer of Setaderm argued that, before any product was added to the list of prohibited substances in the directive, the Scientific Committee for Cosmetology had to be consulted. In the present case, this committee had not been consulted. There had thus been a breach of an essential procedural requirement, causing the prohibition of 11 alpha OHP to be invalid. The Commission, Germany and the UK argued the provision was valid as the committee only had to be consulted if a member state or the Commission requested it, which had not been the case here. The ECJ found that the wording of the directive in the different language versions of the text made it unclear whether the committee had to be consulted in all cases. One interpretation was that followed by the Commission, Germany and the UK. The other interpretation was that it was for the Commission or member states to take the initiative to convene the committee, which had to be consulted in all cases. The ECJ examined the aims of the committee and found that the purpose of consulting it was to ensure that measures adopted at Community level were necessary and adapted to the objective pursued by the directive, namely to protect human health. Consultation of the committee had, therefore, to be mandatory in all cases. As it was not contested that the committee had not been consulted about the prohibition of 11 alpha OHP, the ECJ declared that the relevant provision of the directive prohibiting the substance was invalid; hence, it had no need to answer the first two questions from the German court.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Angolan Human Rights Association has described  as worrisome the conditions experienced by political and other  prisoners in Luanda's jails. That association says that some 60  people perish in jail every month because of the subhuman  conditions they face. Many succumb to physical brutality,  others because of physical exhaustion caused by terrible hygiene  conditions in jail.    In a report it published recently, the Angolan Human Rights  Association noted that there were many detainees who had not  been charged but who were serving long sentences. No health  care is given, even though serious and contagious diseases are  common in those jails.    In the third quarter of last year, an Assembly of the  Republic team visited the jails and found the situation there to  be cause for much concern. At the time, that team promised to  work to improve the situation, but nothing has changed so far.    According to a source here in Jamba, that situation benefits  the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party,  whose idea it was to order the construction of those jails.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIME-TIME FLICKS  </P> <P> Wish You Were Here (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.) introduces us to teen-age actress  Emily Lloyd, whose performance as a cheeky 15-year-old in a staid English town  is one of those extraordinary fusions of actress and role that defy you to pry  them apart.  </P> <P> The Saturday night lineup of oldies but goodies should tempt anyone to stay  home: King's Row (KTLA at 8 p.m.) -- the former president's best; Hud (KCOP at  8 p.m.), Laura (KCET at 9 p.m.) and, best of all, Detour (KCETat 10:30 p.m.),  Edgar Ulmer's fast and furious film noir classic.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NO HOLIDAY FOR ARIZONA;  </P> <P> VOTERS' REJECTION OF KING DAY CAUSES MORE THAN JUST A LOT OF HOT AIR IN THE  STATE  </P> <P> Is the caller there?  </P> <P> The lines are jammed at KFYI, an all-talk radio station here. Callers from  around the state are waiting in an electronic line to talk to show host Bob  Mohan. And Mohan has no doubt as to today's topic. It's the same thing callers  have been talking about since the election Nov. 6.  </P> <P> Dave from Glendale: "How dare anybody ask me, when I'm done voting, to justify  my vote, to prove it. Let alone, have anybody tell me I have made a mistake and  I might do better with another chance. I think King is a joke. I don't want any  day, that I have anything to say about, associated with him."  </P> <P> Cathy from Phoenix: "I'm sick and tired of talking about Martin Luther King. We  voted and let's get on with our lives."  </P> <P> One woman calls to say there is no "prejudicism" in Arizona. A man calls  demanding to know why sports and politics should be mixed. Another caller  suggests a holiday for Sammy Davis Jr.  </P> <P> The talk-show host is working a crossword puzzle. The phone bank in front of  him sparkles with red blinking lights, each light an Arizonan hopping mad.  </P> <P> Dennis from Scottsdale: "In your face Tagliabue. Tuesday's vote was the state's  finest hour. We would have never caved in to the NFL."  </P> <P> Mohan is nodding, nodding. He sighs and says, "And the rest of the country  thinks we're a bunch of Neanderthal apes dragging our knuckles."  </P> <P> It has been like this since Arizona voters failed to support a proposition that  would have created a state paid holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr. That the measure failed narrowly, 50.8% to 49.2%, is not  the point. That Arizona already sets aside a day to commemorate King and the  civil rights movement doesn't seem to be the point, either.  </P> <P> The point is that Arizona has become the focus of the worst kind of national  attention: the "60 Minutes," "Geraldo" kind of attention. The butt-of-jokes,  Johnny Carson monologue kind. The point is, also, that Arizonans are angry,  hurt and not at all ready to accept their title as a racist symbol of the  Southwest.  </P> <P> In the midst of this, the NFL is considering relocating the 1993 Super Bowl  from Phoenix, at Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's recommendation. The Fiesta Bowl  will not be moved, but its organizers had to scramble for teams to play in it.  College athletic recruiters are already rehearsing their anti-Arizona pitches  to recruits.  </P> <P> Conventions are avoiding the state, and other states, California in particular,  are actively wooing Arizona's tourist business. Think of the state as a dying  creature with its neighbors, like vultures, perched on its borders.  </P> <P> To all this Arizonans are saying, via radio call-in shows, letters to the  editor and bumper stickers, "Leave us alone! We are mad as hell and we are not  going to take it anymore!"  </P> <P> The idea of a holiday to honor King has confounded the state legislature since  debate began in 1975. The Arizona legislature has voted against a paid King  holiday 30 times.  </P> <P> The fight for a King holiday in Arizona has a long and often-misunderstood  history. In recent years the controversy reached a boiling point in May of  1986, when then-Gov. Bruce Babbitt proclaimed the third Monday in January a  paid state holiday.  </P> <P> On Nov. 6, 1986, Gov.-elect Evan Mecham announced that he would rescind the  paid holiday, saying the state attorney general had ruled Babbitt's  proclamation unlawful. Upon taking office, Mecham declared an unpaid Sunday  commemoration called the King/Civil Rights Day.  </P> <P> That act set in motion events that at first bewildered and then angered  Arizonans. Although Arizona, New Hampshire and Montana are the only three  states that don't have a paid state holiday honoring King, people here are  quick to point out that 21 cities in the state have some form of observance for  King.  </P> <P> Their protests, though, were not enough to blunt national condemnation and  boycotts.  </P> <P> The Arizona legislature, aware of the state's deteriorating image, acted and on  Sept. 21, 1989, approved a swap -- a paid state holiday for King and the  elimination of a paid Columbus Day holiday.  </P> <P> That, however, didn't solve anything:  </P> <P>  -- Outraged Italian-Americans swung into action, calling for the restoration  of the holiday honoring Columbus.  </P> <P>  -- Three days later, a Tempe architect, Julian Sanders, began a petition drive  to put the King-Columbus matter on the ballot. The group obtained enough  signatures and the King Day enacted by the legislature was put on hold.  </P> <P>  -- In October, Sanders, a Mormon, sent a letter to a church official calling  King a "Communist anti-Christ" who was "a liar, adulterer and thief."  </P> <P>  -- In March, Phoenix was awarded the 1993 Super Bowl. Business leaders  pressured legislators to pass some kind of King holiday. On May 16, the Arizona  legislature agreed to a paid King holiday and restored the Columbus Day  holiday.  </P> <P>  -- In August, Mecham spearheaded a successful referendum drive to put that  legislative action on the ballot. The law was put on hold. Again.  </P> <P> Many who voted against the King holiday said they did so for economic reasons.  Arizona has 10 paid state holidays. The cost of adding another is estimated at  millions.  </P> <P> But to the chagrin of many, the failure of the King-day measure may cost the  state millions more in lost revenue.  </P> <P> According to the Phoenix and Valley of the Sun Convention and Visitor's Bureau,  the fallout from the pre-election King controversy -- dating back to Mecham's  rescinding of the holiday -- has been enormous. Since 1987, the Phoenix area  has lost 58 conventions, representing 46,000 visitors and an estimated $30  million.  </P> <P> To get an idea of the potential economic impact on Arizona, keep in mind that  the figures represent losses in one city, in one segment of the economy, before  the election.  </P> <P> Tourism is Arizona's No. 2 industry, behind manufacturing. And it is tourism  that would be hardest hit by consumer boycotts and negative images of the  state. Phoenix alone makes $3 billion a year on tourism and relies on a  successful Fiesta Bowl for additional income. The New Year's Day game last year  generated $30 million statewide.  </P> <P> And although the Fiesta Bowl will be played, as scheduled, in neighboring  Tempe, organizers have little doubt that revenues will be down.  </P> <P> Since the election, the threat of state boycotts has snowballed. Among the  possible boycotters:  </P> <P>  -- The NFL. The 1993 Super Bowl will likely be moved from Phoenix. Lost  revenue is estimated at $200 million.  </P> <P>  -- The NBA. Phoenix is a candidate for the 1994 All-Star game but is not  likely to get it under the current circumstances. In 1987, the NBA pulled its  annual general meetings out of Phoenix because of the King-holiday controversy.  NBA Commissioner David Stern said last week that he doubted the league would  hold major events in Arizona.  </P> <P> "It just doesn't seem to be a place that we would find particularly  hospitable," Stern said.  </P> <P>  -- The Harlem Globetrotters, who canceled two scheduled games in the state,  with a potential loss of thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> "There are some issues dollars can't measure," a team official said.  </P> <P>  -- Martin Stone, a businessman from Lake Placid, N.Y. Stone has given up his 5  1/2-year attempt to get a major league baseball expansion team for Phoenix. He  has spent $2 million on the effort but said, in light of the King vote, the  National League would not belikely to put a team in Arizona.  </P> <P>  -- The entertainment industry. A widespread boycott is expected. The state has  already been boycotted by such performers as Tina Turner, Whitney Houston, Al  Jarreau, Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder, who either canceled appearances or  said they would not perform in Arizona until a paid King holiday was a fact.  </P> <P> Other groups, such as U2, Kool and the Gang, and Peter, Paul and Mary performed  but protested by donating some concert proceeds to the campaign to recall  Mecham.  </P> <P>  -- The National League of Cities. That group, whose convention is expected to  bring $6.9 million to Phoenix, will decide next month whether to relocate.  </P> <P> Dozens of similarly-sized conventions are expected to relocate.  </P> <P> By most measures, it was a tough election for Arizonans. Propositions 301 and  302 were among a jumble of 13 measures on the ballot. Combinations of yes and  no votes on the propositions presented to voters various possibilities:  </P> <P>  -- Approve both measures and the one with the most affirmative votes wins.  </P> <P>  -- Approve Proposition 301 and reject 302, creating a paid King Day and  eliminating a paid Columbus Day.  </P> <P>  -- Approve Proposition 302 and reject 301, creating a paid King Day and  preserving the paid Columbus Day.  </P> <P>  -- Reject both and retain the status quo, a paid Columbus Day and no paid King  Day.  </P> <P> (Arizona does not follow the federal model that combines Washington and Lincoln  birthdays into Presidents Day, thus adding another holiday.)  </P> <P> To the surprise of no one, the results of a poll conducted a week after the  election revealed that voters had been confused.  </P> <P> Polling organizations are perhaps the one business group not considering  pulling out of Arizona. To the contrary, their business is booming.  </P> <P> One poll released last week to much attention was one that suggested that the  NFL's threat to move the Super Bowl if the King measure failed had caused a  large number of Arizonans to change their yes vote to a no.  </P> <P> The statewide poll, conducted by Earl DeBerge, concluded that 60,000 voters  shifted their vote on Proposition 302 after hearing Greg Gumbel's report on  CBS-TV's "The NFL Today" on the Sunday before the election that the NFL was  poised to pull the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> According to DeBerge, 63% of those polled who had changed their vote from yes  to no said they had done so because they "Resented the National Football League  threat to move the Super Bowl."  </P> <P> Another pollster, Michael O'Neil, reached the same conclusion, reporting, "We  believe that there can be no doubt that (without the) impact of the CBS sports  report two days before the election that Proposition 302 would have passed."  </P> <P> The perception of a last-minute threat from the NFL is one explanation for  still other polls that showed the King Day measure passing with ease. One  factor to consider -- people often lie to pollsters and give what they think  will be the acceptable answer.  </P> <P> Said O'Neil: "The recent examples of people not telling the truth in polls has  been with racial issues."  </P> <P> So many Arizona voters had no intention of voting for the holiday but told  parades of pollsters they were planning to out of fear of being labeled  racists?  </P> <P> "This has been the rallying point of racism," said Lincoln Ragsdale, a Phoenix  businessman and civil rights activist. Arizona's blacks make up only 3% of the  state's population. "The NFL gave people the excuse they had been looking for  to vote against it.  </P> <P> "Look, a fellow goes out on a Saturday night packing a gun. He walks around,  brushing up against people to start a fight. He wants to use the gun. Someone  punches him and he finally has the excuse he needs to shoot someone. The NFL  threat only gave people the reason they needed to vote no."  </P> <P> For whatever reason, there is no doubt that outrage over Tagliabue's statements  was widespread. A Mesa man sued the NFL and CBS Friday, accusing them of  violating state laws prohibiting "changing the vote of an elector by corrupt  means or inducement."  </P> <P> Mecham said the CBS report was planted by the "power brokers" of Arizona.  </P> <P> Mecham, who held a news conference Thursday to announce the creation of the  Preserve Our Vote Legal Defense Fund, railed against the NFL and professional  sports in general.  </P> <P> "We are not going to grovel at the feet of the NFL and the NBA and all the  alphabet put together," he said.  </P> <P> Mecham said Tagliabue was "guilty of extortion."  </P> <P> The Fiesta Bowl likes to bill itself as the bowl game that extends the warmest  hospitality to its teams. That will be amplified this year, as Fiesta Bowl  officials will no doubt lavish the teams with remarkable levels of kindness and  Western hospitality.  </P> <P> After a scramble -- and a rejection from Notre Dame and Virginia -- the Fiesta  Bowl will pit No. 20 Louisville against the Southeastern Conference runner-up.  </P> <P> In a bid to offset King Day criticism, Fiesta officials plan a pregame ceremony  honoring the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, a halftime presentation  honoring King and the civil rights movement, the establishment of a $100,000  Martin Luther King Jr. scholarship fund for each participating team, and the  establishment of a scholarship fund to benefit local students in the name of  King.  </P> <P> A Fiesta Bowl official, asked if these steps had been taken to soothe national  opinion, said, "There is no appeasement in the recipe whatsoever."  </P> <P> Mecham, whose political lives seem endless, is at the center of the King Day  controversy.  </P> <P> A former car dealer, Mecham's political lives have seemed endless. He has run  for governor six times.  </P> <P> As governor, he frequently got in trouble for blurting out whatever came into  his head. For instance, he defended the use of the word pickaninny to describe  black children in a history book used in Arizona schools. He joked about  Japanese becoming "round-eyed" with delight after seeing the state's golf  courses. And he told a Jewish group that the United States is a Christian  nation.  </P> <P> Among Mecham's 147 appointees were the governor's education adviser, who said  that teachers have no right to contradict parents who tell their children the  Earth is flat, and an elderly woman he appointed to the State Board of  Education who lacks a college degree and considers the equal rights amendment a  lesbian plot.  </P> <P> Given his history, few state leaders are thrilled that Mecham has taken the  lead in the anti-King-Day drive.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, damage control here has been problematic.  </P> <P> Rose Mofford, the current governor, said on national television that she felt  Arizona was somewhat a racist state. A sports columnist in Tucson suggested  that the NFL's Phoenix Cardinals offer a Klan Night promotion with the marching  band at halftime honoring former Gov. Mecham by spelling out pickaninny.  </P> <P> Even as Mofford called a special session of the legislature to organize a  gubernatorial runoff election, she was saying she might ask lawmakers to put  together a two-thirds-vote requirement to override the people's vote and  install a holiday.  </P> <P> Before the day was out, a group had formed, held a news conference, and  announced that it would circulate recall petitions against any legislator who  voted for a King holiday.  </P> <P> Few can say just what the impact the controversy will have on the state, other  than that the damage may be limitless.  </P> <P> Ragsdale, the Phoenix civil rights activist, summed up the state's image this  way: "Arizona is the South Africa of the United States, like it or not."  </P> <P> Mecham, ever the smiling optimist, saw the fallout in another light.  </P> <P> "Look at it the other way," he said. "There are just a lot of people across  this country that say, 'Boy, there's a state for you. There's Arizona. They're  not a racist state. They're a great state. And they have got guts enough to  make up their own mind on something. I believe I'll go live in that state.' "  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER TO WINE:;  </P> <P> THE METAMORPHOSIS OF L. A.;  </P> <P> MATERIAL DREAMS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE 1920S BY KEVIN STARR (OXFORD  UNIVERSITY PRESS: $21.95; 424 PP.)  </P> <P> Kevin Starr has written an engaging, eccentric history of Southern California  in the '20s. It shifts focus like a zoom lens, from physical growth to cultural  ferment, water to oil, cops to football, oligarchs to Babbits, Bible-thumpers  to architects, transportation to bibliophilia, William Mulholland to Jake  Zeitlin, Frank Lloyd Wright to Simon Rodia, ethnic mix to real estate. It has a  sort of urban sprawl of its own, yet it manages to hang together the way a  three-ring circus does -- a lot going on, clowns and trapeze artists and  tigers, all under one awning. It is richly researched, informative, fun to  read, and flawed.  </P> <P> It seems a case of metaphor overkill -- not in the writing of metaphors, but in  using the term as label. Thus we have what Starr calls a health-seeking  metaphor, an originating metaphor, a privacy and retrenchment metaphor, a patio  metaphor, resort metaphor, design metaphor, Biblical metaphor, Chicago  metaphor, Santa Barbara metaphor, Newport metaphor, controlling metaphor,  prophetic metaphor, technology metaphor, Christian metaphor, development  metaphor, Spanish metaphor, tide-pool metaphor, genteel metaphor, a "flat  landscape that suggested no easy metaphors," and advice that "the Salton Sea  offered the deepest possible metaphor of the region."  </P> <P> The writing is bright; it has substance, pace and vigor; it makes sense even  when it stretches for metaphoric significance, but Starr is like a very good  pitcher who every now and then throws a ball three feet over the catcher's  head, as when after a good stretch of first-class writing, there are clusters  of inverted sentences, or three sentences in a row that begin with participles.  He uses "sub/urban" repeatedly, where just plain suburban would do for most of  us. But these are small cavils, against the broad scale and integrity of his  canvas.  </P> <P> The book opens with the whopping success story of irrigation in Southern  California ("Foundations in Water . . . Hydraulic Visions and Historical  Metaphors"). Los Angeles "made itself happen through will and water"; the city  was a "hydraulic have-not" which had to "invent itself through water."  </P> <P> William Mulholland, hydraulic engineer, was "the one universally acknowledged  founder of Los Angeles"; the Department of Water and Power was "a second  government"; without the resources of the Colorado River, and the longest  aqueduct in the Western Hemisphere, there would be no modern Southern  California. Starr acknowledges that the saga of struggle, power plays and  annexation ploys entailed in the watering of the region, has been told before,  even once in a movie, but his account is a model of succinctness, wired for  metaphor: ". . . engineering as a mode of humanistic intent . . . the  opportunity to co-create with divinity itself." (Outraged residents of Owens  Valley dynamited the aqueduct 10 different times to protest the sequestering of  water that had been given to them by the same divinity.)  </P> <P> Then come pages on planning and development, ballyhoo, oil, the automobile, the  emergence of institutional Los Angeles, the establishment for the first time in  history of a city built around the automobile. As the '20s began, about 6,000  electric cars radiated daily from downtown Los Angeles to link four contiguous  counties. "Only wealthy and politically independent suburbs such as Palos  Verdes and Beverly Hills were capable of planning with the landscape, not the  automobile, as the primary consideration." The how and why of what happened to  the streetcars is not spelled out, since they vanished in a later decade, and  that story probably will be told in another increment of Starr's "America and  the California Dream" series, of which the present volume is No. 3.  </P> <P> Several characters who flourished in the '20s have resonances today, as we  discover on meeting Harry Culver and I. N. Van Nuys, now memorialized by Culver  City and the community of Van Nuys; and Alphonso Bell, whose name is absorbed  in Bel-Air; and Col. Griffith J. Griffith, who shot his wife, served two years  in prison for attempted murder, and, in a more genial mode, deeded to the city  3,000 acres which became Griffith Park; and E. W. Hilgard, agronomist, after  whom the avenue and hotel in Westwood are named; and, of course, Edgar Rice  Burroughs' "Tarzan of the Apes," who lives on in Tarzana.  </P> <P> In a chapter on institutions in the '20s, Starr brackets an unlikely pair, the  Department of Water and Power and the University of Southern California, for  having "fully expressed and served the ambitions of Anglo-American Los Angeles  in its expansionist exuberance." Following them, he cites the Philharmonic  Orchestra and the L.A. Police Department for attaining "a high level of  autonomous power and authority as they emerged as arbiters and brokers of the  Los Angeles identity."  </P> <P> Recollections of this period include one relating to football. In 1924, USC was  asked to leave the Pacific Conference because of "lax scholastic standards,"  whereupon USC's then President Rufus von KleinSmid retaliated by seeking games  with Notre Dame, the biggest-drawing team in the country. Two years later at  Soldier's Field in Chicago, the match-up attracted 120,000 spectators, up to  then the largest crowd ever to watch a game of any kind.  </P> <P> Regional architecture has an engrossing chapter to itself, with emphasis on two  stars: the Bradbury Building, which "came out of nowhere" in 1893 and which  "challenged Los Angeles to begin thinking of itself as a big city, a Chicago on  the Pacific"; and the Watts Towers, "sustained by the logic of constructivism .  . . an architectural symbol equal in mystery and power to the Bradbury  Building."  </P> <P> Starr devotes two chapters to Santa Barbara as a contrasting alternative to Los  Angeles, claiming that the city "turned its back on glitter and razzmatazz in  favor of romantic historicizing and other preoccupations of the genteel  tradition." Indeed Santa Barbara might have developed a harbor to parallel, on  a smaller scale, Long Beach and Los Angeles, and might well have worked itself  up into a major industrial center and aviation capital (Lockheed and Northrop  got started there). Instead, it made a transition "from sanitarium to a resort  . . . (to) an American Nice, sunny gold and blue, languid and irrelevant . . .  listless, charming, with a disarming beauty . . . a pastoral place that  preferred to stay that way," a city that in 1910 was equal if not superior to  Hollywood in movie production (13 small companies made one-reelers there) but  which chose to "pursue its dreams through architecture, not films."  </P> <P> On life and letters in Southern California, the author, a former librarian, is  in green pastures. All through the book his capsule biographies have the  sharpness and cogency of "Aubrey's Brief Lives," and in the final chapters he  is in top form. Sometimes the effect is gossipy: "MacIntyre was rumored to  bring Occidental coeds there for purposes of seduction" . . . Robinson Jeffers  while at USC pursued "a clandestine love affair with a married philosophy  student" . . . "when Alfred's father died, their relationships became a  marriage in name only" . . . "seduced by a Catholic prelate when she was  fifteen. . . ." But the pages on Books and Bohemia in Greater Los Angeles; on  the comings, goings and doings of Pasadena's literati; on the "Zeitlin Circle";  on Merle Armitage's "monstrous egomania" and "crypto-falangist sense of art as  an elite defiance of the commonplace"; on Aldous Huxley, who once made a  dedicatory speech at a Zeitlin bookshop; on M. F. K. Fisher, "the Virginia  Woolf of cuisine"; on Ward Ritchie, still publishing; on Lawrence Clark Powell,  still teaching; on the emergence of the Huntington Library as an important  research institution in history and the humanities; all make sound reading.  </P> <P> The late Jake (Jacob Israel) Zeitlin emerges as the warmest and most robust  figure of Starr's literary phalanx. "Creative Los Angeles found in Zeitlin an  emblem, a principle of aspiration and continuity, a listener, a patron, a  friend . . . who functioned almost rabbinically as counselor, and confidante .  . . who helped innumerable artists and writers and other creative aspirants  toward fulfillment . . . who helped Los Angeles emerge as a national book and  library center." The gods smiled on Zeitlin, for he went from itinerant book  peddler, so poor his first child was born in a charity ward, to become an  international figure in the rare-book trade. Among other grand slams, he sold  144 illuminated manuscripts to the Getty Museum for $30 million.  </P> <P> There are enough good quotes in this book to fuel a mini-compendium. Two  examples: Frank Hogan, attorney who defended millionaire Edward Doheny in the  big oil scandal of the '20s: "A lawyer's ideal client is a rich man who is  scared"; and preacher Aimee Semple McPherson's instruction to her congregation  at collection time: "Sister has a headache tonight. Just quiet money please."  </P> <P> A bounteous and valuable bibliographical essay rounds out this third volume in  Starr's series of California dream sequences. Next scheduled is "The Dream  Endures: California Through the Great Depression."  </P></p>

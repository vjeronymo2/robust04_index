			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok] </F>   [Excerpt] In telephone conversations with the PLO  yesterday, Israel suggested a summit meeting between Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and a senior Palestinian figure, at which  the PLO's requests made in the wake of the Cave of the  Patriarchs massacre would be discussed in an effort to resume  the peace process.    It is believed in Jerusalem that the Palestinian reply will  be received in the coming days, but not before the UN Security  Council passes a resolution on the massacre. The PLO hopes the  Council will endorse some of its demands concerning the safety  of territories Palestinians. Several telephone conversations  were held yesterday between Jerusalem and PLO-Tunis and between  Jerusalem and the U.S. and Egyptian foreign ministries.    In addition, two meetings were held in Jerusalem regarding  Israel's replies to the PLO demands made in the wake of the  Hebron massacre as presented in Yasir 'Arafat's meeting with  Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political adviser, in Cairo  on 7 March.    The first meeting was a private conversation between Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Minister Peres. The second meeting  was also attended by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, his deputy,  Amnon Shahaq, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Planning Branch Chief  'Uzi Dayan, Jacques Neriya, and Foreign Ministry Director  General Uri Savir. This forum had also met on the night of 6  March, when it drafted the guidelines for Neriya's Cairo mission.    It was stated at yesterday's consultation that 'Arafat had  presented reduced demands in his meeting with Neriya. For  instance, the PLO demand to prohibit settlers from carrying arms  throughout the territories was replaced by a demand that the  settlers should be permitted to carry arms only inside the  settlements; instead of the demand to deploy an armed  international force throughout the territories, the updated  demand was that an unarmed force should be deployed in Gaza,  Jericho, and Hebron. (Israel is willing to accept an unarmed  international force in Gaza and Jericho in accordance with the  Declaration of Principles [DOP].)    The Palestinians demanded that Israel adhere verbatim to the  DOP, withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and Jericho no later than  13 April 1994, even if the PLO-Israeli withdrawal accord is not  finalized by that date. The Palestinians further demanded --  contrary to the DOP -- that the talks on settlements, including  Hebron, be launched immediately after the withdrawal.    Contrary to the agreement reached in the 'Arafat-Neriya  meeting that an Israeli envoy would convey the Israeli replies  to Tunis, it was decided in yesterday's consultations at the  prime minister's bureau in Jerusalem that no such envoy would be  dispatched. The replies were communicated via the telephone.  It was decided to propose to the Palestinians to hold a summit  meeting between Minister Peres and a senior Palestinian figure.  No PLO response was received yesterday.    Also yesterday, Peres met in his Jerusalem bureau with seven  Palestinian journalists representing five East Jerusalem  newspapers: AL-QUDS, AL-NAHAR, AL-TALI'AH, AL-MANAR, and THE  JERUSALEM TIMES. Three days ago Peres was interviewed by MBC,  the Saudi television network. In yesterday's meeting, Peres  said that with the implementation of the DOP, Israel and the  Palestinians could establish a new reality. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (7): Mood of profound scepticism - Sweden and the European Union As many Mondays as he can, Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, heads off to various towns and villages around the country to drum up support for Swedish membership of the European Union. Judging by the latest opinion polls, he might well think his time could be better spent. Swedes, like their Nordic neighbours in Finland and Norway, are profoundly sceptical about European Union membership, and if anything their opposition has increased as 1993 has progressed. The mood suggests the pro-EU lobby is going to have to fight all the way to make Swedish accession a reality by the targeted date of January 1 1995. The very least that will be required for a 'yes' vote in next year's referendum is a successful outcome to the entry negotiations, and that is still by no means guaranteed. Recent opinion polls have given the anti-EU camp 45-48 per cent support and those backing membership a mere 26-30 per cent. The No vote may have slipped a little from its peak, but the last time that more people were in favour of membership than against it was in March 1992. Although business and leading politicians broadly support the EU, many other groups in society are largely opposed to it, including women, young people and blue collar workers. In addition there are deep splits within a number of political parties. The leaders of the Social Democrats, the Centre Party and the Christian Democrats, which all support membership, are to a greater or lesser extent out of line with their membership, who are against. Internal EU disarray over matters such as Maastricht, unemployment and Yugoslavia has undoubtedly complicated the task of those seeking to get to Sweden into the union. But many Swedes seem to have deep-seated emotional reasons for their opposition: they implicitly link the EU with the wider process of change which has brought deep cuts to the welfare state and a sharp rise in unemployment. They also have a strong sense of pride in a system which, notwithstanding the difficulties of the past three years, has brought the country tremendous economic success over the past 50 years. They do not want to head into the unknown and risk a wholesale dismantling of that system if they can no see no tangible benefits from EU membership in return. That is part of the problem. Sweden is due to join the European Economic Area (EEA) alongside other European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries on January 1 1994, and in doing so will become part of a barrier-free trading region which stretches from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. Why go further and sign up for the EU? For all that politicians stress that Sweden will gain more influence, most Swedes worry that they will simply get more interference. The feedback from the negotiations, which began in February of this year, has done much to encourage this view. Swedish politicians have time and again accused the European Commission of being insensitive on 'Nordic' questions such as wet snuff and alcohol policy. The Commission has indicated it would like to ban wet snuff, known in Sweden as 'snus', and scrap the Nordic countries' monopoly on alcohol imports and distribution. But one in 10 Swedes is a regular snuff-taker, and the country has a strong temperance lobby. It is not surprising, therefore, that there have been warnings of a backlash against Brussels' interference in Sweden's domestic policies and traditions  -and fears that if the Commission does not give way, the referendum will be lost. In many ways these 'symbolic' issues have come to assume greater importance in Sweden than matters such as agriculture and regional policy, to which Finland and Norway have given greater weight. Environmental policy also falls into this category, the worry being that public opinion will be negatively influenced if Sweden is forced to lower its standards. Aside from such concerns, it is apparent that Sweden is becoming worried that it will be unable to complete its negotiations by the EU deadline of March 1, endangering the whole accession timetable. Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, minister for European affairs and foreign trade, was irked by the sluggish pace of talks when he spoke to journalists recently, saying that difficulties over snuff and free trade agreements with the Baltics should already have been resolved. He was looking for substantial progress ahead of a EU ministerial meeting scheduled for today. Even if such progress is made, the timetable is tight. Several important questions have still to be discussed including agriculture, regional policy and budget contributions - and they could all prove difficult. The big unresolved question is when exactly Sweden will hold its referendum on the EU. Three alternatives have been canvassed by the government: next June, three months after the negotiations should have been concluded and before the summer holidays; next September on the same day as the general election; or during the autumn. All three choices have their drawbacks. The Social Democrats, who may well form the next government, clearly disfavour June or September, and in any case it will be difficult to swing opinion in favour of membership before then. By waiting until next autumn, however, momentum will be lost and the newly-elected government will almost certainly be preoccupied with internal and domestic matters. The Social Democrats, who actually lodged the Swedish application back in 1991, are commonly seen as the key to a Swedish EU entry on the grounds that without their active campaigning there is little chance of the country being won over. A comparison is made with Denmark, which only voted in favour of Maastricht at the second attempt after a change of government which brought the Social Democrats to power. The trouble is that the Swedish Social Democrats are deeply split over the EU and they have certainly not mobilised the party faithful to promote a Yes vote so far. On the contrary, the party has preferred to lie low, awaiting the outcome of the negotiations. Whether Sweden does eventually join the EU will depend very much on the line the Social Democrats adopt once the result of those discussions is known.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondents Vladimir Pasyakin </F> and Anatoliy Stasovskiy, Sevastopol, under the rubric:  "Military-Political Survey": "The Crimean Peninsula: Armed, But  Is it That Dangerous?"]    [Text] The presidential elections in the Crimea are  an accomplished fact. What is more, Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov has already managed to visit both Kiev and Moscow and to  make quite a few ambiguous statements. It's not an exaggeration  to say that each of his words have been heeded, first of all,  because he spoke about the Crimea --"the peninsula of discord".  The nature of the contradictions there have long ago exceeded  the bounds of the diplomatic. It's no secret for anyone that  there are men and equipment on the peninsula that are capable of  resolving the dispute, alas, not only in words. And the  "sortings out" of late are a sufficiently convincing  confirmation of that.    Analysts warned that arms could start "talking" already  during the course of the election campaign.    That was the kind of picture that was drawn. And  although fortunately the gloomiest predictions were not  realized, a potentially explosive situation remains on the  peninsula.    The Crimea is becoming increasingly saturated with Ukrainian  troops, weapons, and armed formations. The following facts  attest to that.    A more than 650-man Ukrainian naval infantry battalion has  been deployed near Sevastopol (that, as we know, is the Black  Sea Fleet's primary naval base) near the village of Tylovoye. It  has up to 40 BTR-70's [armored transport vehicles], 120-mm  mortars, mount-type antitank grenade launchers, and portable  surface-to-air missile systems in its inventory. Even though it  is called a naval infantry battalion, this formation has an  imaginary tie to the sea. No one is undergoing naval training  here. In fact, it is not even being tasked with that mission.  And the servicemen are first and foremost being trained based  upon the spetsnaz [special forces] program. It is also  remarkable that the battalion has been manned primarily with  conscripts from Western Ukraine. Incidentally, these "naval  infantrymen" have already displayed a curt disposition with  regard to the local population on more than one occasion and  have completely lived up to their sleeve emblems in the form of  a gray predator-wolf.    A mechanized brigade is located in the area of Perevalnyy,  northeast of the main Black Sea Fleet base. It consists of two  mechanized infantry battalions, two tank battalions, and  artillery, antitank and air defense battalions. The authorized  strength is 1,800 men. But today there are actually 2,100 men.  For comparison: The Black Sea Fleet naval infantry brigade,  which recently appointed Ukrainian Navy Chief of Staff  Rear-Admiral Aleksey Ryzhenko called a "foreign formation", is  actually much smaller in strength.    A full-fledged spetsnaz [special forces] brigade that is  training saboteurs has been deployed in Staryy Krym [Old Crimea]  (the western portion of the peninsula). It numbers approximately  900 men. The brigade is organizationally part of the 32nd Army  Corps which is currently commanded by Major-General Aleksandr  Kuzmuk who came here from the Carpathian Military District.    A 350-man traffic control service battalion has been  deployed  within the city limits of Sevastopol itself. There are  approximately 15 BTR's in its inventory. This battalion, like  the one located in Tylovoye, is continuously growing and being  augmented by equipment which, according to some data, is  arriving from a storage base near Dzhankoy.    A patrol-postal service regiment is also deployed here. Its  commander is Aleksandr Kostyukov. The regiment, just like yeast,  literally grew from a recent battalion. Incidentally, the famous  "Berkut" [golden eagle] subunit has also become a part of it.  Right now it is small -- 15 men, but we anticipate that it will  be brought up to a company strength of 60 troops.    A Ukrainian Armed Forces PVO [Air Defense] regiment with the  well-equipped Belbek airfield is located to the north of  Sevastopol. It can receive any aircraft, including reserved  [liternyy] aircraft. The regiment itself has Su-27  fighter-interceptors in its inventory. Incidentally,  fully-graded emplacements were recently dug at Belbek.    It's possible that someone has undertaken to prove the need  for these and other units and large formations on the peninsula.  As we know, you can find the advisability in everything. Let's  note only that in the recent past they planned to reduce the  Ukrainian armed forces on the peninsula. Meanwhile, the strength  of the Ukrainian Armed Forces formation has increased from  15,000-18,000 to 51,000 men during the last 1-2 years.    It is curious that Ukrainian Minister of Defense General of  the Army Vitaliy Radetskiy responded with the following to Yuriy  Meshkov's statement on the initiation of demilitarization of the  Crimea precisely from the withdrawal of Ukrainian units: He said  that this issue is not within Meshkov's competence. Therefore,  it seems the opposite reaction has also not been excluded -- not  demilitarization but a further, drastic reinforcement of the  Ukrainian troop formation in the Crimea.    One spark is sufficient to start this "mechanism". And it's  good that the verbal attempts of Rukh [Popular Movement of the  Ukraine] leaders (we must recall at least Aleksandr  Lavrinovich's recent statement that the results of the elections  are a step toward the initiation of a confrontation in the  Crimea and in Ukraine), and that also the threats of certain  representatives of official Kiev and the leaders of the Crimean  Tatars' mejlis to begin the countdown toward a new cycle of  tension have not been carried out. Predictions with regard to a  nearly automatic annulment of the results of the presidential  elections in the Republic of the Crimea by Leonid Kravchuk and  also the shipment of a "punishing expedition of the Ukrainian  Army" to the "disobedient" peninsula have also not been  confirmed. The events of recent weeks in the Crimea have  occurred under the banner of the widely known but somewhat  differently interpreted sentence in reality: "Everything flows  but nothing changes".    The experience of recent years, when the replacements of  some  political leaders by others or some reformers by others have  introduced practically nothing, indicates that we have become  accustomed to the replacement of the decorations in the  "political theater" and that we can already relate quite calmly  to them. That calm in the Crimea can, at first glance, appear to  be strange. But political tension did not erupt immediately here  once again for several reasons.    We think that one of the main ones is that this is an  attempt  of certain prestigious experts to prevent the possible  development of the situation. It is clear, even to a  devil-may-care person, that warnings about careless steps that  could simply transform the Crimea into a "hot spot" similar to  Karabakh would have to take effect.    One more reason is Kiev's unexpected reaction, for some  people, to the events in the Crimea. It becomes quite  understandable if you look intently at the internal problems of  Ukraine itself. The Republic of Crimea's independence attempt is  already not that original. If you recall, Donetsk Oblast was the  first to set out on that path. And the principle of "don't shake  up" is not the most appropriate with regard to people who are  striving for a better life. It seems that they understood that  in Kiev. Furthermore, there are also concerns that are somewhat  more important than the Crimean presidency -- elections to the  Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. Today the distribution is as follows:  Here for the time being no one can provide guarantees that  events will not follow the "Belarus scenario". The population of  Ukraine is now judging its leaders based upon specific matters.  And there aren't many of them... It is no accident that  Ukrainian Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch said that if Yuriy  Meshkov manages to do anything at all for the residents of the  Crimea, he will "be green with envy of him".    A very important reason for the relative calm in the Crimea  is the fact that the political activity of the residents of the  Crimea, who invested the last, so to speak, political forces in  the elections of their president, has "petered out". It's as if  the peninsula's population has become frozen in anticipation,  having dwelled for the time being on one, let's state it  frankly, "delicate" question: Where do we go from here?    But meanwhile Meshkov himself, -- and we need to admit this  -- has become involved, in the opinion of many people, in a  hopeful political game with quite a deceptive economic result.  At least his first steps on the political scene did not give  trump cards to the radicals from both camps. The meeting in Kiev  and the constructively conducted negotiations in Moscow open  quite real prospects to the Crimea. And, if nothing interferes,  the "unsettled peninsula" could become a unique bridge for the  establishment of closer economic cooperation of the two states.  Partial support on the Russian ruble is a more than obvious  advantage for the people of Crimea themselves.    And the main aspect. We all know: Weapons are quiet where  money "works" and where a mutual economic interest is being  realized.    In a word, there aren't grounds to incite passions for no  reason but still it is impossible not to state the obvious. The  Ukrainian nationalistic wing that finally lost in the Crimea and  part of the Crimean Tatars will hardly reconcile themselves to  defeat and will stand in fierce opposition to the president. At  a low level of general and political culture, it is quite  probable that this confrontation will be far from constructive.  This will certainly add to Yuriy Meshkov's problems since it  will be easy to find inadequacies in his first steps, especially  while considering the inheritance he received. We can predict  with a slight margin of error that the opposition will throw  "its" mass media into the struggle with Meshkov and will attempt  to utilize its ties with Ukraine's supreme authorities. In a  word, today the residents of Crimea should in no way succumb to  euphoria. They must understand that rapid changes are simply  impossible.    The hottest heads are still attempting to accelerate the  process. Neither the methods nor the consequences are important.  A blockaded Sevastopol and Black Sea Fleet with their "oxygen  cut off" in all directions will appear on the maps. Red and blue  lines will appear -- the axes of someone's proposed strikes...    But nothing better will become of this for anyone.  Therefore,  the highest responsibility, thoughtfulness and care in making  decisions and the ability to resort to compromises are required  from the politicians and from the leaders of various levels,  including of the military departments. We need to finally  understand that we should in no way cut the Crimean knot. We  need to patiently and painstakingly untie it.</p>

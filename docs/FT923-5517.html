			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Fife Indmar tumbles Pounds 0.24m into the red The continuing recession, exceptional cost cutting expenses and higher interest charges left Fife Indmar, the engineering holding company, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 236,000 for the half year to June 30. Profits last time were Pounds 845,000. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 16.7m) but trading profits dropped to Pounds 442,000 (Pounds 1.19m). Exceptional costs were Pounds 174,000 (nil) and interest charges took Pounds 504,000 (Pounds 345,000). Looking ahead, Mr Gavin Hepburn, the chairman, was confident that with the distribution businesses continuing to do well, the action taken in other divisions would have a beneficial effect on second half results. Losses per share amounted to 1.53p (5.38p earnings) and the interim dividend is halved to 0.5p.</p>

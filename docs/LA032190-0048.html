			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> FLEURIAN, SEEDED 32ND, UPSETS BECKER IN THIRD ROUND  </P> <P> Jean Fleurian went into his match against Boris Becker with reservations.  </P> <P> He had to cancel them.  </P> <P> Fleurian upset the second-ranked Becker, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1, Tuesday in the third  round of the International Players Championships.  </P> <P> Fleurian, seeded 32nd in the tournament and ranked 46th in the world, had  trailed 3-1 in the first set when play was suspended Monday because of rain.  </P> <P> "I was supposed to take my plane flight home Monday night, and I was really mad  because I didn't make it," the Frenchman said.  </P> <P> "So I made it for tonight. Unfortunately, I won, and now I have to cancel it  again."  </P> <P> Fleurian said he was being realistic, not pessimistic, in booking a flight  before the match.  </P> <P> "When you play Boris, you'd better get ready to go back home," he said.  </P> <P> Fleurian also had to borrow a pair of shorts that were too big for him. He had  to use a safety pin to get them to fit.  </P> <P> Another upset winner was 30th-seeded Javier Sanchez of Spain, who beat No. 4  Brad Gilbert, 6-3, 6-7 (14-12), 7-6 (7-4). Gilbert delayed his defeat by  surviving five match points, including four in the second set.  </P> <P> Top-ranked Ivan Lendl advanced to the fourth round over Uruguay's Marcelo  Filippini, 6-0, 6-2, in another match suspended Monday because of rain.  </P> <P> Fifth-seeded Andre Agassi defeated Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden, 6-1, 6-3.  </P> <P> In a women's quarterfinal match, No. 1-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, who has yet to  lose a set in nine matches this month, beat Susan Sloane, 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> Also, No. 3 Monica Seles beat No. 13 Rosalyn Fairbank, 6-3, 6-4, and No. 4  Manuela Maleeva eliminated No. 10 Raffaella Reggi, 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.  </P></p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Account standards extended COMPANIES WILL be required to apply new accounting standards to all significant transactions regardless of when they took place, the Accounting Standards Board ruled yesterday. In a wide-ranging statement with important implications for covenants and other legal documents, the board stressed that any transactions that took place before a standard was introduced must comply with the new standard. Companies have claimed that adjustments to new standards could mean they breach contracts and agreements that specify limits on items such as net worth or gearing. But the board - with support from the British Banking Association - said this should be considered when contracts are drawn up, and renegotiated if necessary after new standards are introduced. Contracts will use the standards at the time of signing - so-called 'frozen GAAP' or generally accepted accounting principles. Mr David Tweedie, board chairman, said: 'This brings everyone on to a comparable basis. You must make sure covenants deal with accounting standards at the time of signing. We want to show it as it is.' The board argued that the exemption of certain transactions meant they were accounted for in different ways in the same set of accounts, and hindered comparisons.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jujuy, 7 Jun (NA) -- Carlos "Perro" ["Dog"]  Santillan (SEOM) [Trade Union of Municipal Employees and  Workers], leader of the Front of State Workers Unions [Frente de  Gremios Estatales], headed a march in San Salvador de Jujuy  today to protest a decree establishing a 150 percent salary  increase for government officials.    The combative trade union leader described the provincial  government's decision as "a slap in the face of the people of  Jujuy" because workers' wages are way below those earned by  government officials.    The mobilization, involving about 2,000 people, began at  about 1130 after representatives from various trade union  organizations held meetings at their respective headquarters and  then marched without incident to Belgrano Square in downtown San  Salvador de Jujuy.    The SEOM unionist was joined by former Zapla Blast Furnace  workers, retirees, Cederm (Secondary Education Center) members,  ADEP (Association of Provincial Teachers) members, and APUAP  (Association of Public Administration University Professionals)  members, among others.    Santillan noted that the salary increase for government  officials "is unconstitutional" because according to the  provincial constitution "the ministers' salaries must be  established by law."    Santillan added: "We, the trade unions, therefore went to  Belgrano Square. We want the decree to be abolished, or an  authorization for an equal increase for state workers."    The trade union leader stressed that "there was an excessive  increase -- even for municipal officials -- that reached about  200 percent." He asked for "a little respect and justice for  the workers."    Santillan indicated that it is contradictory for these  gentlemen to approve such an increase in Jujuy, "where there is  malnutrition and infant mortality, school desertion, and the  worst crisis in history."

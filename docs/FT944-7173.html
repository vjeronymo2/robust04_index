			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: BCH cuts payout after profits tumble 37.6% Banco Central Hispano (BCH), Spain's second biggest bank, yesterday cut its interim dividend by 31.8 per cent from Pta110 to Pta75, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. At the nine-month stage BCH posted a 37.6 per cent fall in its pre-tax profits to Pta45.3bn (Dollars 349m) after putting aside Pta106.6bn in provisions, 33.7 per cent more than in January-September last year. The dividend move, which was welcomed by analysts and institutions, is an unusual step for a domestic bank.</p>

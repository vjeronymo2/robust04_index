			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 May (DPA) -- The Cuban Government today  received a green light from the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP] to implement a drastic economic  adjustment program that includes an increase in prices and  tariffs on various products and services, the introduction of a  graduated tax system, and an eventual exchange of currency.    The decision was made after two days of debates at the ANPP,  which was convoked exclusively to analyze the fiscal deficit and  the excess of money in circulation, problems which worsened  dramatically after the collapse of Cuba's trade with its  partners in the extinct socialist bloc.    Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, announced  that the measures will be gradually applied in no less than 180  days.    The 600 parliamentary members unanimously approved the  resolution in the presence of President Fidel Castro Ruz and  also authorized an all-out struggle against black market  speculators and hoarders, resorting to "exceptional measures" if  necessary.    The resolution was drafted as an "agreement" that was read  by  ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon following a two-day debate during  which the participants discussed recommendations from "workers"  and from Minister Rodriguez.    First the ANPP asked the government to take the necessary  measures to reduce subsidies that cover enterprises' losses and  other budget expenditures, as well as to increase state revenues  and "significantly" reduce the fiscal deficit, calculated to be  4.8 billion pesos (equivalent to a dollar at the official  exchange rate) last year.    The ANPP also authorized the government to seek the  "stability" of funds deposited at the People's Savings Bank  (BPA), calculated to be approximately 6 billion pesos, which  represents 54 percent of the excess circulating money -- $11.636  million.    The resolution stated that the measures adopted to  eventually  immobilize those funds must be "consistent with the decisions  that will have repercussions on the amount of money in  circulation" but "must also protect the integrity of the BPA and  encourage savings."    It also authorized the government to adopt measures to  establish "adequate controls" on speculation with foreign  currency, which increased noticeably with the recent  "legalization" of the dollar, to guarantee "fulfillment of the  goals for which it was authorized and which correspond to the  measures adopted to put internal finances on a sound basis."    Referring to prices and tariffs for products and services,  the ANPP asked the government to "assess" an increase for  "selected products and services," particularly those "not  considered staples," including cigarettes and alcoholic  beverages, and tariffs on certain services, such as restaurants,  transportation, electricity, and water.    The resolution did not mention gasoline and lubricants,  although it is assumed that their prices will be increased as  suggested by Minister Rodriguez.    In another part of the agreement, the ANPP authorized the  government to "gradually" implement a "new overall tax system,"  the enforcement of which takes into consideration "essential  elements of social justice" to protect the sectors with the  lowest income and to encourage work and production.    The document specifically suggested considering the  "selective introduction" of an income tax, excluding salaries  and real estate.    Although authorities said the measures will not affect the  goals achieved in the education and health sector, the ANPP  suggested the implementation of a "contribution" from the  workers to finance social security.    Regarding an eventual exchange of currency, mentioned by  Minister Rodriguez as a probable weapon in the "arsenal" of  measures to counter the fiscal deficit and the excess of  circulating money, the ANPP recommended "examining the  advisability" of its implementation as "an element to complement  other measures and to be enforced when the time is right."    The legislative branch virtually gave Fidel Castro's  Government carte blanche by authorizing it to adopt other  measures that, in its opinion, are considered "adequate and  efficient" to put national finances on a sound basis.    When the announcement was made the legislators said the  actions to be carried out by the government, and which Castro  personally considered difficult "require the understanding and  support of our people" to "progressively overcome the current  circumstances."</p>

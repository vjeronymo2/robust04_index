			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 4 -- Mr. Pham Sy Ky, vice minister of  water resources and permanent vice chairman of the Vietnam  National Mekong Committee, has granted an interview to VIETNAM  NEWS AGENCY on the occasion of the first anniversary of the  signing of the joint communique on the Mekong cooperation and in  anticipation of a meeting of the group for compiling an  agreement on Mekong cooperation to be held in Vientiane, Laos.    Asked about the activities of the Mekong Working Group which  was established in accordance with the joint communique, Mr Pham  Sy Ky said:    "The four countries of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam  signed a joint communique on Mekong cooperation on Feb. 5, 1996  [date as received] in Hanoi. In this communique, they committed  to continue cooperation in exploitation of the Mekong River and  establish a Mekong Working Group with the task of drafting a  framework agreement for the future Mekong cooperation. [passage  omitted]    On the outstanding problems, Mr Ky said:    "The most important one is on the equitable and reasonable  utilization in detail of water in the main stream of the Mekong  River during dry season. Though four countries have agreed in  principle the equitable and reasonable utilization of water, but  have not yet agreed on detailed stipulations for that issue.    "With a view to respecting the legitimate right of the  countries in the basin, taking into consideration of the needs  of each country and with cooperative goodwill in utilization of  water in the Mekong River, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam have  flexibly applied international laws and good experiences from  some international river, i.e. the utilization of water in the  mainstream of Mekong River during dry season shall be subject to  prior consultation in the committee aiming at arriving an  agreement before any proposed use by any riparians. However,  Thailand has not yet agreed to the principle of prior  consultation for agreement before using water. Hopefully, with  goodwill for cooperation the deadlock will be overcome at the  forthcoming meetings and the agreement on Mekong cooperation  will be concluded."    Asked about some Thai newspaper reports saying that Thailand  is preparing a plan to divert water from the Mekong River to the  Chao Phraya River basin, Mr. Ky said: "THE NATION newspaper of  Thailand issued on 3 January 1993 carried out an article citing  the words of the minister of Prime Minister's Office of Thailand  on the diversion of Mekong water to the Chao Phraya River basin.  Nevertheless, the Vietnam National Mekong Committee is not yet  informed by the Thai side. We think that with goodwill for  cooperation if Thailand plans to build some structures to take  water from the Mekong mainstream, especially in the dry season,  Thailand should inform, consult with other countries in the  lower Mekong basin in order to assess the impact of its move to  other countries, and cooperate with the latter to find out  measures to solve problems if any with a view to arriving at  unanimity among the riparian countries before construction. The  consultation should begin at the stage of feasibility study.  Such consultations are very important for the Mekong  cooperation, regional cooperation and construction of mutual  trust."    Vietnam, upholding its respect for interests of other  countries and with its goodwill for cooperation, is ready to  discuss with other countries in the Mekong basin to find  satisfactory measures for the reasonable use of the river water  in order to meet the need of each country. We are sure that the  international community interested in the Mekong programme will  support such useful discussions, especially in the increasingly  improved situation in the region, Mr Ky said in conclusion.</p>

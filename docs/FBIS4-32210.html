			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Eva </F> Martinkova; place and date not given: "To This Day, I Have  Heard Nothing About Any Faction"]    [Text] [Martinkova] You have said that you know nothing  about any faction within the Civic Democratic Party [ODS]. Do  you accept the possibility that a faction could evolve sometime  in the future? Would you perceive it as a threat to the party's  integrity?    [Klaus] To this day, I have really heard nothing about this;  I have only read about it in LIDOVE NOVINY. Neither myself nor  the ODS leadership have yet come across another member of this  so-called faction. I also do not know how to interpret the word  faction in this context. The fact that various people in the  same political party have different views on the privatization  of CKD [engineering plant], on the privatization of Homolka  [Prague hospital], or on the size of the higher  self-administration units is simply logical, and I think that it  would be unnatural if this were not the case. Should the  consequence of this be that a political party will become  divided? It does not seem to me that this would lie ahead of us.    Let us define the word faction. Is this, perhaps, a small  group of people that is concerned more about restitution in  agriculture than any other small group? The fact that this  small group meets more often and has a more trenchant point of  view on this issue than the rest of the ODS is absolutely  logical. The word faction seems to me to be unnecessarily  strong and has a certain cautionary tinge for me. If we are  talking about groups of people with a different emphasis on  different things, then this certainly is not a faction. We have  always had strong agricultural and ecological groups and a group  dealing with railroad transportation within the ODS. I would  consider this to be natural and normal.    [Martinkova] The statistics for the first four months of  this year point to a slight decline in industrial output. The  result should be rising unemployment. It, however, is falling.  How do you explain these two contradictory trends?    [Klaus] How can these two contradictory figures be made  compatible by means of an explanation? This is just what I have  been talking about in Nove Straseci at a meeting with 80 labor  office managers. The explanation is very simple. There is a  third quantity, a third angle, the data entered into the column  headed labor force, that is, how many people there are at a  productive age. The level of employment or unemployment is  gauged on the labor force, not on the size of a country's  population. If there is a voluntary decline in employment, then  unemployment does not rise. To put it very simply -- if the  wives of well paid businessmen leave work to take care of their  families, this is projected into a decline in employment without  an increase in unemployment. The participation level, which is  the percentage of employed per number of inhabitants, was 51.2  percent in 1989. It then fell from year to year. The  preliminary figures for 1993 suggest 45.8 percent. That is, a  decline by more than 5 percentage points. If you carry this  over into quantitative figures, then this means that there are  roughly 500,000 citizens who are not now employed, but do not  regard themselves as unemployed. Otherwise, they would be  looking for work, they would be applying for support, and  unemployment would -- obviously -- be far higher, in fact three  times higher.    [Martinkova] Your wife has become a member of the CEZ [Czech  Energy Enterprises] board of directors. Are you not concerned  about accusations of a conflict of interest?    [Klaus] I am concerned about accusations from all possible  sides and about everything that I do and do not do. This is one  of those accusations in which I am absolutely innocent and about  which I have nothing to say. To this effect, I have to say that  my wife is a capable, independent individual. She is an  economist, she is an expert in finance, indeed, she has been  dealing with these issues the whole of her professional life and  I have nothing else to say about this. If the kind of articles  that have now appeared continue to crop up, she will be the one  who will feel discriminated against as a citizen of this country  and she will ask whether she deserves to be discriminated  against in her professional life because she is the prime  minister's wife.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> Regarding "Will Dianne Feinstein Play in Pacoima?" by Keith Love (Feb. 25): My  father, who was a minister in San Francisco, died suddenly in 1979. He was  prominent in the Bay Area, so there were politicians lining up to speak at his  funeral.  </P> <P> My family did not want to see a three-ring circus, so we made it clear that no  politicians would be allowed to speak or participate in the service. Although  our wishes for the most part were respected, I can still remember seeing these  elected officials standing conspicuously throughout the church.  </P> <P> As my family and I sat waiting in the limousine after the services, a woman  came to the car, leaned in, touched my mother's hand and spoke to her softly.  She shared her experience of recently losing a husband. Even through  tear-stained eyes I remember the look of true compassion and caring on Dianne  Feinstein's face. We hadn't known until that moment that she was at the church.  None of the other politicians even bothered to say anything to my mother.  </P> <P> I could sleep easily at night knowing that there is a person in the governor's  mansion who is not just a politician, but a real person.  </P> <P> SHERRI LYNN FORD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

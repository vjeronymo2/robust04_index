			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Skill shortage expected to cloud upturn THE recession has perman-ently changed companies' staffing patterns but as the economy picks up businesses are still likely to be affected by skill shortages, a survey of 350 companies by Reed Personnel Services found. The changes identified include: more central control over staffing, the restructuring and cross-training of a permanent core of staff, and greater use of flexible contracts. More than 80 per cent of companies said they wanted to hold on to these changes and would be able to do so. The survey says that companies have learnt to do more with less staff, but during the next six months 38 per cent of companies expect to take on permanent staff and 26 per cent temporary staff. A shortage of skilled staff will develop alongside continuing high unemployment for both unskilled staff and managers. Only 11 per cent of companies expect to take on more managers as the recession ends, but 33 per cent expect to take on more skilled staff. The number of skilled staff fell in only 20 per cent of companies as the recession deepened. Personnel departments also survived the recession relatively well, with staff cuts declining in only 17 per cent of companies. Several reports have been published to coincide with today's announcement of last month's unemployment figures which are expected to show another substantial rise. The Trades Union Congress said that on current trends employment will not start growing until 1994 and the AEEU engineering and electrical union has identified 22,500 manufacturing job losses since mid March, bringing the total for the year to 55,000. Recruitment consultant Alfred Marks says the number of permanent job vacancies continues to grow slowly. In the past three months vacancies are 14 per cent up on the first three months of the year. The number of employers offering paternity leave has nearly doubled over the past three years, according to the largest survey of personnel management in Europe by the Price Waterhouse Cranfield Project. The survey found companies maintained equal opportunities policies in spite of the recession.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Gore in flood control study STATE floodplain managers have begun working with the White House to develop new approaches to flood control, in the wake of the devastating Mississippi floods, George Graham writes. Mr Larry Larson, head of the floodplain management and dam safety programmes for Wisconsin and executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said yesterday his organisation had begun to work with Vice President Al Gore to find better ways of keeping people out of harm's way. He warned that many earthwork levees along the river were only designed to contain much lesser degrees of flooding. President Bill Clinton will sign a Dollars 6.3bn flood relief bill today in St Louis, Reuter reports. The government slashed projections for corn and soybean harvests and said crop losses are expected to total Dollars 2.5bn. Chicago market, Commodities Page</p>

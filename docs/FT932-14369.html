			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (9): Stay in touch from almost anywhere - Office in the sky THE rapid advance of silicon technology over the past decade has enabled the travelling businessman to stay in touch with the office from almost anywhere on the globe. Over the past decade the advent of high-powered lightweight notebook computers in particular has made portable computing a real option. By using a modem, the user can remotely send and retrieve information from virtually anywhere there is a telephone line. Today there is nothing surprising in the sight of a business executive struggling with a shoulder bag bursting at the seams with electronic gadgetry or opening a briefcase to reveal the latest in slimline notebook computers - and perhaps even a portable printer or fax machine. Soon, a new generation of pocket-sized machines called personal digital assistants will add a further dimension to the concept of the mobile office by combining the functions of a pen-based computer system and a mobile telecommunications device. Voice and data communications services are becoming more international. For example since last September it has been possible to contact business travellers in five European countries - Germany, France, Italy Switzerland and the UK - by pager using the Euromessage service provided by Hutchison Paging. Similarly, the introduction of digital cellular telephone services across Europe based on the pan-European GSM standard means that travellers will soon be able to use their mobile phone or even more conveniently, their GSM smartcard, anywhere in Europe. These terrestrial telecommunications developments are being mirrored by the introduction of new systems and services in the air. On many airlines, particularly in North America, the business air traveller will soon be offered all the voice and data telecommunications available in the office from the comfort of his airline seat. These new digital telecommunications services range from high quality voice telephony to facsimile and computer data links, together with a wide range of entertainment and information services. A basic air-to-ground public telephone service based on VHF radio has been available to passengers on many US carriers' domestic flights since the mid-1980s. The first passenger telephone call from an airliner was made in October 1984 on an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Chicago using the Airfone service. Until the beginning of last month, more than 26m calls had been made using the GTE Airfone system which is now installed in almost 2,000 jets operated by 11 US airlines. Most of the systems are seat-based, although a few of the earlier installations feature cordless bulkhead-mounted equipment. But despite the popularity of these services, which cost about Dollars 2 a minute for a domestic call, the technology behind them has some serious limitations. In particular, because it is based on older analogue radio telecommunications technology - like most terrestrial cellular telephone systems - call quality is not always what it should be. And because it relies upon the signal being passed from one ground station to the next, calls are sometimes dropped. In addition, the equipment on the aircraft is limited in its range to the line-of-sight between the aircraft and the nearest ground station - a maximum of about 200 miles. This means the service is limited to flights above continental America and up to about 200 miles out to sea. Most of these problems are being addressed by the introduction of new air-to-ground systems based on digital technology, and by satellite communications. Digital systems not only provide much clearer call quality, they also enable a wide range of value-added services to be offered. In the US, In-Flight Phone, an Illinois-based company, was the first to develop a digital communications system for aircraft passengers. Its Flight-Link system is based on 50 US ground stations and was developed over three years at a cost of Dollars 65m. Last month, following operational trials, USAir decided to install it in up to 402 of its aircraft by the end of 1994. In addition to air-to-ground, ground-to-air, air-to-air and seat-to-seat calling, the in-seat system can also provide a wide range of other services including facsimile and computer data transmission, computer video games, news and stock quotes and mail-order services. Credit cards are used to pay for all the services. FlightLink is being evaluated by a number of other US airlines and several in the Middle East. Meanwhile, GTE Airfone will introduce its own digital system, called GenStar, in mid-year. Like FlightLink it will also provide a host of new services including fax services and personal computer connections. GTE plans to have all existing Airfone installations converted to GenStar equipment by mid 1996. Meanwhile, Claircom Communications, formed in 1990 as a joint venture partnership between McCaw Cellular Communications and General Motor's Hughes Network Systems, has launched a service aimed at providing digital telecommunications systems for corporate jets as well as the commercial market. The company launched its AirOne system in 1992, with orders from Alaska, Southwest and Northwest to equip a total of 550 aircraft. All three US digital service providers are also linking up their systems with emerging satellite-based digital telecommunications systems to provide worldwide access. They will be compatible with the planned European terrestrial flight telephone system (TFTS). Unlike the competing US systems the TFTS will be a single system, initially covering all of western Europe. Competing service providers will use the same network of ground stations which will be operated by the national telecommunications organisations. However, delays in its construction have hampered the growth of passenger aircraft telecommunications in Europe. Indeed there is some doubt about whether such a system is needed at all. Although air-to-ground telephone systems will probably continue to provide the lowest-cost services and are most suited to short-haul flights, their limited coverage means that digital satellite-based service providers - such as the Skyphone consortium comprising British Telecom, Norwegian Telecom and Singapore Telecom - also have a key role to play, particularly for long-haul operators. The Skyphone consortium developed the first satellite-based passenger telephone service using International Maritime Satellite Organisation (Inmarsat) satellites in 1990. Singapore Airlines was the first commercial carrier to use Skyphone and is installing the service on all its long-haul fleet. According to Mr Graham Lamble, manager for Skyphone marketing support at BT, the Skyphone service is available on more than 100 aircraft today, most of them business jets. Skyphone provides both voice and data telecommunications and is due to add a facsimile facility in the near future. Another significant trend is that passenger telecommunications systems are being integrated with the increasingly sophisticated in-flight entertainment systems which most airlines are installing in their business and first-class cabins. But not all carriers believe that their customers want office-style telecommunications facilities at their airline seats. Some carriers, particularly those in Europe and many in east Asia, believe that their business customers would rather relax than work during flights. In research conducted by several airlines including Virgin, Cathay Pacific and British Airways, passengers put business services near the bottom of their list of priorities. BA conducted detailed interviews with 80 frequent business fliers 18 months ago and discovered that its passengers most wanted to use the time to relax before their next appointment. The passengers also emphasised that they wanted to manage their own time and be treated like individuals 'rather than pin-striped businessmen.' 'They do not want the seat turned into an office,' said Mr David Charlton, group brand manager for BA's long-haul fleet. Accordingly BA is trying to turn their seats into 'their favourite armchair in the sky.' Based on the research and trials, BA is still considering whether to install passenger telephones in business and first-class cabins for occasional use. Instead, it is emphasising passenger well-being and comfort by installing new Club World seats and a state-of-the-art eight-channel seat-back video system providing passengers with an unrivalled choice of viewing entertainment.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CITY TO OBSERVE PEACE DAY MAY 20  </P> <P> Fillmore will celebrate May 20 as "Peace Day," along with at least 35 other  California cities.  </P> <P> Last year, Gov. George Deukmejian declared the third Sunday in May as Peace  Day, in support of a resolution passed by the state Legislature.  </P> <P> The document was a collaboration between Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San  Jose) and the Peace Day Project in Santa Cruz, where Peace Day has been  celebrated since 1985.  </P> <P> Andrew Carman, a director of the Peace Day Project, said Peace Day was inspired  by a production of the musical play "Peace Child" by David Woolcombe, which  envisions a time in the future when Peace Day is celebrated internationally as  "the day when peace broke out throughout the world."  </P> <P> Fillmore joins 35 other California cities in proclaiming Peace Day, Carman  said. The Peace Day Project has contacted 456 mayors throughout California  inviting them to make Peace Day a state-wide event, Carman said.  </P> <P> The city has no plans to celebrate the day with organized festivities.

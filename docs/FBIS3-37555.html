			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 17 February broadcasts the "Details"  current affairs program introduced by Sergey Dorenko. Todays  program was devoted to media relations with the Russian  Government and State Duma and carried interviews with Duma  opposition personalities, including Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  Georgiy Zyuganov, and Aleksandr Nevzorov.    Dorenko begins the program by suggesting that the present  government was nostalgic for a previous age when it could  maintain strict secrecy around its work. He then reports from  the day's session of the Information Judicial Chamber under the  Russian Federation president, over which Anatoliy Vengerov was  presiding. The video shows the chamber at work.    Dorenko says that journalists attending the session had  attacked the government for refusing media access to cabinet  meetings two weeks previously. He then remarks that Vengerov  had shown pro-government leanings at the actual session.  Dorenko says that Vengerov had "twice thanked government  representatives for attending, and said that the press had  complaints to make, then corrected himself and said that they  were not complaints, but requests."    Dorenko then interviews Vengerov. When he suggests that the  public was being kept in the dark about government business,  Vengerov replies that official statements were released after  every cabinet meeting.    Returning to his commentary, Dorenko says that the  government  has defended its decision to bar access to journalists on the  grounds that there was not sufficient space to accommodate them  at the meetings. "Picture if you will, tens of thousands of  journalists at a cabinet meeting. Truly a monstrous sight. It  seems that it is not possible to find any bigger premises."    "The whole joke of it is," he continues, "that you will get  to learn of everything anyway, only you will have to get your  information from the government's enemies, among others." He  goes on to say that the reason for the government's secrecy is  that: "The government is busy with specific business. It is  portioning out your quite specific money and is accounting for  it not to you, but to the president."    The video then switches to Dorenko in the State Duma lobby,  where he remarks that, in contrast to the government, the Duma  is seeking as much media exposure as possible because it is  suffering from an "orphan complex." He says that the anti-media  sentiments of the last Russian parliament, which had "frequently  attempted to do away with" the liberal Soviet-era press law, had  continued into the Duma. A succession of opposition politicians  then comment on the media:    Vladimir Marychev, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia says: "The attitude of the Duma to the press is quite  simple. That is to say, that all deputies are united in saying  that where the press is concerned, the deputies have no chance  of the truth being told."    Communist Faction leader Gennadiy Zyuganov says: "It is  perfectly clear that a qualitatively new weapon is being used to  destroy and tear at our power: It is called the information  manipulation of public awareness."    Independent Deputy Aleksandr Nevzorov says: "To be perfectly  frank, I believe that there is nothing more filthy than the  so-called Russian press, and that this press has, for a long  time now, been waging a deliberate war against all directions of  authority and its own people. An information war for which  there is no reason and which is doing its utmost to befoul  practically everything. It is criminal to entrust any press  whatsoever with covering the activities of parliament."    Dorenko then quotes Zhirinovskiy as having written in "his  book" that journalists were "lonely, unfortunate people." Then  Zhirinovskiy is shown being interviewed: "I am the leader of the  party that won the elections. On the lists, we won on the 12  December. Therefore, journalists should be asking me about what  I think of the president's helpers. But here the opposite is  the case. Journalists ask the president's helpers what they  think of the parties."    Then Duma Deputy Anatoliy Dolgopolov, dressed in  Cossack-type regalia, complains that the press had reported that  deputies had "multimillion salaries," "reserved cars," and  "Bahamas lifestyles." Marychev then complains that media  attention is focussed on a handful of deputies such as "Vladimir  Volfovich, Gaydar, and Chubays."    Oleg Mironov, a Communist faction deputy, is then  interviewed. He, too, complains that "the work of the Duma is  reduced to Zhirinovskiy and talk about this or that privilege."  When the female interviewer points out that Zhirinovskiy  constantly insulted people, he replies: "We are not talking  about hiding anything, but a lot depends on the dosage."    Dorenko then remarks that many deputies saw the only  solution  to the coverage problem in live broadcasting of parliament.  Nevzorov is again interviewed. After referring to the "filth"  being put out by the press, he says that he is himself a "great  expert in the area of humiliating and destroying the body of  deputies. I see my own methods being used, albeit in an  unprofessional way. At least we used to do it with a sense of  humor." He then concludes: "This Duma is, of course, doomed.  There is no relay and the journalists cannot be trusted."    The video then switches to Zyuganov again: "Information and  television are now not the fourth estate, but the first, second,  third, and fourth, and a well-produced program directed against  the law or something else prevents all the other estates from  working properly. If we pass a law and the same evening a nice  commentator appears and begins to pad it out, then believe you  me, nobody in the country will obey that law."    Dorenko says that the Duma had adopted a law that day  instructing the state media to cover its work in weekly reports  in "Vesti," "Novosti," and "Details." Dorenko says that this  instruction is worthless because no mechanism has been  introduced to monitor the content of TV programs, and disarray  among Duma deputies meant that it would be difficult to create  such a mechanism.    He further points out that the Duma has no authority to  issue  instructions to the "Details" program as it was an independent  production. Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Duma's Media  Committee, is then interviewed.    Poltoranin says: "This does not mean that you are going to  get phone calls saying: Look here, Sergey, you are shooting  such-and-such a thing today -- well, you will have to drop it.  Nothing of the sort. All we mean is that where, for example,  we are debating the criminal codex or economic problems, we will  say to you: Listen, Seresha, there is an interesting topic being  worked on in the committees at the moment. It is important for  the fight against corruption, the fight against crime, it is  important for everyone, and we would like people to know what is  being done about it in the highest corridors of power. Then you  will say: Right, we will take a look. Who is dealing with it?  Then we will just tell you who to see and you go ahead and  judge for yourself."    Dorenko concludes by saying that there was nothing more  frightening for his program than "endearments from the  authorities."</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Industry hails Swedish Yes: Rise of krona fails to dent mood of optimism among big business The Swedish krona rose sharply yesterday in response to Sunday's referendum vote backing entry to the European Union. But though the increase might have damaged the earnings prospects of the country's big export-oriented multinationals, business leaders did not mind in the least. The clear endorsement of EU membership was exactly what they wanted - even though a weaker currency might have benefited them in the short term. 'It is the long term which is important,' said Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive of Volvo, Sweden's biggest industrial group. Mr Magnus Lemmel, head of the Federation of Swedish Industries, said: 'We can now begin our way back to our lost position at the top of the world's industrial countries.' Sweden's current economic recovery, after three years of recession, has been driven by the success of its exporters. It was not surprising, therefore, that the importance of EU membership for its big companies was highlighted repeatedly during the referendum campaign. The bosses of the country's multinationals stressed that they had to be able to operate under the same conditions as their competitors, as well as to influence the outcome of decisions affecting the business climate in Europe  -by far their largest market. 'Sweden's entire wellbeing stands or falls on its nearness to its markets, in particular to Europe,' said Mr Leif Johansson, president of Electrolux, the world's biggest manufacturer of household appliances. Membership was particularly important for the pulp and paper sector, Sweden's largest net export earning industry. Ever since Finland voted last month in favour of EU entry, Swedish forestry executives were worried they would lose out to their main European competitor if they were left outside the Union. Equally, they wanted to be able to influence directives coming out of Brussels, particularly where - as in the case of waste paper recycling  - there is a direct impact on the amount of Swedish virgin fibre going into the paper system. A further reason for business to back membership was the belief that EU monetary convergence criteria would force the government to be more disciplined in reducing the country's large budget deficit and fast-growing debt. They believe tougher government action will bring down interest rates, stimulating investment and creating jobs. Yesterday brought a glimpse of this brighter future. Long-term interest rates fell sharply, with the yield on the five-year benchmark bond dropping 19 basis points to 10.35. The stock market also celebrated, rising 2.34 per cent. A climate of greater investor confidence in Sweden should bring both increased domestic investment and a spurt in much needed foreign investment in the country.</p>

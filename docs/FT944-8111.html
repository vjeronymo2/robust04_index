			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Lifetime jobs may hurt company competitiveness Japan's tradition of lifetime employment may impair the competitiveness and hence the creditworthiness of some its largest companies, a leading credit-rating agency warned yesterday. A report* by the Tokyo unit of Moody's Investors Service says the agency has already 'incorporated some negative credit implications' in its ratings of sectors where Japanese companies are carrying much heavier staff costs than international competitors. These are banking, airlines, steel, chemicals, cement, paper and pulp. If this led to a reduced credit rating, their funding costs would rise. Moody's suspects these companies will be tempted to allocate capital inefficiently and expand sales, at the expense of profits, to be able to continue paying surplus employees. 'Without decisive changes. . . their positions within the global market will be threatened,' it warns. Lifetime employment, the preserve of Japan's top 300 to 400 companies, survived other recessions because it was seen as a competitive strength, as an aid to productivity and product quality. It may still be one for some car and electronics makers, the report says. But growing international (especially Asian) competition, in both cost and quality, plus the legacy of excessive Japanese industrial investment in the late 1980s, has left many companies bloated compared with their closest competitors. Economists agree that Japan's economic recovery will not be strong enough to absorb the full surplus of capital and labour, the report adds. As an example of how the need to provide jobs for life can affect managers' investment decisions, Moody's cites Japan's bulk chemicals industry. There have been mergers in this formerly fragmented sector, but the resulting economies of scale have been disappointing because the mergers were not followed by heavy redundancies. Steel companies' performance has been harmed by their strategy of launching often poorly performing diversifications, in theme parks, memory chips and food, for the sole purpose of employing surplus staff. General trading companies have failed to close unsuccessful diversifications, while banks' earning power has been 'dismal' over the past five years, partly because of their high employment costs, the report goes on. Not all sectors have been so reluctant to cut costs, however. Several shipbuilders cut their staff by up to 80 per cent during the 1980s, some textile companies cut their work force by half, and steel companies cut head office staff by up to 60 per cent late in the decade. But it took several years of losses to force them to take the plunge and many staff were shifted to subsidiaries or affiliates, on salaries subsidised by the parent company. Despite the high cost of lifetime employment, Moody's does not believe the system will quickly disintegrate. It is deeply entrenched because of the seniority-based salary system, whereby employees are underpaid for the first 20 years or so of their careers and then receive sharp pay rises, peaking in their 50s. In contrast, European and US salaries tend to peak when staff are in their 30s or 40s. Several leading manufacturers tried to move away from the social contract in 1992, but this attracted bad publicity and attacks on managements' credibility from the Labour Ministry. Others positively want to keep lifetime employment as a way of holding on to accumulated expertise. Unfortunately, argues Moody's, that is only a competitive advantage in a small number of high value-added sectors, where products and services are sold on quality rather than cost.

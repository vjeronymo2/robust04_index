			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Observer: Troops in or out? Lord Healey, who as plain Denis Healey sent British troops into Northern Ireland 25 years ago when defence minister in a Labour government, yesterday delivered a volte-face of impressive stature. Speaking at The Irish Fund of Great Britain's annual City luncheon, which despite its name was held in Whitehall, Healey revealed that his grandfather had been 'a Fenian from Fermanagh', and that he himself was a 'great believer in muck and magic'. But despite such a bellicose background, he chose to praise Prime Minister John Major for 'opening the door to talks'. There really was no practical alternative to talking to terrorists to solve political problems, he said. If only that thought had occurred to him 2 1/2 decades ago.</p>

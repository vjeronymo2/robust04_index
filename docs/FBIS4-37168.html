			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Sentiments expressed at the Jimmy Carter-Kim il-Song  meeting in Pyongyang and President Clinton's immediate response  have given rise to a glimmer of hope that the international  community would retrieve itself from the precipice of a  catastrophe. The former U.S. President Mr. Jimmy Carter at the  outset appeals for friendship, understanding, and trade, and  full diplomatic relations in return for total nuclear  inspections and a verifiable nonweapons production guarantee by  North Korea.    President Kim il-Song's reponse that it was suspicion and  lack of trust which led to the crisis. His call for direct  talks with Washington coupled with continued access to  international inspectors to monitor the Yongbyong nuclear  facility has brought good response from the United States.    President Clinton remarked that if North Korea means that it  is willing to freeze its nuclear program while talks take place,  this could be a promising step. Though an offer for nuclear  freeze made by President Kim il-Song in return for diplomatic  recognition and economic cooperation was spurned by President  Clinton, Jimmy Carter in his second round of talks today would  secure greater and convincing steps to guarantee that North  Korea is prepared to give up its nuclear intentions. President  Clinton's response comes at a time when China has firmly stated  that it will maintain its defense arrangement with North Korea  and it is against the sanctions. Russians also opposed it,  though on non-consultation and non- consideration of its  proposal of an international conference on the issue. With the  Security Council resolution on sanctions not materializing,  President Clinton would be left with the option to go it alone  with his allies Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, and  Britain. Without the powers to prevent merchant ships and  freight aircraft from reaching North Korea, the United States  would not be in a position to stop many nations and private  businessmen in its alliance countries from trading with  Pyongyang. Any move to prevent such trade could provoke North  Korea. Even if shunned by many countries, it has immense powers  to remain isolated and pursue its (?past). Beijing's support in  the face of American moves would also vitalize its strength.  Therefore, a more promising way out is constructive engagement  through direct negotiations between the United States and North  Korea. The second meeting between Jimmy Carter and President  Kim il-Song moving in that direction is promising. The two  could continue it in open negotiations or secret meetings.  China and Russia could then relent on a milder Security Council  resolution with more time for negotiations.</p>

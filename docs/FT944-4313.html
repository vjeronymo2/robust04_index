			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / East Europe impatient for seat at the top table A belated invitation from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to attend the concluding session of the European Union summit in Essen is not as humiliating as a summons from the Soviet leadership to attend a Comecon meeting in Moscow used to be. But neither is it the sort of open and frank dialogue which the six aspirant members from central Europe had hoped to establish with the EU in the five years since the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Attitudes east of the Elbe have changed while Brussels dithered over plans for the EU's Drang nach Osten (drive to the east). At first the nations liberated from the Soviet yoke blithely assumed that they would be safely scooped into the west's economic club, the EU, and its military safety net, Nato. But that vision of bliss born out of ignorance did not survive long. As central Europe plunged into painful shock therapy the EU sublimely sailed on to Maastricht while the western alliance as whole was diverted by the Gulf war and sucked into the Yugoslav vortex. To cap it all, recession sparked off anti-dumping and other restrictions on iron, steel and textile imports from eastern Europe and meat import bans for spurious sanitary reasons. The recipients of initial EU 'aid' also soon realised it took a form more convenient to the donors, like surplus grain and redundant civil servants, than useful to the recipients. When negotiations for 'association agreements' began in 1990, the central Europeans found that the Brussels view of trade was very similar to that of Comecon commissars: 'A jungle of complex quotas and haggling over the precise details of dried mushrooms', as Mr Andrzej Olechowski, in charge of Poland's negotiations with Brussels, describes the drawn-out process. Instead of a Marshall plan-like strategic vision of a united Europe, Brussels opted for nit-picking bilateral treaties with the individual applicants for eventual membership, adds Mr Janos Martonyi, Hungary's European affairs expert. The Copenhagen and Edinburgh EU summits and subsequent revisions to the bilateral association agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Poland and Slovakia have improved market access and opened the door to eventual full entry, without however specifying a timetable or clearly laying down the necessary criteria. Thanks to the relative openness of EU markets, Germany has replaced the former Soviet Union as the principal market and source of imports for all aspirant members, while trade with the EU states as a whole is also well over 50 per cent of their total. All aspirant members are showing strong, export-led growth and building up their laws and institutions to be EU-compatible. They are also re-establishing trade and other links with the former Soviet states - but on a private trade and contact level, not the rigid, hierarchical inter-party and inter-state basis of yesteryear. The six central European leaders invited to Essen are glad of the opportunity to be seen alongside their west European confreres at the farewell photo opportunity. The fastest possible integration into the EU remains the focal point of their economic and foreign policies. They see economic prosperity and ever growing investment and trade links as integral members of an enlarged EU as the more reliable basis for future security. But above all they want to be part of the negotiating process which redefines the political and economic shape of 21st-century Europe, not just on the sidelines of great events.</p>

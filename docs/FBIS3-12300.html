This crime happened yesterday, Friday, at dawn,  in this blessed month and in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque.    Those who passed away to meet with God the almighty are  among  the righteous martyrs and chaste ones. This consoles us and  eases our pains. Here, in this gathering and in this mosque,  and in any gathering that brings us together with kinsfolk and  brothers who are joining us in the one objective and genuine  Arab march, we are not meeting as officials and citizens. In  fact, we are meeting as brothers and kinsfolk, and as members of  one family. We all assume our responsibilities now and in the  future, hand in hand, brothers on the path of right and success,  God willing.    From this place, and on behalf of all my kinsfolk, brothers,  and beloved ones, we emphasize to the kinsfolk, the brothers,  and beloved ones in Hebron and in all the other occupied  Palestinian territories, that we are with them, not only in  these moments but in every moment in this life, in terms of  patience, endurance, adherence to the land, defense of justice,  and confidence in the inevitable triumph of justice in the long  run.    We are with the kinsfolk under hard circumstances and in  confronting the continuing crucial test and suffering. We are  with them with all of our resources and capabilities, the  brothers, kinsfolk, and beloved ones who are the families of the  martyrs and wounded, who fell as victims of this heinous crime.</p>

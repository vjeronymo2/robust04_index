			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chrysler, General Motors debt ratings downgraded THE SEVERE financial pressures facing the US automobile industry were underscored yesterday when one credit agency lowered its rating of General Motors' debt and another downgraded Chrysler. However, GM, the biggest of the US car manufacturers, could claim a victory of sorts in that Moody's Investors Service, the agency which lowered its senior debt rating, did not downgrade the short-term commercial paper issued by General Motor Acceptance Corp (GMAC), its finance arm. GMAC, the largest non-bank financial group in the US, relies on commercial paper for much of its funding needs. A downgrading by Moody's or Standard &amp; Poor's, the most influential rating agencies, would have impeded its ability to tap this market, forcing it to pay higher interest rates. Moody's cut its rating of GM and GMAC's senior debt from A1 to A2 but maintained its Prime-1 rating on GMAC's commercial paper. Fears of a downgrade were a major factor behind GM's announcement last month of a big restructuring, including the closure of over 20 plants and 70,000 job losses over the next four years. However, Moody's said its action was based on the fact that 'GM's long-term competitive position may continue to weaken despite an expected improvement in the company's cost structure and competitive efficiency'. Standard &amp; Poor's, which has yet to comment on GM, yesterday cut its ratings for Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three motor manufacturers, and Chrysler Financial, its finance arm, from double-B-minus to single-B-plus. S&amp;P said the reasons included the weakness of the US automobile market and the fact that Chrysler had not taken action to improve access to the capital markets for its important and profitable finance arm, Chrysler Financial. Chrysler said it was disappointed at the move, which was 'not warranted by the current financial outlook'.</p>

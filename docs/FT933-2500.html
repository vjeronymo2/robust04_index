			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Investment agencies face fight for funds INWARD investment agencies in the UK face sharply increased worldwide competition in the 1990s to secure a much reduced number of new greenfield projects, Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Northern Development Company, warned yesterday. Globalisation of production also poses a threat as international companies operating at world-class manufacturing standards concentrate production on only a few plants worldwide, instead of investing in capacity in every market they serve. Addressing the annual general meeting of the NDC, the economic regeneration body for north-east England and Cumbria, Sir Ron said that much of the inward investment in the 1980s was driven by the need for international companies' to be inside the European Community as the single market approached. Since early 1985, the NDC area attracted more than 320 investments from overseas, worth Pounds 3bn, with 37,000 jobs. This was more than 10 per cent of all UK inward investment in the 1980s. Sir Ron said competition for the fewer investments now available was coming not only from EC countries but eastern and central Europe; equally companies serving world markets were looking at sites in the Pacific Rim, South East Asia and Central America. Against this 'bleak analysis', said Sir Ron, it would be wrong to draw too much comfort in regional terms from the emergence of the domestic economy from recession, excellent news though that was. Nor could the north, in spite of the fact that it has the UK's highest regional unemployment, expect great help from outside as the entire nation had problems.</p>

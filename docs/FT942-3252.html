			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries improve after better inflation news US Treasury bonds improved yesterday after the day's economic news relieved the market's lingering concerns over monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 higher at 87 7/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.309 per cent. The two-year note was  1/8 better at 100 5/32 , to yield 5.771 per cent. Bonds made a moderate move higher in early trading after the Labour Department reported that consumer prices in May had risen by a benign 0.2 per cent. When the more volatile food and energy sectors were excluded, core CPI came in a 0.3 per cent. Both figures matched the consensus forecast of economists. The data eased concern that inflation might have begun to climb. Such misgivings resurfaced last Friday, when the core producer price index slightly exceeded expectations. Yesterday the positive sentiment was reinforced by news of a 0.2 per cent decline in May retail sales. Analysts had projected no change in the reading. As a result, bonds consolidated their gains. In the afternoon, however, profit-takers moved in when Johnson Redbook reported a solid upturn in retail sales in the first two weeks of June. European government bonds had another roller-coaster day, falling sharply in the morning and rallying in the afternoon to close little changed. The early sell-off was largely due to technical selling in the futures market and nervousness ahead of US inflation and retail sales data. When these turned out better than expected, US Treasuries rose, pulling European bonds higher. Despite sterling's weakness, UK gilts put in a strong performance, buoyed in the afternoon by the better US trend. However, most of the action was reported to have taken place in the futures market. 'Most investors think the market's cheap but aren't willing to commit any money to it,' said one dealer. Most traders today will be watching a barrage of data, including May retail prices, May unemployment and April average earnings data. 'The average earnings will be the most closely watched after strong numbers in the last few months,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at HSBC Greenwell. If average earnings come in at 4 1/2 per cent 'gilts will have another horrible day,' he said. The consensus forecast is for a 4 per cent rise in average earnings. Traders will also be looking to chancellor Kenneth Clarke's Mansion House speech tonight. German bonds fell sharply in the morning in futures-driven trading and bounced back after the US data. Weak April retail sales numbers had little impact on bunds. 'The market has still not refocused on fundamentals, which are being overridden by technical and external factors,' said Mr Torsten Bohler, senior bond analyst at UBS. In Austria, the government cancelled a planned auction of a five-year bond which was to have totalled Sch10bn, triggering a spurt of short-covering in the five-year area. Dutch bonds tracked German bunds despite the Dutch central bank's 10 basis point cut in its special advances rate to 4.90 per cent. 'The cut was largely a technical adjustment on the back of guilder strength,' said Mr Bohler. Despite the Swedish central bank's three basis point cut in its repo rate to 6.92 per cent, Swedish bonds plunged in the morning on heavy foreign selling, which also pressured the currency, before recouping most of the losses. While many analysts now see value in the market, 'with the political uncertainty ahead of the September election and the November EU referendum, and the economic risks associated with the strengthening recovery, we see the risk of further yield curve steepening in the months ahead,' warned Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at market analysts IDEA. In Finland, market participants are eyeing today's vote of confidence for Prime Minister Esko Aho's government, which, he warned yesterday, would resign unless it received sufficient assurance of political support for its handling of the EU membership process. Italian bonds were dragged off their lows by the recovery in other markets, but further advances are expected to be capped by today's issuance of new 10-year bonds and continued uncertainty about the size of the budget deficit.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> OPEN FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> 'LOOK': A FUNNY DEATH WARMED OVER  </P> <P> Show up for "One Last Look," a play at Crossroads Theatre, and a  flower-bedecked casket is stage center. Services open with soaring gospels and  spirituals from a robed women's chorale.  </P> <P> When mourners in the funeral parlor get up to peer into the box at the late  Eustace Baylor, you begin to feel queasy. Did you take the wrong turnoff?  </P> <P> Suddenly there's a vocal fuss at the back of the house. At the same time, a  blind man with a cane stumbles up to the coffin and sticks his hand into the  open casket to feel if it's really old Eustace. A brawl erupts when rival  members of the deceased's extended families -- his West Indian wife and his  African-American mistress (and their warring offspring) -- fight over who is  going to sit where.  </P> <P> Even the ghost of Eustace (a droll Lincoln Kilpatrick) shows up. This is an  uproarious show, death warmed over, with some unexpected scorching drama  (particularly from the wives, Masequa Myers and Amentha Dymally). There is a  hilarious turn by busybody griever Susie Garrett, who carps about those "West  Indian monkeys." Raymond Allen's formal Harlem funeral director has his hands  full.  </P> <P> Directed by Edmund J. Cambridge and set in 1962, the production is the final  play of a trilogy by Steve Carter ("Eden" and "Nevis Mountain Dew") exploring  relationships between African and Caribbean Americans.  </P> <P> The production is a promising send-off for the comfortable smaller theater in  Crossroads' new home in the Leimert-Crenshaw district.  </P> <P> At 4310 Degnan Blvd., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m., through  Oct. 7. $12. (213) 291-7321. RAY LOYND  </P></p>

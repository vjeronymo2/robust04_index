			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady as FOMC leaves rates unchanged The dollar yesterday showed little response to the decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave US interest rates unchanged, writes Philip Gawith. The decision had been expected, but the chance of a surprise monetary tightening had left traders cautious ahead of the meeting. The US currency closed in London at DM1.5720, from DM1.5738, and at Y100.13 from Y100.155. Soon after the meeting finished, around 19.15 GMT, the dollar was trading at DM1.57. It ended in New York at DM1.5701 and Y100.17. The main excitement came from Mexico, where the government sanctioned a 15 per cent devaluation of the peso. The upper limit of the peso's trading band against the dollar was raised by 53 centavos. The daily rate at which the peso is permitted to slide against the dollar, equivalent to 4.3 per cent in a year, was maintained after the devaluation. The peso finished in London at 3.885 against the dollar, 12 per cent down from Monday's close of 3.4647. In Europe the lira remained the main focus, ahead of the no confidence vote later this week. It touched a record low of L1,049.80 against the D-Mark, but the market shied away from pushing it through the L1,050 barrier. Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade-weighted index ending unchanged at 80.3. The decision to devalue the peso was taken by members of the Pact for Well-Being, Stability and Growth. They include government, business, labour and campesino leaders. The Pact said the decision to allow the peso to slide was taken in response to rebel threats in the Chiapas region that have recently unsettled Mexican financial markets. A growing current account deficit, however, provides an economic explanation for currency weakness. Before yesterday's move, some observers had considered the peso overvalued, in spite of having fallen by more than 10 per cent against the dollar during the year. Mexico's current account deficit is expected to widen to about Dollars 28bn this year, more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product. With capital flows insufficient to finance the deficit, reserves have fallen by about Dollars 10bn since February, and short-term interest rates have risen above 14 per cent, more than 7 per cent in real terms. Some economists argued that for interest rates to come down and economic growth to accelerate, above the 3 per cent expected for this year, a devaluation was necessary. Until yesterday, the government had been opposed to a devaluation, arguing that interest rates would still rise, to quell concerns about imported inflation, while Mexican companies with large foreign currency loans would suffer heavy losses. Last week Mr Jaime Serra Puche, finance minister, said the peso would be defended with higher interest rates, at the expense of 1995 growth targets. The bellwether interest rate on the 91-day tesobono, a dollar-denominated money market instrument, rose after the announcement by 88 basis points to 8.28 per cent. The Pact said, however, that Mexico would be able to meet its economic goals in 1995, particularly that of price stability, supply and economic growth. The dollar showed little response to the release of October trade figures, in spite of a widening in the bilateral deficit with Japan. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, analysts said the dollar had limited downside if interest rates were kept on hold. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said investors were expecting the dollar to move higher in 1995. After meeting recently with a cross-section of the firm's US clients, he said he 'did not come across anybody who was bearish on the dollar'. His view that the dollar would reach DM1.65/70 next year, possibly in the first quarter, 'seemed to be generally accepted'. Mr MacKinnon added that rising German interest rates - he expects the first upward move in the first quarter of 1995 - would cap the dollar's progress. He said it was also his impression that the Bundesbank did not like the D-Mark slipping through the DM1.70 level against the dollar. The Bank of England cleared an Pounds 850m money market shortage, mostly through late assistance.</p>

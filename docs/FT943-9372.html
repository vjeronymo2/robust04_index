			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: O&amp;Y's US creditors in foreclosure proceedings Creditors of the US arm of Olympia &amp; York, the failed Canadian property group, said they no longer intend to pay O&amp;Y Dollars 3.5m under the terms of a deal struck in March. The unofficial committee of the creditors, who hold Dollars 200m in bonds secured by a property in lower Manhattan, added they would begin foreclosure proceedings this week to gain ownership of the building. The move was prompted by 'Olympia &amp; York's unwillingness or inability to address in a timely manner major substantive issues' of its reorganisation, the committee said. In March, the holders of mortgage notes secured by the property, 59 Maiden Lane, agreed to pay O&amp;Y Dollars 3.5m in return for an agreement to transfer ownership. The deal was seen as quietening a combative group of creditors at a time when the group was is struggling to restructure Dollars 5bn of debt. The creditors say they are taking a 'non-consensual approach' to securing ownership. They plan to file a foreclosure complaint, the first step of proceedings, with the Supreme Court of New York state later this week. NationsBank of Tennessee, the trustee for the mortgage notes, which will pursue foreclosure proceedings under the committee's direction, will distribute Dollars 7m to note-holders on August 22 from excess cashflow generated by the building, the committee said.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Healthy BP increases dividend British Petroleum yesterday capped its return to robust health with a 20 per cent rise in its first quarter dividend to 2.5 pence a share. It was the first such increase since 1992, when structural weaknesses and mounting debt caused it to cut the payout to shareholders. Investors welcomed the the signal of renewed confidence, and BP shares rose 16 1/2 p to close at 399 1/2 p. Mr David Simon, chief executive, said the BP board was confident that the company could operate profitably even with relatively low oil prices. 'It was the right time to share some of the benefits' of BP's successful cost-cutting, he said. The company warned investors not to expect the same pace of dividend growth, although it 'intends to grow the dividend progressively'. The first quarter results exceeded analysts' expectations. Replacement cost net profits before exceptional items were Pounds 305m, 32 per cent up on the Pounds 231m recorded in the first quarter of 1993. Earnings per share were 5.6p (4.3p). After an exceptional gain of Pounds 23m (Pounds 18m a year earlier), net profits were Pounds 328m (Pounds 249m). The company attributed the performance to success at cutting costs, higher production volumes and wider refining margins in the US. The chemicals division returned to profit after 18 months. It was the third successive quarter in which BP was cash positive excluding proceeds from divestments. Net cash inflow excluding disposals was Pounds 342m, although the average North Sea oil price in the first quarter was Dollars 13.92, 25 per cent lower than in 1993. Analysts say BP's ability to generate large amounts of cash at low oil prices probably persuaded the board it was safe to raise the dividend, even though the company has not met all the targets it set when it cut the dividend. These were: capital expenditure of Dollars 5bn a year or less; annual debt reduction of Dollars 1bn or more; and Dollars 2bn in replacement cost profits. Mr Simon said debt now stands at Dollars 11.8bn (down Dollars 593m in the quarter), its lowest level since 1988. About Dollars 400m has been raised from disposals so far this year, with Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn expected for the full year. That would bring full-year gearing down to 66 per cent, according to company officials. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / The Property Market: One acquisition too many The appointment this week of administrative receivers to Randsworth Acquisition, the West End property company, marks a sorry end to the first excursion by US pension funds into the UK property market. The US pension funds which joined JMB Realty, a Chicago-based investment group, in making a Pounds 258m bid for Randsworth at the peak of the market in 1989, have made heavy losses. JMB also made large losses on its stakes in Rosehaugh and Priest Marians, two high-flying property companies that were brought to their knees by the decline in the market. The Randsworth deal suffered from a combination of poor timing and the highly-geared nature of the acquisition vehicle. Randsworth was bought at the peak of the market, at a 2 per cent premium to net asset value. Citibank injected Pounds 180m of debt, while the investors put in Pounds 95m of equity and Pounds 95m of loan notes. A relatively small decline in the value of the underlying company, Randsworth Trust, which had borrowings of its own, could wipe out the value of the equity in Randsworth itself. The administrative receivers, KPMG Peat Marwick, have not yet gone through Randsworth's books. But in April 1991, Credit Suisse First Boston calculated that the portfolio's value was Pounds 327m. The portfolio, which is concentrated in shops and offices in the West End, has probably fallen in value since then. Set against these assets are the claims of creditors, which lent some Pounds 450m to Randsworth, according to CSFB. The most secure are the debenture holders, which have the first claim against Pounds 135m of the assets of London &amp; Provincial Shop Centres, Randsworth's chief subsidiary. Then there is Pounds 209m of bank debt, which is secured by first and second charges on the property and a floating charge on other assets. Loan note holders and equity investors are at the end of the queue. Randsworth has not gone down without a fight. In early 1991, it raised a further Pounds 58m from its shareholders. But over the past 15 months, its attempts to raise more equity or persuade its bank to swap debt to equity have failed. This debacle has largely deterred other US investors from making excursions into the UK property market. Even JMB, which expects to make further property investments in Europe, says there may be 'a short term negative effect from Randsworth'.</p>

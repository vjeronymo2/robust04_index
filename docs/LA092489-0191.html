			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TRACING THE BITTER ROOTS OF SCHOOL DISTRICT'S DISCONTENT  </P> <P> The telephone answering machine at the Rancho Palos Verdes home of Bob and Dawn  Henry greets callers with the chorus of the 1961 hit song, "Hit the Road Jack."  </P> <P> "What a catchy tune," Bob Henry chimes in after the chorus. "We know it's No. 1  in your hearts. On Nov. 7, let's make it No. 1 on the charts."  </P> <P> The message is aimed at Jack Price, 58, superintendent of the Palos Verdes  Peninsula Unified School District for the last seven years and, for the last  two, nemesis of the East Peninsula Educational Council, a parents' group that  wants him fired.  </P> <P> The group, which includes the Henrys, has fought desperately to keep Miraleste  High School open, despite the school board's decision that the east side school  should be closed because of declining enrollment. Three candidates seeking  Price's ouster -- Peter Gardner, Barry Hildebrand and Maryanne Kipper --  resigned from the group to run for the school board this November.  </P> <P> At the same time, Price and school board members have been been forced to  defend themselves against a lawsuit that alleges they cost the district more  than $1.5 million by failing to get top dollar for surplus school property and  by selectively forgiving developer fees.  </P> <P> "I want to see public officials held accountable," said Janet McAuley, who  lives in Palos Verdes Estates and who filed the lawsuit last year with Rancho  Palos Verdes resident Richard Smith, a Lynwood High School teacher. "I really  believe once the public is informed they won't tolerate this."  </P> <P> School board President Jeffrey Younggren, Price and other school district  officials view the actions by the parents' group and the lawsuit as a  coordinated attempt to discredit them in the eyes of the community. Younggren  calls the lawsuit a "witch hunt." Price said he believes the lawsuit, as well  as the east side parents' actions, are an attempt "to bring the district to its  knees."  </P> <P> "This is a classic case study in fanaticism," Price said. "It's been a  nightmare."  </P> <P> McAuley denies that her legal action is related to the district's decision to  close Miraleste, although she and the parents' group say they are united in  their belief that the district is not managed properly.  </P> <P> About the only thing all sides agree on is that although district students  consistently achieve lofty scores on California achievement tests, their  parents and some school officials have sometimes taken the low road in their  disputes.  </P> <P> Both sides point to slashed tires, mutilated pets, mailboxes knocked over and  acts of minor vandalism. Neither side has any proof of the identity of the  perpetrators.  </P> <P> "This is . . . a highly competitive, very aggressive, very wealthy community of  individuals who in many ways made their success by not buckling under, but  going for the jugular," said Younggren, a psychologist who drives a fire  engine-red Ferrari. "And we see that here."  </P> <P> For example, Ted Gibbs, spokesman for the parents' group, says his phone rings  three times every morning at 5 a.m.; there is never anyone on the other end.  </P> <P> Price says he also used to get early morning phone calls, as well as obscene  letters and poems urging him to leave the district. Twice, he said, urine was  splattered over his office door.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sequence of Loans  </P> <P> The personal attacks against Price have included allegations by some critics  that he has used district time to write some of the six textbooks he has  co-authored. Price denies that and says he is irate that McAuley and Dawn Henry  have publicized his personal finances, including a sequence of loans totaling  $2 million that he took out in the last four years to finance a home and pay  off bills.  </P> <P> Price said it drives his detractors crazy wondering how he can make the  payments on the loans. In addition to his $82,150 annual salary as  superintendent, he says he also earns more than $100,000 a year in textbook  royalties, and his wife is paid about $70,000 as an administrator for the  Pomona Unified School District.  </P> <P> "Dave Capelouto (assistant superintendent in charge of finance) and I are  supposed to be two crooks," Price says, adding that he has never profited  personally from any of the district's real estate or other business dealings.  </P> <P> But there is no question that Price has tried to get in a few licks against his  opponents himself.  </P> <P> After Bob Henry made inquiries about Price in Vista, the San Diego County city  where Price was school superintendent before resigning to take the Palos Verdes  position, Price wrote a letter to Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores.  </P> <P> In the letter, Price questions whether Henry, who is director of management  services for the Harbor Department, had been sleuthing for the parents' group  during the workday. Explaining that his own inquiries to the Harbor Department  had been rebuffed, Price asked Flores in his March 15, 1988, letter to find out  if Henry took vacation time to conduct his detective work.  </P> <P> "I am certain that you can find out," Price wrote. "You do not need to tell me.  It is enough to know that you will be certain that public funds are not  expended on private business."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used Vacation Time  </P> <P> Bill Stein, director of port administration, wrote the councilwoman that Henry  had used vacation time for his research, with Stein's prior approval.  </P> <P> The critics' feelings against Price became particularly inflamed after he  appeared before the Rolling Hill Estates City Council in April and argued in  favor of expansion plans by the private Peninsula Heritage School.  </P> <P> "It shocked, saddened and sickened me to hear this man speak in support of  expansion plans of a private school system, at a time when we are fighting  tooth and nail to keep our present school system from closing down one school  after another on the hill," Glenda Urmacha wrote in a letter to The Times.  </P> <P> " . . . With friends like this, the Palos Verdes school system needs no  enemies."  </P> <P> Price says that in nearly four decades as an educator, he has never been  subject to the character assassination or charges of mismanagement now leveled  against him.  </P> <P> However, Lance Vollmer, a Vista school board member, says he ran for election  in 1983 on a platform to fire Price. Vollmer had criticized Price, who left the  district before the election, for his handling of some land trades that Vollmer  said led to an FBI investigation. No indictments were issued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FBI Investigation  </P> <P> In a 1983 interview with The Times, Price acknowledged that there had been an  an FBI investigation but said he did not know "what they were looking for."  </P> <P> Public displays of animosity have lessened somewhat since the State Board of  Education ruled Sept. 8 that peninsula voters should not be allowed to decide  whether a separate school district should be formed on the east side. The  parents' group had petitioned the state panel for the election after the local  school board decided to close Miraleste, the only high school on the east side.  </P> <P> The district, faced with a legal challenge by the parents' group, is preparing  a court-ordered environmental impact report on the Miraleste closing and other  closures throughout the district. The report is scheduled to be complete in  early October.  </P> <P> At the heart of the dispute between the school district and the parents' group  is the issue of declining enrollment throughout the district. In the early  '70s, the district had nearly 18,000 students, a number that has since declined  to 8,800.  </P> <P> As a result, the district in recent years has closed five elementary and two  intermediate schools and has sold six parcels of land that had been earmarked  for future school construction. Although the district's own demographer  projects a slight increase in students to between 11,000 and 12,000 by 1993,  Price believes the district will never be as large as it once was.  </P> <P> "The property up here is too expensive (for young families)," Price said.  "Secondly, we are almost all built out. . . . There isn't much space for new  housing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Projections Disputed  </P> <P> The parents' group disagrees with the district's demographic projections and  with its earlier decisions to sell surplus property outright instead of  retaining ownership in case it is needed in the future. Nancy Bolton, a  demographer who has been active in the group, contends that, by closing  schools, the district is making "permanent solutions to a temporary problem."  She contends that more families with children will move onto the peninsula in  coming years as its present population grows gray.  </P> <P> "I know housing is expensive here," Bolton said, "but it is expensive in a lot  of places. . . . It is not at all unrealistic to think in seven or eight years  we could have 14,000 or 15,000 (students) because this is an area of mostly  single-family homes."  </P> <P> The $6.65-million sale of the Peninsula High site in Rolling Hills Estates in  January, 1987, has become the chief exhibit for McAuley and Smith, who contend  that the school board and administration fell short in their stewardship of  public property. School officials say they did well in selling the site, which  had been earmarked for a high school but had never been developed.  </P> <P> In 1987, when the school district faced a budget shortfall, it disposed of the  36-acre site, giving 10 acres to the city of Rolling Hills Estates for  recreation, and selling the remainder, which was zoned for 72 home sites, many  with views.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expanse of Dirt  </P> <P> The site today is a cleared expanse of dirt. Plans call for a first phase of 44  homes ranging in price from almost $700,000 to about $850,000, with completion  in 1990. A second phase of 28 larger homes, tentatively priced at $2 million  each, is scheduled for completion in the next three years.  </P> <P> McAuley says she has obtained internal documents, prepared by the developer who  bought the site, that show each home site was worth $250,000 after streets and  utilities were put in. By her calculations, the school system should have made  as much as $15 million on the sale.  </P> <P> "I am at a loss why the school system would forgo a profit of that magnitude in  a rapidly rising real estate market," she said.  </P> <P> School board candidate Barry Hildebrand, citing a school site sale in Manhattan  Beach, said other school systems did better with similar sales. In that sale,  the Manhattan Beach school district obtained a tract map for the 4.2-acre  Manhattan Beach Heights Elementary School site and sold it in October, 1988,  for $10 million.  </P> <P> Hildebrand said the school board and administration mishandled the Peninsula  High sale by using an outdated appraisal that was too low to start with and by  giving the developer concessions worth $500,000. McAuley and Smith make the  same allegations in their lawsuit.  </P> <P> "The way they handled that sale says to me that the school board and the  administration are not concerned about the kids of the peninsula," Hildebrand  said. "It says to me they are more concerned about their friends in real  estate. They gave it away."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defended Sale  </P> <P> Younggren, speaking for school board members, defended all aspects of the sale.  The critics of the school board are "looking for a commie under every bed," he  said.  </P> <P> "I feel the bidding was competitive and we marketed the property the best we  could," Younggren said.  </P> <P> Price emphasized that the school system got about 20% more than the  $5.4-million appraised value of the land. He said the district got what the  market was willing to pay and added that he and other school officials are  educators, not developers.  </P> <P> A development group composed of Goldrich &amp; Kest Industries and California  Coast Development Group Inc. was awarded the bid for the site on Nov. 17, 1986,  and on June 7, 1988, paid $6.65 million for the property.  </P> <P> One of the losing bidders, developer Ron Florance, a former councilman in Palos  Verdes Estates, said the school system would have made much more money if it  had accepted his offer to form a partnership.  </P> <P> A consultant's memo to the board that evaluated Florance's bid labeled it  "speculative with inherent risks."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 50% of Profits  </P> <P> Florance was willing to pay the $5.4 million appraised value within two years  and cut in the school system for 50% of the profits from the development,  according to district documents.  </P> <P> "They would have got double for the property," Florance said.  </P> <P> "We were in a rising market. You had to be deaf, dumb and blind not to  recognize that."  </P> <P> Price said neither Florance nor another developer who proposed a similar  development supplied the district with sufficient details.  </P> <P> The second main accusation made by McAuley and Smith about the school board's  handling of financial matters concerns developer fees. They allege that Price  and Capelouto cost the district more than $500,000 by needlessly granting  exemptions to developers, even though the granting of the exemptions violated a  school board resolution.  </P> <P> In 1987, the board voted to impose a fee of $1.50 per square foot on  residential construction and 25 cents per square foot for commercial  development beginning June 27 of that year. Under state law, school districts  are entitled to adopt such fees under the theory that new development will draw  more children into a community.  </P> <P> At the meeting on April 24, 1987, where the resolution imposing fees was  passed, the board discussed exemptions for people who had begun development  plans but decided not to grant any.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Began Granting Exemptions  </P> <P> Three days before the fees took effect, however, the district began granting  exemptions. The practice continues under a board policy adopted in June, 1988.  </P> <P> Capelouto later told state auditors that he granted exemptions to local  developers who could show that they had submitted a building permit application  to a peninsula city before March 1, 1987, but had encountered problems that  prevented issuance of the permit until after June 27.  </P> <P> State Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro), prompted by requests from  constituents, asked the state auditor general in the spring of 1988 to  investigate the district's management practices. Auditors criticized school  officials for failing to adopt written criteria for granting exemptions, and  for not letting the public know that exemptions could be obtained until the  district issued a press release in February, 1988.  </P> <P> In addition, auditors said that between June, 1987, and March, 1988, the  district collected $297,000 in developer fees, and exempted $532,000 worth of  fees. Auditors found that the district could not demonstrate that 13 exemptions  met Capelouto's unwritten criteria. The district later provided documentation  for the 13 exemptions, according to Philip Jelicich, who conducted the audit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consistent Criteria  </P> <P> Younggren said board members initially did not know that the exemptions were  being granted. However, Younggren said, after administrators assured them  several months later that consistent criteria were being applied, board members  allowed them to continue.  </P> <P> Younggren acknowledged that the school board did not issue a formal policy  statement outlining criteria used for granting exemptions until after the  auditors finished their report and recommended that it do so.  </P> <P> "There was no favoritism shown" in granting exemptions, he said.  </P> <P> Although the board discussed exemptions, the resolution did not address that  issue. Afterward, Price said, "The feeling was it was OK for us to go ahead"  and grant them. In retrospect, he said, he and Capelouto should have informed  the board that they were making exemptions.  </P> <P> "Neither Dave (Capelouto) nor I ever thought of that," Price said.  </P> <P> Price himself was not left unscathed by the auditors. They criticized the  district for accepting a $6,727 developer fee check from Price in January,  1988, and then failing to deposit it until March. The payment receipt issued to  Price allowed him to obtain his building permit for his home from the city of  Palos Verdes Estates.  </P> <P> Price initially asked school officials not to deposit his check, according to  the auditor's report. Charlene Pavlick, an accountant for the district, told  investigators that "the superintendent indicated that he did not have the money  to cover the check on Jan. 7, 1988. Charlene said that she was unhappy with  this request to hold his check, but she complied because Dr. Price was the  superintendent and, therefore, her boss."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Poor Judgment'  </P> <P> In a recent interview with The Times, Price would not elaborate on the matter,  except to say that he exercised poor judgment.  </P> <P> After two years of acrimony, district officials and their critics say they are  eager for a resolution of the issues that divide them.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, as the State Board of Education debated the parents'  request for an election, Price declared, "All we want to do is to get the kids  off the hangman's noose."  </P> <P> But further delay on some issues is inevitable as the lawsuit winds its way  through the courts.  </P> <P> The next milestone in the district's travails comes Nov. 7, when three seats  will be filled on the school board. Each side hopes to gain a three-member  majority -- and vindication.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the antagonists cling tenaciously to their positions.  </P> <P> "There is no deception or conspiracy or incredible ineptness here," Younggren  said.  </P> <P> Said Dawn Henry: "It is time to get honest and responsible representation in  this district."  </P> <P> </P> <P> KEY FIGURES IN THE DISPUTE  </P> <P> Richard Smith  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes resident filed lawsuit, with Janet McAuley, against the  peninsula school board and superintendent.  </P> <P> Jack Price  </P> <P> Peninsula superintendent: "This is a classic case study in fanaticism. It's  been a nightmare."  </P> <P> Janet McAuley  </P> <P> District critic: "I want to see public officials held accountable. I really  believe once the public is informed they won't tolerate this."  </P></p>

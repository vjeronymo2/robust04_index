			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: Marathon trek into the unknown has now begun With the firing of the starting pistol yesterday, the deal between Lloyds and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester will now begin a marathon trek through the regulatory thicket in its path. Some parts of the path are untrodden, even by Abbey National, which converted to a bank in 1988. The deal is not expected to be concluded for more than a year. Before then there are some complex and precise procedures C&amp;G must undertake in order to shed its mutual status and become a bank. The first stop will be the High Court, probably late next month. What happens there, in what is being billed as a friendly action brought jointly by C&amp;G and the Building Societies Commission, the statutory regulator, will determine whether the deal can go ahead. The Commission has been seen as being hostile to takeover of societies by non-societies. There are two points on which both sides are seeking clarification. The Commission's concerns focus on the parts of the 1986 Building Societies Act which relate to cash payments. Can a 'third party' make payments to a society's members and can cash be distributed to anyone who has not been an investing member of the society for at least two years? In 1989, the Commission issued guidance to members saying that these restrictions applied. This has been seen as a deterrent to takeovers but the lawyers for C&amp;G and Lloyds clearly think there is room for doubt. Beyond that obstacle C&amp;G still has to be approved as a bank by the Bank of England. This is likely to take place over the summer and will involve independent auditors looking at the books. C&amp;G's statutory transfer statement, due to be sent to all members in the autumn, must be signed and approved by the Commission as accurate and containing all the material information members will need to make a decision. A Lloyds Bank extraordinary meeting has been scheduled for mid-November. A special general meeting of C&amp;G, which all the society's qualifying members, totalling more than 1m, are entitled to attend and vote, is pencilled in for later the same month. The proposals for the C&amp;G meeting must be approved by two separate resolutions for borrowers and investors. A simple majority of those voting is sufficient for borrowers' consent. The position for voting investors, however, is more complicated. Either it must be supported by 75 per cent of those voting, with a minimum turnout of 50 per cent or it must win the consent of those holding 90 per cent of the total value of shares held on voting day. The second alternative may be particularly relevant given the structure of the sweeteners. If all goes smoothly, C&amp;G will probably apply to the Commission for confirmation of the deal in March next year. Even then, the Commission can hear representations from interested parties - mainly members - if there are any who believe that the process has not been properly handled. Assuming all has gone well, that should be the end of the relationship between the Commission and C&amp;G.</p>

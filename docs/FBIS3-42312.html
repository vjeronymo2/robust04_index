			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Political Terror Against the Rukh </F> and Its Leaders"]    [Text] The Ukrainian Popular Movement [NRU], Rukh, is  consistently pursuing policies directed at the development of an  independent Ukrainian state and its liberation from the old  communist nomenklatura. It conducts its political line by  staying in parliamentary opposition to the power structures that  exist in Ukraine. This is why the Rukh has found itself under  steady political pressure from official institutions, as well as  from pro-presidential and pro-imperial media.    This is evidenced by cases of assaults on local Rukh  organizations and the use of violence against its members, which  has become systematic since the election campaign started.    The Rukh's Chernivtsi local organization was attacked twice  over the past several weeks. The premises of Rukh's local  organization based in Ternopol was demolished on Christmas Eve.  The children of several leaders of Rukh's department in Odessa  were beaten up. Unidentified attackers broke into the house of  the Rukh organization in Kirovograd Oblast; and on 15 January,  there was an attempt to break into an apartment belonging to Les  Tanyuk, member of the Rukh Central Command. Colonel Serhiy  Budko, the organization's legislative candidate, was beaten up  in broad daylight on 17 January. Similar cases are reported  from practically all parts of Ukraine.    Still unknown is the fate of Mykola Perevoznyy, Rukh leader  in the town of Kotelvy, Poltava Oblast. About two months ago,  "the relevant agencies" detained him without pressing any  charges. All inquiries filed by his wife and the Rukh's local  department remained unanswered. Zoya Kovalenko, a Rukh activist  in the town, thinks that Mykola Perevoznyy was persecuted for  his critical newspaper articles revealing abuses on the part of  local government officials. One of those people, Hryhoriy  Kostenko, a militia department chief, has already been  registered as a candidate for people's deputy.    Roman Dyakovych, Rukh's legislative candidate who works in  Khmelnik hospital, could lose his job at any time because of his  political convictions. He was previously reinstated in his  position by a court decision. There is also evidence that  people are intimidated and pressured to withdraw their  signatures collected in support of Roman Dyakovych.    On the night of 16 January, the premises of Rukh Secretariat  were subjected to an armed attack. On that same night, Mykhaylo  Boychyshyn, member of the Secretariat and cochairman of the NRU  election headquarters, was reported missing. His whereabouts  are still unknown. Ukrainian Television delayed broadcasting  information about his disappearance. Law enforcement agencies  ignored demands by the Rukh and Boychyshyn's family, and were  slow to initiate an investigation of the case.    The unprecedented disappearance of one of the NRU leaders  and  all the above mentioned actions have a heavy political tinge and  are directly connected with the election race in Ukraine.    There are certain influential political circles in our state  which actively oppose electing Rukh representatives to the  legislature. With the election around the corner, they resort  to terror, trying to demoralize the democratic forces and  intimidate their supporters, which makes the political situation  in Ukraine even more unstable.    The Ukrainian Popular Movement reaffirms its resolve to  continue fighting for an independent and democratic Ukraine,  prosperity of its people, and their social protection in spite  of all repressions.    In connection with the Boychyshyn case and other incidents,  Rukh's Central Command instructed its leader to resume his  participation in Supreme Council sessions. The nomenklatura  majority in the parliament greeted Chornovil with catcalls and  laughter. The electorate put forward Lubomyra Boychyshyn as a  candidate for the legislature, who will run in the district of  her missing husband. By extending this kind of support to a  bedridden woman, Lvov residents displayed their resolve to fight  for the electoral victory of pro-reform forces in spite of the  flagrant pressure and political terror.</p>

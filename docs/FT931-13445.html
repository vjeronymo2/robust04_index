			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wescol losses increase 60% to Pounds 2.5m Wescol Group, the USM-quoted structural engineer, fell deeper into the red in the year to July 31 as pre-tax losses rose 60 per cent to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 1.55m). Turnover dipped from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 16.3m reflecting the difficult conditions in the construction industry and the group's closure, last May, of TMV Aluminium Systems, its curtain walling subsid-iary. Its sheeting and cladding business was closed in 1991. Wescol made a Pounds 506,000 exceptional provision for the closure of TMV while interest charges increased from Pounds 419,000 to Pounds 476,000. Losses per share were shown as 21.6p against 11.3p, and there is no dividend. Mr Peter Price was appointed chairman yesterday, taking over from caretaker chairman Mr Barry Anysz who replaced Mr John Hicks when he resigned last May. Mr Price said the group had strengthened its trading base, by 'refocusing operations, reducing overheads and securing fresh backing from our bankers'. He explained that facilities included a new six-year Pounds 2m loan.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Satellite music channels planned ICT-Europe, a satellite music company, plans to offer 86 channels of compact disc quality music throughout Europe by the end of the year, Raymond Snoddy writes. The 24-hour music channels which will range from chart hits, alternative rock and country music to opera and classical will be broadcast on the Astra satellite system. The ICT service, Digital Music Express, is already available on cable television networks in five European countries. The company yesterday announced a deal with British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite venture in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times holds a significant stake, to offer the 86 channel service to subscribers. There will be no advertisements or disc jockeys.

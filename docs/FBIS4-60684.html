			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, al Maa' [May] 24, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY  -- Successive phone calls were underway throughout the 'Aid al  Adhah ['Id al-Adha] holiday between the leader of the revolution  and the Yemeni leaders 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim  al-Bid in the ongoing efforts by the leader to bring an end to  the suffering and destruction in Yemen. Over the last 24 hours  telephone calls were exchanged between the various parties with  the leader emphasizing the stance adopted by the Arab world and  its revolutionary forces vis a vis division and those who  support division. The leader said that it did not suit the  revolutionaries of Aden to be in favour of division.    However, 'Ali Salim al-Bid explained to the leader of the  revolution the reasons for his decision to break away but also  expressed his willingness to search for any way out of the  current sitution to restore the unity of Yemen even if at his  expense.    The contacts made with 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih revolved mainly  around a search for a political solution which would guarantee  Yemeni unity, which would bring an end to the fighting and  prevent further bloodshed.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (5): De Klerk seeks government by consensus - President FW de Klerk set out his bottom line in constitutional negotiations and his vision of the new South Africa, in an interview with Andrew Gowers, Michael Holman and Patti Waldmeir What is your concept of power-sharing? In a government of national unity we believe that all major parties must play a fundamental role, and I have no doubt that my party will be one of those. But it won't be a white hand (on the tiller of state), it will be the hand of the leader of the National Party which will be the biggest or the second biggest party after an election. There are fundamental differences (on power-sharing) which need to be solved . . . (but) I believe that an agreement on how you structure a government of national unity will be achieved. Would this not give the National Party an effective veto over decisions made in a power-sharing cabinet? We are not talking about vetos. We are talking about the need in a government of national unity - with regard to fundamental issues - for the country to be governed on the basis of consensus between the main role players. With regard to matters of average importance one can always have an agreement as to how differences between them can be settled. But with regard to the fundamentals, there needs to be consensus. And the obvious thing would be for the main role players immediately after an election getting together, working out a framework: What will our policy during the five years be with regard to the economy, with regard to education, with regard to health, with regard to everything? And that policy framework becomes almost the Magna Carta for that five years. So we are not talking about a veto: I am talking about the creation of a basis which makes constructive co-operation possible. The government of national unity cannot succeed if it has a confrontation between the main role players every day. Consensus is arrived at through negotiation and fundamental interaction and a meeting of the minds. A veto calls before the eye proposals put on the table, a vote being taken, one party having the inherent right to say: I veto, I block. It is psychologically and philosophically quite different from consensus. How do you define this in a constitution? There are various ways. One can list the type of fundamental principles which need consensus - one can form between the main role players an executive committee and say that executive committee will agree upon the policy principles on which the co-operation within the government of national unity will be based, and they will take decisions by consensus and not by a head count. So a sort of inner cabinet . . . ? Yes: in terms of our proposal, the members of such an executive committee would on a rotating basis, for instance, act as chairman of the cabinet. Would there be a president as well as a chairman of the cabinet? Well, that's a question for negotiation. I'm easy. But having gone through the experience of being head of state and head of government simultaneously, it is a tremendous task and I personally think that we made a mistake by merging the positions of president and prime minister. How serious is the challenge posed by the Conservative Party to the negotiations? The CP is no longer what it used to be. It has split. I have no doubt that the Afrikaner Volksunie (a moderate offshoot of the CP) will be on board and even be on board with enthusiasm if a meaningful regional system is assured. And I think that once that agreement is reached they will grow at the cost of the CP. The CP will then be faced with a choice: do we break, or do we adapt? And I have no doubt that there are strong elements in the CP who are looking at adaptation. In that sense of the word I think there are elements in the CP who might opt for a more radical route, but there are definitely also strong elements who will opt for a moderate route. How seriously do you view the threat of a coalition between the CP and the Inkatha Freedom Party? A real alliance between the IFP and the CP is out of the question because the IFP very strongly rejects any form of racism and is philosophically miles apart from the CP on that fundamental issue. The CP does not stand for just devolution of power and entrenched powers of regions: the CP (is) pleading for an ethnic white sovereign state that would become part of a confederal southern Africa. Would you demand that consensus decision-making be written into the constitution forever, or for just five years? We definitely believe that also in a second constitution or final constitution - whatever one might call it - that the principle of power-sharing must be part of it. But it need not be in exactly the same way that it is achieved in a government of national unity. We are negotiating to have such a principle included in the constitutional principles by which a constitution- writing body will be bound. For the foreseeable future? Yes. We sincerely believe that a winner-takes-all model is the worst possible model which there can be for South Africa. But there are various scenarios on which I don't want to speculate which contain forms of power-sharing which are totally in step with true democracy and what pertains in many countries in different forms throughout the world. But proportional representation and strong regional government would not be enough? That is not enough. There must be the limitation of the power of any government also when it comes to the executive, not to such an extent that it must be a lame duck government but to ensure, as the founders of the American constitution did, there won't be misuse of power. What will happen if no agreement is reached at the multi-party talks? I've said that if negotiations were to break down the government will have to take responsible initiatives to ensure continued progress. It is something quite different from a go-it-alone scenario. We are not considering that. But . . . I really don't believe it will be necessary. I think we're going to get sufficient consensus to move forward in the knowledge that the vast majority of South Africans are supportive. And if no elections could be held? I'm a democrat. I think the people want to vote, especially those who've never had the chance to vote. I'm committed to a democratic process and to constitutional changes being brought about constitutionally. Is your party fully behind you? I've no doubt that I have my party behind me. But what is true is that at grass roots level, because of the continuing violence, because of from time to time irresponsible, almost shocking statements being made - like the one of reducing the voting age to 14 - confidence is undermined in the commitment of other role players. If we make a good agreement, this uncertainty will be removed and be replaced by confidence. A bad agreement will result in radicals both to the left and the right growing in strength and the broad moderate centre losing support. I do not intend to sign a bad agreement.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Yeltsin authorises military aircraft sell-off MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has authorised the air force to sell 1,600 outdated military aircraft free of export tax. The proceeds of the deals - which are to be negotiated by the air force, but vetted by the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry - are to finance housing and salary increases for servicemen. Mr Yeltsin's decree also suggests, somewhat ambitiously, that Dollars 9bn of the total profits would be reinvested in unspecified aircraft manufacturing programmes. Land forces have already been authorised to sell off surplus tanks and weapons. On Friday, Mr Mikhail Malei, a presidential adviser suggested that only hard-currency arms sales could finance the conversion of the country's huge defence industry to civilian output. The government is already actively seeking to expand arms sales to bring in badly needed hard currency. In an attempt to prevent arms falling into the wrong hands, it is setting up an inter-ministerial committee - representing economic ministries as well as the military - to supervise exports. But there is probably little that officials in Moscow can do to prevent the former Soviet Union from turning into a giant arms bazaar. Other republics are determined to nationalise Red Army hardware on their territory not because they want to use it, but so that they might sell it. In the second largest republic, Kazakhstan, a commodity exchange called Pax-Alisa has announced plans to begin auctioning off SU-24 MK fighter-bombers and systems for co-ordinating land and air operations. As a result of falling discipline and living standards, thefts of military hardware within the Red Army itself grew three-fold last year, according to the chief military prosecutor. Georgia is planning to demand a share of the Black Sea Fleet for its own coastal defence. Mr Avtandil Tskitishvili, Georgia's first deputy defence minister, said the republic expected to take over some of the vessels anchored at the ports of Poti and Ochamchire. But, unlike Ukraine, which has been arguing with Russia over the Black Sea Fleet, Georgia has no plans to demand an oath of allegiance from servicemen, even though its ultimate aim is to have its own armed forces.</p>

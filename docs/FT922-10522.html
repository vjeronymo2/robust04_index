			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Management: Death as a salesman - A macabre approach to promoting products In the past few months, the advertising world has lifted the veil from the last taboo of the late 20th century and started exploring the use of death, or at least mortality, as a messenger. The most dramatic images of death come from Benetton, the clothing retailer already known for its willingness to upset accepted mores. In its latest advertising campaign, the company uses a series of photographs of disasters  -ranging from an exploding car to an Aids patient on his death bed - with only the Benetton logo to identify the company and its product. Athletic shoe makers have seized on a lighter approach, but there no escaping their carpe diem messages. 'I believe Life is short. Play Hard,' extols the Reebok ad. 'Someday, since you are human, you will notice that time has passed and you are not who you were 20 years ago or 10 years ago or even last week,' is the message from Nike. "Your life was programmed at the factory for continuous play. With proper care and maintenance your life will provide a lifetime of enjoyment,' LA Gear proclaims. Using dead stars to sell products is also increasingly popular. Diet Coke's latest offering employs the services of Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney and Louis Armstrong, with Elton John representing the living. Perhaps the most macabre of all are the endorsements from the grave. Michael Landon, a popular American television actor whose well-publicised death from cancer dominated the tabloids and People magazine last year, can be seen on TV stations across the nation promoting educational study aids. 'Because of Michael Landon's belief in this programme, he authorised the producers to continue its broadcast after his death,' is the introduction to the television spot for 'Where there's a will, there's an A' Michael Landon's desire posthumously to promote a product, which has no relevance to the actor's life or death, is a long way from the first sombre use of a dead celebrity, when Yul Brynner spoke out against smoking for the American Cancer Society in 1986, in an ad made to be shown after his death. 'I really wanted to make a commercial when I discovered that I was that sick, and my time was so limited I thought I would make a commercial that says simply: 'Now that I'm gone, I tell you, don't smoke - whatever you do, just don't smoke'.' No one is quite sure why death has come out of the advertising closet, or how prevalent the theme will become. At Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the person in charge of monitoring trends recently started a file on death. 'There's a death theme that she's seeing more and more, and she doesn't know what to make of it,' said Shelly Lazarus, who worked on the LA Gear account. Some believe that western society will become increasingly concerned with ageing and death as the so-called baby boomers age and die. Others believe that Aids has thrust death into the limelight. It is only recently that we've become squeamish about death. In his book, 'Western attitudes toward Death,' French social historian Phillipe Aries says 'the more society was liberated from the Victorian constraints concerning sex, the more it rejected things having to do with death . . . The interdict on death suddenly follows upon the heels of a very long period  -several centuries - in which death was a public spectacle from which no one would have thought of hiding and which was even sought after at times.' Benetton, which has been charged with exploiting serious issues to sell sweaters, maintains that its provocative ads force people to think and discuss important issues, and that its target customers - 18 to 34-year-old women - 'are more socially active and aware than any generation that precedes them. Various studies have shown that in 1992, consumers are as concerned by what a company stands for as they are about the price-value relationship of that company's products.' Larry Kopald, executive vice president of Foote Cone and Belding, a marketing consultancy, says: 'There has been a tremendous reaction to the Benetton ads. Many people think it is a gross misuse of a real life tragedy, that is being used for shock value. I think that advertising is always trying to find new ways to make a message relevant, and this is a new way for some people to do it. I hope it isn't a trend.' Bill Katz, executive vice president at BBDO, the advertising agency, has not noticed an increased obsession with death but believes there is a trend away from 'fluff and peripheral imagery and towards more substance and reality. It gets back to the pundits and soothsayers of our industry who try to plot and charter the future and believe the 1990s, with recession hitting, are about reality.'</p>

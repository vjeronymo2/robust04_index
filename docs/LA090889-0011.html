			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SERIAL-ROBBERY TRIAL DELAYED  </P> <P> An appeals court Thursday delayed the trial of a suspected serial robber who is  charged with holding up cashiers in stores throughout the county.  </P> <P> The 4th District Court of Appeal delayed the trial of Paul William Bresney, 38,  of San Diego so it can review a ruling by the trial judge before the trial gets  under way.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells filed a writ with the appellate court after San  Diego Superior Court Judge J. Perry Langford on Wednesday split up the 56  charges against Bresney and ordered four separate trials.  </P> <P> Langford ruled that Bresney be tried for 15 counts each at three trials, and  then for 11 counts at the last trial.  </P> <P> Bresney's lawyer, Charles Elliott, had successfully argued that bunching all of  the cases together in one trial would be prejudicial to Bresney.  </P> <P> Bresney is accused of being the "Walk to the Back" robber, who told his victims  to go the back of the store he was holding up while he made his getaway. The  robberies began Jan. 3 and continued into April. Bresney was arrested April 21.  </P> <P> The order halting the trial came just as potential jurors were called to the  courtroom.  </P> <P> The appellate justices are expected to review Langford's decision and make a  ruling within a few weeks.  </P></p>

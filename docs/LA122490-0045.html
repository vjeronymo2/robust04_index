			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUCK SPILLS ACID ON TEXAS FREEWAY  </P> <P> Decontamination crews worked for eight hours Sunday to clean up 10,000 gallons  of acid that spilled after a tanker truck skidded on icy Interstate 10 in  Baytown.  </P> <P> Department of Public Safety spokesman David Wells said the eastbound tanker was  carrying 40,000 gallons of hydrochloric acid solution from Freeport to  Beaumont.  </P> <P> Driver Leon Tremonte of Freeport told officers the truck hit ice on the roadway  at about 6 a.m. and skidded into a guardrail. The tanker struck the guardrail  and ruptured before bouncing into a ditch and spilling about a fourth of its  load.  </P> <P> Wells said police blocked off the area and a hazardous materials squad was  rushed in to clean up the spilled acid.  </P> <P> Tremonte suffered only minor injuries and was treated for breathing problems  after exposure to the caustic material.  </P> <P> Wells said the spilled acid was loaded onto other vehicles and the wreckage was  cleared by 2 p.m., enabling troopers to reopen the busy freeway between Houston  and Louisiana.  </P> <P> No other injuries were reported.  </P></p>

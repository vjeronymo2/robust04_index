			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALIBU HOTEL PROJECT STYMIED AS PANEL REJECTS SEWER PLAN  </P> <P> The California Coastal Commission has handed the Adamson Cos. a serious setback  in its bid to develop a luxury hotel overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu.  </P> <P> By a unanimous vote, the state panel last week refused to approve an interim  sewer plan for the planned $65-million, 300-room hotel. Without the approval,  the firm, one of Malibu's largest landowners, would be prevented from starting  construction until a regional sewer system that Los Angeles County wants to  build in Malibu is in place.  </P> <P> Adamson may reapply for approval after it conducts further studies, but that  could take several months.  </P> <P> The decision Wednesday came a day after the coastal panel refused to allow the  county to speed construction of the proposed $43-million sewer system. The  commission approved the hotel plan in 1986 but said the sewer system had to be  installed before the hotel could open.  </P> <P> The latest developments greatly increase the likelihood that the hotel's fate,  and that of the sewer, will be left to Malibu's future City Council to help  decide, once the community becomes a city.  </P> <P> "I think we have to realize there's a gorilla in the room, and that's the  (future) City Council," Commissioner Gary Giacomini said. "Even if we approved  (the company's) request, it could be undone later by the new City Council."  </P> <P> A three-judge panel in Los Angeles has scheduled a hearing Wednesday to decide  whether Malibu's incorporation, approved by voters last month, can go forward,  or whether the county can delay cityhood until next March.  </P> <P> Opponents of the Adamson plan argued that it would be too risky to approve a  septic-tank system for the 27-acre site near Pepperdine University when not  enough is known about the possible consequences. The site is next to an  earthquake fault and is susceptible to landslides.  </P> <P> Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, a Malibu resident, said she would be astonished  if the same county officials who call residential septic tanks in Malibu a  health hazard approve septic tanks for the hotel complex, which would include a  60,000-square-foot convention facility, several restaurants and a separate  office building.  </P> <P> "This is so many times greater than anything else that is on a septic system in  Malibu as to be almost incalculable," Glickfeld said. The county has long cited  the environmental damage caused by leaking septic tanks as the prime reason for  insisting that the sewer system be built.  </P> <P> Adamson had announced last week that it will join forces with the firm that  owns the Hotel Bel-Air to develop and manage the Malibu hotel. Its partner, the  Sazale Corp. of Japan, owns several other luxury hotels in the United States  and France, including the Biltmore in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Besides the interim sewer plan, the company must have the Coastal Commission  approve its final grading plans before construction can begin. The commission  is scheduled to consider the grading matter next month at its meeting in  Eureka.  </P> <P> Adamson, which has already spent more than $5 million on the hotel project, had  hoped, like the county with its sewer system, to start work before Malibu  becomes a city.  </P> <P> The firm has done little to enhance its popularity among cityhood backers, who  accused it of working behind the scenes to defeat cityhood in 1976. Last  December, the company joined the county in a lawsuit to delay this year's  cityhood vote.  </P> <P> More recently, with cityhood appearing to be inevitable, company officials have  made gestures aimed at healing the rift.  </P> <P> Three weeks before last month's incorporation election, Sylvia R. A. Neville,  the firm's managing general partner, gave a rare interview to a Malibu  newspaper in which she declared that she was in favor of cityhood. Other  company officials have stated that they look forward to working with the new  city on the hotel.  </P> <P> "We haven't received an unfavorable response from any of the council  members-elect with respect to the hotel, and I would say that's encouraging,"  said Barna Szabo, a political consultant for the company, after last week's  Coastal Commission hearing.  </P> <P> Among those at the hearing who urged the commission to deny approval of the  company's interim sewer plan was Sharon Adamson, whose late husband, Merritt,  was managing general partner of the Adamson Cos. until his death in 1986.  </P> <P> Sharon Adamson is involved in a bitter legal battle with Neville and Rhoda-May  Dallas, her former sisters-in-law, contending that she and her two adult  children are owed one-third of the family's estimated $75-million fortune. She  has accused Neville and Dallas of grossly mismanaging the company's assets.  </P> <P> In testimony before the Coastal Commission, Sharon Adamson said that the hotel  plan was "poorly conceived" and that if she and her children succeed in  obtaining the hotel site as part of their share of the company's assets, "our  plan (for the site) will be completely different."  </P> <P> As proposed, the hotel would include 11 low-lying, Spanish-style villas nestled  into the hillside, surrounded by extensive landscaping, including streams and  fountains. There would be a free-standing restaurant at the corner of Pacific  Coast Highway and Malibu Canyon Road in addition to restaurants in the hotel.  </P> <P> Company officials say the villa design will be much less noticeable from the  busy coastal highway, and its Spanish-style architecture will complement that  of the nearby university.  </P></p>

The heads of the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP] and Sakigake (Harbinger) reached the  accord in a meeting Thursday night, the sources said.    They were Tomiichi Murayama of the SDP, Keigo Ouchi of the  DSP, and Masayoshi Takemura of Sakigake. Ouchi serves as the  health and welfare minister, while Takemura is the chief cabinet  secretary.    Earlier this week, Hosokawa said he is considering an early  cabinet reshuffle, hinting at removing Takemura from the key  position of chief cabinet secretary, a post serving as the prime  minister's chief spokesman and also chief of staff.    On Wednesday, Hosokawa told a parliamentary session he has  yet to decide whether to reshuffle his cabinet, but failed to  rule out such a move. "The issue is still a blank piece of  paper," he said.    On Thursday, Hosokawa reiterated to reporters that he is  undecided whether to reshape the cabinet.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The small wars are a big problem for Russia: Asian conflicts continue to widen in significance THE SMALL wars around Russia's perimeters are growing and acquiring an increasing geo-political significance. All three of the Trans-Caucasian republics on Russia's southern border - Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia - are engaged in ethnic conflict. In Tajikistan, rival groups continue their bloody battle for control. Russian troops are embroiled on all sides in conflicts which are creating thousands of refugee families living in squalid misery, usually in the states' capitals, and which are leaching away already vastly depleted reserves. The Caucasian and Tajik crises are to top the agenda at a meeting on Friday of the heads of state of the Commonwealth of Independent States in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. Discussions have already begun on sending in peacekeeping forces to all of them. But there a desire within the CIS not to internationalise the conflict. Georgia and Tajikistan do not want the involvement of Russian or other CIS forces. Russia does not want the involvement of the United Nations. Yet the scope for internal pacification narrows as the internal chaos increasingly grows. The Georgian leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, is having a terrible time. At the weekend, he again threatened to resign following a visit to the separatist region of Abkhazia, in north-western Georgia. His forces were last week thrown out of the town of Gagra, where they had been engaged in fierce clashes with irregulars fighting for autonomy. He has promised to get the town back, but reports yesterday suggested it was securely in Abkhazian hands. Mr Shevardnadze has been forced into making anti-Russian noises, threatening to take over the arms of the Russian troops still deployed in his republic. That in turn caused the Russian defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, to warn on Saturday that any attempt to seize weapons would be forcefully resisted. Russian influence in the Caucasus is waning fast. Russia can either let its southern Caucasian republics go or assert its power by force. There are proponents of both views in the Russian government and parliament, with the latter one prevailing. Meanwhile, the war in Abkhazia has become, in the past two weeks, even bloodier than the still-running conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Nagorno Karabakh. Where, in the case of Nagorno Karabakh, the Christian-Moslem antagonism is clear in the desecration of each other's holy places, so the same malign energy begins to be evident in the Georgian/Caucasian conflict. The Abkhazian rebels are supported by the Confederation of Mountain Peoples, which ended a conference in the largely Moslem republic of Chechen Ingushetia over the weekend with a rousing denunciation of Russia from General Dzhokar Dudayev, the republic's president. He called Moscow the 'source of all evil' and proposed that 'unless we become masters of the Caucasus now, we may share the plight of the Moslems of Bosnia.' There have been demonstrations in neighbouring Kabardino-Balkaria, agitating for a Moslem-dominated Caucasian federation. In Tajikistan, the new government in Dushanbe under acting President Akbarsho Iskandarov is faced with a sustained challenge from forces loyal to the ousted, former Communist President Rakhmon Nabiyev. His troops have waded into the southern town of Kurgan-Tyube through the blood of hundreds of its inhabitants. The new government is more pro-Moslem than the old, though it is still largely composed of former Communist officials manouevring for position. Islamic parties, both moderate and radical, are increasing in influence in both Tajikistan and neighbouring Uzbekistan: however, the lines of struggle are complex, with rival groups taking different sides. Mr Nabiyev's supporters are probably being helped by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Islamic Party of Afghanistan. According to Mr Davlat Khudonazarov, a rival of the former president, Mr Hekmatyar is meddling in Tajik affairs in order to promote Uzbek-Tajik rivalry and thus extend his own influence over the area. The hapless Russians are again trapped in the fighting - on guard on the Tajik-Afghan border, deployed round the main hydro-electric station and as ordinary citizens living and working in the republic. Here, as elsewhere, they have no secure allies left in power and can only appeal to the feeble structures of the CIS as an antidote to further atomisation and bloodshed.</p>

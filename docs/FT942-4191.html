			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (8): On the track of gentle giants - Leslie Crawford looks at tourism The heart of Bwindi's Impenetrable Forest in southern Uganda is home to almost half the world's population of mountain gorillas - a rare and endangered species of which fewer than 650 remain. To protect Bwindi's gentle giants, gorilla tracking permits are strictly rationed: only six visitors are allowed to enter Bwindi national park each day. Even if gorillas are not sighted, the experience of exploring Bwindi's virgin jungle, under the canopy of huge tropical hardwoods, lianas and orchids, is mysterious and unforgettable. For the foreseeable future, Uganda's appeal to the foreign visitor will centre on 'special interest' activities: mountain trekking in the Ruwenzoris  -the legendary Mountains of the Moon; a visit to Bwindi, or the equally remote savannah grasslands of the Kidepo Valley near the frontier with Sudan. It is also in Uganda where the Nile begins its 4,000-mile journey to the Mediterranean. International tour operators have begun to include Uganda on their East African safari circuits, encouraged by the country's efforts to recover its neglected tourism infrastructure. Abercrombie &amp; Kent have set up two tented camps near Bwindi and Murchison Falls, and plan to transform the Lake Victoria Hotel near Entebbe into their five-star showcase in Uganda. Tim Somerset Webb, president of A &amp; K Overseas Ltd, says he is finalising an agreement for the management contract and an equity participation in Lake Victoria Hotel with the state-owned Uganda Hotels Ltd. Accommodation in Kampala remains overpriced and somewhat below international standards, but a number of hotels in the capital are undergoing upgrading and renovation. About 40 local tour operators provide an increasing range of services for the adventurous traveller. At the Uganda Tourist Board, above the British Council offices in Kampala, Freddie Irumba likes to take the long-term view. 'We have to be both cautious and sensible about promoting Uganda as a holiday destination,' he says. 'Until our hotels are rehabilitated, the road network improved and our passenger handling facilities at the airport are up to scratch, we should not aim to attract large numbers of visitors.' He says the number of visitors is rising by 20 per cent each year, and estimates arrivals will top 80,000 in 1994.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (10): Property offers shelter from risk - Tax-efficient investments 2, The Business Expansion scheme / There is little time left in which to make an investment that provides one of the most generous tax-breaks RISK AND business expansion schemes used to go hand in hand. Originally, the BES was intended as a way of raising equity for new businesses from the private sector. The carrot for investors was the generous tax relief extended at the investor's marginal rate, as long as the BES shares were held for five years. Any gains made on the sale of the shares were free of income and capital gains taxes. But the tax incentives were often not enough to make up for the stick of risk. As Nick Percival, director of Best Investment, says: 'The early schemes were high-risk trading companies, and a lot of the companies did not make any money.' The scheme changed in 1988, when the government decided to use it to bolster the private rental property sector. Tax rebates were offered to investors in companies which purchased and then let property on assured tenancies. It was with assured tenancies that the BES really took off - attracting Pounds 345m in the 1988-89 tax year, compared with Pounds 175m the previous year - as people perceived investment in property as a safer bet than trading companies. Assured-tenancy schemes now dominate the BES market. The sponsors have been ingenious in constructing schemes to squeeze out risk through the introduction of bank guarantees and arranged-exit schemes, whereby the sale of the BES company shares is pre-arranged at a set price. To make the schemes even more appealing, the 'loan-back' BES was invented last autumn, whereby investors would take out a loan, with shares in a BES company as security. This allowed them to realise their investments after six months instead of five years - a blatant contravention of the spirit of the legislation, but it pulled in the investors, who provided Pounds 928m of BES funding in the 1992-93 tax year, almost three-quarters of which was in loan-back schemes. The government abolished the schemes in the March budget, having already announced, in its 1992 budget, that the BES would be wound up on December 31 this year. The assured-tenancy schemes fall into two broad types. In an arranged-exit scheme, the company, on whose behalf the scheme is being issued, contracts to buy back back the shares at a pre-arranged price after five years; some arrange for cash deposits or a bank guarantee to back up the obligation. A recent innovation has been to link returns to rises in the stock market, instead of offering an exit price. The cash-backed arranged-exit schemes, combined with the generous tax relief  -a higher-rate taxpayer parts with only Pounds 24,000 for a Pounds 40,000 investment - has made the BES a proposition for serious investors to consider, once they have taken advantage of other tax-efficient investments. The early assured tenancies, issued in 1988, have not fared well, however, according to Ian Pugh, of Best BES Advice, because they bought property at the height of the market. Investors in the early schemes also face the problem of removing tenants and selling the properties at a good profit. Arranged-exit schemes: A higher exit price may reflect greater risk. The Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College issue, in July, sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance, offered an exit price of 127p after five years for every 100p invested, making it one of the highest returns, but it had little cash backing. Where there is cash backing, Nick Percival says that the investor should check that this is for the full exit price and not just a portion. If there is a bank guarantee instead, check that the bank has a good credit rating. Other points to note are the reputation of the sponsor and its ability to send out BES 3 certificates, which are needed to claim the tax relief, quickly. The effective annual returns to the investor quoted by the sponsors are based on the BES 3 certificates being sent out in time for the investor to claim tax relief for the year, otherwise the overall return to them is reduced. Stock market-linked schemes: There is no arranged exit price. Instead, the investor receives a fixed price per share (minimum 60p - the effective investment after tax relief is given) after five years, plus a return linked to the FT-SE 100 index. As with a personal equity plan, the investment will be free of income or capital gains tax. BESSA Oxford, issued in August by sponsors Close Brothers, had automatic lock-ins, to protect against falls in the market towards the end of the five-year maturity date. David Harris, of independent financial advisers Chantrey Financial Services, says that these schemes are best suited to the wealthier investor who can afford the worst-case scenario of a drop in the market. Tax considerations: There are different ways of obtaining tax relief, depending on whether you are under the PAYE system or are self-employed. In the former case, a proportion of the relief will be given every month, according to Mavis Seymour, BES specialist at accountants Stoy Hayward. 'If, having made an investment in August 1993, the inspector changes your PAYE code in time for your January 1994 salary payment, you should obtain 10/12 of the BES relief in January, 1/12 in February and 1/12 in March 1994,' she said. If you are self-employed and pay half your tax liability on January 1, 1994, and half on July 1, 1994, half of the BES relief received before January 1 reduces each of these payments. The BES has been structured in a way to appeal to the higher-rate taxpayer, but, like all investment decisions, the choice should be made on the soundness of the investment rather than purely on considerations of tax savings. Independent financial advice should be taken before making a decision. Best BES Advice, published by the Allenbridge Group (071 409-1111), and BESt Investment (071 936-2037) monitor the industry and provide research and advice. The BES Association (071 613-0032) operates as the trade association. Also useful are Inland Revenue pamphlets IR 51, The BES; and IR 85, The BES - Private Rented Housing.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses more pensive after recent gains BOURSES faltered a little yesterday after an early attempt at flying higher, writes Our Markets Staff. They had cause. News of US warplanes bombing northern Iraq sent bullion prices higher, and German M3 grew by 7.5 per cent in July after 7 per cent in June. Some investors were also worried that laggard stocks and sectors had been prominent in recent gains, indicating that a correction might be around the corner. However, strategists seemed inclined to stay on board. Mr Marcus Grubb, at Salomon Brothers in London, said that on average, most European bourses were trading on yield ratios (bond yields to dividend yields) which are cheap by a factor of 15 to 40 per cent compared with ten year averages. The cheapest markets, he said, were Italy, Spain and France. FRANKFURT inched to another 1993 closing high, the DAX index rising 3.26 to 1,938.98 after an intraday 1,946.39. The M3 figures, coming after hours, seemed mostly built into brokers' calculations; the Ibis indicated DAX eased only 1.14 to 1,937.84 in the post-bourse. Turnover eased from DM10.4bn to DM10.2bn. Engineers, steels and carmakers, in the van of this year's gains, mostly showed falls although BMW, an underperformer for much of this year, rose DM5 to DM574. Utilities, also underperformers, rose too, RWE by DM6.30 to DM426.50 and Viag by DM8 to DM458.50. Schering, which has changed categories this month, rose another DM36 to DM997 on prospects for its Betaseron drug, up by DM167, or 20 per cent this month against a 7.5 per cent DAX index gain. PARIS fell back by 1 per cent as investors ignored a further slight easing in the 24 hour lending rate. The CAC-40 index, however, managed a last minute improvement from the day's low of 2,131 to end down 21.55 at 2,139.20. Turnover was some FFr3.8bn. Alcatel Alsthom remained at the top of the most actives even although the South Korean authorities delayed further an announcement on the award of the railway contract. The shares added FFr9 to FFr734 in heavy turnover of FFr468m. Lafarge Coppee slipped FFr17.20 to FFr439 in reaction, analysts said, to a media report that it may bid for a Belgian cement group. The company denied the story later. AMSTERDAM encountered some profit-taking although Elsevier showed a 4 per cent gain, the shares rising Fl 5.60 to Fl 144.00, a new year's high, on reports that it may acquire the Official Airline Guides of the US, formerly owned by Maxwell Communications. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.3 to 128.5. The strength in Elsevier helped other sector stocks with VNU up Fl 1.80 to Fl 140.80, another year's high, and Wolters Kluwer gaining Fl 1.90 to Fl 96. ZURICH ended mixed and quiet, the SMI index easing 6.0 to 2,481.2. In cyclicals, Brown Boveri came under pressure; yesterday's first-half results from ABB Asea Brown Boveri were marginally above with expectations, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank, but BBC bearers fell SFr18 to SFr931. MILAN saw profit-taking in spite of a good run in telecommunications. The Comit index lost 1.38 to 617.60. Interest was shown in Sip on reports that its cellular telephone operation might be sold by next spring. Its shares gained L52 to L3,579, as Stet advanced L76 to L4,476. MADRID stayed bullish, if more restrained with the general index rising another 1.50 to 291.96. Blue chips were mixed across the board, Telefonica standing out with a gain of Pta55 to Pta1,615 after the AT&amp;T bid for McCaw Cellular in the US. LISBON climbed to a new 1993 high, its index rising 0.9 per cent to 1,109.01 as foreign investors bought blue chip stocks. COPENHAGEN's KFX index continued to pull ahead, gaining 2.74 to a new 1993 high of 100.73. Banks led the gains, Den Danske bank rising DKr17 to DKr392 on satisfaction with its half year results. STOCKHOLM fell back, the Affarsvarlden general index losing 12.9 to 1,326 in heavy turnover of SKr2.9bn. Reaction to Ericsson's half year results saw the B recover from an intraday low of SKr367 to SKr376, off SKr1. OSLO lost 2.2 per cent on profit-taking, leaving the composite index down 12.85 at 573.52 in turnover of NKr731m. ISTANBUL gained 4.5 per cent as investors returned to equities after a further fall in interest rates. The composite index put on 466.8 to 10,915 in turnover of some TL1,200bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 19                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1310.93     1310.71     1306.99     1305.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1397.94     1395.91     1391.08     1391.56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1305.73     1304.18     1303.76     1304.07 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1391.46     1388.87     1387.19     1385.51  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 18    Aug 17    Aug 16    Aug 13    Aug 12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1303.09   1284.89   1276.32   1276.24   1280.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1387.63   1368.15   1359.35   1354.67   1359.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1311.91; 200 - 1398.17 Low/day: 100 - 1302.38  200 - 1385.51.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

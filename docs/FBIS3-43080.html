			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Kuchin, senior scientific specialist, High </F> Energy Physics Institute: ``The Fate of Science -- In the Hands  of Politicians''; the first three paragraphs are an introduction]    [Text] Now we all are involuntary witnesses of the ruinous  consequences of a breakdown in businesslike cooperation in the  economy. Politicians already are beginning to correct the twists  and turns which have occurred during sovereignization of the  production sphere, to seek out the ``extremists,'' those who  first said ``no'' to a partner and began to build a wall around  their own territory. Meanwhile in science (yes, and probably  not only in science) the cessation of normal relations among  work partners is continuing to be aggravated. It is not what  scientists want, but seemingly is occurring by itself by reason  of some objective factors. Evidently in the last analysis the  same strong factors are operative here as in the economy. And  the consequences of this quiet process of calamitous  self-isolation may be not less destructive for the growth of  scientific potential in the republic and the development of the  country as a whole. Accordingly, it is important as quickly as  possible to stop the general disintegration of the intellectual  sphere of activity before its results become irreversible for  us. When Kazakhstan was part of the Union our science was  included in the common information pool of the country. The  central scientific library of the republic Academy in a  centralized system received from Moscow the books and journals  published in the USSR and abroad. Now the operation of this  system does not extend to us. They explain to us: there are no  funds available. In one way or another the flow of scientific  information to the republic has been cut off. We have been left  without a number of international journals in the English  language in the fields of mathematics, physics and other  disciplines. Our director then declared: ``Seek out partners,  establish contacts with the necessary authors, ask that they  send reprints and preprints. You certainly understand that  without information we cannot survive! However, money also is  needed for maintaining contacts with the respective parties...  The other day our institute was visited by a group of Chinese  scientists. It was headed by Chou Huan Chao, president of the  Chinese Academy of Sciences. This was not the first visit of  Chinese colleagues to our institute. Already six years ago  applications were finalized for carrying out joint research in  different fields of high-energy physics and plans were laid for  carrying out joint balloon experiments in the stratosphere. The  negotiations ended without results: neither country had the  necessary funding and equipment. Nevertheless Kazakh and  Chinese physicists found a basis for carrying out joint research  -- in third countries. Our scientists and specialists in four  major scientific institutions in China (at Beijing, Shanghai,  Wuhan, and Linfen) and the scientists of other countries with  the support of Moscow colleagues are entering into a major  international collaboration (cooperation sphere), are studying  the interaction among different nuclei and photoemulsion nuclei  in a broad energy range. A number of interesting results were  obtained and 14 joint studies were published. But Kazakh and  Chinese physicists cannot meet and talk in a neighborly way. To  be more precise, we cannot. The tenth meeting of participants in  this collaboration was held in September 1991 in Wuhan. The  scientists of our institute also received an invitation. But  they did not go: there was no money for missions abroad. This  time invitations to China and proposals for cooperation no  longer followed. But, indeed, at the meeting there was  discussion of the difficult times that had arrived for  fundamental research in some countries... So an outright  disgraceful situation has arisen for an independent country: in  order to meet with a work colleague who lives right here, not  far away, ``over the mountain,'' it is necessary to go to Moscow  or await an invitation from Sweden, where the collaboration  center is located at Lund. It goes without saying, if the trip  is at the expense of the inviting party... And this is not the  sole example when the friendly hand of support extended from  abroad is not being met with a return handshake on our part. For  a long time our institute cooperated with the Physics Institute  at Lodz University (Poland). Joint research was carried out,  there was an exchange of work results and scientists and plans  for the future were laid. In 1991 the Poles proposed that in the  spring of the coming year a small working conference be held on  ``Simulation, Theory and Experimentation in Cosmic Rays'' at  Almaty. And it also was planned that this conference later  become traditional, that it acquire a solid international status  and that different countries participate. But again everything  was cut off due to the lack of money; the Academy at that time  (in 1992) did not have 30 thousand rubles for meeting the  minimum expenditures on the reception of guests. It was  evidently difficult for the Poles to believe this. They broke  contacts with us and the traditional protocol on cooperation was  not extended. In actuality, what sense does it make to maintain  relations with such an incapacitated partner! In search for a  solution they say, seek sponsors, involve yourself in commercial  activity, organize joint enterprises and companies, and continue  scientific work. They cite the example of Japan, where reliance  is on practical research carried out by large private companies,  or China, where scientists are put on a self-supporting basis.  We regard such a recommendation to be fallacious at its very  core. And it is strange to hear it from time to time from the  ``generals'' of science. At best it is suited for solution of  the problems of a limited number of individuals, but not science  in general. The fact is that for the time being in the  republic there are simply no such large industrial companies  which would be in a position to assume a considerable fraction  of responsibility for the growth of scientific research and the  development of new technologies. Our private entrepreneurial  sector only now is beginning to stand on its own legs and is  absorbed in its own problems of survival and initial  accumulation of resources. It is not up to sponsorship at such a  scale as would be necessary for the normal functioning of  science. For the time being the government remains the sole  ``sponsor'' for science, culture, education, medicine, etc.  The market for individual entrepreneurship in our country is  extremely limited and specific. It cannot be accepted by all who  do not wish to switch suddenly from the good life to trading in  computers or selling beverages in the streets. Incidentally, for  those not in the know, the heads of the researcher and creative  worker are not at all tuned like those of a merchant or broker.  Accordingly, to combine business, science and art is difficult  for a normal person with a psyche not operating on two  frequencies. And finally, and most importantly: perhaps it is  not evident that all this feverish individual activity of  scientific workers in the search for sponsors, grants and money  for acquiring computers and equipment, trips abroad and return  reception of visitors has a single result: rapid breakdown of  scientific potential. The same as the departure of people for  commercial organizations or the ``brain drain'' abroad. And this  potential, indeed, has been built up in Kazakhstan over the  decades and constitutes a treasure of the republic. And it is of  great importance for the movement of people along a civilized  development path. Will we select backwardness? The tragic  situation in which Kazakh science has found itself, it is  believed, is caused not so much by the general economic crisis,  which in itself is secondary, as by the mentality of the  influential part of society, a systematic undervaluation of that  role which science plays in our time, in general, for the  intellectual potential of the country, for the growth of the  well-being of people and the prospects for its further  development. With respect to the number of people involved in  intellectual spheres of activity, with respect to the importance  for the future development (or degradation) of society, the  problem of the fate of science in Kazakhstan is now already  acquiring a political ring. Like litmus paper, giving evidence  of the course of a reaction in one direction or another, the  prolonged neglecting of science indicates a voluntary (or  involuntary) choice of a definite variant of the development of  events: a choice in the direction of backwardness. In  actuality, when Japan after bitter damage in the Second World  War went to work on restoration of its economy it also  experienced an acute need for money and received material  assistance from the outside. And nevertheless it proceeded to a  sharp increase in expenditures on fundamental research and  development work. During 1948-1949 36.7% of the budget was  allocated for these purposes. Because its leadership elected a  path of development by increasing the intellectual capabilities  of the population and on this basis the mass use of advanced  foreign methods and equipment. There's an example of  resoluteness and faith in their own capabilities! Against the  background of Japan and other countries attaining rapid progress  due to an intensification of the intellectual sphere of  activity, the slow ``financial'' stifling of science in  Kazakhstan is perceived as a sort of act of national suicide.  Again and again I want to ask our powers that be: ``Do you  need science? If not, it is interesting to know how, relying on  what social forces, you intend to ensure the proclaimed  strategic development of the republic, the flourishing of the  people and growth of its prestige in the world?'' In order to  accelerate democratic and market transformations in society  there must be profound changes in the consciousness of the  people, a radical breaking away from the stereotypes and  mentality which have developed. With the present-day  psychological mood of society it is difficult for scientists to  count on any full recognition of the usefulness of their  activity and receive everything which is necessary for carrying  it out at a fitting professional level. It seems that in  Kazakhstan there is a need for a union of science and politics.</p>

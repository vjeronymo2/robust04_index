The Council rejected cooperation with a  state-appointed commission on any issue pertaining to the holy  places.    Our Arab affairs correspondent Arye Gus has learned that the  decision to boycott the Shamgar commission was inspired by  Jordan, and contravenes the Waqf's initial position in support  of testifying before the commission.    Several days ago, the Hebron Municipality published a  proclamation calling for the expulsion of the Jewish settlers  from Hebron, the dismantlement of Qiryat Arba' and the other  settlements, and the lifting of the closure from the town. The  Municipality, which was appointed at the time by the Military  Government, also demands the removal of the Jewish synagogue  from the Tomb of the Patriarchs and the restoration of the  site's Islamic nature.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / ANC announces candidates The African National Congress yesterday published its list of candidates for South Africa's first elections, topped predictably by Mr Nelson Mandela, writes Patti Waldmeir from Johannesburg. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief constitutional negotiator, took second place on the list, strengthening his claim to be deputy president to Mr Mandela if the ANC wins the elections as expected. Mr Thabo Mbeki, who has up to now been tipped to fill this position, came third on the list. The ultra-radical Winnie Mandela, Mr Mandela's estranged wife, was demoted to position number 31 on the 200-name list after an extended meeting of the ANC's national executive committee.</p>

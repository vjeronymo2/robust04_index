The computer data contained on the computer diskettes submitted are subject to the protective order attached to the Commission's decision served July 15, 1994, and are for the exclusive use of Commission employees working directly with review of substantive matters in this proceeding. The flexibility provided by such computer file data will facilitate expedited review by the Commission and its staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Discovery may begin immediately. The Commission will not tolerate dilatory tactics in response to discovery requests designed to elicit relevant evidence.

Responses must be served upon all parties of record, and five copies of those responses must be concurrently filed with the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We plan to conclude the evidentiary phase of this proceeding by January 2, 1996.

Evidence supporting protestants' responsive applications must use 1993 as the base year and the depreciation accounting system, and applicants' evidence in opposition to the responsive applications must use 1993 and depreciation accounting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We advise protestants that, if they seek to have the primary application denied, or seek conditions if approved, because they contend their ability to provide essential service and/or competition will be harmed, they must present substantial evidence in support of their positions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Lamoille Valley R.R. Co. v. ICC, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  711 F.2d 295 (D.C.

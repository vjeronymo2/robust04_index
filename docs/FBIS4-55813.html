			<p>BFN     [Text] The Muslim-Croat peace agreement is mostly being  respected in central Bosnia. However, HINA [Croatian news  agency] has learned from the command of the HVO [Croat Defense  Council] Vitez operational zone that certain events in the field  warn about resistance to the peace agreement and the  establishment of the Bosniak-Croat federation. An official  government delegation of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna,  headed by Vice Prime Minister Perica Jukic, was last night  harassed and threatened at gunpoint between Gornji Vakuf and  Novi Travnik, an area under the control of the armed forces of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Another official HVO delegation was stopped  and mistreated in the same area yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> The Rev. James Lawson is one of dozens of clergy, religious workers and other  protesters arrested for blocking the entrance to the Los Angeles Federal  Building in weekly non-violent protests over U.S. military aid to El Salvador.  On Wednesday, for instance, Lawson was arrested along with 62 others, including  actors Martin Sheen and Ed Asner, in the protest prompted by the killings and  persecution during the civil war in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Yet Lawson, pastor of Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles, brings  distinctive credentials for church-related civil disobedience.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, Lawson was in Memphis to receive the National Conference of  Christian and Jews' second annual Human Rights Award. The citation recalled  Lawson's roles as activist and strategist in the early civil rights movement  led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. King was assassinated in Memphis in 1968  when he was there to lend support to that city's sanitation workers' strike, a  protest led by Lawson, then a Memphis pastor.  </P> <P> Lawson, who has pastored the 2,700-member Holman church since 1974, has been  president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference for the last eight years.  </P> <P> Although he has been involved locally in social issues and participated in  anti-aparthied protests, Lawson had not been arrested in Southern California  for nonviolent protests until the current furor by American church leaders over  continued U.S. aid to El Salvador.  </P> <P> "I think we need to try to arouse the consciousness of this country that our  tax dollars are persecuting church workers in Central America, that American  public policy is engaged in killing of sisters and brothers of our faith," he  said in an interview.  </P> <P> The U.S.-backed government in Central America has claimed that rebel forces are  receiving aid and comfort from churches and religious relief agencies.  </P> <P> "Irrespective of what the rebel group may represent . . . Catholic parishes,  Lutherans, Baptists, Episcopal lay workers and others trying to organize  themselves for their own well-being are the primary targets -- apparently of  the death squads and the military," Lawson said.  </P> <P> His fourth arrest on Wednesday was the most painful, Lawson said. At each  demonstration, police have booked the protesters and given them citations to  either appear in court or pay a fine. "I was in handcuffs this time from 9 a.m.  to nearly 3 p.m. It was very painful . . . (but) it was a good experience,"  Lawson said.  </P> <P> Lawson said organizers, including Jesuit Father Gregory Boyle, plan to continue  the protests, except for Dec. 27, each Wednesday morning into January. "Our  numbers are increasing," said Boyle, who said he hoped "that 1,000 people (will  come) to shut this building down."  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles invited more than 350 needy children  to the annual Archbishop's Christmas Party to be held at 10 a.m. today at  Filmland Center in Culver City. The co-hosts for the charity event are actress  Cindy Williams, well-known for her role on the "Laverne and Shirley" TV series,  and Lynne Stewart of "Pee Wee's Playhouse."  </P> <P> The Rev. Clifton King, 65, pastor of the Encino Community Church for the last  12 years and an unconventional minister who made visitations on a motorcycle,  will retire from the ministry by year's end to take a position with a  management training company, said a spokeswoman for the 350-family, independent  congregation. The Rev. Edward Keebler, most recently an Army chaplain, will  succeed King.  </P> <P> MAILINGS  </P> <P> Don't get too excited if you receive a letter from the "American Christian  Leadership Council" in Atlanta that begins: "Congratulations! You have been  nominated to be honored in the 1989 edition of Who's Who in American Christian  Leadership." Such a letter was addressed not long ago to "L. A. Times," and it  began, "Good Morning L: Congratulations! You have been nominated to be honored  in. . . ." JOHN DART  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A. WEINBERG; WRITER AND SOCIAL HISTORIAN  </P> <P> Social historian and author Arthur Weinberg, probably best known for his  biographical works on legendary attorney Clarence Darrow, died Saturday at a  Chicago hospital. He was 73.  </P> <P> Weinberg wrote "Attorney for the Damned," an anthology of Darrow's greatest  case summations, in 1957; it was on the New York Times best-seller list for 19  weeks. He also co-authored with his wife, Lila, six other works of nonfiction,  including "Clarence Darrow: A Sentimental Rebel" in 1980.  </P> <P> The others are "The Muckrakers," selected for the White House library during  the John F. Kennedy Administration; "Instead of Violence," a study of  nonviolence through the ages; "Some Dissenting Voices," a book about dissenters  aimed at young adults; "Verdicts Out of Court," another Darrow study, and  "Passport to Utopia," about economic and social highlights in U.S. history.  Both "A Sentimental Rebel" and "Verdicts" are to be rereleased this spring.  </P> <P> At the time of his death, Weinberg was a 1988-89 Lloyd Lewis Fellow in American  History at Chicago's Newberry Library, where he spent many years as a scholar  and researcher.  </P> <P> Describing himself as a "philosophical anarchist," Weinberg was active in the  Industrial Workers of the World and served a term as its president during the  1930s.  </P> <P> At the time of his death, Weinberg and his wife were working on "Bold Spirits:  Women of Hull House," about the early women who lived in that pioneering place,  and also were consultants on two television projects about Darrow's life.  </P> <P> His writing and book reviews have appeared in numerous publications, including  the Saturday Review, Ebony, the Progressive and the Los Angeles Times.  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Wintry whiff of discontent: Labour relations in Europe are not all gloomy, but there are some ominous trends Striking Air France workers wearing masks block runways at Orly airport in Paris. Beefeaters at the Tower of London go on strike in protest at government plans to shake up the civil service. Workers in Italy and Germany take to the streets against government economic policy. In Spain and Belgium unions threaten to wreck social pacts designed to create jobs. The events of the past fortnight might indicate that Europe is heading for a winter of industrial protest. But a closer examination reveals a less threatening and more confusing picture - one that nevertheless cannot be ignored by Mr Jacques Delors and other European Community policymakers seeking a blueprint for lower unemployment and greater competitiveness. Much of the recent disruption has been limited to the public sector. Even here, nationwide protests have involved at most one-day stoppages. In none of the countries mentioned has there been any significant unrest in the private sector. While public sector action is likely to continue sporadically, token protests must be viewed in the context of a continent deep in recession, with most governments pruning public spending in their efforts to contain large budget deficits. 'What requires explanation is why strikes are so rare despite painful industrial restructuring and strong downward pressure on European wage rates,' says Mr Peter Reid of the British Engineering Employers Federation. The presence of 18m unemployed in the EC is part of the answer. The Air France dispute was about job security not pay. Similarly, protests in Italy and the UK have been primarily about jobs. And I G Metall, the German engineering workers' union, says this year's crucial pay round is about employment first and pay second. Another part of the answer is to be found in the fragmentation of Europe's labour movements. The collapse of the Soviet Union has accelerated the decline of communist-led union federations in Spain and France. In France, the communist CGT no longer holds the majority of seats on the workers' committee at its one-time stronghold at Renault. Other former communist federations such as the CGIL in Italy have changed strategy and supported, for instance, the end of the scala mobile which linked pay to inflation. Meanwhile, the non-communist union federations - Christian democrat, socialist or social democrat - are often linked to parties that see no virtue in public ownership for its own sake and in many cases recognise the need to introduce more flexibility into labour markets. In Spain, for example, it is the ruling Socialist Workers party that is trying to remove some of the formidable obstacles to sacking workers. Finally, domestic and international competition has made industrial action in the private sector increasingly counter-productive. 'Unions are no longer targeting the means of production but are aiming at high-profile protests, such as closing down motorways,' says Mr Denis MacShane a leading international trade union official. Despite these developments, the rumblings from Europe's weakened workers underline three ominous trends: The problems of union decline. Weak unions are no guarantee of industrial harmony. France, the centre of the most eye-catching recent disruption, has the lowest rate of unionisation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But Mr Michel Giraud, labour minister in the centre-right government, says he would like to be able to consult with stronger unions, because they would be more receptive to compromise. Unionisation is denser in the French public sector than in the private sector, but the loose hold that union leaders have over the rank and file, even in the public sector, prevented an early conclusion of the dispute at Air France. In many other EC countries, union strength is declining in the workplace even when they still have an important influence in national politics. In France and Spain, unions have concentrated on political lobbying and have gradually withdrawn from the messy business of representing real people with real concerns over job security and pay. At local level, the vacuum left by weak unions is being filled by ad hoc, and often aggressive, 'co-ordinations' - growing fast in Italy and France. The just-in-time strike. Traditional strike action may be going out of fashion but a short, well-directed industrial blow can cause more damage than in the past. The closure of Orly airport by a few Air France workers illustrated how vulnerable modern economies can be to small-scale direct action. This is a French tradition - the word sabotage comes from the French word for wooden clog, which workers used to throw into their machines - but it is not peculiar to France. In Italy recently, employees of Enichem, the state-owned chemicals company, carried out a violent occupation of their Crotone plant. The result was that the government shelved a plan to close the plant. Just-in-time manufacturing techniques, which drastically reduce stocks, have exacerbated manufacturers' vulnerability. Two years ago fewer than 200 Arab workers at a Renault plant in Cleon, northern France, stopped making car engines and within days the entire Renault operation had come to a halt. New technology also allows small groups of workers to inflict disproportionate damage. In the UK in 1989, strike action by a handful of computer operators stopped all local tax collection in Birmingham. New social contracts under threat. Most worrying, recent protests indicate that some EC governments might have to push through jobs and competitiveness packages without organised labour's support. In both Spain and Belgium important sections of organised labour appear determined to reject 'social pacts' which would create jobs, but also hold down wages for three years. In Spain the government's proposal includes an overhaul of costly dismissal procedures and in Belgium a reduction in employers' social security payments. Such hostility bodes ill for Mr Delors' job creation plans. Next month he should publish a consultative paper arguing that over the long term the proceeds of European economic growth should be shared more widely and not appropriated by those in secure jobs. European unions fear his proposals could mean tax cuts for employers but wage cuts and longer hours for employees, with no guarantee of higher employment. One EC official said: 'It's not much good sharing out growth if there isn't any.' At European level the unions are likely to be offered the trade-off of legislation on European works councils - forums for informing and consulting workers in multinational companies. This is a low-cost item for companies but passionately desired by unions, which view it as a step towards Europe-wide bargaining. At national level, or company level, trade-offs are more problematic for the unions. But the idea of reducing working time with a corresponding cut in pay - thus leaving unit labour costs broadly unchanged - is attracting growing political support. For instance, Volkswagen, Germany's problem-hit volume carmaker, is promoting the idea of work-sharing to avoid mass lay-offs. And a recent opinion poll in Germany found that half the population would work a four-day week for a reduced income. The European Commission and the French government also back the idea; the latter has just passed legislation to reduce companies' non-wage social costs if they cut the working time of existing workers by 15 per cent and hire at least 10 per cent more workers. However, many leading industrial employers doubt that work-sharing is compatible with holding down unit labour costs. Equally sceptical, Air France workers reflected the reservations of many by rejecting a pay cut to save jobs. Organised labour in Europe does not have the veto power it once did. But the events of the past few weeks suggest that it remains a factor to be reckoned with, at least in those countries where its rights are enshrined in law. If governments across Europe want union support for innovative plans to cut unemployment, they still have some persuading to do.</p>

The meeting, the first one on unification and security  policy  coordination, decided that all unification matters, diplomacy  related to the DPRK and security problems should be discussed  among various ministries so as to harmonize their views.    The various ministries and secretariats should push ahead  with the policies of unification and security under the  principle that the government must seek progress in inter-Korean  relations.    The meeting was presided over by minister of the National  Unification Board (NUB) Yi Yong-tok and attended by heads of the  foreign and defense ministries, the Agency for National Security  Planning, Presidential Secretariat as well as Secretariat for  Foreign and National Security Affairs.    "We looked into the overall situation of unification and  security" following the United Nations Security Council's  presidential statement on the DPRK's nuclear issue and the  suspension of inter-Korean working-level contact, NUB Minister  Yi said after the meeting.    The government ministries and departments concerned will  discuss every relevant policy to iron out their differences, Yi  added.    Coordination meetings will be held more than once a week and  President Kim Yong-sam will chair the sessions when necessary,  according to official sources.</p>

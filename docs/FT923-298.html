			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (4): Why banks must beware securities INTERNATIONAL BANKING DEREGULATION: THE GREAT BANKING EXPERIMENTby Richard Dale Blackwell Pounds 40, 211 pages SHOULD BANKS be allowed to get into the securities business? To some the question may seem absurd. No one asks whether a tobacco company should be allowed to diversify into, say, food processing. The only relevant question is whether experience and analysis suggest that such a move would be in the long term interest of the company and its shareholders. Banks, however, are special. Failure, or the threat of failure of one bank, can weaken rather than strengthen its competitors. Because of their central position in the financial economy, what happens to banks can have serious knock-on effects. So banks are regulated in a way other industries are not. On mixing banking and securities businesses, regulatory and institutional practice has varied widely. In Germany and Switzerland it has always been allowed. In the UK it has only prevailed since 'Big Bang' in 1986. In the US it was common in the 1920s but has been illegal under the Glass-Steagall Act since 1933 because it was thought to have contributed to the Great Depression. In Japan, a law analogous to Glass-Steagall has been in force since the war under a US legal code. Richard Dale's study is a model of clarity in exposition and fair-mindedness in argument. The central chapters describe the position in half-a-dozen countries, analysing the underlying dynamics: how and why did matters come to be as they are and what are the pressures for change? Framing these chapters is an excellent discussion of the arguments in principle for and against the merging of banking and securities activities. Banks have usually argued in favour, citing potential economic benefits for themselves and their customers in terms of greater competition, cost savings and the convenience of 'one-stop' banking. Dale is prepared to accept the force of these arguments (though experience in London since Big Bang might argue for scepticism). Regulators and legislators tend to have been cautious on two main grounds: potential conflicts of interest and the dangers of contagious risk. Conflicts of interest can arise when the roles of principal and agent or adviser are combined - the possibilities of 'stuffing' clients with particular securities; of all kinds of insider information; and of distortion of securities markets by the lending power of banks. Again, however, Dale is not too worried by these problems believing, perhaps reasonably, that a regime of Chinese Walls, properly policed and legally enforced, will minimise the dangers. Dale's over-riding concern is with increased risk. Although later work appears to absolve universal banking in the US in the 1920s from most of the blame for exacerbating the Depression, and although securities activities do not appear statistically more risky than banking, there remains for Dale the crucial point that 'they do provide opportunities for additional risk-taking for aggressively managed institutions'. The behaviour of the US Savings and Loan institutions provides him with an awful warning. If a bank is allowed to do securities business, how can we avoid the danger that losses in that business may threaten the individual bank and thus - potentially - the system? First, we need adequate supervision. But the securities industry needs its own regulators. So a conglomerate bank will have at least two (often more) supervisors, with attendant dangers of divided responsibilities. Dale is critical of the UK's pragmatic solution to the problem by means of establishing for each institution a lead-regulator with arrangements for passing information between regulators. It is untidy, but probably works better in practice than Dale allows. But not even a perfect supervisory regime can (or should) prevent losses. If, in spite of all efforts, a securities subsidiary of a bank runs up losses that are substantial in relation to the bank's balance sheet, how is the bank to be protected? One solution, canvassed in the US in the current debate on whether to repeal Glass-Steagall, is to make it legally possible (or even required) for the parent to walk away from the subsidiary. Dale argues forcibly (and surely rightly) that this would in practice prove impossible, or dangerous - or both. The opposite solution is, while accepting that the parent must take responsibility, to require that the subsidiary is fully, separately capitalised. But, Dale argues, to be effective this approach is likely to make it economically pointless for the two activities to be combined. So Dale believes the circle cannot be squared. In this, he is perhaps too tidy-minded. But he is right to warn of the risks of experimentation, especially in the present state of the world's financial system - risks of which those in Brussels charged with developing the prospective regime for the EC appear to under-rate.</p>

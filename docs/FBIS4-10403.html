			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Mr. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the presidential  candidate for the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], said  before autonomous PRI peasant organizations that he is committed  to eliminating bureaucratic pitfalls that have hindered the  development of Mexican agriculture.    [Begin Zedillo recording] We also have to work for the  productive recovery of the countryside; this is very urgent.  For many years, Mexico's farmlands have been either at a  standstill or have been growing at a very gradual rate. [end  recording]    The PRI candidate promised to break the vicious circle that  has kept 18 million of the nation's 23 million peasants in  poverty. To do this, he promised a very vigorous social policy.    [Begin Zedillo recording] My pledge is to eliminate all of  those obstacles that have limited agriculture's productive  potential. We must specifically attack the severe bureaucratic  problem that still afflicts Mexican farming. If there is a  single victim of centralism in Mexico, it is the Mexican  peasant. [end recording]    Peasant leaders who spoke with the PRI candidate were  Alfonso  Garzon Santibanez from the Independent Peasants Central  Organization, Aquiles Cordoba from the Peasant Torch [Antorcha  Campesina], Humberto Serrano from the Mexican Agrarian Council,  Hugo Andres Arauco of the National Peasant Confederation, Jose  Luis Gonzalez of the General Union of Workers and Peasants of  the Mexican State, and Guadalupe Martinez Cruz of the National  Council of Tenant Farmer and Peasant Associations [Consejo  Nacional de Sociedades y Uniones Campesinas de Colonos]. All of  them voiced support for the PRI presidential candidate.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (13): Prague offers diversity  -The hotel market in eastern Europe is struggling to catch up with demand Since the collapse of communism in central and eastern Europe, Prague has been one of the most popular destinations for visitors to the region. But while the huge influx of visitors has been good news for local tradesmen and commerce, it has caused overcrowding at favourite sight-seeing spots such as Charles Bridge and Prague Castle, and suitable accommodation has been both more difficult to find and more expensive. The flow of tourists seems to have slowed this winter, though it may pick up again in the spring and summer, and it has been easier to book a hotel room. Scarcity of accommodation, however, means that prices remain high even in comparison with other European capitals, and the quality of service has yet to catch up with prices. Luxury class international hotels include the Forum, just two metro stops away from Wenceslas square; the new Atrium, which is slightly off the centre but boasts extensive business facilities; the Intercontinental, not far from Old Town Square; and the Jalta, on Wenceslas square. All these hotels are, broadly, 'modern' buildings, except for the Jalta which has been completely refurbished with pleasant rooms overlooking the square. The Jalta is less formal and staff tend to be more friendly. Hotels continue to charge foreigners several times more than the local residents for the same room - an unacceptable hangover from former communist days when westerners were seen as a source of easy money. For those who do not wish to pay Dollars 200 or more per night, there are a few smaller hotels on the Mala Strana side of the river. Alternatively, if you are planning to stay for a week or longer - and having a telephone or someone to take messages while you are out is not absolutely essential - bed and breakfast in a private home will be cheaper. The Czech tourist office should be able to provide you with a list of accommodation, but it is important to remember that you will need to do your own shopping for basics and that few people speak English in local shops. The quality and speed of service varies considerably even among the more expensive hotels, confirming the old adage that paying more does not necessarily mean better treatment. It is best to be patient. Prague has quickly adapted to some less appealing western traits, and petty crime and thefts have risen considerably in recent years. Don't leave a car with a foreign number plate parked on the street at night, but use the hotel car park or one of the few car parks near the city centre. (The latter are expensive, but your car will be safe.) Street parking in the centre of town is almost entirely limited to permit holders, so choose your spot carefully, otherwise your car could be clamped - and possibly towed away. It will take time and the payment of a fine to get it back. The large hotels usually have their own taxi service. These tend to be more expensive than a cab hailed in the street, but if you do not speak Czech they are your best bet. Taxi ranks in the city centre, such as the one on Old Town Square, should be avoided, as drivers sometimes refuse to switch on their meter and substantially overcharge. Local radio cab companies such as AAA are reliable. You may get a battered old Skoda for the ride, but the drivers tend to be more friendly and honest. There is a good clean airport taxi service which will bring you to the centre of Prague in about 40 minutes, depending on traffic, for less than Kcs500. The choice of duty-free goods at the airport is limited and you can pay only in hard currency, so if you plan to take goods home, they are best bought while in town. Czech cuisine is not for the faint-hearted and tends to be heavy. There are some reasonable white wines, though the local beer is by far the best drink. There is a wide choice of restaurants offering a mixture of Czech and international food around the centre.</p>

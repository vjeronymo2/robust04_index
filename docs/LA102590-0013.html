			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INTERIM BUILDING STANDARDS EXPIRE  </P> <P> The city of Lawndale's interim development standards for apartments expired  Monday, resurrecting a set of old standards that council members and others  have long complained are too lenient.  </P> <P> The interim standards were first imposed under an emergency ordinance last  October and then extended for 10 1/2 months to give city officials a chance to  develop permanent building guidelines for the construction of apartments.  </P> <P> But John Chapman, Lawndale planning director, said his department has been too  understaffed to develop a set of permanent guidelines, and he recommended that  the council extend the interim standards another year.  </P> <P> The council voted 2 to 1 Monday to extend the interim standards, with  Councilmen Larry Rudolph and William Johnson voting in favor and Councilwoman  Carol Norman dissenting. Mayor Harold E. Hofmann was ill. A fifth council seat  is vacant.  </P> <P> But because state law requires a four-fifths vote by the council to extend an  emergency ordinance of this type, the council's decision is invalid, Assistant  City Atty. Bob Owen said.  </P> <P> Under the interim apartment standards, developers were required to build larger  parking spaces and more guest parking spots and to incorporate more open space  into their projects.  </P> <P> Except for a few apartment projects that were already pending when the interim  development standards were imposed, no new apartment buildings have been built  in the last year, Chapman said.  </P></p>

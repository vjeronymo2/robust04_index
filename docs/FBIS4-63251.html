			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS and UKRINFORM correspondents] </F>   [Text] Simferopol/Kiev/Moscow May 19 TASS -- The Crimean  parliament postponed on Thursday the scheduled vote on  reintroducing items of a 1992 draft constitution of the Crimean  Republic which envisaged greater autonomy of the republic from  Kiev.    The decision was taken upon the demand of Crimean President  Yuriy Meshkov. Later, the president presented his explanations  for the postponement of the vote to a parliament closed-doors  meeting. Earlier Meshkov had been repeatedly calling on the  lawmakers "not to heighten temperature" on the peninsula.    Amid mounting tension in the Crimea, Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk disbanded on Thursday law enforcement ministries  of the self-style peninsula republic.    According to a presidential decree which was signed on  Thursday, Crimea's Interior Ministry was reorganised into a  department of the Interior Ministry of Ukraine directly  subordinated to Kiev.    Thus all local police forces with their premises, weapons,  transport means and other property were made responsible only to  Kiev.    Similar decrees have put under Kiev's control, Crimean  Security Service and Ministry of Justice making bringing their  status down to that of departments of respective Ukrainian  ministries.    By these decrees Kravchuk also appointed heads of the  aforesaid departments.    The regional parliament fired back and formally confirmed  the  appointment of Valeriy Kuznetsov full-fledged interior minister  of the Crimea. Earlier he was appointed to the post by Crimean  President Yuriy Meshkov.    Earlier today the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet reported that  for the past 24 hours some 1,000 Ukrainian home guards and  special forces had been dispatched to the Crimea including a  group of saboteurs now deployed close to Sevastopol, the main  base of the Black Sea Fleet.    In his angry message the Ukrainian president today warned  the  Crimean parliament against "the revision of basic principles of  relations between Ukraine and its integral part -- the Republic  of Crimea". "The violation of these principles might lead to  conflict situations and other unpredictable consequences",  Kravchuk stressed.    The Ukrainian president was even more resolute in his  telephone conversation with President Boris Yeltsin that took  place later in the day.    The Ukrainian president's press service quoted him as saying  that "Ukraine would take appropriate measures to preserve  territorial integrity of the state".    The Crimean parliament at its closed-doors meeting decided  to  postpone until Friday the discussion on reintroducing items of a  1992 draft constitution of the Crimean Republic which envisaged  greater autonomy of the republic from Kiev.    The lawmakers voted against a proposal to send a delegation  to Kiev for negotiations with Ukraine's leadership.    In retaliation to President Kravchuk's decrees bringing  Crimean law enforcement bodies under direct control of Kiev, the  lawmakers appointed Vladimir Lepikhov chairman of the Crimean  Security Service, and Lyubov Yeliseyeva-Bora minister of justice.</p>

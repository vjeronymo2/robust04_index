			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / FBI to investigate Iraqi loans: Allegations of misconduct over US intelligence reports THE Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe into possible misconduct by senior Bush administration officials. The investigation follows admissions that US intelligence information about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) of militarily useful loans to Iraq was deliberately concealed from a federal court. These loans, made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, have been at the centre of a long-running scandal in which the Bush administration has been accused in Congress of covering up its own knowledge and involvement in the illegal financial transactions. Late last week Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Justice officials admitted in closed Senate testimony that intelligence reports on BNL had been withheld from a US court. The FBI probe, requested by Mr William Barr, the US attorney-general, came as officials of the CIA and Department of Justice engaged in an unusual slanging match about which agency had acted to withhold CIA reports from Judge Marvin Shoob, the federal judge who has presided over the BNL case. Mr Dan Levin, a Justice Department spokesman, said the FBI would investigate whether information had been withheld and whether there had been any misconduct by senior Bush administration officials. A substantial part of the BNL loans, including some that were guaranteed by the US government, financed Iraqi nuclear, chemical weapons and ballistic missile projects. Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, said last week that a special prosecutor should be named to investigate the BNL case. Senator David Boren, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said at the weekend that testimony from CIA and Justice Department officials had created 'very troubling' signs that both government agencies knew that a CIA report on BNL issued last month was misleading. The report examined whether the agency had any knowledge of the involvement of BNL's head office in Rome. It claimed that the CIA had only heard of Rome's involvement from 'publicly available sources'. However, the report was immediately contradicted by the disclosure in Congress of another classified CIA report. Both the CIA and Justice Department yesterday denied their officials had deliberately misled Congress or the court. But a Senate official who was present during the testimony confirmed these admissions were made. Mr Robert Mueller, the assistant attorney-general, acknowledged that he had personally rejected an attempt by the CIA to issue a clarifying statement. 'The reason why I did not believe it should be published was that it did not resolve the conflict between the conclusion of the underlying (CIA) summary and the document on which it was purportedly based.' Mr Mueller said that while he tried to resolve the discrepancy, 'I never got an adequate response from the CIA.'</p>

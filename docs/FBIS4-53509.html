			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nate Thayer in Battambang and Nayan Chanda in </F> Phnom Penh: "Things Fall Apart..."]    [Excerpts] Remember the Cambodian peace accords? The  glittering ceremonies in Paris' Kleber conference hall? The  United Nations peacekeepers in Cambodia? They are all a distant  dream now as hundreds are killed and tens of thousands flee  their burning villages. As if to remind the international  community that Cambodia is back to warfare as usual, the Khmer  Rouge has taken to beheading its victims, and a beleaguered  government army seeks to shore up its morale by displaying the  severed head of a captured Khmer Rouge soldier. [passage  omitted] The head of a captured Khmer Rouge soldier, chopped off  during interrogation in early May, is on display in front of a  military installation on Battambang's main road. And according  to the government, the Khmer Rouge raped and beheaded 10  soldiers' wives in a border village, though independent  confirmation of that report was unavailable. [passage omitted]</p>

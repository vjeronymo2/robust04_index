			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Sport: They're lean and mean - Rugby Football DOWN THE years there have been good England rugby teams and less good ones. England's team in the current Five Nations' Championship is the best ever. They proved that in the second half against Scotland and throughout the memorable game against Ireland in which they scored six tries. Their performance at Twickenham two weeks ago was remarkable because Ireland won 50 per cent of the possession and had the put-in at 15 of the game's 21 scrums. The mind boggles at what England might have done with more possession. If Will Carling's team beat France in Paris this afternoon, as they should, and go on and win the Grand Slam, as they should, they will have proved themselves the best European team in the international championships for at least 30 years. How they have done this is instructive. They have based their methods on those of a successful club. A squad system was introduced and a team manager, Geoff Cooke, appointed. Cooke has brought stability and consistency to team selection. They were not always present before. Cooke has also introduced mental training techniques. When he gave tapes for mental rehearsal to Paul Rendall and Jeff Probyn, England's props, he received a dusty answer. He did not give up however. Prior to the Irish game he asked every player to write down six reasons why they wanted to play for England and six reasons that motivated them to their best performances. Even a seemingly simple exercise such as this had a benefit: it helped the players concentrate their minds on the task in hand. The most significant reason for England's surge forward is their dedication to fitness. England's players are fitter than ever and whether or not they bring home the bacon in the form of the grand slam this season, this achievement can not be taken away from them. They are 25 per cent fitter than Wales's, believes Alan Davies, Wales's coach, and much fitter than Ireland's, too. England tried to improve their fitness as long ago as the mid-1970s. It did not work then any more than did the practice of having the selectors in track suits on the pitch at training sessions, not to mention Larry Lamb, the referee, Don Rutherford, a doctor and a physiotherapist and one or two other well-minded but misguided England camp followers. 'I was told I had to run six miles in 48 minutes and be able to do ten 150 yard sprints each in 18 seconds,' recalls one England international of that vintage. 'What use was that to me? It would not increase my speed over 30 yards and that was what I needed, explosive speed not stamina. Anyway the senior players put an end to it. We were supposed to be tested at Aldershot and only the scrum-halves and a couple of other backs turned up. The senior players all refused.' In 1986, McNab returned to work with the England squad and his principles are now followed. A number of England players recently achieved oxygen uptake figures measuring the capacity of the heart and lungs that would have been respectable for highly-trained athletes. Although their weight and body size have increased, body fat has diminished, in some cases to proportions almost as low as marathon runners. England's rugby players are not just mean, they're lean, too. Rugby throws up famous players in groups of two or three: Mesnel and Sella currently representing France, for example; Price, Windsor and Faulkner, the Pontypool Front Row, for Wales in the 1970s; Marques and Currie, the England locks of nearly 40 years ago. A considerable part of England's current success is due to the centre partnership of Carling and Guscott. Concentrate on one and the other is away. They are fast in attack and strong in defence and two better centres have not played together for England. They are the heart of a potent three-quarter line. As other countries have found to their cost, concentrate on Guscott and Carling and England wings Halliday and Underwood, will go on a spree and, if they do not then Webb will, as he did two weeks ago. As he surveyed the wreckage of his Irish team at Twickenham Ciaran Fitzgerald observed: 'England's back division had everything you could ask for - speed,teamwork and strength. They had a great ability to penetrate, not with one single player but in numbers.' There have been two mould-breaking British teams in the past 21 years. The first was the 1971 British Lions, the first Lions to win a series in New Zealand, and the second was the 1974 British Lions, who went unbeaten through a Test series in South Africa. This current England team should be regarded as mould breakers, too.</p>

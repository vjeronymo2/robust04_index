			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his wife, First Lady  Ana Paulo dos Santos, are at the head of the list of corrupt  people in Angola. Reliable reports reaching our news desk today  confirm that the Futungo de Belas couple is involved in cases of  corruption and stealing Angola's wealth.    Those sources say that Jose Eduardo dos Santos is losing  credibility in the international community because it has been  found that he has great personal wealth and that he has links  with corrupt Angolan figures. [passage omitted]    The international community has found that Eduardo dos  Santos  has property and large financial investments both in the country  and abroad. The amounts in his coded bank accounts in Italy,  Switzerland, and France are also known.    Ana Paulo dos Santos, his wife, is also involved in  corruption. [passage omitted]    There are other threads to the Futungo de Belas web of  corruption. They have been uncovered by the international  community, which believes corruption in Angola can only have  reached its present dimensions because the Angolan president is  both involved and protecting others. Those sources say it is no  accident that the best known figures involved in corruption are  all proteges of and close to Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The names  listed include Jose Leitao, who made a 30 percent profit in the  recent $180 million weapons deal with Russia; Joao de Matos,  currently Angolan Armed Forces chief of General Staff; Alberto  Neto, head of an aviation company that works almost exclusively  with the military sector; Norberto dos Santos, minister of  assistance and social reintegration; Agriculture Minister Isaac  dos Anjos; and Territorial Administration Minister Paulo  Kassoma. [passage omitted]    Those sources added that other figures involved in Jose  Eduardo dos Santos' web of corruption are: Finance Minister  Emanuel Carneir, Deputy Petroleum Minister Desiderio Costa, and  Noe Baltasar, Angola National Diamond Enterprise director  general.

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grumman lays down guidelines ahead of auction Grumman, which this month became the subject of a Dollars 2bn takeover battle between fellow defence groups Martin Marietta and Northrop, yesterday tried to lay down procedures for an unusually rapid auction of the company, calling on both sides to submit their best bids by 5pm this Thursday. Grumman, which makes defence electronics and military aircraft, laid down the bidding procedure in letters sent to both Martin Marietta and Northrop. Grumman agreed on March 7 to a friendly Dollars 1.9bn, or Dollars 55 a share, bid from Martin Marietta. However, Northrop, with which Grumman had held several months of secret takeover discussions, then launched a hostile Dollars 60 a share bid, worth Dollars 2.04bn. In spite of Grumman's initial enthusiasm for a deal with Martin Marietta, the board is required by law to obtain the best value for shareholders, and yesterday's statement represented its first acknowledgement that the company will be sold to the highest bidder. US takeover battles can last for many months but Grumman yesterday sought to impose a very short timetable, arguing that a prolonged process would disrupt its business. It said it wanted a single and final round of bidding, with each company submitting its best offer by 5pm on March 31. Grumman would not disclose the offers until it had accepted one of them, and the bidders would keep their offers confidential and on the table until 9am on Monday April 4. It reserved the right to change the rules. Analysts noted that it might be hard for Grumman to stick to its timetable if one or other bidder demanded more time to produce a higher bid, since a raised offer would be in shareholders' best interests.</p>

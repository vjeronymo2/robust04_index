			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / VAT on fuel 'will cut energy use' PUTTING value added tax on domestic fuel will reduce household use of energy by 6 per cent, a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies says today. It says the impact will be felt most heavily by low-income households, which spend a higher-than-average proportion of their income on fuel. The poorest 20 per cent of households will cut energy consumption by 9 per cent but still face increases in energy costs of 2 per cent of their total spending. For average households, the extra tax will be about 1.1 per cent of their total spending. The government needs to spend an extra Pounds 430m on social security benefits next year to compensate for the tax increase, the institute says. The tax, which was announced in the March Budget, has created a political row that is likely to dominate next week's Conservative conference. VAT will be charged on domestic fuel at 8 per cent from April next year and at 17.5 per cent a year later. Increased fuel prices will eventually feed through into higher social security benefits through the annual indexation process, but the institute says that indexation - based on average households - is likely to be less than the poorest families need to cover their increase in fuel bills. It will also come through a year after the charges are imposed. The institute recommends bringing forward the indexation of benefits in the first year, so that benefits rise at the time VAT is imposed - this would cost Pounds 330m in 1994-95. It also recommends additional help for pensioners to recognise the importance of heating bills in the budgets of the elderly. Adjustments to means-tested benefits to double the compensation paid to the elderly would cost Pounds 100m. Although the measure has been taken largely to boost tax revenues, the government has stressed the environmental benefits of the tax in lower energy consumption. The institute says VAT 'would be less efficient at restraining carbon dioxide emissions' from burning fuel than the carbon tax proposed by the European Commission. A MORI opinion poll in The Times today says that 92 per cent of all voters and 83 per cent of Tory voters are against the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel. A total of 94 per cent of all voters oppose VAT on children's clothes and 80 per cent VAT on books.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Candidate for the  post of Ukraine's prime minister, people's deputy Vitaliy Masol,  said in an exclusive interview for UNIAN during a break in the  session that he was doubtful as to his own need to accept the  possible appointment. "It would not add to the image, and in a  while there will be a lot of ruckus and I will be blamed for all  sins." Masol believes economic management over the past two  years has led to a great many irreparable losses. He stressed  that his only motive was "being unable to remain on the  sidelines after the Kuchma government has made, alas, so many  ill-considered moves." Masol said he had seen the report by  Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz, who will present his  proposals on overcoming Ukraine's economic crisis at the  parliament session on 15 June. He denied having drawn up  Moroz's "main guidelines" himself, but said that a lot of it had  been borrowed by the speaker from Masol's own book.</p>

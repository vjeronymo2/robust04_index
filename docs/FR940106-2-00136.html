			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on these comments, NHTSA has decided that requiring parts marking in MY 1995 for the new vehicle lines determined to be high theft based on the CY 1990&hyph;1991 theft data would impose an undue burden on manufacturers. The agency also agrees with Volkswagen that requiring newly designated high theft lines to be marked beginning with model year 1995 may not permit some manufacturers to submit timely petitions for exemption from parts marking for its vehicle lines, pursuant to part 543. Section 543.5(b)(4) requires a manufacturer to submit a petition ``at least 8 months before the commencement of production of the line(s).'' For a manufacturer which plans to introduce its model year 1995 lines in the summer of 1994, Part 543 petitions may already be due at NHTSA. Delaying parts marking to model year 1996 would permit all manufacturers to submit timely petitions for exemption from parts marking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, NHTSA plans to apply the parts marking requirement for newly designated high theft lines, including cars and MPV's/LDT's, pursuant to the 1990/91 median theft rates, beginning with model year 1996. This expectation will be reflected in a future rulemaking to amend the Theft Prevention Standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Effect of 1990/91 Median Theft Rate on Lines Previously Determined To Be High Theft <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nissan made several observations regarding the effect of the 1990/91 median theft rate on Nissan vehicle lines previously determined to be high theft. NHTSA confirms Nissan's understanding that the Infiniti Q45, although ranked no. 177 in the final theft rates, continues to be a high theft line subject to the theft prevention standard. Section 603(a)(5) of the ACTA provides that any line subject to parts marking when the original Motor Vehicle Theft Act was enacted continues to be so subject, and that the only exemptions are for vehicles with NHTSA-approved antitheft devices. See also section 603(d). In model year 1990, the Infiniti Q45 was granted an exemption from parts marking, based on a standard antitheft device on all vehicles in the line. (See 53 FR 45181; November 8, 1988.) Thus, Nissan may continue to place the antitheft device on all vehicles in the Q45 line, in lieu of parts marking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA also confirms that the publication of this final theft data has no effect on the Nissan Infiniti J30, which was not yet introduced in 1990 or 1991. The Infiniti J30, a high theft line introduced in model year 1993, was also granted an exemption from parts marking, beginning with model year 1993. (See 56 FR 47983; September 23, 1991.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Theft Data and Final Median Rate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Table I of this document, the agency lists each of the 231 vehicle lines manufactured in model years 1990 and 1991 in descending order according to theft rate. Based on the data set forth in Table I, NHTSA has determined the final median theft rate for 1990 and 1991 to be 3.5866 thefts per 1000 vehicles produced. The final median is the theft rate ranked 116th (3.5866 thefts per thousand) in the table, according to the instructions in section 603(b)(2) of the Cost Savings Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If NHTSA has not previously determined the line to be high theft, each line shown in positions 1 through 115, inclusive, in Table I, will be subject to selection as a high theft line. In selecting high theft lines based on the 1990/91 median theft rate, NHTSA will follow the procedures it established in 49 CFR part 542 Procedures for Selecting Lines to be Covered by the Theft Prevention Standard, and provide affected manufacturers an opportunity to comment on NHTSA's preliminary determination that a line is high theft. Final selection by NHTSA will mean that the vehicles in these lines and their major replacement parts will have to be marked as specified in 49 CFR part 541, the vehicle theft prevention standard, beginning with model year 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Table II of this document lists previously designated high theft lines with theft rates below the median theft rate of 3.5866, and Table III lists lines that have theft rates above the median theft rate and have major parts interchangeable with those of lines that have theft rates below the median theft rate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  19 U.S.C. 2021 and 2023; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: December 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Howard M.

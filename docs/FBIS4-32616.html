			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Sugar: "The Unknown Face of Vladimir </F> Meciar"]    [Text] The man who on Friday morning shortly before 1000  entered the premises of Radio Twist on Salviova Street was  undoubtedly the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS], Vladimir Meciar. But he bore no resemblance to  the politician who, at gatherings in the Park of Culture and  Recreation or in the television program "Kroky" [Steps], shocks  spectators with angry revelations about his political  sympathizers from the Movement or the coalition. This Meciar,  who is visibly thinner, is a sympathetic, direct man with a  cordial smile on his face, who appears to me to be diffident  rather than aggressive.    Before the leader of the opposition enters the soundproof  booth of the broadcasting studio of Radio Twist to answer  listeners' questions in an hour-long roundtable, Lubos Machaj,  program director, greets him and points out the modest premises  of this modest radio station. Then he gives him the pleasant  news about the relative strength of listeners who support his  politics and those who condemn it: it is 50-50. That was  indicated by the questions phoned in to Radio Twist by 70  listeners a day before the broadcast. I looked at Meciar, who  received this information with modest satisfaction.    Even before the HZDS chairman accepted the invitation of the  radio station, we asked him several questions in order to take  advantage of the situation and not have to talk to him by phone.  We were interested to know how much truth there is to the rumors  about the security measures in the HZDS building on Tomasikova  Street. The shadow prime minister does not deny anything but  acknowledges only that they accepted four members of the  security guard. The bullet-proof glass in the windows of his  office he consigns to the realm of disinformation games. In the  brief interview, we also touched on the question of tapping  politicians' telephone conversations, which Ludovit Cermak  complained about at the meeting of the National Council.    "Let them listen in on me all they want," Vladimir Meciar  declared. "It does not bother me at all. When you have a  politician who tells everything on radio or television anyway,  it is really a waste of time." But he nevertheless admits that,  in the past, during the totalitarian regime, security did tap  his phone. But because he knew that a recording on tape lasts  only 45 minutes, he saved the important matters for after this  time elapsed. (Editor's comment: This is obviously a  misunderstanding because we know that State Security used the  so-called endless tapes for tapping phones, which eliminated the  possibility of missing some of the conversation.) However, the  interview, which Radio Twist broadcast, could be taped by  anyone. And certainly his political opponents taped and listened  to it in order to find out what he learned from his political  defeat and whether he chose another tactic. It seems to me that  he did. Not only from what he said, but rather from what he did  not say. He was not confrontational, he did not thunder at his  political opponents, he did not threaten with his planned steps,  and did not accuse his former sympathizers of betrayal. He  answered questions, even the most stupid ones, calmly, mildly,  and to the point. He conceded that the HZDS leadership made a  critical analyzis of the causes of what happened and came to the  conclusion that the fault was not in the people but in the  system, so that, in a year or two, this could happen again.    Vladimir Meciar realizes that people were already tired of  the constant political tension, permanent crisis, and a series  of scandals, and that they welcomed the relative calm that  filled the Slovak political scene after the change of the  government. He himself embraced nonconfrontational politics,  obviously also in order to win over citizens frightened by his  methods. As he said, "we want to address not only our  sympathizers, but also those who do not understand us. At this  time, we are drafting, with a large team of experts, a program  for the future development of Slovakia. We want to present it to  the voters for evaluation, and, if they like it, let them vote  for HZDS; if not, let them choose another alternative. But we  want to win over voters with our program, not by asserting that  we are good and the others are bad."    In the radio roundtable, Meciar had to listen not only to  questions from those who applaud him in the Park of Culture and  Recreation, but also from those who are horrified by the  possibility of his return to the political arena. After all,  Meciar recently declared that his first step will be to remove  President Michal Kovac from office. He moderated his tone, he  controls himself well, and he shows much more willingness to  meet others halfway, but obviously he will not forgive his  political opponents anything. It was clear mainly from what he  said about the election law that is being drafted:    "Moravcik's present party, which sits in the parliament  without the benefit of elections, is not legitimately in the  parliament and should collect 10,000 signatures. They are now  thinking about how to repeal this part of the election law, so  that they would not have to meet this obligation. But that would  create a situation where every family could establish its own  party and run in the elections."    We can accept this statement, to be sure, only with a big  dose of benevolence, as a kind of poetic license, because, to  establish a political party, you also need 10,000 signatures.  More fundamental will be whether Vladimir Meciar will succeed in  acquiring a new image of a more tolerant politician, one who  respects the rules of democratic politics and who will not  ruthlessly pursue his vision of political power. If he also  wants to convince the voters from other political parties of  this, he must first distance himself from the militant groups of  his followers, as he did in this interview, when he reacted to  the statement of one participant in the meeting: Better a civil  war than Michal Kovac as president.    "There can be an agent provocateur in every crowd," said  Meciar, "but that does not mean that this agent provocateur is  my follower. My followers were, and are, civil people." If  Vladimir Meciar succeeds in convincing our entire nation of  this, it will be his greatest victory.</p>

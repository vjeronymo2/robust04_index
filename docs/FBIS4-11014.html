			<p>BFN     [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua, commander of the Armed  Forces, yesterday admitted that the military has advised  Congress to update the 1954 Military Assistance Treaty with the  United States "to be consistent with the current situation."    The military chief indicated that every day U.S. economic  aid  is minimized and conditioned on various situations.    "It is assistance conditioned on many situations, even on  sanctions by the U.S. Government, because of U.S. preoccupation  with domestic policy. Nevertheless, I think the 1954 agreement  is necessary," he said.    According to Gen. Discua, the state should review both the  agreement and the two protocols signed by the two governments in  subsequent years.    "The Armed Forces are proposing the review because we are no  longer in the Cold War or an ideological war. In other words,  the world situation has changed completely. Therefore, the  agreements must be reviewed to update them according to the  current situation," he commented.    Discua indicated that certain rules are established in these  types of agreements. "We can see that in the treaty and in the  protocols there are many things that no longer agree with  current times," he added.    He explained that the military wants to update the documents  to see what commitments Honduras has as a state as a result of  the military aid.    "We are not asking for benefits. I think the rules of the  game have already been established. The U.S. Government has  been very clear by reducing defense expenditures," he indicated.    "Treaties are no longer bilateral agreements but  multilateral  agreements on integration and globalization. In other words, it  is a new foreign policy," he added.    For the military chief, the treaties signed in the 1950's  reflect a clear anticommunist position to strengthen democracy  and to cope with the Cold War and the ideological war. The U.S.  Government has set the rules of the game by promoting the  changes, he said.    Asked whether the Armed Forces favor a military presence in  Palmerola, he indicated that "they state that it is the will and  they are at the disposal of the Honduran Government and policy."  [sentence as published]    "We are now advising Congress to analyze this agreement,  without violating international regulations and laws, and  without seeking confrontation," he said.    "We want the agreement to be updated in accordance with the  new U.S. political agenda for the region and for Honduras. I  think that is fair," he stressed.    He recalled that the Armed Forces have presented to the  legislative branch a suggestion. "We clearly understand that it  is up to the civilian power to decide what it wants or what  should be done," he added.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI REFUSES TO NAME CENTER AFTER LUCY  </P> <P> America may love Lucy, but Simi Valley wants to keep it a distant affair.  </P> <P> The City Council has unanimously rejected a suggestion from one of Lucille  Ball's fans to name its yet-to-be-built cultural center after the comedienne.  Ball, who died April 26 at age 77 in Los Angeles, starred in the popular TV  series "I Love Lucy."  </P> <P> "To our knowledge, she's neither filmed nor visited here," Councilwoman Ann  Rock said. "There's just no connection."  </P> <P> The council's action Monday followed the proposal's defeat earlier this month  by the Cultural Arts Assn. The group soon will begin raising about $15 million  for a performing arts complex, including two theaters, at the Civic Center on  Tapo Canyon Road.  </P> <P> "To honor Lucy would preclude us from naming the center after a large donor,"  said Judy Michaels, association president.  </P> <P> Katherine Flook, the 82-year-old fan who campaigned vigorously for the  appellation, said she was disappointed by the city's decision and vowed  Wednesday to find another way to honor her idol, such as establishing a museum.  </P> <P> Asked if she had any Lucy memorabilia herself, Flook said that mementos were  not necessary because "I have her in my heart."  </P></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Smokescreen for more work by fewer Sir, Charles Handy has once again produced a rare book (Personal View, February 21) that analyses incisively and with originality some of the key dilemmas facing modern managers. In particular, he exposes the tension produced by calls for flexible and adaptable companies and the need for a committed and effective core of key knowledge workers. He is also very persuasive in his prescription for companies suffering this tension. However he, like the RSA in its recent interim report on its Inquiry into Tomorrow's Company, is much less convincing in explaining and justifying the call for tomorrow's company to operate in an 'inclusive' way. Isn't the term more of a smokescreen than illuminating when applied to the workforce and the wider community? In what sense can these 'stakeholders' be described as included when more managers are, as Handy points out, applying the formula ' 1/2 x 2 x 3' (half the workforce paid twice as much to produce three times as much)? Reconciling the conflicts between global pressures to operate more competitive companies (part of which means having less intrusive and 'burdensome' state sectors, deregulated labour markets and privatised welfare states) and the fallout this creates in terms of increasing numbers of excluded is one of the major social and political challenges facing Britain. Concealing this conflict behind a warm-hearted but ultimate empty rhetoric is doing no one any favours. Bob Tyrrell, Henley Centre, 9 Bridewell Place, Blackfriars, London EC4V 6AY</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: A SAFER WAY FOR SMALL INVESTORS TO BUY STOCKS  </P> <P> You think the stock market looks tempting: The Dow Jones industrial average is  up 7.5% since Jan. 1 and volume has been picking up. But like most small  investors these days, you hesitate to jump in for fear that equities may be  peaking and are due for a big correction.  </P> <P> Fortunately, many stock mutual fund companies in recent years have made this  process easier, and as a result it is gaining popularity among many investors.  </P> <P> Dollar cost averaging is, in effect, buying through an installment plan.  Instead of investing in one lump sum, you invest in regular increments: say,  $100 a month, instead of $1,000 all at once.  </P> <P> Such a process relieves you of trying to predict market peaks and valleys --  something at which most investors, including professional money managers, fail  miserably. If the market goes up, you will be thankful that you are earning  profits while you continually invest more. If the market goes down, you will be  happy because you will be buying shares at lower and lower prices, reducing  your average costs. And you'll feel a lot better than had you invested your  whole bundle at a market peak.  </P> <P> One key to making dollar cost averaging work is being sure you don't stop when  the market tumbles.  </P> <P> "Dollar cost averaging is an excellent way to make any kind of investment, but  the problem with it (is that) when things are going badly, investors stop,"  says Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco investment adviser who manages mutual fund  portfolios. "After the (October, 1987) crash, people just stopped. But that is  exactly when you should be doing it, because you will be buying at the cheapest  point."  </P> <P> Another advantage of dollar cost averaging: It is a good form of forced  savings, making you set aside a certain amount of your earnings every month for  long-term investing. Over time, you could build a considerable nest egg that  you can use to buy a home, fund your childrens' education or provide for a  comfortable retirement.  </P> <P> And dollar cost averaging gets you to think of stocks as a long-term  investment, which is appropriate anyway for small investors who don't follow  the market on a day-to-day basis like the pros. For while stocks definitely are  more volatile than bonds or certificates of deposit, over the long run they  consistently outperform other paper investments.  </P> <P> Dollar cost averaging can be applied to individual stocks, but it is best  applied to mutual funds. That is because buying individual stocks in small  amounts can be costly; brokerage firms typically charge higher commission rates  on smaller purchases. But applying dollar cost averaging to no-load mutual  funds won't cost you anything extra, since those funds don't charge sales  commissions anyway. And small investors gain diversification and professional  management through mutual funds.  </P> <P> Realizing the demand among investors for dollar cost averaging, many larger  fund groups have set up programs in recent years to do it for you. Many  investors say they don't have the discipline to write a check every month on  their own, says Stanley Egener, president of Neuberger &amp; Berman, a New York  mutual fund company.  </P> <P> Ask your fund group if it has such programs.  </P> <P> Some fund families, such as T. Rowe Price, will arrange with your employer to  have a certain amount -- as little as $50 a month -- automatically taken from  your paycheck at work. The money is then invested directly into the fund of  your choice. Major employers doing this with T. Rowe Price include Hughes  Aircraft, AT&amp;T, Unisys and Coldwell Banker, says T. Rowe Price spokesman  Steve Norwitz.  </P> <P> Other fund families, including Fidelity and many others, can arrange to have a  set amount transferred from your checking account at a bank or savings and loan  into a mutual fund. These usually require minimum monthly withdrawals of at  least $50 or $100, but most larger banks and S&amp;Ls will do it, usually  without charge. T. Rowe Price also allows you to order discretionary transfers  through a toll-free telephone number. In any case, you generally will need to  first open an account in the fund you are transferring money into, meeting its  initial minimum investment requirement.  </P> <P> Still other fund groups, such as Neuberger &amp; Berman, will allow you to  designate a set amount to be withdrawn each month from your money market mutual  fund. That money is then reinvested into another fund in that group. Neuberger  &amp; Berman, for example, requires you to place $5,000 or more into any one of  its money market funds and then designate how much you want transferred on a  monthly basis, with a minimum of $100 a month.  </P> <P> And some fund groups, such as Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, will reinvest  dividends or capital gains that your earn in one fund into another fund in that  group. Fidelity, the nation's largest mutual fund group, just started such a  program, called Directed Dividends. It, like other programs, first requires you  to open an account in the fund to which you are transferring funds.  </P> <P> These and other programs are provided free of charge by fund companies,  although you will have to pay any loads (sales commissions) charged by the  funds you are buying.  </P> <P> Bill Sing welcomes readers' comments and suggestions for columns but regrets  that he cannot respond individually to letters.

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTLOOK FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> FOR BUSINESS, THE 1980S WERE A PERIOD OF ENORMOUS TURMOIL. A JAPANESE SIEGE OF  THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY AND AUTO INDUSTRIES, A SURGE AND PLUNGE IN OIL PRICES,  MASSIVE FAILURES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND A FEARSOME STOCK CRASH. THE  1990S DON'T PROMISE MUCH PEACE AND QUIET. HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT BUSINESS FACES  IN THE NEXT DECADE.;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT  </P> <P> For Hollywood, the opening act of the 1980s was sheer warfare. The major  studios battled outsiders who sought to distribute movies through new  technologies such as cable networks and home videocassettes. MCA Inc. and Walt  Disney Co. fought Sony Corp.'s importation of video players all the way to the  U.S. Supreme Court, and MCA and several other studios tried to foil Time Inc.'s  Home Box Office by launching their own pay-cable service.  </P> <P> Hollywood lost both battles, but it pocketed awesome sums of money from the  licensing of its movies to the new players. Now, video and cable sales generate  about 57% of Hollywood's revenue -- compared to about 30% earned at the box  office, according to Paul Kagan Associates.  </P> <P> Being pragmatic, the major studios have been merging with one-time enemies. The  common quest: to control not only the programming but strategic portions of the  distribution "pipeline."  </P> <P> In the past year alone, Warner Communications Inc. combined with Time Inc., and  Columbia Pictures Entertainment agreed to an acquisition by Sony. Three years  earlier, 20th Century Fox Film Corp. joined the global empire of Rupert  Murdoch, who spent more than $2 billion to buy the studio and seven TV stations  and is now building a satellite-delivery TV service in Britain.  </P> <P> The entertainment industry will be dominated in the 1990s by such media giants,  according to some analysts, who add Tele-Communications Inc., Disney and  Capital Cities/ABC to the list. (Indeed, control of all three TV networks  changed hands in the '80s, with only CBS not now owned by a huge conglomerate.)  </P> <P> The decade had its subplots, of course -- and some befit the propaganda films  of the 1940s. Little was said when Australians bid for Hollywood studios, but  the arrival of Japanese buyers has touched a nationalistic nerve.  </P> <P> Lee Isgur, Paine Webber's veteran entertainment industry analyst, predicts that  the power of American film making will speed Japanese assimilation into Western  culture, rather than the other way around. "The joke," said Isgur, "is did we  buy Japan, or did they buy Columbia Pictures?" KATHRYN HARRIS  </P></p>

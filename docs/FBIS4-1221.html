			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ben MacLennan] </F>   [Text] East London April 25 SAPA -- Ciskeians queued in  their hundreds in East London from early Monday [25 April]  morning in a last-minute rush to get voter cards for Wednesday's  election.    Acting regional representative of the Department of Home  Affairs in the Border, Mr Les Grieb, said the department's  office in East London stayed open on Saturday and Sunday,  issuing some 1,500 cards.    By 9.30 AM Monday, the queue already stretched round two  sides of a city block. Mr Grieb said most applicants would be  from Mdantsane in the Ciskei.    Normal office hours were 8 AM to 3 PM, but any queue that  still existed at 3 PM would be dealt with, he said. His staff  had been carrying on until seven or eight at night. "I would  say they are coping, but we are under terrible pressure at the  moment."    Mobile teams of the department working in the East  London/Mdantsane also issued about 1,000 cards over the weekend,  and were back in the field on Monday.    At a nearby home affairs office issuing ID documents, the  queue was much smaller than the voting card line. Mr Grieb said  that up to last week, the ID office had been issuing up to 1,000  documents a week. It seemed people had decided that if their  ID's had not arrived by now, they would rather get a voter card.</p>

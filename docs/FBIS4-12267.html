			<p>BFN     [Text] The PLO representative in the Gaza Strip failed to  arrive at the ceremony in which the Gaza police facility was to  be handed over to the Palestinians. This was reported by our  Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe.    One of the PLO leaders in the Strip told our correspondent  that the Palestinians did not come to receive the keys to the  police hostel because there were still unresolved disagreements  in the Cairo talks on police matters.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by "E.F.": "All New Beginnings"] </F>   [Text] It still needs to be seen whether the election  congress in Halle will reverse the political mood in the  country, which is unfavorable for the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] and whether it really means the beginning of a  change in the atmosphere. To the extent to which party  congresses and party congress speeches can influence such  developments, however, Halle must be assessed as a success of  the party and its chairman and candidate for the chancellor's  office. The delegates were wildly determined to give the signal  for a new beginning, which was expected by the party leadership,  and Scharping not only did not make it difficult for them but,  with his speech, he indeed created confidence and even  enthusiasm. He demanded discipline and obedience, showed his  critics their places with mild, fatherly strictness -- and the  delegates thanked him for it. After all, they did not have any  other choice if they did not want to damage their already ailing  chairman even more. Four months before the elections, the party  only has Scharping, and therefore it has to care for him.    Scharping did not deviate from his strategic line and from  the concept of his election campaign: no statement on a future  coalition, restraint regarding social promises, and  concentration on the issue of work. He also remained loyal to  himself in the noncommittal way in which he brushed over the  tensions between ecology and economic growth and in the  vagueness of the SPD's foreign policy line. However, more  clearly than before, he was looking for a confrontation with the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. Its 12 years  of government have meant not only stagnation, but a step  backward. And where the European Kohl is unsuitable as an enemy  image, Scharping brings up Bundestag Group Chairman Schaeuble as  the "man after Kohl" and describes him as a  national-conservative reactionary with horns, a club-foot,  surrounded by the stink of sulfur. The SPD, as the guardian of  European enlightenment and the shield against the attack of a  new, evil nationalism -- this idea became an inspiring common  experience at the party congress, even if it does not have much  to do with reality.    "Now things are getting started," the delegates chorused.  The party's sinking into despondency seems to have stopped for  the time being. The Social democrats are always great in making  a new start. Things usually get difficult as soon as they have  arrived.</p>

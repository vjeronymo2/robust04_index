			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Threats mar Maastricht victory TWO FRESH threats to the passage of the Maastricht bill emerged yesterday on an evening which ended on a high note for the government, when it won a procedural vote to extend debate on the measure into the small hours. One setback came from Labour, which tabled a new amendment that could force the government to choose between accepting the social chapter and being unable to ratify the treaty. The second occurred when it emerged that Tory Euro-sceptics received legal advice at a meeting on Tuesday which encouraged them to seek judicial review of the attorney-general's opinion about the impact of a separate Labour amendment. Last month, Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, surprised MPs by contradicting Foreign Office lawyers' advice that accepting the amendment, which excludes the social chapter from the bill, would wreck the treaty. If the amendment is passed, the Tory rebels are now determined to challenge his view. The new Labour amendment would prevent the ratification bill coming into force until the Commons had decided whether the social chapter should apply to the UK. This would mean a separate debate after the bill completed its parliamentary passage. The government's morale boost came when the support of 17 Liberal Democrats helped it to a comfortable majority of 17 (296 votes to 279) on a division to extend the 17th day of detailed Commons discussion of the bill beyond 10pm. A total of 26 Tory rebels, five Ulster Unionists, two Scottish Nationalists and one Lib Dem voted with Labour against the extension. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the European affairs minister, said: 'We remain on course to complete the committee and report stages before the Danish referendum (May 18) and take the third reading immediately afterwards.' Labour is confident that its new clause on the social chapter is within Westminster's procedural rules. The decision about whether the Commons should debate it rests with Mr Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker. It would, however, be a tortuous process to reach the point at which the government had to choose between not going ahead with Maastricht and adopting the social chapter. To get there, Tory Euro-sceptics would have to vote explicitly for the social chapter - which they do not support - in the hope that ministers' vehement opposition to the chapter would mean that the government would prefer not ratifying to adopting it. But if that were the choice, the government would come under severe pressure from many Tory backbenchers to accept the social chapter rather than wreck the treaty. That is because they believe more jobs would be lost through a fall in inward investment if the UK did not sign up to Maastricht than would be lost because of the impact of the social chapter.</p>

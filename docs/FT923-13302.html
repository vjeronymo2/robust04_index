			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: War diary of a Vorticist painter, novelist, critc, polemicist, agitator - died in 1957 at the age of 74, his sight all but gone and, in his reputation, an acknowledged but marginal figure. Yet through the second decade of the twentieth century and up to the Second World War he had been one of the great men of the Modern Movement, the embodiment of the avant garde. Born in the US of an American father who abandoned his family, he was brought to England as an infant by his British mother, and in England he remained, apart from the period of the Second World War, which he and his wife passed in Canada and New York. Yet his provenance established in his character, not exactly a rootlessness, but a certain distance and sceptical disaffection that throughout his active life would put him at odds with British institutions and attitudes, social, political and aesthetic. He was never one not to make his presence felt, and perhaps his habitual vehemence and asperity became a shade monotonous and predictable, and he was not taken too seriously in consequence - only old Lewis sounding off again. But in the vigour and confidence of his youth, in the years before 1914, he was a true leader and inspiration to his generation. He had been at the Slade around 1900, a student of Tonks, friend and contemporary of Augustus John. He travelled wide and often, becoming the familiar of the international avant garde, intimate of Pound and Eliot. William Rothenstein remembered him in those early days as 'even then (showing) signs of a formidable personality. He hesitated between writing and painting. . . He liked to shroud himself in mystery. After hiding for weeks, he would suddenly reappear, having been, he would declare, in Sweden, or in some remote country. . . He certainly went later to join (Augustus) John in Paris. . . (theirs was) an intimacy frequently disturbed by violent quarrels and again renewed.' His greatest public moment came in the year or so immediately before the First World War, when his own familiarity with Cubism in France and Futurism in Italy bore fruit in Vorticism, that was Britain's own, short-lived equivalent. A younger Sladeite generation was committed to the movement, that included Bomberg, Epstein, Gaudier-Brzeska, Wadsworth, Roberts and Nevinson, but Lewis was its prime mover, chief apologist and polemicist. The review Blast was its banner and battle-cry, surviving for only two issues that challenge us still. Two samples: 'BLAST years 1837 to 1900. . . BLAST their weeping whiskers. . . SENTIMENTAL HYGIENICS. . . ROSSEAUISMS. . . PURGATORY OF PUTNEY'. And 'BLESS ALL PORTS. . . RESTLESS MACHINES of scooped out basins, heavy insect dredgers, monotonous cranes. . . BLESS ENGLAND, industrial island machine. . .' This tribute was to the machine in a brave new mechanical age, unsentimental and implacable, and one that all too soon was to achieve its awful apotheosis. But Lewis's disillusionment was to wait upon the long aftermath of the War. Like so many of his artist contemporaries, and many more besides, he went to War young and happy, excited and stimulated, and found in the extremities and deprivations of the Western Front a kind of fulfilment. And his artist-self went with him. He was a gunner, with the Royal Garrison Artillery, and it is this close, oddly monastic community, the quiet and steady hierophants of destruction at their altars that supplies the essential subject of this exhibition at the Imperial War Museum. The mood is reserved, detached, objective, the treatment formal in its interest and mannered in its character. 'Whatever happens', Lewis had written in 1915, in his second Blast, 'there is a new section. . . that is, for want of a better word, the Abstract.' But by now, so strong was the immediate, phenomenal world, that theory and principle had fallen, and abstraction long given way to the abstracted. And indeed it is the conscious mannerism, the formal preoccupation with peculiar rendering of the image, that gives the work its distance and cool reserve. It is no unusual paradox that by being so, far from being callously indifferent, the work seems to gain an added force and poignant humanity. An officer lounges with studied languor as the men receive their rum. A single gunner, a powerful silhouette against cadmium yellow, tugs at the lanyard to fire the gun. Men heave on the ropes, dig their pits, lay their guns, hump their shells, fire salvoes, go out on patrol, attack, dive for cover. Just so, the mundane life of the trenches, goes on. And no anti-war tract or polemical image, even Lewis's own symbolical compositions of later years, could ever say so much and ring so true. The Imperial War Museum is the repository of one of the finest public collections we have of modern British art, notwithstanding its necessarily specialised nature. Sadly, there is no longer any permanently changing display of its riches, which makes these rarer treats all the more worth savouring.

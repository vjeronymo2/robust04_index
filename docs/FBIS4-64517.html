			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United Nations and Cyprus"--punctuation as </F> published]    [Text] The package of confidence-building measures has  revealed that the UN organization acts with an ulterior motive  against the Turkish Cypriot people. Those who know the history  of Cyprus have not been surprised by that. After all, the UN  organization has maintained its approach since 1964.    1. The package of proposals that UN representative Galo  Plaza submitted in 1964 urged the Turkish Cypriots to "agree to  enosis [union of Cyprus with Greece] in return for minority  rights." We resisted the UN representative's ridiculous  proposals and rejected them even when we were confronted with  the threat of destruction.    2. The UN organization adopted a resolution to recognize the  bloodthirsty and occupying Greek Cypriot administration as the  legitimate government. We refused to accept that resolution at  the time, that is, during the dark era in which bloodshed took  place and Turkish Cypriots were killed throughout the island.    3. The UN organization failed to obstruct the Greek Cypriot  attacks in 1963. It also failed to obstruct the attacks on  Erenkoy [Kokkina] in 1964 and Gecitkale [Lefkoniko] and Bogazici  [Lapathos] in 1967, the massacre of Turkish Cypriots in Turkeli  [Ayios Vasilios], Taskent [Vouno], Atlilar [Aloa], Murataga  [Maratha], and Sandallar [Sandalaris], the landing of 20,000  Greek troops in Cyprus, the occupation of 97 percent of the  island by them, and the fascist Greek junta administration's  military coup on 15 July 1974, which aimed to achieve enosis.  But the UN organization adopted a resolution condemning Turkey  for the action it took on 20 July 1974 to obstruct enosis and  the Greek Cypriot acts of massacre and ethnic cleansing  operations against the Turkish Cypriots. It called on the  Turkish troops to immediately withdraw from Cyprus.    We did not accept those resolutions at the time, that is,  when we were in a weaker position and when confusion existed in  Cyprus. We ignored them and moved in the direction we decided  to go in.    4. The UN organization adopted several baseless resolutions  after we declared our independence on 15 November 1983,  resolutions that conflicted with international law. It called  on us to withdraw our decision on independence and urged foreign  countries not to recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus [TRNC]. It threatened the Turkish Cypriot people and  tried to blackmail them. But we advanced in the direction we  chose to go, believing that the clock could not be put back and  that we would continue to exist even if the state we established  was not recognized. We maintained our position and reached the  point we are at now...    5. It has been 10 years since we established our independent  republic...    6. Our glorious flag, which is the symbol of our  sovereignty, has remained hoisted...    7. We live in security and without fear and look to the  future in hope...    We owe our today to our resistance of the unjust resolutions  that were adopted by the guided organizations, such as the  United Nations and other similar establishments, which have  assumed the form of a Christian club and try to realize the  expansionist objectives of the neocrusaders under the guise of  "peace initiatives."    The staff officer of the neocrusaders, who heads the UN  General Secretariat, has moved to threaten the Turkish Cypriots  and to direct pressure on them again through the UN Security  Council, which has been converted into the headquarters of the  crusaders. We will maintain our resistance. We must. We have  no alternative. We must resist injustice and remain steadfast.    Instead of concerning itself with Cyprus, which has enjoyed  peace during the past 20 years, the UN organization should wage  a struggle against the criminal Serbs, who are killing the  Islamic people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Instead of waging a  struggle against the Turkish Cypriots, who have been deprived of  their rights, subjected to an embargo, belittled, and isolated  during the past 30 years, the UN organization should take steps  to deal with the occupying Armenian terrorists, who have killed  hundreds of thousands of innocent Azerbaijani people and forced  1 million Azerbaijani citizens to become refugees in Daghlyk  Karabakh... Instead of moving against Turkey, which established  peace, democracy, security, and prosperity in Cyprus in three  days, the UN organization should take measures against the  aggressive Zionists, who shed blood and torture people in  Palestine daily...    We know of Europe's plans to have Turkey besieged by the  forces of the Orthodox religion. We also know of the plan to  realize enosis through the UN organization. But we will not  yield. We will maintain our resistance against those who have  failed to halt the bloodshed in Bosnia, Azerbaijan, and  Palestine and who secretly cooperate with the occupiers and  murderers.    Regardless of the resolutions the United Nations may adopt  against the Turkish Cypriot people, we are determined to  maintain the TRNC's existence and refuse to accept the  sovereignty of our sworn enemies. UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and the UN Security Council must realize that...</p>

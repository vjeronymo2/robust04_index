			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Dutch engineering beats British LABOUR productivity in British engineering companies is 25 per cent to 30 per cent lower than in their Dutch counterparts although proportionately more initial and continuing training is now carried out in British companies. This is the main finding of a study published today by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research of the differences between productivity, machinery and skills in British and Dutch engineering companies. The report says the main reason for the continuing productivity gap is widespread provision of full-time vocational education and training in the Netherlands, which allows companies to carry out subsequent training among employees to craft and technician standards much faster and more cost effectively than is possible in Britain. The study also points to the slower investment in capital equipment such as advan-ced computer numerically-controlled machinery in British companies compared with Dutch companies as well as 'lower average levels of workforce skills and knowledge' to explain the productivity gap. It says the relatively high standards of students from the age of 13 onwards at junior and intermediate technical schools in Holland give Dutch employers a considerable head start over their British counterparts. The study says British engineering employers are no longer 'complacent' in the face of international competitive pressures. The research is based on visits to 12 British and nine Dutch engineering plants in 1991-92. Productivity, Machinery and Skills in Engineering: an Anglo-Dutch Comparison, Geoff Mason and Bart van Ark.

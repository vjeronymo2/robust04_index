			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Silver's retreat continues - Market Report SILVER yesterday continued to lead the retreat of precious metals prices, closing 27.5 cents down in London at Dollars 4.65 a troy ounce. GOLD ended at Dollars 376.70, down Dollars 2.50, slightly up from an earlier 3 1/2  month low. 'Silver did most of the hard work on the way up and it will probably do the same on the way down,' one analyst said. Wide swings in London Metal Exchange NICKEL prices resulted in a nervous day's trading throughout the base metals complex and all contracts ended sharply down. Compiled from Reuters</p>

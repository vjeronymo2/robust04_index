			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "The Spring Sowing Is </F> Beginning in the White House"]    [Text] The allocation of money to Russian agriculture  has always been a political question and not an economic one.  However, as the results of the Commission for Operational  Management meeting held yesterday testify, the poor coordination  of the work of the appropriate departments is leading to even  those decisions, whose adoption served as an occasion for  government resignations, not being implemented.    The government's examination of questions concerning  preparations for the spring sowing is just as traditional and  inevitable as the greeting of the new year. The ritual during  the examination of these questions has not changed for years --  the representatives of the agrarians complain about the acute  shortage of fuel (this year, almost twofold less than last year  has been prepared), tractors (62,000 fewer), seeds, and -- what  is the main thing -- money. In accordance with the government's  decree adopted in January for financing Russian agriculture,  approximately 5 trillion rubles should be allotted for the  spring sowing. However, only about 800 billion rubles had been  provided by 1 March. In connection with this, the meeting  participants recalled last year with great warmth. Then, the  majority of fuel and mineral fertilizer deliveries were carried  out without any mandatory prepayments by order of the prime  minister (as a result of this, the agrarians still owe mineral  fertilizer producers 100 billion rubles). Nevertheless, in the  words of Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukh, it is possible that  the second part of the money -- almost 1.3 trillion rubles --  will begin to arrive in the accounts of the agrarians this week.  Moreover, he expects the repayment of the debts of agroproduct  consumers to amount to 2 trillion rubles; true, the hopes among  the agrarians for its repayment are rather weak -- probably  because they themselves are not noted for strict financial  discipline: Of the credits supplied last year, they returned  only 25 percent (another 60 percent, or 1.5 trillion rubles of  credits, was postponed to this year).    Yesterday, the members of the commission did not confine  themselves only to "seasonal work": One can view the discussion  of the Federal Energy Commission question as an element in the  strategic planning of the government's activity. Traditionally,  this is a weak spot in Viktor Chernomyrdin's Cabinet. Not only  the fact that Russian industrialists consider the existing  tariffs (the main subject of the Federal Energy Commission's  activity) extremely high but also the fact that the  inter-relationship mechanism between the Federal Economic  Commission and the producers of electrical energy can be a model  for developing a mechanism to regulate the activity of natural  and state monopolies, in general, explain the economic  significance of this question. In this connection, the  discussion about the commission's personnel composition  (Aleksandr Shokhin was appointed chairman) and functions, which  was begun by Yuriy Shafranik, minister of fuel and energy, but  immediately suppressed by the presiding Oleg Soskovets, is  extremely symptomatic. Oleg Soskovets' desire to reduce the  influence of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy on the decisions  adopted by a state (and not public, as now) commission is  completely justified -- otherwise, the present situation in the  pricing of electrical energy, where the interests of the power  workers and not those of the industrialists have paramount  importance, could be reproduced even with the new statute for  the commission. Moreover, Shokhin, who is more loyal to the  first vice-premier, along with developing a concept for  controlling energy prices, "will not forget" the question of  favorable rates for individual enterprises in metallurgy and  transport.    The third question on the agenda of yesterday's meeting was  increasing the volume of export quotas for 1994. For more  details about this, see the article on this same page.</p>

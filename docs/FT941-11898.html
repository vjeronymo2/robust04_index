			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Debate on Scots bill disrupted The government's legislative programme ran into renewed problems in the Commons yesterday when Mr Alex Salmond, Scottish National party leader, blocked debate on the Scottish local government bill. Mr Salmond, who is not a member of the committee, refused to leave the room in which the bill was being debated. His action was part of a nationalist campaign for greater Scottish representation on committees debating bills dealing solely with Scotland. The delay is a further embarrassment for the government, which was forced last week to bow to Labour demands for a cut in its majorities on some committees.</p>

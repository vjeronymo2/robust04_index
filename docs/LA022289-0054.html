			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASIA TRIP GIVES BUSH CHANCE TO REVIEW POLICIES  </P> <P> President Bush, embarking today on a whirlwind, 100-hour visit to Japan, China  and South Korea, attends the funeral this week of the emperor who reigned in  Japan during World War II and greets a dozen or so leaders whose cooperation he  will need as he crafts a foreign policy for what he hopes will be a period of  reduced global tensions.  </P> <P> Bush's first major international journey as President offers mostly symbolic  opportunities in the crucial Pacific Basin rather than the prospect of  direction-setting initiatives. The more immediate impact may be on the home  front, where Bush is fighting suggestions that his measured, deliberative  approach to setting a foreign policy is allowing the nation to drift on the  world stage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Negative Approach'  </P> <P> "I simply don't agree with that," Bush said, with an edge to his voice, at a  news conference Tuesday. "I really hadn't ever heard such a negative approach  to foreign policy."  </P> <P> Declaring that "we have a foreign policy," Bush said that the 17,000-mile trip  will advance his process of carefully reviewing East-West relations, events in  South America and the U.S. role in the Middle East as specific goals and  courses are plotted.  </P> <P> There will be time for only brief meetings in Tokyo with no more than a dozen  of the approximately 60 government leaders visiting Japan for the funeral of  Emperor Hirohito. But the trip -- according to White House National Security  Adviser Brent Scowcroft -- "is an opportunity to underscore not only the  importance of the three countries that the President will be visiting to  American interests, but also the growing importance of the U.S. relationship to  Asia as a whole, and to point out, again, that the United States is an Asian  power."  </P> <P> At the same time, the high-profile appearance in international settings also  presents a valuable opportunity in a more parochial realm. It is a chance to  extend the honeymoon phase of the new presidency at a time when it is suffering  the sorts of nicks and scratches that eventually dull the shiny veneer of a new  Administration.  </P> <P> If shifting attention from controversies and criticisms in Washington "turns  out to be a dividend, let it never be said (that) this Administration ever  refused to accept a dividend," White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growing Criticism  </P> <P> Criticism has been growing in Washington that the new Administration may be  moving too slowly in developing foreign policy initiatives toward the Soviet  Union, Nicaragua and other key nations and regions.  </P> <P> While Bush did not spell out specific policies that will be pressed on the  trip, he said that U.S. policy in the Middle East is intended to encourage  discussions between Jordan's King Hussein and Israel. Bush plans to meet with  Hussein, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli President Chaim Herzog in  Tokyo.  </P> <P> Bush also intends to meet with key figures from Belgium, Brazil, France,  Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, West Germany and Japan, said  Scowcroft, in a schedule "that fills up almost every spare minute that the  President has."  </P> <P> "We're going to try to see as many as possible, so the substance will not be  extensive," Scowcroft said in a briefing for reporters.  </P> <P> Officials have said that the topics will range from superpower relations and  the complicated U.S.-Japanese relationship to the unsolved problems of Third  World debt.  </P> <P> The importance of the trip is "not with how long the meetings necessarily are  and how much substance, but the significance of a face-to-face opportunity to  get, at least, out on the table a few issues for discussion," Scowcroft said.  "That's very, very important, and it eases the sense of communication between  countries after that if you've had this kind of personal contact."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Courtesy Calls in China  </P> <P> In Beijing, several courtesy calls are being squeezed into a tight schedule but  only one in-depth, lengthy session -- with Premier Li Peng -- is planned. A  stop in Seoul on the way home from China is scheduled for barely four hours.  </P> <P> The six-day trip represents the latest phase in a presidency that, in its first  five weeks, has unfolded in phases.  </P> <P>  -- The first 10 days or so, the President's aides say, offered the nation a  view of who George Bush is, and the standards -- particularly in ethical  behavior -- that he expects from those who work for him. The ethics question,  however, reflected unfavorably when two of his closest advisers, Secretary of  State James A. Baker III and White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, encountered  pointed criticism over their initial reluctance to release control over their  substantial financial investments.  </P> <P>  -- Next came the unveiling of his fiscal 1990 budget priorities, meant to put  some flesh on the vision of a "kinder and gentler" America that he drew during  the presidential campaign. But he did not highlight any central themes of his  proposal, provoking complaints from Democrats that he had turned over to  Congress the political liability of deciding which programs to cut.  </P> <P>  -- Now the focus turns to foreign affairs, as the White House takes advantage  of the timing of Hirohito's funeral during a politically difficult period in  Washington when the Senate is focusing on the embattled nomination of former  Sen. John Tower to be secretary of defense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeking Direction  </P> <P> Throughout it all, the Administration has been weighing the direction it  intends to pursue in foreign policy, even as it continues to assemble its  national security group at the Pentagon and State Department.  </P> <P> Asked for evidence that the United States had set a course for its relations  with Asia, Scowcroft conceded that it is "unfortunate that the President  doesn't have his national security team in place as yet," but he said  sarcastically at a White House briefing for reporters:  </P> <P> "One month after he's come into office we're already worrying that he's not  charging off in all directions with finished policy.  </P> <P> "I believe the President is not trying to make quick headlines. What he is  trying to put into place is a foreign and national security policy which will  look forward . . . toward the end of the century and try to set in place  near-term actions which will aid us in where we think we'd like to be at the  end of the century."  </P> <P> For his part, Bush said he is undismayed by such developments as the current  Middle East tour of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> "I don't want to be stampeded by the fact that the Soviet foreign minister  takes a trip to the Middle East. In my view, that's a good thing," he said,  adding that he envisioned "a limited role" for the Soviets in that troubled  region.  </P> <P> As for the timing of his own trip, of course, Bush had no choice.  </P> <P> Once the Japanese announced that the funeral for Hirohito, who died Jan. 7,  would be Feb. 24, the only question for the President was whether to attend --  a decision about which there was little debate, given the importance of Japan  to U.S. policy in Asia and to the global economy, White House aides said.  </P> <P> Indeed, in the view of White House officials, others who are advising Bush and  such outside observers as Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, the timing  provided an opportunity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Too Many Glitches'  </P> <P> "His takeoff hasn't been flawless. There have been too many glitches," said  Hess, a student of the presidency since the Administration of Dwight D.  Eisenhower. "Here's an opportunity to 'Come fly with me,' get above Washington  and look like a statesman."  </P> <P> While the President and his staff have yet to be caught in the grip of the sort  of crisis atmosphere that invariably takes over the White House from time to  time, there have been political crises of sorts, seen and unseen.  </P> <P> "Obviously, they're still learning," said Rep. Richard Cheney (R-Wyo.), the  assistant House minority leader and chief of staff in the Gerald R. Ford White  House. "There's a shakedown process under way. They're learning. Give them a  little bit of time."  </P> <P> There was the quickly aborted plan to charge savings and loan depositors a fee  on their savings to help bolster the sagging S&amp;L industry. And there were  questions that flared up and then vanished as the White House mobilized behind  the scenes to defend the Cabinet nominations of Housing and Urban Development  Secretary Jack Kemp, since confirmed by the Senate, and Louis W. Sullivan, who  has yet to face Senate hearings as Bush's choice for secretary of health and  human services.  </P> <P> Then, the nomination of Tower to be secretary of defense ran into a wall of  allegations and doubt that has not yet been resolved.  </P> <P> "Personally, I'm very upset. I don't think this is any way to start a new  Administration," groused one White House newcomer, recognizing the need for  what he called "some serious damage control."  </P> <P> Others, taking their cue from the President, say that the controversies have  not diverted them from the initial tasks of setting the Administration on  course. Indeed, they say, the Asian trip represents an opportunity to chart a  course in a crucial part of the world without distracting them from more  pressing domestic issues.  </P> <P> "The White House is reeling. The White House is spiraling," a senior White  House official muttered mockingly as he walked down the silent corridor just  beyond the Oval Office on a day when the allegations about Tower were  particularly bothersome. "I don't notice much reeling. I don't notice much  spiraling."  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> A VISIT TO ASIA  </P> <P> President Bush's trip to three Asian capitals will include these visits:  </P> <P> TOKYO  </P> <P> Akasaka Palace -- Modeled on the palace at Versailles and on the Louvre, it was  completed in 1909 to be the crown prince's residence. Emperor Hirohito, whose  funeral Bush will attend Friday, lived at the palace before he ascended the  throne in 1926.  </P> <P> The Imperial Palace -- The main ceremonial building within 284 acres of ponds,  moats and forests in the center of Tokyo was built in 1968 to replace a  structure destroyed in World War II. In the 17th Century the complex was the  headquarters of the Tokugawa Shogunate that ruled Japan.  </P> <P> Shinjuku Imperial Gardens -- This park, the site of Hirohito's funeral  services, once served as the garden for the imperial household.  </P> <P> BEIJING  </P> <P> Great Hall -- Built for the celebration of the Communist government's 10-year  anniversary in 1959, it sits on Tienanmen  </P> <P> Square in the traditional heart of the city and is the site for all major  gatherings.  </P> <P> Zhongnanhai -- A 213-acre compound that includes two large lakes that used to  be part of the imperial palace grounds, it now serves as Communist Party  headquarters.  </P> <P> Chongwenmen Christian Church -- Bush is expected to attend services at this  Protestant church.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times  </P> <P> SEOUL  </P> <P> The Blue House -- The nation's presidential residence since the Republic of  Korea was formed in 1948.  </P> <P> The National Assembly -- Home of South Korea's unicameral legislative body.  </P> <P> Yongsan garrison -- Actually a city within a city, this is headquarters for the  Combined Forces Command, the U.S. Forces Korea, the U.S. 8th Army and the  United Nations Command.  </P></p>

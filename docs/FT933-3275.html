			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Russia may lose credit for banking revolution THE stern red granite former German embassy in St Petersburg this week opened its doors to the public as home to the first foreign bank in Russia since the Bolshevik revolution. But when Dresdner Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris held an official opening of their joint subsidiary with champagne - and talk by the mayor of an historic occasion - there was little cause for celebration. Despite security provided by an ex-KGB officer against gangsters, the bank is under threat from other quarters. On Friday, the Russian parliament will decide whether to ban foreign-owned banks from taking deposits from Russian customers. Such customers would include joint ventures with foreign companies that account for most of the foreign investment in Russia so far. Parliament's proposed ban, which would come into effect next January and last until 1996, is the fruit of lobbying by some of the increasingly powerful Russian commercial banks which say they are not ready for foreign competition. Their main fear is that they will lose their prized hard currency deposits to western banks which, by virtue of being well established and foreign, may inspire more trust among Russian customers. The government, central bank, and even parliament's own sub-committee for banking are mobilising efforts to get deputies to change their minds in behind-the-scenes lobbying this week. On Monday, the central bank issued licences to two more foreign banks, Credit Suisse and the Netherlands' ING Bank, as part of its efforts to present parliament with a fait accompli. Full banking licences have already been given to France's Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, as as Bank of China. 'Competition would be good for our banks. They would learn how to work better,' explained Mr Nikolai Medvedvev, chairman of the banking sub-committee. But there is no guarantee that these efforts, together with private warnings by German authorities that loans to Russia might be reviewed in retaliation, will succeed. Asked why they had pressed ahead despite the risks, Mr Jacques Henri Wahl, BNP's chief operating officer, said the two western banks, which enjoy a global alliance, wanted to be in a position to take advantage of opportunities which would arise when the economy got going again. 'If the law restricts our activities, we will comply with it in the hope it will be modified in a relatively short time,' he said. 'I just hope that political wisdom will prevail.' Privately, western bankers say they want to get a foot in the door while it is still open. In a more moderate plan to protect its fledgling banks, the central bank has already said it plans to limit the share of foreign banks to 12 per cent of banking capital in Russia. But the consequences of the ban envisaged by parliament would harm not just the banks, but would further dent western business confidence. It would also deprive the authorities, which lack supervisory skills and credibility, of a badly needed tool for improving the performance of their own banks and for encouraging foreign investment. Rather than compete for rouble customers and lending opportunities, the most successful and independent Russian banks hold hard currency on short-term deposit, channel it in and out of the country for trading operations, and play the foreign exchange market. BNP-Dresdner Bank (Rossija) itself does not initially plan to take rouble deposits or do very much in the way of project lending. Banks as a whole are unlikely to switch to productive lending on any significant scale unless the economy is stabilised. The banking sector itself is badly in need of restructuring, a process which will be speeded up only if there is financial discipline for the economy at large. Russia has nearly 2,000 banks, with about 100 accounting for two-thirds of the banking system.</p>

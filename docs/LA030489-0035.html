			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEE ON BARBARA TUCHMAN  </P> <P> The death of Barbara Tuchman has quite properly occasioned numerous eulogies of  this distinguished historian. Her clarity, grace, style, and narrative gifts  have all been justly celebrated. Unfortunately, such encomiums have been  accompanied by a rather virulent strain of academy-bashing, a notable example  of which is found in Carolyn See's column (Editorial Page, Feb. 11). University  history faculties are depicted as snobbish elites, dominated by reactionary  white males, dedicated only to the maintenance of their control over the  profession and the production of turgid, unreadable scholarly tomes on subjects  of no consequence. Their dismissal of popular historians like Tuchman is said  to proceed from a disdain for anyone without a Ph.D. attempting to write  history.  </P> <P> It is not true that the profession has ignored Tuchman. Ironically, on the same  page as See's column appears the text of the address that Tuchman delivered to  the American Historical Assn. in 1966. It should be noted that an invitation to  address the AHA is considered a signal honor within the profession, which makes  nonsense of See's claim that Tuchman was one of the "invisibles" (writers  ignored by the professoriate).  </P> <P> Another of See's alleged "invisibles" is Diane Johnson. See is evidently  unaware that Johnson has taught English at UC Davis for a number of years, and  that she was unanimously elected president of the Pacific Coast Conference on  British Studies, an academic organization of over 200 members.  </P> <P> If Tuchman has not been ignored by the profession, is it not true that she has  been subjected to criticism? Most certainly -- just as the works of most  academic historians have been. Professors and non-professors alike who write  seriously about the past are part of a large international community of  scholars. Their views are subjected to close critical scrutiny, in the books  and articles of subsequent writers, as well as in the book reviews that  constitute an important part of journals like the American Historical Review.  This ceaseless challenging, revising, and refining of established views of the  past make history the lively and valuable discipline it is. Out of this  multifaceted dialogue emerges new subjects of historical inquiry and new  methodologies for investigating them.  </P> <P> Among the many new areas of investigation, women's history and histories of  ethnic minorities are (contrary to See's claim) burgeoning fields of  scholarship, in which work of great importance and distinction is being  published. I invite her and other interested readers to examine any recent  issue of the American Historical Review for a good sense of the kind of work  being written by the dedicated men and women of the historical profession.  </P> <P> They range from specialized monographs to general histories, from conventional  narrative accounts to statistical studies, but few of them deal with  inconsequential matters. Studies of the history of topics like the family, the  environment, war, racism, and technology abound, and it is clear that  policy-makers and the public alike would benefit from reading them.  </P> <P> That it should be necessary to point out perhaps reveals a major public  relations challenge for academics in general and for historians in particular.  By all means, let's enter upon a sustained and serious dialogue about the  nature and value of history in our society, but let's not doom it at the outset  by shrill invective and misrepresentation. Such a conversation would be a  fitting tribute to the ever wise, honest, and tolerant Barbara Tuchman.  </P> <P> ANTHONY BRUNDAGE  </P> <P> Professor of History  </P> <P> Cal Poly Pomona  </P></p>

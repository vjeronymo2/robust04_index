			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise Oil hit A report that French oil group Elf Aquitaine has reclassified its 10 per cent share-holding in Enterprise Oil as a non-core investment was interpreted as increasing the likelihood of the shares being sold and prompted renewed downside pressure on Enterprise shares. Already unsettled earlier this week by a sell recommendation issued by NatWest Securities, Enterprise shares were among only a handful of poor performers in a generally buoyant market, closing 2 off at 446p. Earlier they had fallen to 442p. Turnover was a higher than usual 1m shares. Other oil issues managed to move ahead yesterday in spite of the continuing poor showing of crude oil prices, which currently languish below the Dollars 14 a barrel mark. Elf is thought to be planning Pounds 600m worth of asset sales for the next three years and dealers said the Enterprise stake would probably be at the end of the queue. 'They would be seen as unwise to unload such a big stake on to the market when a weak oil price has wrought such damage in the sector,' said one analyst. Lasmo rallied 4 to 118p, responding to favourable press comment on the Pounds 123m asset sale to PowerGen. Bank shares came under sustained selling pressure early in the session, as some of the market's action funds began to cash in their profits on the sector and switched to other high yielding areas of the market, such as the utilities. Hit by the early flurry of selling, the banks then mostly rallied as marketmakers took the opportunity to replenish their trading books. Standard Chartered, however, shrugged aside the early selling, with the stock price stimulated by talk that Cazenove, the bank's own broker, had upgraded its forecasts. Standard shares, among the market's outstanding performers in recent weeks following a series of rather wild bid stories, forged ahead 32 to 1221p as the Cazenove upgrade filtered into the market. Lloyds Bank, which retains a 4.6 per cent holding in Standard Chartered following its unsuccessful bid for the bank in the 1980s, and is always seen as a potential bidder for the company, came under pressure, closing 4 off at 644p. TSB, put forward by many market observers as one of the market's best potential bid targets, put on 3 at 254 1/2 p. Merchant banks showed further strength, led by Hambros, which appreciated 8 to 396p, followed by Kleinwort Benson, 4 higher at 595p. Royal Insurance took the honours in a mostly subdued composite insurance sector, racing up 16 to 333p, while Sun Alliance rose 9 to 387p after talk of a Fleming buy recommendation. CE Heath, still responding to strong buy advice from Kleinwort Benson, added 13 at 380p. YJ Lovell shares plunged 30 per cent, closing 4 3/4 down at 11p, after revealing a loss of almost Pounds 60m for the year. That figure included Pounds 55m worth of write-offs on land and property values in the UK and the US. Stores stocks finally shrugged off talk of drab winter sales as reports were heard of a late surge in Christmas shopping. Clothes shares, which have borne the brunt of the poor sales reports, were in particular demand. Next advanced 10 1/2 to 226 1/2 p, Austin Reed 8 to 183p, GUS 16 to 631p and Burton 1 1/2 to 65p. Among others, Boots rose 14 1/2 to 575p, Goldsmiths 7 to 85p, Kingfisher 18 to 737p, just under its all-time high reached two weeks ago, and Lloyds Chemist 10 to 349p. Property shares were left behind by yesterday's rush, although analysts said the sector's recent rumbustious run meant many stocks were looking overbought. MEPC, which has seen its shares jump 12 per cent in the past six weeks, almost double that of the FT-SE 100, slipped a penny to 550p. Land Securities remained at 787p, still 13 off its all-time high hit two ses-sions ago. Leisure and property group Ladbroke returned to favour as investors bought it on recovery potential; the stock was also tipped by one newspaper as a likely outperformer in 1994. There was again heavy two-way business, with some investors still unwilling to stay in the stock, which has been plagued in recent months by speculation over its trading situation and dividend policy. Yesterday the share price gained 9 1/2 at 164p in hefty turnover of 18m. Other lesiure stocks were in demand. Among hotel groups, Stakis added 4 at 64p, as did Forte, at 261p. Granada Group, still awaiting developments in its television bid war, continued to make its all-paper offer more attractive as its shares climbed 8 to a record 534p. Rank Organisation, also among some brokers' tips for 1994, moved up 6 to 980p, while Thorn EMI gained 11 at 1009p. Euro Disney, however, missed the party as the theme park operator dismissed suggestions by its auditors that it may have to close this spring without a much-needed financial restructuring. The shares dropped 22 to 373p.</p>

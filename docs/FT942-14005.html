			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Power company halts station plan An independent power company appears to have shelved plans to build an electricity plant in East Anglia following the decision by Offer, the industry regulator, to put a limit on prices in the electricity wholesale pool. Independent Power Generators, a consortium involving French companies, has terminated a contract with National Grid to take power from a proposed 730MW station in Sutton Bridge, East Anglia. IPG was not available for comment last night. However, the company said recently that it was deferring non-essential development at Sutton Bridge 'due to continuing downward regulatory pressure of the wholesale price of electricity and over-capacity in the UK market'.</p>

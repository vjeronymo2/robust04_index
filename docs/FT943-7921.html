			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / French industry output slips French industry suffered a slight setback in June, when production fell 0.8 per cent from May, according to Insee, the state statistics institute, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. But economists were confident this was just a seasonal glitch which would not impede continuing recovery of French industry and the rest of the economy. The overall decline in industrial production disguised a sharper 1.3 per cent fall in manufacturing output. One of the weaker areas was motor vehicles, reflecting the end of government initiatives to encourage consumers to trade in old vehicles for new models.</p>

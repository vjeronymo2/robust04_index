			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Jottings" by Shu Guang (5289 1638): </F> "Mistakenly Hitting `Another Target'"]    [Text] When NATO aircraft attacked the Bosnian Serb  positions in Gorazde on 10 and 11 April, they were wide of the  mark. When flying over the target on the first occasion, the  aircraft lost touch with the ground and had to drop their bombs  and return in a hurry; on the second occasion, a 500-lb bomb was  again mistakenly dropped into the city center of Gorazde,  causing casualties among the civilians.    The Pentagon assessed the results of the air raids as "very  unsatisfactory" and cited "foul weather" as the cause. Having a  firm belief in the operational functions of its aircraft, the  Pentagon could only "blame the weather" and not the "aircraft."    People might as well associate this with the political  climate in the Bosnian situation, which is at least equally  "foul": The ethnic relations are intricate and the historical  resentments are entangled. In the face of such a situation, is  not taking such military action as an air raid equally  "irrelevant to the subject" and an act of mistakenly hitting  "another target"?    Viewed from the Bosnian situation after the air raids, this  is not a groundless worry. Ground fighting in Gorazde has not  stopped so far and shots are again being heard in Sarajevo,  which has had a cease-fire for quite some time. The Serbs claim  that, in future, they will hit back at NATO aircraft conducting  the air raids and they have also detained UN peacekeeping  personnel as "hostages."    Apparently, the air raids conducted by NATO aircraft have  failed to achieve the original intention of "attaining the  greatest political objective with limited military action."</p>

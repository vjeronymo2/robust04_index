			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Leading Article: All in a good day's work MR MAJOR'S new brand of conservatism is beginning to make its mark in Brussels. Mrs Gillian Shephard, Mr Major's new employment secretary, yesterday did battle with the European Community's working time directive, which lays down EC-wide minimum standards on working time, rest breaks and holidays. She conceded little, if anything, more than her Thatcherite predecessor, Mr Michael Howard. But she appears to have won some goodwill - and possibly even a directive that the UK could sign up to at the next meeting in June, thanks to more positive presentation. The UK government has rightly opposed the prescriptive and inflexible nature of many of the directive's proposals, for example the 48-hour limit on weekly working. But, hitherto, the UK government has conveyed the impression that any minimum standards in the field of employment are an affront to the voluntarism of British industrial relations. This aggressive stance has created an equal and opposite response from the Commission and from some other EC countries that might have been sympathetic to the UK's stance. It has also led to the Commission's absurd introduction of the working time directive as health and safety legislation, requiring only a qualified majority to pass, so side-stepping the UK veto. Most EC countries, especially Germany, do not want to let the UK slip further away in the employment field than the Maastricht 'opt-out' already allows. They are ready to compromise on the working time directive, rather than face a UK challenge to its legal basis. Indeed many of them have big objections of their own. Armed with a fresh electoral mandate and an attitude of 'yes, but' as opposed to 'no meddling' the UK government might be able to coax an acceptable agreement in June. That should concentrate on making the proposals more permissive, by allowing the limits to be broken if there is no health risk, if employees volunteer, or if unions and managers agree.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / A steady hand at the helm: Eddie George, who takes over today as Bank of England governor, discusses his aims A posse of technicians will soon be at work in the Bank of England moving a battery of computer terminals from the deputy governor's office into the governor's next door. The move of the screens carrying market news between the two 'parlours' opening on to the Bank's Garden Court will be the first visible evidence that from today a new hands-on manager, Mr Eddie George, has taken over running the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. The 54-year-old Mr George is a keen sailor and so sports the light tan that is de rigueur among modern-day central bankers. But he comes from a very different background from his patrician predecessor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Mr George was the Bank's deputy governor until midnight last night. He is only the third insider to take the top job since the Bank was nationalised in 1946. The computer terminals and the cigarette that is usually in his hand tell of a central banking career that has developed in a symbiotic relationship with the world of financial markets. Interviewed in his old office this week, Mr George chose his words with a fluent caution born of 31 years working in the Bank. Spelling out the priorities and concerns that will colour his five-year term of office, he: suggested Britain had the potential for recovery continuing 'through the rest of this decade'; warned that there must be limits to the protection that bank depositors can expect; reaffirmed his belief in more central bank autonomy while dampening expectations that he would campaign for it; and made clear that, while the Bank would act as the 'interface' between the City and industry, it was not the governor's job to be the chief spokesman or champion of the Square Mile. But the word that cropped up most - some 20 times in 50 minutes - was 'stability'. Achieving stability is Mr George's prime policy goal. His determination to put stability first bears witness to years of frustration trying to manage monetary policy in a nation that has too often suffered inflation and lurched from slump to boom. A passionate belief in stability - generally expressed in terms of low inflation - coloured his observations on many issues, ranging from the purpose and morality of monetary policy, to central bank independence and European economic and monetary union. But first he was asked whether his elevation and the appointment of Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, formerly editor of the Economist, as his deputy would lead to a change of style and management at the Bank after the 10-year governorship of Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who was noted more for his skill in delegation than day-to-day management. 'Yes. There will necessarily be a change of style. I was quite clearly brought up in the Bank and have been totally involved in what you might call the plumbing. So I shall continue to take an extremely close interest in the plumbing.' But being governor necessitated at least 30 days of foreign travel a year. 'So, inevitably, I shall be distanced from the day-to-day affairs to a degree that I haven't been hitherto.' At those times, Mr Pennant-Rea would 'run the Bank in the way that I have done'. But otherwise Mr George seemed determined to stay in control. The only formal change in the management structure would be turning the existing deputy governor's committee, which has functioned as a kind of executive committee, into a more formal executive committee with Mr George, as governor, staying in charge. 'I'll chair it when I'm here and Rupert will chair it when I'm away . . . Rupert and I, I see as being like twin arms of an armchair. I expect us to work extremely closely together.' Unlike their predecessors, both men have a clear mandate from the government to put the combat of inflation before other goals. This new framework and the government's inflation target have been 'extremely helpful' and 'remarkably successful', says Mr George. Low inflation is important because it is a necessary condition for economic growth. 'I think by achieving stability, you are better able to achieve sustainable growth, sustainable increases in employment, sustainable improvement in national wealth and therefore better able to achieve your social objectives, whatever they are.' It also provides a reliable basis 'for taking all the major economic decisions . . . And I think it is the way we can move towards a long-term economy rather than a short-term economy.' There is a moral aspect to stability, too. 'What you get if you get high and variable inflation is a totally arbitrary distribution of wealth in real terms. And I think on the whole with inflation it is the weaker sectors of society that get disadvantaged compared with the financially more sophisticated.' Indeed propagating stability is more important than achieving greater operational autonomy for the Bank, he says. Mr George's remarks suggest that he will be happy to join Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, 'sitting on the fence' in the debate about whether Britain should have a more independent central bank. 'The thing that I shall lobby for is to broaden the constituency and support for stability, because in a sense unless you actually have public, political support for stability . . . then greater autonomy, statutory accountability, call it what you like, wouldn't be terribly effective.' Although Mr George believes that 'on balance and over time' more operational autonomy for the Bank would help it achieve stability, he concedes that 'it's not, in this particular set of circumstances, a case that's made.' He declines to predict that he will be running an independent Bank of England at the end of his first five-year term. Independence is no magic black box that brings stability in its wake. 'I think there is no doubt that the constituency for stability is the horse. The rest is the cart,' he said. Unlike Mr Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's new governor is not too enthusiastic about the example of New Zealand, which has given its central bank operational independence while making it accountable to a Westminster-style parliament. 'I don't pretend to be a constitutional expert,' he said, but 'I do think it's quite dangerous to take any model and simply seek to transpose it internationally. There are a lot of differences between the New Zealand situation and ours. On the whole, it's a small economy, probably more sensitive to monetary instruments than ours is.' By contrast, conducting monetary policy in Britain is a complex business. According to Mr George, '400 pieces of information' have to be taken into account when changing interest rates. The Bank and government must look at the exchange rate and 'all the movements of financial markets. All the monetary indicators; not just broad money. What's happening in credit. What's happening to the sectoral behaviour - the personal sector, the industrial sector, the financial sector. All the real economic indicators. The behaviour of the fall in unemployment and what that is telling us about the economy.' But are not UK interest rates changes political, rather than economic? Mr George looked slightly pained. He admitted that the precise timing of two recent base rate cuts - January 26 and last November - was influenced by political pressures. But he insists: 'We took the initiative to cut interest rates in January and we did in response to the 400 or 4,000 indicators.' However, the perception that the government was behind the move was costly. 'It does have a corrosive effect over time, that it creates the impression - I think the largely false impression - that actually monetary policy is dictated by political considerations.' 'It's a pity and it's expensive in the sense that perception undoubtedly increases the risk premium that is on UK rates. And you could see it created for a time a weakening in the exchange market which wasn't justified by fundamentals.' Are there not other areas where the Bank's reputation is endangered? It has had an unhappy record with bank supervision over the past decade, for example. Mr George believes that supervision 'probably can most effectively and efficiently be done here', although he is 'not dogmatic or doctrinaire that the consumer protection dimension of banking supervision must remain with the Bank'. What concerns him more is the growing perception among the public in the wake of the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International that bank depositors should be guaranteed against all risk. 'If you produce too much protection to depositors, you can actually undermine systemic stability through moral hazard. I would be extremely worried if people felt that simply because the name of a institution is on the list of authorised institutions that this was in some sense a guarantee against risk. 'There is risk in all financial transactions and I think it's pretty dangerous if we lead people to thinking that that can be eliminated. They need to take responsibility for what they do themselves with their money.' But does this approach to consumers mean that Mr George sees himself as a spokesman for the City? 'I don't think I would feel that the governor of the Bank should be chief spokesman for the City. I think the governor should be the chief spokesman for sound money.' There are circumstances where 'the governor of the Bank of England needs to represent the concerns of financial institutions if he feels they are not being understood by government,' he says. But the governor is 'not a champion for the financial institutions'. The Bank has a 'catalytic role'. It tries to ensure that the conditions are right for the financial industry to prosper. But Mr George wants to 'step back from the idea of being the spokesman for the City almost in opposition to other parts of the economy. I just see the City being part of my work,' he says. The clock is ticking. 'Books', the morning meeting of the Bank's directors, is less than 10 minutes away and questions still have to be put about the European exchange rate mechanism and the European Community's plans for economic and monetary union. Stability first is the watchword for Europe as well as for the UK. 'I've basically had the view that you really have to achieve internal stability first. If you do that in convergence with the other major countries that will actually deliver de facto as much exchange rate stability as realistically is achievable,' he says. 'The hesitations I've always had in connection with the ERM or even more in relation to Emu is trying to do the thing the other way round, to fix the exchange rate in nominal terms and to hope or expect that that will deliver internal stability within the area of the exchange rate arrangement . . . I think the tensions we've seen in the past year in the context of a hardening of the ERM essentially reflect the fact that we got the cart too far ahead of the horse.' On the other hand, the Maastricht convergence criteria 'are not a bad guide to sensible national policy management'. It would be fine if Britain and the other EC countries eventually meet the criteria and want to go ahead with Emu, but Mr George suggests it will take longer than the final deadline of 1999 set out in the treaty. If the rest of the UK's EC partners rush ahead with union and Britain stands aside 'that wouldn't be necessarily the worst thing in the world'. Looking ahead, Britain, for once, has a 'realistic chance of rather well sustained expansion', he says. Relations between the Bank and the Treasury are good. Although Mr George 'hesitates to predict' that such happy circumstances will continue, he gives the appearance of a man starting his term of office in a strong and contented position.</p>

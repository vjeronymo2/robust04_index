			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Naoki Okabe, editorial staff member: "Hosokawa's </F> `Economic Reform' Policy Lacked Principles--Lack of Appropriate  Measures Due to Reliance on Bureaucracy; Political Leadership  Put to Test"]    [Text] In a way, the collapse of the administration of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is the result of its failing to  implement sound economic measures. The administration has  faltered with tax system reform. The budget issue has been  postponed, and deregulation plans have been impeded. As a  result, Japan's economic relations with the United States  remains strained.    The administration was not headed in the wrong direction. It  felt fresh to the people's ears when the administration called  out for "economic reform." Its calls began to sound empty  because the administration lacked political leadership and  policy principles. Leadership in tackling impending issues to  help bring about true economic reform is sought in the next  administration, which is yet to be seen.  <H5>  The Issue of Tax System Reform Was the Underlying Cause of </H5> the Crisis    Initially, the world's financial capital markets reacted  calmly to the news of "Hosokawa's resignation." However,  U.S.-initiated adjustments are currently going on in these  markets. Due to a tightening of U.S. monetary policy, long-term  interest rates have risen in various countries, and stocks have  fallen. For unstable markets which are sensitive to new  information, political disturbances can become decisive factors.    The market in Tokyo is most affected by tension in the  Korean  peninsula. Although there are strong concerns in Japan about yen  appreciation, what is really frightening is the fall in the  values of yen, stocks, and securities when this is combined with  mounting international tension and bogging down of the political  situation.    The economy finally seems to be moving toward recovery.  There should be no concern that this trend might be drastically  affected by the recent change in the political situation.  Should the turmoil be prolonged, however, psychological effects  cannot be ignored.    In the end, what has the Hosokawa administration  accomplished  regarding economic affairs? What is ironic is that Hosokawa's  "final task" was his getting advice on tax system reform from  the government Tax Commission. What could have gone through the  prime minister's mind when he read the Tax Commission's report?  What troubled him the most must have been the tax system.  This, then, was the underlying cause of the collapse of the  administration.    Prime Minister Hosokawa found himself in a predicament as  the  ruling coalition parties remained divided over the issue of a  consumption tax hike, while Finance Ministry bureaucrats  insisted on balancing revenue shortfalls with tax hikes. Since  priority was placed on political reform, budget compilation,  which normally is routine work, has been postponed. As a  result, the administration came to an abrupt halt, failing to  even see the beginning of Diet deliberations on the draft budget  bill. The public lost its confidence in the prime minister when  he was forced to take back to the drawing board his proposal for  a national welfare tax, which was based only on "rough  estimates." What replaced this was a plan to "cut taxes for one  year only"--a major factor that caused the breakdown in  Japan-U.S. summit talks.    The Hosokawa administration gained wide acclaim from the  world's economists by saying "no" to the setting of numerical  targets during trade negotiations. However, it failed to come  up with counterproposals, causing the U.S. administration to be  further dissatisfied. Hosokawa used the laudable phrase "mature  relations" to ease the impact of the breakdown in the framework  trade talks. Since Japan-U.S. relations have relied heavily on  the personal relationship between Hosokawa and U.S. President  Bill Clinton, the prime minister's resignation, all the more,  could lead to a delay in the restoration of bilateral ties.  <H5>  An Inclination to Introversion </H5>   What is more serious is that under the Hosokawa  administration, Japan unknowingly became introverted. Even  though Japan is the greatest benefactor under GATT, it played  the role of a victim in the Uruguay Round talks.    It is said that it will be unlikely for Japanese ministers  to  attend a GATT ministerial meeting to be held in Morocco this  week. What does it signify for Japan to be absent at a time when  the world seeks to set up new frameworks of negotiations  regarding employment and trade, environment and trade, and other  issues under the new World Trade Organization (WTO)? An  immeasurable negative impact can be expected if the nation with  the largest current account surplus in the world remains silent.    Regardless of who takes over the reins of the government,  it is clear which direction the Japanese economy should move.  Needless to say, priority must be placed on enacting the draft  budget bill. Only then can the new administration tackle  unfinished tasks regarding "economic reform."    Concerning tax system reform, tax cuts should be continued  in  such a manner that the progressive structure of income taxes may  be relaxed. The consumption tax should be raised in the future  after improving the consumption tax system by abolishing taxes  on profits and through other means.    Regarding deregulation, policy principles should be made  clear as to "what purpose deregulation is intended for."  Nothing would have been accomplished should deregulation be  implemented equally among all government ministries and  agencies, just as in the manner the budget is allocated among  them. That would be tantamount to playing into the hands of  bureaucrats. Rather, what would be more effective is to  concentrate on deregulating those sectors which would help boost  domestic demand.    Economic reform in Japan should serve as a model case for  post-cold war market economies. Only after it has implemented  economic reform can Japan finally qualify as a proponent for an  international economic system in the next era.  <H5>  A Necessary Responsibility </H5>   Although the Japanese economy should move in such a  direction  regardless of who takes over the reins of the government, this  cannot necessarily be accomplished by just any administration.  Economic reform can only be implemented by an administration  which does not let bureaucrats take over policies and can  exercise political leadership and comprehensive coordinating  capabilities. The problem with the current political structure  is that there are only a few politicians who have better  knowledge of economics than the bureaucrats, even though they  may be very interested in power struggles.    When Tanzan Ishibashi was finance minister, he stayed up all  night to write a financial policy speech regarding the fiscal  year 1946 national budget, all by himself. Since the final  draft of his speech, which included a well-known passage, "man  lives for hope in the future rather than the present," was not  ready for a cabinet meeting, Ishibashi made verbal explanations  and managed to answer to Diet interpellations. Japan made a  miraculous recovery because here was a politician with a sense  of responsibility in times of great tension. Such politicians  are rare nowadays. This is what is causing a waste of time in  Japanese politics.    Only by adjusting the political structure gradually can  economic reform be brought about. However, should the Japanese  economy fail to emerge from the turmoil because too much time  has been spent on adjusting the political structure, it will be  mercilessly exposed to heavy selling in the world's markets.  Japanese politics is being put to a test in a time of historic  upheaval in the world economy.</p>

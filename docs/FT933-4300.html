			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wm Baird 12% down in difficult trading WILLIAM BAIRD, the textiles and engineering group, blamed difficult trading conditions in the UK for a 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half ended June. They declined from Pounds 10m to Pounds 8.77m on reduced sales of Pounds 230.6m, compared with Pounds 242.7m. The shares fell 3p to 285p. Mr Donald Parr, chairman, said there had been no consistent pattern of recovery in consumer confidence. The anticipated benefits for UK manufacturers from the devaluation of sterling last year have not yet had a discernible effect on business. Operating profits fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 9.7m. Baird Textiles contributed Pounds 7.02m (Pounds 8.53m) on increased turnover of Pounds 203.6m (Pounds 195.3m). Darchem, which recently sold its engineering division to the Weir Group for about Pounds 16m, reported lower profits of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.87m). Mr Parr hoped to sell the remaining building services and engineering companies shortly. However, he said: 'There is no emergency; they are still making profits. If it takes us another year to dispose of them so be it.' Borrowings of Pounds 25m are expected to be eliminated by the year end. Lower interest rates led to a fall in net interest charges to Pounds 979,000 (Pounds 1.5m). Earnings per share fell to 5.2p (6p). The interim dividend is maintained at 3.55p. COMMENT The UK recovery may be taking longer than anticipated but the fall in textile margins disappointed the market. Regardless of how slow the upturn proves to be, the benefits from last year's devaluation of sterling are likely to flow through before the end of the second half. That should help the group to increase annual pre-tax profits to some Pounds 27m. But it may not be enough to make investors happy. A good acquisition might do the trick. That probably depends on how quick Baird can dispose of Darchem. If precedence is anything to go by it is likely to take longer than expected. The stock will look more attractive next year, but for now the shares - on a prospective multiple of 17.3 - are high enough.</p>

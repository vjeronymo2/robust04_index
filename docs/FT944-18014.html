			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: M&amp;A shows revival signs in Japan, say brokers Mergers and acquisitions by Japanese companies, which have been declining since the bursting of the 'bubble economy' of the late 1980s and early 1990s, are showing signs of revival. Reports by two leading Japanese brokers reveal that Japanese companies have returned to mergers and acquisitions as a means of restructuring their operations. According to Daiwa Securities, there were 373 M&amp;A deals in the first nine months of this year, up 26 per cent on the same stage of 1993. However, unlike purchases during the economic boom, recent transactions reflect efforts to counter increasing competition and to cut costs. In contrast to transactions during the late 1980s, the average size of deals has fallen sharply. Yamaichi Securities said the average transaction size has dropped 46 per cent, from Y3.51bn in 1991 to Y1.9bn (Dollars 19m) so far this year. Daiwa said M&amp;A deals were particularly prominent in the petrochemical and retail industries. Japan's petrochemical industry has been hit by low domestic demand and the appreciation of the yen, and companies are turning to mergers in order to survive. The discount boom and the rise of private brands in the retail industry has prompted large supermarkets to cut out the wholesaler in order to maintain profit margins, forcing consolidation among wholesalers. Increasing competition among convenience stores has also prompted an increase in M&amp;A activity. Acquisitions of US businesses by Japanese companies rose 45 per cent to 64 deals during the nine months to September. Electronics, telecommunications and pharmaceutical groups are investing in US venture companies to acquire advanced expertise. Daiwa also noted a rise in purchases of plants in order to secure manufacturing bases in North America. Yamaichi said acquisitions of Asian companies by Japanese businesses doubled from a year earlier, to 18 deals, although investment in Europe slowed slightly from 24 to 23 deals. Purchases of Japanese businesses by foreign companies rose by 9 to 30, Yamaichi said. Japanese companies looking to restructure their operations have turned to overseas corporations looking to expand in Japan, while the country's deregulation efforts have started to attract foreign companies.</p>

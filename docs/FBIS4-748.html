			<p>BFN     [Text] Lusaka April 14 SAPA -- Zambia has undertaken to  train 120 African National Congress members as army officers.  ANC representative in Zambia Japhet Ndhlovu confirmed on  Thursday [14 April] that his organisation had requested the  training, but the plan could not be implemented immediately  because it had not been budgeted for in the 1993 year. ANC  President Nelson Mandela had formally made the request when he  last visited Zambia in 1992. Confirming the plan, Zambian  Government spokesman Kelly Walubita said: "That is a bilateral  issue and will be implemented this year."</p>

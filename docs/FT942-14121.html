			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sherwood Computer shares rise despite loss Shares in Sherwood Computer Services rose 17p to 94p after the financial software company reported losses of Pounds 1.67m pre-tax for 1993, following exceptional charges of Pounds 1.86m, against profits of Pounds 3.02m. The rise more than made up for the fall to 60p in November after the USM-quoted company issued its second profits warning in four months. There were no further surprises yesterday with the company still blaming problems in the local government and Lloyd's insurance markets for operating losses of Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 2.22m profits). Exceptional costs related to provisions on leases, redundancy costs and other provisions. Sherwood has decided to exit from all peripheral activities and since the year end has sold Venus for Pounds 110,000, concluded an agreement with Capita to take over Threshold and Household and sold its 25 per cent interest in Guardian Computer Services for Pounds 825,000. Losses per share were 35.78p (34.1p earnings) and the final dividend is passed, leaving the total at 1.75p (7p).</p>

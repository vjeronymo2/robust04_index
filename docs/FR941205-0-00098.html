The Scope of Retransmission Consent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Radio <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 58. In the Report and Order we concluded that Congress intended to provide retransmission consent to all broadcast signals, including those retransmitted by radio. Petitions for reconsideration argue that the retransmission consent provisions of Section 325 and the must-carry provisions of Sections 614 and 615 were intended to work in concert and, therefore, because the must-carry provisions apply only to broadcast television signals, Congress intended retransmission consent to apply only to broadcast television signals. Cable operators argue that most cable systems carry radio stations as an all-band offering, meaning that as with any standard radio receiver, all stations which deliver a signal to the antenna are carried on the system. They contend that the refusal of one radio station to grant consent would preclude all other radio stations from being carried in the all-band method. Several commenters assert that cable operators are more likely to drop the all-band radio offering, rather than attempt to bargain for retransmission consent from all stations carried. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 59. We continue to believe that Section 325, as amended by the 1992 Cable Act, applies to radio signals as well as television signals. The statutory language and the legislative history support this conclusion and we have not been presented with a credible argument for reading the statute otherwise. Section 325(b)(2) expressly exempts certain broadcast stations from the consent provision, and radio stations are not included in these exceptions. However, with respect to the difficulty of obtaining consent for all stations carried in an all-band method, we believe that cable system have a legitimate concern. In order to make possible the offering of an ``all-band'' FM radio service, cable operators need only seek the consent of stations within the usual reception area of a high power FM station. Therefore, cable systems must obtain consent from all stations which are located within 92 km (57 miles) of the cable system's receiving antenna(s). The distance of 92 km was selected as a result of the Commission's allotment policies relating to FM radio stations. Because the predicted service contour of a Class C FM radio station is 92 kilometers, the use of such a distance will ensure that retransmission consent is obtained from FM radio stations received by the cable system's receiving antenna(s). Other stations, in the absence of specific notice to the contrary, will be presumed to be insufficiently present to be considered carried in the all-band reception mode. This should eliminate concern over obtaining consent from signals which fade in and out of an all-band offering due to atmospheric conditions. We note that although the cable operator is not required to obtain retransmission consent from stations outside the 92 km zone, any such station that is received and retransmitted by the cable system may affirmatively refuse to grant, or negotiate for compensation in return for granting, retransmission consent to the cable operator. Alternatively, a cable system may choose to use a filtering device to eliminate those radio stations from an all-band offering for which the cable operator is unable or unwilling to obtain consent. This change will be reflected in Section 76.64 of our rules, under a new subpart (n). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Low Power Television Stations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60. In concluding in the Report and Order that low power television stations are entitled to retransmission consent, we stated that low power television stations are ``television broadcast stations.'' We incorrectly stated, however, that a low power station meets the definition of television broadcast station in &sect;76.5 of our rules. Section 76.5(b) defines television broadcast station as ``any television broadcast station operating on a channel regularly assigned to its community by &sect;73.606 of this chapter *&blank;*&blank;*.'' A low power television station, defined in Section 74.701(f), however, is authorized under subpart G of Part 74 of our rules. However, we continue to believe that the statute was clear that low power television stations are entitled to assert retransmission consent over their signals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Exceptions to the Retransmission Consent Requirement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 61. Section 325, as amended by the 1992 Cable Act, provides four exceptions to retransmission consent. Section 325(b)(2) states that retransmission consent shall not apply to the retransmission of NCE stations, retransmission directly to a home satellite antenna, the retransmission of the broadcast signal of a network directly to a home satellite antenna of an unserved household, or the retransmission of the signal of a superstation if such signal was obtained from a satellite carrier and the originating station was a superstation on May 1, 1991. Petitions for reconsideration have been filed regarding the interpretation of the fourth exception. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

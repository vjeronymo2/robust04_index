			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Tie Rack back in the black with Pounds 301,000 TIE RACK, the speciality tie retailer, bounced back into the black at the half-way stage recording pre-tax profits of Pounds 301,000 compared with a loss of Pounds 972,000 last time. The company experienced a healthy improvement in sales, which rose 18 per cent to Pounds 25.4m in the 28 weeks to August 16, with business-style ties and Disney products selling particularly strongly. Existing stores accounted for 11 percentage points of this increase with five new stores contributing the remainder. Tie Rack also benefited from a reduction in its cost base and stricter control of working capital. This led to an operational cash inflow of Pounds 5m yielding Pounds 161,000 in interest income compared with Pounds 490,000 paid out last year. The company again passed its interim dividend and said it would not be resumed in the 'foreseeable future'. However, Tie Rack affirmed its intention to pay a final dividend. Earnings per share came to 0.38p against losses of 1.75p last time. The company said it remained 'cautiously confident' about trading prospects. Mr Nigel McGinley, chief executive, said: 'Trade started off well in August but we saw quite a marked softening in the middle of September coinciding with Black Wednesday and the stream of poor economic news.' However, the company reported that sales had again picked up last week and it was expecting further increases over the crucial Christmas period. At the end of the half year, the company traded from 141 stores in the UK and 121 overseas. Fourteen more stores will have been added by Christmas. Tie Rack continued to incur losses in the US, although it said the business was on an improving trend. Its first franchised store in the Far East opened in Hong Kong during the period.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cairns group agreed in its latest meeting in  Uruguay that the drafting of the United States Farm Bill in  September should be monitored closely, according to  secretary-general of the Agricultural Economics Office  Phithiphong Phungbun na Ayutthaya.    He said yesterday that monitoring was necessary because of  speculation that the US might resort to rice subsidies counter  to the GATT agreement signed in Marrakech by GATT members  including the US.    The Cairns group has assigned Canada and Australia to  monitor  the bill.    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak proposed in  Montevideo Uruguay, on May 19 and 20 that the agricultural  policy of developed countries including the US, Japan and those  in the European Union be monitored closely.    Developments on this issue must be reported promptly and the  Cairns Group should ensure that developed countries refrain from  using health regulations as trade protectionism in disguise,  according to Thailand.    Thailand wants the group to push for trade in fishery  products to be more liberalised under GATT.</p>

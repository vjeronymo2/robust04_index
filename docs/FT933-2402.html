			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (5): Expatriates can roll it up offshore INVESTORS WHO wish to keep their assets on deposit, but who are expatriates or intend to move abroad, might consider offshore funds as an alternative to holding money in a UK-based bank or building society, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Many are similar to unit trusts; but, unlike their onshore counterparts, offshore funds can pay income gross (though November's Budget may bring change). Offshore funds are broadly divided into two main types for UK tax purposes: distributor and accumulator funds. Distributors must pay out 85 per cent of their income as dividends. UK investors pay income tax on the dividends, but any other profits are taxed as capital gains. Accumulators do not pay out income, but 'roll it up' within the fund. Gains are taxed as income, not capital gains, but only when investors sell their holding. Accumulator funds can, therefore, be useful for postponing a tax liability. If an investor knew he was going to retire and move into a lower tax bracket, he could invest in a roll-up and take profits at the most tax-efficient moment. Furthermore, the roll-up can enhance performance. Since tax is postponed, investors can compound their investment gross rather than net. Roll-up funds tend to invest in the money markets, or in bonds, where income is high enough to get the full benefit of the roll-up process. Many investment houses offer a range of funds, allowing investors to switch easily between cash, bonds and equities without incurring the same costs as moving between different institutions. Investors can also switch between currencies. Investment for expatriates - see page 22</p>

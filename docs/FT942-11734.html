			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank Bumiputra backs private power plan Bank Bumiputra, the Malaysian state-owned bank which has been dogged by controversy and bad debts, is fully underwriting a MDollars 587m (USDollars 212.7m) loan to a consortium of local companies involved in Malaysia's independent power programme. The consortium, Powerteck, has the license to build, own and operate a 440MW gas fired power station in Malacca, on the west coast of peninsular Malaysia. This is the third loan Bank Bumiputra has made in recent months to companies involved in Malaysia's plan to privatise part of the electricity industry. The bank says the loans - all in ringgit, the Malaysian dollar  - show the maturity of the local capital market. However, some financiers have expressed concern that Malaysian financial institutions, and Bank Bumiputra in particular, are too exposed in one sector. They have also asked why foreign banks have chosen not to become involved in the private power sector.</p>

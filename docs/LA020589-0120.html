			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIP OF THE WEEK: HISTORIC STATE PARK INCLUDES ELK RESERVE, FARM  </P> <P> There's no reason to be bored on a drive through the San Joaquin Valley.  Instead of following the freeways that speed through California's food basket,  detour on California 43.  </P> <P> That rural two-lane road will lead to an unusual state historic park, a farm  where visitors can pick their own vegetables, a reserve for the rare tule elk  and a recreation area that's popular with fishing folk and campers.  </P> <P> From California 99 north of Bakersfield, take the Ducor/Alpaugh exit at  Earlimart and go west on Tulare County road J22 (56 Avenue) to California 43.  Turn left and head south about two miles to Palmer Avenue, a road that crosses  the Santa Fe railway tracks to Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park.  </P> <P> Park boundaries encompass the center of Allensworth, the only town in  California founded by blacks.  </P> <P> Today, ranger Phil Jenkins and a groundskeeper and their families are the only  residents of Allensworth, which exceeded 200 people in its heyday.  </P> <P> The town owes its name and beginning in 1908 to a former slave and U.S. Army  chaplain, Lt. Col. Allen Allensworth. He envisioned an agricultural colony in  which blacks could be economically and politically independent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Town Prospered  </P> <P> With good soil and water wells, the town prospered. It had two general stores,  a bakery, a barber shop, a livery stable, a drugstore, a machine shop, a hotel,  a school and a library.  </P> <P> Allensworth's demise began in 1914 with the death of its leader in a Los  Angeles traffic accident, followed by a declining water supply. Residents moved  away.  </P> <P> Much of the town had disappeared by 1976, when the site became a state historic  park as a monument to its black pioneers. Since then several structures have  been restored or reconstructed.  </P> <P> Head first to the visitor center to view a 30-minute video about the town. Buy  a park map (75 cents), then walk or drive to various buildings on the flat and  almost treeless town site.  </P> <P> Signs describe past use of restored structures. Push a button at the elementary  school, Grosse's Drug Store and Singleton's General Store for taped  commentaries about those buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prefabricated House  </P> <P> Visit the furnished home of Col. and Mrs. Allensworth. Their prefabricated  house was brought in in sections by the railroad and constructed in 1910; the  ranger will open it upon request. The school and the Smith and Hindsman houses  will be opened if requested.  </P> <P> Plans include a display of livestock and replanting of the town's experimental  garden. The former hotel is to be reconstructed as an eight-room inn.  Meanwhile, visitors can overnight in a campground with 15 sites (no hookups).  There are shaded tables for picnics.  </P> <P> The visitor center is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. On May 13 docents will  give guided tours of the town during the annual Allensworth Jubilee. The park  phone is (805) 849-3433.  </P> <P> Continue south on California 43 through Wasco and Shafter and their fields of  roses to Stockdale Highway due west of Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Turn right and go west three miles to entrance signs for the Al Bussell Ranch.  </P> <P> The Bussell clan has been growing fruits and vegetables on their farm for 29  years, and they let visitors pick in the fields. This is the first season the  farm has been open to the public in winter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vegetable Picks  </P> <P> You'll find ripe carrots, radishes, broccoli, cabbage and turnips. Those  vegetables are also sold in the farm shed. Oranges, pears and apples are  available, too. Open daily, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Youngsters can pet the farm animals and play in a maze created with bales of  hay. Sandwiches and beverages are available at a refreshment stand. For an  update of what is ripe for picking, call the Bussell Ranch at (805) 589-2324 or  (805) 589-0595.  </P> <P> Thousands of tule elk once roamed California's valleys, but hunters and loss of  grazing lands to agriculture almost destroyed this subspecies. Forty-nine of  the rare animals still roam in the 350-acre Tule Elk State Reserve.  </P> <P> Continue west on Stockdale Highway more than a mile past the Interstate 5  overpass and turn left on Morris Road. At its end, go right on Station Road to  the reserve headquarters. When there has been little rain, the elk frequently  come to a watering hole near the viewing area; take binoculars to help see  these shy animals.  </P> <P> Continue west on Station Road, turn left on Tupman Road that follows the  California Aqueduct to Taft Highway/California 119, and turn left again to  reach Enos Lane. Then turn right (south) to the Buena Vista Aquatic Recreation  Area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Boaters, Campers  </P> <P> In summer this Kern County park overflows with boaters, swimmers and campers  trying to beat the valley's heat. This time of year, however, there is plenty  of room to enjoy its two man-made lakes.  </P> <P> In 1973 water was pumped into the dry Buena Vista Lake bed to create Lake Webb,  a favorite of boaters, and the smaller Lake Evans, where fishermen try for  trout.  </P> <P> Camping is available without reservations; it's $12 to $15 per vehicle per  site, $14 to $18 with full hookup. Day-use entry is $3 per vehicle. Trout  fishing costs $3.50 extra per person, $1.50 for ages 8 to 15.  </P> <P> Return to Los Angeles by going north on Enos Lane to California 119/Taft  Highway and turning right to Interstate 5.  </P> <P> Round trip between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley is 328 miles.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Credit Goes to the One Who Deserves It"] </F>   [Text] What has made the brothers in Saudi Arabia involve  themselves in the restoration of the Islamic places in the holy  city these days, and to claim that the Kingdom is going ahead  with its commitment to implement the project in cooperation with  UNESCO.    Everyone knows that Jordan, and His Majesty King Husayn  personally was the one who looked after, supervised, and  financed the restoration of the holy places and the Dome of the  Rock throughout the past decades. The celebrations held in  Amman and Jerusalem a few days ago to mark this great  achievement were evidence of this restoration, which is the  third Hashemite restoration that was carried out with pure  Jordanian planning, supervision, and financing. That effort was  blessed by our people and all religious and popular  establishments in Jerusalem and the whole of occupied Palestine.    While carrying out this noble duty, Jordan was showing  commitment to historical and geographical responsibilities  without reminding anyone of a favor or boasting about what it is  doing. Jordan only seeks God's satisfaction and wants to serve  and maintain the first of the two qiblas and the third holiest  shrine.    The statement by the official Saudi source, claiming that  Saudi Arabia is continuing its restoration of the holy places  through UNESCO, can only be understood as arrogance, claiming  the work of others, disregarding the efforts of others, and  extreme ingratitude.    What is worse is that the Saudi official source insists on  involving an international organization, that is UNESCO, in what  he termed the project to restore the holy places, as if he wants  to internationalize these shrines and put them under  international control, ignoring that these shrines are Arab and  Islamic, and sovereignty over them is only for Almighty God, as  His Majesty King Husayn said.    His Majesty King Husayn has openly and loudly said: We are  carrying out this duty in the name of the Islamic nation and on  its behalf, and the path for the restoration of our shrines in  Jerusalem is known -- it is the Jordanian Ministry of Awqaf and  the Committee for the Restoration of al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of  the Rock.    Neither UNESCO, nor any other international establishment or  organization have any connection with the reconstruction and  restoration because these activities are carried out by the  Hashemites, who have jurisdiction and religious right, and who  are--historically and geographically--the custodians of the  Covenant of 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab. All allegations by any side  will only bring regret to those who make them, and the credit  will continue to be for the one who deserves it.</p>

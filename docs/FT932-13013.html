			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Estimated insurance losses at 'Pounds 300m' INSURED losses caused by Saturday's bomb attack are likely to exceed Pounds 300m, according to the Association of British Insurers, the industry trade association. The ABI said the losses would be of the same magnitude as last year's City bombs. The pattern of payouts could also be repeated, it added. Two thirds of claims were for material damage - to property, fixtures and fittings - with roughly one third of payouts compensating lost profit and rental income. Mr Nick Balcombe, a loss assessor, said he expected losses to be more extensive and could exceed Pounds 1bn. 'Many more buildings will have to come down. The Hongkong bank has had its guts ripped out. I don't think Bishopsgate will be open for some time.' Describing these and other estimates as 'likely to prove wildly inaccurate', the ABI said most businesses affected are likely to have 'carefully worked out contingency plans which should minimise disruption and keep down business interruption claims'.</p>

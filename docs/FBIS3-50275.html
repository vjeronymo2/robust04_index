			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  Mate Granic and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko  signed a protocol in Zagreb today on cooperation between the  Croatian and Ukrainian ministries of foreign affairs and a  protocol on establishing consular relations.    We are new independent states and therefore we have mutual  interests in many spheres. We would primarily wish to develop  political cooperation, but also economic cooperation, as we have  good conditions for this, Ukrainian Minister Anatoliy Zlenko  stated following the signing of the documents.    We had talks on the political situation in the region, the  situation in Croatia and Ukraine, the promotion of economic  relations which lag behind the political will, and on political  relations, because there are no open questions between Ukraine  and Croatia, Mate Granic stated. He announced that treaties on  friendship and cooperation between the two states, treaties on  economic, cultural, medical, and transport cooperation, and  several other important documents are being prepared.    The Croatian minister informed journalists that his talks  with the Ukrainian minister also referred to all important  issues in Croatian and Ukrainian foreign policy. Minister  Granic also informed the Ukrainian minister about the Geneva  negotiations, his visit to Italy in February, and Croatia's  desire to be admitted to the Council of Europe and to join the  Partnership for Peace program.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Postipankki reduces deficit POSTIPANKKI, the Finnish state-owned bank, yesterday announced a sharp reduction in losses for the first eight months, confirming evidence that the Finnish banking sector is past the worst of its difficulties. The bank's operating loss amounted to FM66m (Dollars 11.6m), compared with FM599m in the corresponding 1992 period. It was helped by falling interest rates, which cut the carrying costs of non-performing loans and lifted the profits of money market activities.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Brussels fine to hit company Bollore, the French transport and industrial conglomerate, warned yesterday that its 1991 results would be hit by the Ecu15m (Pounds 10.7m) fine imposed by the European Commission on four of its shipping subsidiaries for freezing out freight competition on routes between France and west Africa, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. Bollore, which dominates the sector, has had to promise to cut back its heavy involvement in west African freight trade to help promote competition.</p>

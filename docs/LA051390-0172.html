			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: PALM HAS ARMAGEDDON MADE IN SHADE  </P> <P> I have this recurring daydream about an L.A. Armageddon. Usually it starts as I  sit gridlocked on the Hollywood Freeway, watching diesel fumes drift sleepily  over car tops. Everything goes very still on the freeway, and I get this  picture of a holy fire descending to bring some final revenge on L.A. and  gridlock and the whole shebang. Most of us get taken to Beach Hell for our  sins.  </P> <P> And then I start to wonder which artifacts would survive the L.A. holocaust. A  Mike Glickman real estate sign maybe? Or a license plate that reads, "AZ4  SUZE"? Or a bag of oranges at the end of a freeway exit?  </P> <P> Actually I have my own favorite, and that's what this column is all about. My  nominee for Last Object is Washingtonia Robusta, otherwise known as the Mexican  fan palm. If God ever designed one creature to outlast the rest of us in Los  Angeles, surely this is that creature. I have come to feel the warmest sense of  kinship with the Mexican fan palm and some day you may too.  </P> <P> Maybe you are thinking you haven't noticed the Mexican fan palm. That's OK. You  must look closely, but once you've noticed it and stared in wonder at the  incredible places where it thrives, fan palm watching can become a sort of  obsession.  </P> <P> For years, I also was unaware. Then one day, as usual, the traffic was stopped  dead on the Hollywood and I was left to daydreaming about God's revenge. My  gaze wandered around the collection of heavy iron puffing away and then fixed  on the median strip. I was startled.  </P> <P> Right there, shoving its tiny crown through four inches of industrial asphalt,  was a palm tree. A seedling palm tree, its fronds already covered in grimy  dust, its trunk entwined with audio recording tape. Somehow it had managed to  take root in that no-man's land, underneath the asphalt, and then push its way  upward, toward the light.  </P> <P> I thought about all the petunias that had croaked in my back yard after months  of pampering and the best nutrition Armstrong's could provide. I found myself  hating the petunias and loving the palm tree. Where was this orphan palm  getting its water? How could it live in the constant, carbon-monoxide winds of  the Hollywood Freeway?  </P> <P> Then I glanced down the median strip and saw another. And then another. There  were dozens of little fan palms muscling their way through the asphalt. Some of  them had lifted whole chunks of pavement and left cracks two inches wide. They  were everywhere along the median strip, decorated by clumps of fiberglass  insulation, old tire treads, used syringes.  </P> <P> Since that day, I have watched for them in unlikely spots. I found one fan palm  growing underneath an RV that must have been parked for years on a street in  Sun Valley. The palm crown was pushing against the differential.  </P> <P> There was another growing out of the corner of a building at Ventura Boulevard  and Laurel Canyon. The owners cut it down, but you can still see the leftover  trunk lodged underneath the outside wall, where it is partially bearing the  weight of the building. Any day now, I expect a small green shoot to emerge  from the trunk.  </P> <P> No other palm tree behaves this way. Date palms, canary palms, queen palms are  all more civilized, more beautiful, and you will not find them growing where  they are not invited. Only the Mexican fan palm has this junkyard-dog quality.  </P> <P> It is also homely, with a tall trunk and small crown that make it the least  desirable of all the palms for landscaping. In Florida, where it also thrives,  a University of Miami botanist recently called for an extermination campaign  against the Mexican fan palm. She called it "a weed."  </P> <P> Little did she know. Here in L.A., Caltrans constantly tries to exterminate the  fan palm from the freeway median strips. The maintenance men cut them down,  jerk them out with chains, stomp them with their boots. It doesn't work.  </P> <P> I called the Caltrans supervisor in charge of the Hollywood. How many fan palms  you got out there right now, I asked. Hundreds?  </P> <P> He paused. More like thousands, he said.  </P> <P> They had tried everything. Even chemicals. They finally stopped because the  chemicals had no effect whatsoever.  </P> <P> That palm tree, the supervisor said, is the meanest thing Caltrans deals with  out there.  </P> <P> I hung up, feeling all warm inside. Caltrans was whipped. Here was a palm that  seemed made for L.A. It was too mean to die, too tough even for Armageddon. And  if I had to choose, I would take it over a Mike Glickman sign, any day.  </P></p>

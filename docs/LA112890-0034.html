			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN OWNERS IGNORING LAW ON REGISTRATION  </P> <P> Owners of hundreds of thousands of military-style assault guns in California  are holding onto their weapons and not registering them in what an official of  the National Rifle Assn. characterized Tuesday as a massive demonstration of  civil disobedience.  </P> <P> Under an 18-month-old statute that all but outlawed such firearms, owners of  legally acquired Uzis, AK-47s, AR-15s and other exotic semiautomatics must  register them by Dec. 31 or face a stiff fine or possible criminal penalties.  </P> <P> Since the law was signed by Gov. George Deukmejian, only 5,150 out of  approximately 300,000 such guns believed to be owned by Californians have been  registered with the state Department of Justice.  </P> <P> Although a last-minute rush to register is possible, "I think it is pretty  obvious that there is non-compliance with the law," said Robert Drake, a bureau  chief in the department's division of law enforcement. "Enforcement is not our  job. Enforcement is a local issue."  </P> <P> However, local authorities, who will be called on to enforce the registration  law, said they do not intend to launch extraordinary efforts to find and  prosecute violators.  </P> <P> In Washington, Richard Gardiner, who led the NRA's unsuccessful fight to kill  the assault weapons bill in the California Legislature, said he believes that  as the deadline approaches "there is going to be massive civil disobedience" by  gun owners.  </P> <P> "According to all the surveys, nine out of 10 citizens believe they have a  constitutional right to own firearms and they are going to exercise that  right," Gardiner said. "People are not going to take (unregistered) guns out on  the street and try to get themselves arrested. (But) a lot of people are going  to quietly keep the guns in the hope that the law will be either invalidated or  repealed."  </P> <P> Gardiner said the NRA does not advise its members to obey or disobey the law.  "We tell them that we believe it is unconstitutional. We leave it to them to  choose what they want to do. If someone chooses to disobey the law, civil  disobedience is a moral decision that each must make for himself."  </P> <P> Historically, many gun owners, even so-called moderates, have viewed  registration as the first step toward the unthinkable: confiscation of their  firearms.  </P> <P> The law gave owners of legally obtained assault weapons 18 months, or until  this Dec. 31, to register them. Failure to do so is punishable by an infraction  fine of $350 on the first offense. Subsequent violations may be treated as a  misdemeanor or felony, including jail terms.  </P> <P> Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los  Angeles), authors of the statute, expressed disappointment that the  registration requirement is apparently being ignored.  </P> <P> "Civil disobedience is fine, but it is going to be expensive," Roberti said.  </P> <P> Said Roos: "It's just amazing to me that an organization, and Gardiner himself,  who have been suggesting that we get tougher with people who break the law,  should now be so cavalier with a law they don't believe in."  </P> <P> Among other things, the law made it illegal as of last Jan. 1 to sell,  transfer, import, loan, manufacture, distribute or give away about 60 types of  military-style assault guns, including semiautomatic rifles, pistols and  shotguns.  </P> <P> For Californians who already legally owned these weapons -- estimated by the  NRA and the state Department of Justice at about 300,000 -- the law created a  heavily publicized, first-ever firearms registration system.  </P> <P> There is no statewide policy that governs how the registration requirements  will be enforced. But in a series of interviews, officials of several local and  statewide law enforcement organizations indicated that police chiefs and  sheriffs intend to establish similar local policies.  </P> <P> These officials agreed that no special effort would be made to enforce the new  law and that citations would be incidental to another offense or citizen  complaint.  </P> <P> "We are not going to go out and create a task force of any kind," said Los  Angeles Police Department spokesman Fred Nixon. "We anticipate that in the  course of some other kind of investigation that occasionally we will become  aware of failure to register the weapon. In those instances, we will, of  course, take the weapon into custody and then request the appropriate criminal  filing."  </P> <P> In Northern California, Lt. Lyle Shores of the Contra Costa County Sheriff's  Department said domestic disputes and divorce cases may provide the best  incidental leads to unregistered weapons.  </P> <P> "You never know what you are going to stumble over," Shores said. "If you get  called to a domestic fight, the wife may tell you all the things the husband  has that he isn't supposed to have, or vice versa."  </P> <P> In a case that may end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, the NRA failed late last  summer to persuade a federal judge in Fresno to strike down the assault weapons  law as unconstitutional. The NRA has asked that the ruling be reconsidered.  </P></p>

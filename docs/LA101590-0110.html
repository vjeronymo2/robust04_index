			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BEIRUT'S GREEN LINE DISMANTLED  </P> <P> The government of President Elias Hrawi moved today to reunify Beirut by  dismantling the Green Line that has split the Lebanese capital into Muslim and  Christian sectors.  </P> <P> The army command of Gen. Emile Lahoud ordered military police to stop  lawlessness by some leftist and Muslim militias that moved into the enclave of  defeated Gen. Michel Aoun in the Christian heartland outside the city.  </P> <P> Syrian and Lebanese troops crushed Aoun's 11-month mutiny in an air-and-ground  assault Saturday that left 160 people dead and more than 800 wounded. Aoun took  refuge in the French Embassy, where he remained today while Lebanon and France  argued over French efforts to move him to exile in France. France has been the  traditional protector of Lebanon's Christians.  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Mirror, mirror THE PHYSICAL fitness regime of the Princess of Wales would not normally be a subject of concern to this newspaper. It has been made so by the decision of two titles in the Mirror group to publish photographs of the princess, taken in a London gymnasium with a concealed camera. The subsequent decision by the Mirror group's national titles to pull out of the Press Complaints Commission throws the future of self regulation of the UK press into doubt. In publishing the pictures, the Mirror flagrantly flouted the commission's code, of which it is a signatory. This bars intrusion into private lives except when the public interest dictates otherwise. The newspapers' defence, that they have exposed a security risk, is worth mentioning only for its brazen disingenuity. Inevitably, the incident has led to renewed calls for action to curb press intrusions, a subject the government intends to address shortly in a white paper. Newspapers have argued that instead of legislating, the government should give the PCC more time to show its value. Set up in 1991, the PCC has speeded up its complaints procedure and this year acted to make itself more robust, giving non-press members a majority voice and strengthening its code. The grandiose hypocrisy of the Mirror undermines these efforts and exposes the fact that the commission has no sanctions save harsh words. We know what the papers' editors think about the propriety of breaking the newspaper industry's agreed code of conduct. It would now be proper to hear the views of the board of the Mirror Group, in particular the chairman Sir Robert Clark and his non-executive directors, Mr Alan Clements, Sir Gordon Borrie and Mr James McColgan. Legislators, however, should note another point. This spy camera was installed not by a journalist, but by the gym's owner, in order to make money at the expense of a famous customer. That underlines the most important point in the debate about press law. Electronic eavesdropping, of which this is an example, should be banned by law. But journalists should be neither above the law nor subject to discrimination by it.</p>

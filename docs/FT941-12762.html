			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / France and US in clash over ways to end Bosnian civil war Western disagreements over how to end the Bosnian civil war yesterday erupted into angry recriminations between Paris and Washington as Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, flatly denied French assertions that the US had washed its hands of the crisis. He was responding to comments yesterday by Mr Richard Duque, the French foreign ministry spokesman. Hitting back at earlier remarks by his State Department counterpart, Mr Mike McCurry, that France was resorting to 'a very strange moral calculus' in insisting that the US exert full pressure on the Bosnian Moslems, Mr Duque retorted: 'If we are talking on a moral level, the choice today is between merely watching the fighting and doing everything possible to stop it.' Mr Christopher insisted: 'The US is not standing by, by any means.' He repeated the US support of Nato resolutions which could lead to the use of air power in support of United Nations peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, specifically to reopen the airport at Tuzla and to relieve Canadian troops besieged in Srebrenica. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday received a report from Mr Yasushi Akashi, his special representative in former Yugoslavia, detailing UN military plans, including the possible use of air power, to secure these two goals. Mr Christopher said: 'We're quite prepared to pursue the president's commitment to take action when UN military plans are drawn up,' adding that both President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, 'were supportive on these points'. He also rebuffed what were seen in Washington as French demands that the US send troops to Bosnia. 'The US does not believe it should put in ground forces in order to require the parties to enter into a settlement. We think it would be inappropriate to insist that the victim, the Bosnian government, conform to some pre-existing plan,' he said. In Paris, however, Mr Duque said France had never proposed imposing a settlement by force or a massive military intervention. Despite yesterday's exchanges, the French government made clear it intends to continue trying to convince the US of the merits of a more concerted diplomatic support for the European Union's peace plan for Bosnia.</p>

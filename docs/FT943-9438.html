			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not only New York funds drive gold price Sir, The analysts at Bear Stearns &amp; Co argue that the gold price is too high at Dollars 380 an ounce (Letters, August 5). This may be the view in New York, which often forgets the wider world in which the interplay of many markets makes the price. Although one driving force in gold recently has been the ubiquitous 'funds' in New York, the underlying strength of the gold market continues to be strong physical off-take for jewellery and industry in places as diverse as India, Indonesia, Italy, China and the US itself. This demand alone outstrips, even at Dollars 380, new mine production and scrap. At Dollars 330 in early 1993, gold was perceived as so 'cheap' that it triggered demand not seen since the metal was at Dollars 35 an ounce 25 years ago. Which brings us to Bear Stearns' remarks about the Fed (where, of course, Wayne Angell was a board member until recently). The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been out of the gold market since it closed its gold 'window' in 1971, no longer handing out gold for dollars at Dollars 35 to any passing central bank. Unlike the Bank of England, it has not maintained its expertise in the gold market. So how is the Fed to 'get' the price back between Dollars 320-Dollars 340? Start selling US reserves at those prices to all-comers? Has it been forgotten that in the 1960s the central banks' gold pool tried in vain to hold gold at Dollars 35? Or that the US Treasury sales in the late 1970s were seen as a vote of no confidence in the dollar? The Treasury got Dollars 255 an ounce for its gold; the price pressed on to Dollars 800. Moreover, markets now regard the gold price as a moveable feast. When historically it was principally a monetary metal, the benchmark offered by the stability of its price was crucial. But the world of gold has moved on; the cocktail of forces determining its price today means that any central bank trying to 'stabilise' it to suit its own convenience does so at its peril.

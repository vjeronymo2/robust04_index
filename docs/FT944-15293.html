			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Muzak - an irritating and noisy distraction Sir, I was interested to read the article, 'Muzak to the ears' (October 13). Personally, I will always walk out of any shop, restaurant or hotel which uses so-called background music. I would also get off any aircraft doing the same thing, if it were possible without doing myself serious damage. The whole point is that one has no control over this form of pollution. One cannot alter it, suppress it or, best of all, get rid of it entirely, except by going elsewhere. Whatever Muzak or its British equivalent is labelled, it is noise - and noise which one cannot switch off is not only an irritant, but likely to cause increased blood pressure, nervous exhaustion or worse in susceptible people. To the misguided managements of Mothercare, Harrods and other proponents of this insidious form of pollution, I would ask - do people visit their stores to hear music? No, they go there to view and perhaps buy. Why therefore distract them? Robert T Street, 109 Oak Tree Road, Knaphill, Woking, Surrey, GU21 2SB</p>

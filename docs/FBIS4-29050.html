			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  may hold subcabinet-level talks next week to find ways to  improve American access to Japan's auto and auto parts markets,  a senior Trade Ministry official said Tuesday [14 June].    The two parties are narrowing differences as much as  possible  during the current ongoing working-level auto trade talks, said  the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI), who declined to be named.    But difficult issues will be left to the next stage of talks  which may be held next week at the earliest between Sozaburo  Okamatsu, MITI vice chief for international affairs, and Jeffrey  Garten, U.S. commerce undersecretary for international trade,  the official said, indicating that the controversial issue of  how to set "objective criteria" in gauging openness of Japan's  auto markets will be suspended.    Japan and the U.S. held working-level talks in Tokyo on  Monday and Tuesday and will continue into an unscheduled third  day Wednesday.    The senior MITI official said the two countries next week  will resume talks designed to expand foreign access to Japan's  glass market, a topic newly added to the priority fields of the  trade "framework" negotiations.</p>

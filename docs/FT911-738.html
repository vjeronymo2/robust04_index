			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Leading Article: How to control pay at the top AS SO often over the past few years, the late spring spate of annual reports is proving open season for people to snipe at the large sums of money which many top managers are paid these days, on both sides of the Atlantic. This year, unusually, some good may come of all the criticism. There are several reasons why this year's brouhaha is different in character. First and foremost, for the first time since the early 1980s, revelation of some sharply rising mega-salaries comes against an almost universal backdrop of falling profits. Second, many of the same companies are also expecting lesser managers and employees to moderate their salary and wage claims sharply in the face of the recession. Third, some of the companies have suffered especially embarrassing business failures. Fourth, some of this year's toughest sniping is coming from insiders: late last month the head of the British Institute of Management laid into UK directors for increasing their pay but reducing that of their managers for the first time since 1984. He warned that this might 'damage the relationship on which good leadership is based'. A further reason for the pitch of this year's debate is the salutary example of so many of yesterday's highest paid (and supposedly best performing) executive stars biting the dust. Finally, it is becoming crystal clear that the issue is not just one of basic salary and bonuses, but also of a bevy of other benefits: extra pay-offs to departing directors, big adjustments to pension benefits and housing subsidies. Performance incentives Some of the criticism contains a degree of both exaggeration and delusion. The idea that top directors of large UK companies are always paid at astronomic rates is by no means borne out by all the available surveys. Some have also taken big pay cuts in the latest 12 months. Nor is the concurrence of slumping corporate profits with sharp pay rises for directors always as illogical as it seems: a growing proportion of top executive pay, especially in the US, is rightly based on medium or long-term performance incentives, which at present relate back to better years: in 1991, they reach back to 1989 or even earlier. US counterparts Then there is the much-touted global (or at least transatlantic) market for top executives which, it is often argued, means that British bosses' earnings should grow even closer to those of their US counterparts. In direct terms, this factor applies only to certain international industries; it can hardly be claimed, even indirectly, to be a justifiable factor behind remuneration levels at UK insurance companies and building societies, for instance. In recent years, the most popular prescription for improving the control of top executive pay has been to give more power to non-executive directors and corporate audit committees; that view was expressed again last month by Britain's Institutional Shareholders Committee. Such an approach is inadequate. Audit committees run by 'independent' non-executive directors (a questionable concept in itself) certainly have an important role to play. But, in the US, company boards with a majority of non-executive directors, plus the high prevalence of audit committees, have not solved the problem. The most effective solution would be to force public companies to create much greater transparency in the service contracts which they give their main board directors. Current legislation allowing shareholders to search out such information at short notice should be strengthened by requiring companies to send details of every such package (existing and proposed) to all shareholders, and thereby to the public, well in advance of the annual general meeting, at which all packages should be voted upon. Few shareholders take much interest in these issues at present, but a requirement for full disclosure and approval, plus all the attendant publicity, would create much more effective pressure on companies.</p>

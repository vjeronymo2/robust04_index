If someone stands as  a candidate with another party he is already out of the PRI  [Italian Republican Party]. It is purely a political matter,  not a matter of issuing official documents to expel someone who  has chosen a path different from ours. It is something else  that is shocking -- the exploitation of the good faith of the  PRI's traditional voters to gather signatures for the rival  Democratic Alliance [AD] list. This cartel -- merely electoral,  and lacking a serious program -- is headed by former PCI  [Italian Communist Party] leader Achille Occhetto, who has  allied again for this purpose with the hard-liners of Communist  Renewal, no less. People who still idealize Cuba, who want to  tax government stock, and who in foreign policy still think as  though the Berlin Wall had never come down."    Giorgio La Malfa made it clear that he does not at all  regret  having used the epithets "traitor" and "sold out to the enemy"  of a major sector of the old Republican nobility. The very  sector of the old nomenklatura that is planning to contest the  coming general election under the rival AD banner. But the PRI  secretary, at least for the present, does not seem to intend to  make a technical issue of it, that is, by having the court of  arbitration consider the issue of "expelling" from the party  Visentini, Bogi, Ayala ("But I was never a member..."),  Gualtieri, Passigli, Sgarbati, Ugolini, Modigliani, and all the  other rebels who have gone over to the enemy camp.    "This, partly because the court of arbitration is an  ineffective weapon, which La Malfa himself blunted by reducing  the body's role," Paolo Ungari pointed out scathingly.  Certainly, the day after La Malfa vented his anger, though  impenitent, he admitted that he had "allowed himself to be led"  in his fierce attacks on the traitors. This ugly business among  the Republicans -- accompanied by insults from the crowd and  fierce attacks by the secretary on Senator Gualtieri and company  -- came to a head Sunday morning at a movie theater in Forli,  the PRI's traditional stronghold, under military occupation by a  large and compact group of rebel candidates -- Gualtieri, Ayala,  and Ugolini.    "We are still at the stage of `I have a family behind me,'  as  Leo Longanesi used to say. So if Gualtieri is not elected as a  deputy, thanks to the generosity of the PDS [Democratic Party of  the Left], he may still be able to become chairman of ARCI-Gay  [Italian Cultural and Recreational Association gay branch]," La  Malfa permitted himself to say, addressing the outgoing chairman  of the Atrocities Committee. La Malfa himself, the resurrected  son of Ugo, after a long and troubled political dance -- first  at arm's length with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi and then  arm-in-arm with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [PDS  Secretary] Occhetto -- decided instead to bring the PRI back to  the center of the political system. This decision split the PRI  in two at the end of a National Council session which, in terms  of insults and rifts -- including at the personal level -- acted  as a prelude to Giorgio II's latest Rome shindig.    "We know that La Malfa was capable of playing dirty. He  proved it at Forli," the rebel Gualtieri replied yesterday, with  equal asperity. He went on: "However, it is not I who am the  victim of the accusations, despite the coarse nature of the  attack; it is the party, already deeply wounded by his conduct  and irregularities. It makes me very sad," Gualtieri concluded,  "to see how someone such as he can bring division and hatred  among the Republicans after having damaged their image and their  name by allying with the corrupters of Italian politics."    Casini, formerly of the DC's [Christian Democratic Party]  Forlani faction, provided unexpected backing for Gualtieri: "La  Malfa's remarks are so coarse as to prompt my full solidarity."  But though the new "Berlusconite" is extending a proffered hand  to the rebel Gualtieri, there are still those within the PRI who  point to the difference of attitude and conduct between Casini  and Gualtieri: "Casini left the DC, saying that it disgusted  him, and eventually he did leave, albeit slamming the door  behind him. Gualtieri, however, still remains within the PRI,  even though its policy line disgusts him. But conscience will  never permit action against the party -- and here La Malfa is  entirely in the right."</p>

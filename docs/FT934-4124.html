			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Crackdown threatened for Jewish settlers: Violence grows between Israelis and Palestinians opposed to peace Israel's cabinet yesterday vowed to crack down on violence by Jewish settlers opposed to Israeli-Palestinian peace after the most violent week since the accord was signed in September. An increasing cycle of tit-for-tat violence by Israeli and Palestinian extremists, united in their desire to sabotage the peace process, has overshadowed the visit by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who yesterday vowed to 'energise' stalled peace talks between Syria and Israel. Over the weekend, Israeli settlers living around occupied Hebron shot into crowds of Palestinians, some of whom were throwing rocks. In another incident, a settler fired at an Arab taxi. At least six Palestinians were wounded in the weekend violence in Hebron and one died yesterday in hospital. In an apparent revenge attack, a Palestinian guerrilla belonging to the extremist Islamic Jihad group yesterday attacked a bus near Tel Aviv. One Israeli wounded in the battle later died in hospital and the guerrilla was shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Crowds of Israeli's gathered around the Palestinian's body shouting 'Death to Arabs'. Since the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord was signed in September at least 33 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed. Cabinet ministers, many of whom have criticised the government for not taking firmer measures, attacked the wave of violence by settlers, accusing them of terrorism, murder and other illegal acts to disrupt the peace process. Mr Moshe Shahal, police minister, and Gen Ehud Barak, army chief of staff, promised tougher measures to curb settler violence and the use of force against law-breakers. Other ministers threatened to review the right of settlers to carry weapons. At least five settlers involved in the weekend incidents in Hebron were arrested and police officials said they were looking for others. Mr Christopher, who flew to Damascus yesterday for talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, called for an end to the violence but made it clear that he was concentrating his Middle East shuttle diplomacy on trying to achieve a breakthrough in stalled talks between Israel and Syria over the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967. Mr Christopher, who hopes to carry messages between Damascus and Jerusalem, was expected to offer Mr Assad an improvement in ties with the US in return for concessions to Israel and a written Syrian clarification of the nature of peace with Israel it envisions. He flies to Amman today to meet King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation leader. Tomorrow he will hold a second round of meetings with Israeli leaders before considering a possible second trip to Damascus.</p>

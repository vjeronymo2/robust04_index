			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Bundesbank The French franc's recovery leaves the Bundesbank under less immediate pressure to cut interest rates. But it still has the unenviable task of coping with money market distortions created by intervention of up to DM100bn during the recent upheavals in the ERM. Money supply growth of 9 per cent and a crop of disappointing inflation figures from the Lander dictate an urgent attempt to drain liquidity from the money market. So it is no surprise that the bank has cancelled its regular securities repurchase arrangement for the second week running. But it also has to move carefully to avoid upsetting the exchange markets. Short-term rates have thus been left just under 9 per cent, well below the Lombard rate of 9.5 per cent. The mistake for the financial markets would be to read any policy significance into money market rates at these levels. More important is the systematic way in which liquidity is being drained - DM 28bn this week alone  -by the cancellation of the repurchase agreements. There is evidently a strong body of opinion on the Bundesbank council still prepared to take a tough line even in the face of a deteriorating domestic economy. The hawks' determination has almost certainly been reinforced by domestic criticism of the bank for supposedly bowing to political pressures in cutting rates on September 14. Nor is it necessarily in Bonn's interest for the Bundesbank to relax. That would only reduce pressure for a consensus on containing the fiscal deficit. Dwindling hopes of a rate cut this week doubtless contributed to falls of 4 per cent and 2.5 per cent in French and German equities yesterday, not to mention London's 41-point decline. But that is by no means the end of the story. Unless the Bundesbank moves, the mood on exchange markets will sooner or later grow violent again.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities advance in higher volume RELIEF THAT both the presidential election in the US and the Maastricht debate in the UK are now over and done with brought the buyers back into the London stock market yesterday. Gains in the dollar stocks were restrained by Wall Street's reluctance so far to make a definite response to President Clinton's success at the polls. But firmness in domestic issues signalled the stock market's belief that, now that its Maastricht proposals have won parliamentary support, Mr John Major's Conservative government will introduce measures to restimulate the UK economy. A batch of significant corporate developments also helped the equity market. The FT-SE Index gained 19.4 to 2,711.1. But the market made a slow start, dipping 10.3 in early trading as London shied away from the near 30-point fall overnight in New York's Dow Average. Share prices rallied quickly, however, when the stock index futures opened for business, and although trading volume was light at first, the Footsie had climbed by more than 21 points by midsession. London faltered a little in the afternoon and increased turnover towards the close indicated that some investors had taken the opportunity to cash in on the morning's profits. The New York stock market made another sluggish start but brightened later, to show a gain of 7.56 on the Dow as London closed for business. Strategists appear to have divided into two groups; those who have confidence in prospects for the re-stimulation of the economies of the leading industrial nations, and those who fear that the UK stock market has been overbought and could be due for a sharp correction. The two groups showed their hands yesterday in conflicting strategies in the equity and stock index futures markets. Among the international stocks, oil shares steadied from the depression caused by fears that President Clinton may tighten environmental requirements. However, there was only a mild response to trading results from British Petroleum. Attention was focused on the telecommunications sector by the news that BT (British Telecommunications) will sell its 22 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, of the US. Traders immediately began to seek a new target for BT in the cellular phone market. A firm dollar helped many overseas earning stocks. BAT Industries, which reported profits this week, came in for renewed speculative support, and ICI regained more of the ground lost over the past fortnight. But the multi-national drug stocks lagged behind the market as worries over the new US President's likely policies towards medical funding resurfaced. Glaxo, the front-runner of the sector, rallied in late dealings, however, as London grew more hopeful regarding the outlook on Wall Street. Among domestic stocks, there were gains in the retail and store sectors, which continued to look for early cuts in UK base rates. Banking shares also found buyers again after trading uneasily over the past few trading sessions. In late dealings, the stock market's hopes for recovery in the domestic economy were encouraged by the disclosure that UK car sales rose by 8 per cent in October, the first sign of hope from a struggling industry.</p>

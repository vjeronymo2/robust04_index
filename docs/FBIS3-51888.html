			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 25  January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item:    Lagoven, a subsidiary of Petroven, announced that output at  the Bachaquero Sur-Oeste oil field increased to 3,100 barrels  per day after four new wells were opened in the Lake Maracaibo  area, Zulia Department. The Lagoven engineering department  disclosed that the new wells had increased production by 2,300  barrels per day in 1993. In 1992, Lagoven discovered crude oil  that rated 45 API, which in its test phase incorporated 18  million barrels of reserve petroleum. The company intends to  drill seven new wells this year. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish  23 Jan 94 p 11)    Petroven announced a $0.50-per barrel increase in export  crude as well as other products, thus raising the price of  export crude to $12.20 per barrel. Petroven management  explained that the price increase was due to an increase in  demand brought about by colder weather in the United States and  Europe. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 18 Jan 94 p E-5)    The Finance Ministry Public Finances Department reported  that  Venezuela canceled $2.685 billion in foreign debt service during  fiscal year 1993. Of the total amount paid as part of the  country's foreign debt services, $2.11130 billion, or 78.62  percent, corresponds to unstructured debt, while $1.05868  billion, or 39.42 percent, corresponds to restructured debt.  The report also discloses that capital payments totalled $1.176  billion, while interest payments amounted to $1.508 billion.  Foreign debt balances during 1993 totaled $27.296 billion as  opposed to $27.08290 billion during 1992. (Caracas EL GLOBO in  Spanish 17 Jan 94 p 13)    Lagoven announced that crude oil and by-product exports  increased to 797,000 barrels per day in 1993. According to  Daniel Ramirez, manager of Lagoven Commerce and Supply  Department, the company was able to increase its exports by  37,000 barrels per day compared to 1992 exports. On the other  hand, export revenues fell during 1993 due to excess supply as a  result of OPEC and North Sea overproduction and greater than  expected exports to Russia.

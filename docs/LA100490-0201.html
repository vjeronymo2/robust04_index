			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: DRUG TESTS HELP YOUTHS STAY CLEAN  </P> <P> Football players at Mission Viejo High School never know who is going to be  tapped or when, but every day at least five of them have to report to the  principal's office, grab a plastic cup and head for the nearest restroom.  </P> <P> And within 24 hours, the verdict of the test for drugs and alcohol is mailed to  their parents.  </P> <P> For the past three years, such has been the routine for about 100 players who  voluntarily consent to confidential drug tests, the results of which are unseen  by their coaches, teachers and administrators, but readily available to their  parents.  </P> <P> This year, administrators have offered the program to 600 students, including  all members of sports teams, band, drill team, cheerleading and student  government. Close to 400 students have already signed up for the tests, which  are patterned after a program at Edison High School in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> With the random tests, students have an acceptable excuse for saying no -- they  might face a drug or alcohol test the next morning.  </P> <P> "If some big football stud or big man on campus says no, it might make someone  else say no also. If just three or four kids do that, it will be worth it,"  said football Coach Dave Clark, who started the Mission Viejo program.  </P> <P> The tests are done on campus by a private drug-testing firm for a $22 fee.  Because of a court decision against a high school in Banning, school  administrators are barred from requiring the tests or punishing students if  test results are positive.  </P> <P> Although the program has the support of the Football Boosters, the PTA and the  school district, many students won't sign up because they consider it a  violation of their civil rights.  </P> <P> "I'm against it," said cross-country runner Cameron Pedego. "It's invading your  privacy."  </P> <P> In three years, no football player has tested positive, according to the  testing company.  </P> <P> "Logic is just an organized way of going wrong with confidence." -- Anonymous  CHERYLANNE BEALER  </P></p>

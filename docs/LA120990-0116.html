			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANLEY'S FIVE TOUCHDOWNS POWER SAN JOSE STATE;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA BOWL: HE BREAKS THE SCORING RECORD FOR THE GAME AS THE SPARTANS  STORM PAST CENTRAL MICHIGAN, 48-24.  </P> <P> Sheldon Canley scored a California Bowl-record five touchdowns, one on a  59-yard run, as San Jose State scored a 48-24 victory over Central Michigan  Saturday.  </P> <P> The Big West-champion Spartans led, 26-10, in the third quarter when Canley  broke through the line, cut to the left and back to the center of the field  around several defenders for the touchdown that put the game out of reach.  </P> <P> Canley then broke the California Bowl record of three touchdowns on a five-yard  run and caught a touchdown pass from Ralph Martini early in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> San Jose Coach Terry Shea said opponents give Canley, a 5-foot-8 tailback  chosen as a third-team All-American by the Associated Press, "tremendous  respect . . . for his style and what he puts into the game. It's unparalleled  in college football today.  </P> <P> "Some backs may have more glamour and more stats, but not the heart," Shea  said.  </P> <P> The Chippewas (8-3-1), champions of the Mid-American Conference, got a bad  break when Canley swept around the right side for a five-yard touchdown on the  Spartans' first possession. Replays showed Canley stepped out of bounds on the  two, but the touchdown stood.  </P> <P> After a field goal early in the second quarter gave the Spartans (9-2-1) a 10-0  lead, Central Michigan's Jeff Bender passed to Ken Ealy running down the left  sideline for a 55-yard touchdown. Ealy had two more touchdown receptions in the  second half after the game was out of reach.  </P> <P> Canley took the opening kickoff but fumbled when he was hit by Todd Reynolds,  and the Chippewas recovered at the San Jose State 14. On fourth-and-one at the  five, Central Michigan went for the first down -- but Billy Smith was thrown  for a one-yard loss, and the momentum shifted to the Spartans.  </P> <P> Canley slipped around several defenders on the right side for a 22-yard  touchdown set up by a 40-yard pass from Martini to Gary Charlton later in the  second quarter for a 17-10 lead.  </P> <P> Canley finished with 164 yards in 23 carries and added 44 yards on five  receptions.  </P> <P> Martini finished with 27 completions in 36 attempts for 404 yards.  </P> <P> Bender passed for 220 yards on 14 completions in 25 attempts. Ealy caught seven  passes for 161 yards.  </P> <P> Central Michigan Coach Herb Deromedi said the Spartans were simply too fast.  </P> <P> "They're the fastest football team I've had the opportunity to coach against,"  he said.  </P> <P> "We worked extremely hard to get to this level. But on this given day, we just  played an outstanding team."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- Cuban Ambassador to  Korea Jose Ramon Rodriguez Varona hosted a reception Wednesday  on the occasion of the birthday of the great leader President  Kim Il-song.    Speaking at the reception, the ambassador said "the birthday  of the great leader of the Korean people Comrade Kim Il-song is  a significant holiday of all us."    He said the great leader of the Korean people Comrade Kim  Il-song gives a keen analysis of the international situation and  shapes correct lines and policies to cope with it. "We can be  well aware of his sagacity in view of his judgement and position  on the nuclear issue," he noted.    "It is our view and stand that the nuclear issue should be  solved in the interests of the Korean people and mankind," he  said, expressing the belief that Korea would be certainly  reunified in the near future.    Kim Yong-nam, Politburo member of the Central Committee of  the Workers' Party of Korea, vice-premier of the Administration  Council and foreign minister, spoke next.    He said the birth of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  was  a historical event for the Korean people to put an end to the  era of darkness for good and herald a new era, bright and  prosperous.    He said:    "Today the Cuban party and people are advancing under the  banner of socialism, smashing the blockade and interference of  the U.S. imperialists under the wise leadership of Comrade Fidel  Castro, supreme leader of the Cuban revolution. Our party and  people highly estimate the struggle of the party, government and  people of Cuba to defend the socialist cause and will as ever  express firm support and solidarity for the struggle of the  Cuban people."    He said that the friendly and cooperative relations between  the two peoples based on the particular intimacy forged between  the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Fidel Castro  Ruz, supreme leader of the Cuban revolution, will continue to  strengthen and develop without any vacillation in any storm and  stress in their common struggle to defend and glorify the cause  of socialism.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with General Saw Bo Mya, chairman of </F> the National Council and Karen National Union, by an  unidentified correspondent -- place, date not given]    [Text] [Correspondent] I would like to ask about the  cease-fire agreement with the SLORC [State Law and Order  Restoration Council]. General Mya, what would you like to say  about this?    [Mya] Our view is that we will not be able to achieve  internal peace through a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC.  The SLORC's cease-fire is a sham. The revolutionary forces in  Burma took up arms for political reasons; the SLORC is pursuing  a cease-fire, but this does not solve the political problem.  Internal peace can only be established when the political and  ethnic problems are solved. The SLORC is not doing this. It is  pursuing a cease-fire, but it is not talking about politics.  When political issues are raised, it insists categorically on  the surrender of arms. The KNU [Karen National Union] cannot  accept this.    Other ethnic groups made cease-fire agreements with the  SLORC  and held talks, but they were not allowed to raise political  questions; they stopped at the cease-fire issue. This does not  serve the interests of the ethnic groups' armed revolutionary  struggle. Furthermore, the SLORC does not wish to establish  internal peace; we have learned that it is pursuing this in  order to get foreign loans.    [Correspondent] The news on the outside is that the SLORC  and  Gen. Mya's KNU are attempting to hold cease-fire talks.  Considering the points you just mentioned, what reason would  you have for holding cease-fire talks?    [Mya] We will not discuss a cease-fire with the SLORC. We  will participate, however, if talks are held. If we participate  we will do so according to DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma]  policy; if we hold talks we will do so as the entire DAB. We  informed the SLORC, but it did not accept this. It said it will  only hold separate talks. We said we would hold separate talks,  but they had to be held abroad in accordance with DAB policy.  The SLORC did not accept this; it wanted to hold the talks in  Rangoon.    We insisted on holding talks abroad because we held talks  with the BSPP [Burma Socialist Program Party] on three previous  occasions without any success. On these previous occasions,  they said the political problem had to be solved politically and  insisted on surrender. Now the SLORC is doing the same. We  insisted on holding talks abroad because it insisted on  surrender without attempt to solve political problems by  political means. We want to hold talks abroad because we want  to establish genuine internal peace and discuss matters freely  as we wish. We want to work in a cordial manner in an attempt  to bring about internal peace. It is neither our desire nor  wish to obtain a cease-fire; we are striving for lasting peace.  The SLORC, however, does not accept this.    [Correspondent] I gather from what you just said that you  wish to hold talks with the SLORC not only on the limited matter  of a cease-fire, but on broad issues including political and  military matters and the issue of peace in the country. Is this  assessment correct?    [Mya] Yes. We want peace for the entire country and not just  peace between the Burmese and Karen. We want peace in the whole  of Burma.    [Correspondent] You said the SLORC rejected your suggestion.  According to one report we received, the SLORC verbally rejected  your proposal to hold talks in Thailand. Is this correct?    [Mya] That is correct. I met the military attache, but they  also did not accept this.    [Correspondent] There is a report that Khun Sa had proposed  an alliance with various ethnic groups, including the KNU. Is  this true?    [Mya] There was an offer from Khun Sa. Khun Sa had publicly  declared the formation of a republic. We sent some youths to  observe his declaration of a republic. We wanted to study the  extent of the Shan people's support and interest.    [Correspondent] The SLORC has alleged that representatives  of  the KNU, Mon, and Karenni met with Khun Sa to discuss a military  union. Would you like to comment on this?    [Mya] This is not true. It was not aimed at military union.  We wanted to observe whether they would fight after achieving  independence. As far as we observed, they will not fight the  SLORC, but will retaliate if the SLORC attacks them. That is  what we observed.    [Correspondent] That is all I would like to ask on the  current situation. Would you like to add anything, Gen. Bo Mya?    [Mya] The people of Burma are being oppressed and insulted  by  the SLORC. Other countries should consider this; they should  remember the suffering and hardship of the people of Burma and  come to our defense.    [Correspondent] I said I had no more questions, but I do  have  another question. Does the DAB remain as united as before?    [Mya] Yes. The DAB remains united, and there is much  understanding. Some organizations that already held talks with  the SLORC have become disappointed because the SLORC does as it  pleases, while some organizations are reestablishing contact  with us.    [Correspondent] The fourth anniversary of the general  elections in 27 May. What would you like to say in this regard?    [Mya] The people want genuine internal peace and full  democratic rights. They absolutely do not want the SLORC. The  people's judgment will eventually prevail.</p>

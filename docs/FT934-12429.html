			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Liberal party softens its approach to freer trade - Trade Pacts CANADA'S Liberal party has substantially softened its stand on North American free trade since the last general election in 1988. During that election, which they lost, the Liberals made abrogation of the US-Canada free trade pact a key plank of their policy platform. By this year's campaign, however, the Liberals had pledged only to seek renegotiation of some elements of the 1989 accord, the FTA, and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which includes Mexico. 'Abrogating trade agreements should only be a last resort if satisfactory changes cannot be negotiated,' the Liberals' campaign platform said. Nafta is due to come into force on January 1 1994. Diplomats and political observers predict that, with a little help from President Bill Clinton, the US Congress and the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, the Liberals will eventually sign on to Nafta in time to meet the implementation date. The outgoing Progressive Conservative government pushed Nafta enabling legislation through Parliament last summer. Only formal promulgation is required to put it into law. The Liberals pledged in the campaign to seek four specific 'improvements' to the FTA and Nafta: a subsidies code, an anti-dumping code, a more effective dispute settlement mechanism, and the same protection for Canadian energy producers as is envisaged for Mexico. Some Liberal concerns would be addressed if the Uruguay Round is successfully wrapped up this year. The previous Conservative government tried but failed to negotiate a subsidies package in the 1989 FTA. Anti-Nafta pressure on Mr Chretien would also be eased if the US Congress ratifies Nafta. Votes are scheduled in the Senate and the House of Representatives next month. On other issues, diplomats predict that Ottawa and Washington will find a face-saving formula which will enable Mr Chretien to point out that his concerns are being met, and allow him to proceed with implementation of Nafta. A visit to Washington will be among the new prime minister's early priorities. President Clinton said yesterday he did not expect the election to have an impact on Nafta. The results of the election should also make it easier for Mr Chretien to press ahead with Nafta. The left-leaning New Democratic Party, the only parliamentary group unambiguously opposed to Nafta, ended up with only eight seats in the House of Commons. The two regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform party, which will form the bulk of the opposition, generally favour the free trade agreements. Even within the Liberal party itself, support for free trade is more vocal and opposition more muted than it was five years ago.</p>

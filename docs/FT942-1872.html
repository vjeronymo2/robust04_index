			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Innovation index would help rate R&amp;D success Sir, Your feature, 'Technology: R&amp;D Scoreboard' (June 17) is a welcome recognition of the importance of technology in underpinning the wealth-creation process. As you also recognise, R&amp;D is only one of the contributors to a company's competitiveness. Without attention to the whole range of innovation indicators - including capital investment, market research and training - R&amp;D on its own can be misleading. Indeed, the latest Confederation of British Industry/Natwest Innovation Trends Survey, weighted to reflect the performance of all sectors, indicates a reduction in the amount of expenditure, not an increase, as the R&amp;D scoreboard suggests. Differing time-frames can possibly explain this apparent contradiction, and certainly trends survey predictions for the next 12 months are more bullish. But in the accompanying interview with Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, it is acknowledged that it is the quality of the output from innovation investment in terms of profitable products that counts; and this points to the need for an innovation index to assess outcomes. The CBI/Natwest survey has influenced much of the thinking behind the development of such an index, not least by providing the database of companies for the joint CBI/Department of Trade and Industry activity on best practice. The survey will help place individual company performance in the context of its related sector. The indicators need to be developed in parallel and we are in close touch with the DTI on the way forward.

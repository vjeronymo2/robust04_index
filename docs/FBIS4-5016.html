			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between Yoshiaki Kobayashi, professor at Keio </F> University; Takao Iwami, MAINICHI SHIMBUN special editorial  staff member; and Yasuhiro Tase, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN editorial  staff member; place and date not given]    [Text] [Iwami] The first act of political realignment  began with the establishment of a coalition government last  summer; now the second act has begun. The commonality between  the two is that the coalition is on the offensive and the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is entirely on the defensive.  However, there is also a decisive difference between the two  acts. In the first act, the coalition reaped the fruits of  capturing power; in the second, it is trying to alter those  fruits. In that sense, although the coalition parties are on  the offensive, their unity is on the decline and they will have  considerable difficulty in conducting state affairs.    The Ichi-Ichi [Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, leaders of  Shinseito and Komeito] lineup continues to pursue a positive,  aggressive strategy; Hosokawa seems to be taking part in it,  thus accelerating the political tempo. The confrontation with  Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura will be the first step. In the  end the Ichi-Ichi lineup, in alliance with Hosokawa, might go so  far as to form a new new party [shin shinto].    [Kobayashi] Until the election last year, Hosokawa,  Takemura, and Ozawa had all been advocates of a two-party  system. However, the substance was different: The Ichi-Ichi  lineup had favored a two-party system comprising the LDP and a  new conservative party; Hosokawa-Takemura had favored a union of  Shinseito and Komeito as well as a union of the Japan New Party  [JNP] and Sakigake, and had wanted the LDP and the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to join either of the two  unions. However, since becoming prime minister Hosokawa has  shifted his stance to the Ichi-Ichi lineup. Therefore, it has  become impossible for Takemura to take the initiative.    Shinseito and Komeito want to be the ruling parties again.  There are two conditions for this: One is that the LDP should  not have a one-party majority in the next general election, and  the other is that there should not be a coalition government  comprising the LDP and other parties. For this purpose, the  current coalition parties must unite under the single seat  constituency system as much as possible. As things stand, there  is a possibility that a tripolar structure will come into being:  a group comprising Shinseito, Komeito, and part of the JNP; a  group comprising Sakigake, the SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP], and part of the JNP; and the LDP. Then there is a  possibility that a coalition government consisting of the LDP  plus a Sakigake union will come into being. This is what the  Ichi-Ichi lineup dreads the most.    Added to this, there is the problem of candidate  adjustments.  There is an 11-member single-seat constituency district for 14  incumbent coalition members, so some incumbents will have to  change to the proportional representation system. However, even  if elections are held on the basis of "the candidates of party A  for the single-seat constituency system and the candidates of  party B for the proportional representation system," there is no  knowing how many votes for party A of the single-seat  constituency system will go to party B of the proportional  representation system. Under certain circumstances, candidates  who have changed over to the proportional representation system  will end in grief. Then a new new party will surely be  preferable.  <H5>  The Rupture of the Hosokawa-Takemura Combination </H5>   [Tase] The biporlarization of the coalition parties now in  progress comes not so much from confrontation due to the  difference of lines and policies as from emotional  confrontation--in effect, a power struggle. Hosokawa's  character has a lot to do with that. Hosokawa is the type who  severs connections with his close friends in an instant. There  is no knowing how long Hosokawa's honeymoon with the Ichi-Ichi  combination will last.    Therefore, since the political situation will progress for  the time being based on individual emotions, it is impossible to  determine what will happen in the future.    However, it is now impossible to repair the rupture in  relations between Hosokawa and Takemura. We may take this as an  established fact.    [Iwami] The Ichi-Ichi lineup wants to discard Takemura as  soon as possible. That policy was decided on much earlier. The  decision was made when the national welfare tax caused trouble;  it may even have been made prior to that.    Tase's indication that there exists an emotional  confrontation is certainly true, but the confrontation between  the two men is rooted in their differences as regards political  ideas and methods. We did not know what Hosokawa would do in  this connection, but that has become clear now. Hosokawa will  go along with the Ichi-Ichi lineup.    [Tase] However, his move is not a calculated one. If you  say that is the characteristic of a lord, that is the end of it;  but nobody knows his "outlook on the state" or his "line." What  Ozawa is going to do and what Hosokawa has said are  contradictory. Concerning the election system, Hosokawa has been  advocating the medium-constituency plural ballot system, has he  not?    Strictly speaking, he may have no principles.    [Iwami] Anyway, the tripolar structure has been consolidated  in nine out of 10 cases. Concerning the new new party advocated  by the Ichi-Ichi lineup, Secretary General Ichikawa has begun  saying Hosokawa will be its president. If we tentatively call  it the Hosokawa party, it is likely the Takamura party will come  into being. The Kono party will also remain. The next election  will be contested by these three parties.    [Kobayashi] Contrary to expectation, the Kono party may have  few dropouts. Since the number of small electoral districts has  been increased to 300, the Kono party's surplus Diet members  have considerably decreased in number.    The problem is the Takemura party. Since this party will  unite as an anti-Hosokawa party, it will include not only those  members of the SDPJ who have considerable inclination toward the  left, but also Sakigake members who have considerable  inclination toward the LDP. If the Takemura party is challenged  to policy discussions by the opposing parties, to what extent  can it keep itself united?    [Iwami] However, the SDPJ, the JNP, and all the other  parties are going to split. The Takemura party will establish  its own ideals and will somehow survive, even if its union is  far from perfect. Takemura is trying to differentiate himself  from Ozawa by publishing a book in opposition to Ozawa's. It is  the LDP that is uncertain, and it may not be able to  differentiate itself from the Takemura party.    [Kobayashi] Another point is what kind of move will be made  by the Diet members of the Japan New Party. There are some  individual electoral districts in which the Japan New Party will  have to compete with Sakigake. These districts will be captured  by the Hosokawa party. Conversely, Sakigake will have to  compete with Shinseito in some districts, and these districts  may be captured by the Takemura party.    [Tase] There is no knowing what Representative Secretary  Sonoda will do.    [Iwami] That being the case, in principle the Hosokawa party  will try to win Diet members to its side one by one. The  problem is the left faction of the SDPJ. During his address in  Nagoya, Takemura extended his tolerance limit so as to embrace  Gotoda and Yokomichi. Even the Hosokawa party is capable of  embracing Michio Watanabe and Tomiichi Murayama. The party can  try to bring members to its side one by one.    [Tase] Any combination is possible depending upon the  manner of adjustment of the ruling parties' candidates; the  formulation of doctrines can wait.    [Kobayashi] There is little possibility of there being  policy disputes. In the U.S. House and Senate elections, there  are few electoral districts where the policies of the Democratic  and Republican candidates are different. In Japan, it is also  unlikely that substantial differences will emerge no matter  which side wins.  <H5>  The Leftist Faction of the SDPJ Has No Place To Go </H5>   [Iwami] However, this time the basic policies of each party  will become more clear than those of the current coalition  government, otherwise political realignment is meaningless. In  that case, those who cannot follow will be excluded. It is  unlikely the left faction of the SDPJ will join the new new  party. Since it is highly ideological to advocate the  principles of "a major power" or of "a small but brilliant  country," peacekeeping operations may come to the surface again  as one of the indices. Hosokawa's new party, or Ozawa, has a  rather clear view on such operations. On the other hand,  Takemura is against them, and Kono leans towards Takemura.    [Kobayashi] There are many Sakigake members within the  Takemura party who can accept the left faction of the SDPJ, but  DSP members will not.    [Iwami] Then the pure left faction of the SDPJ will have no  place to go. It may pursue its own lines, but there are those  in the left faction who are not strict about principles.    [Tase] There are still some active members in it.    [Iwami] Ozawa says there will be "two-party party and other  parties," but I think there will be a three-party party and  other parties.    [Kobayashi] In actual elections, both the LDP and Hosokawa  party have firm support organizations. Who will conduct  elections for the Takemura party? Sakigake aside, the SDPJ will  have to depend on its left faction.    [Tase] According to opinion polls, Takemura enjoys  considerable popularity. It is unthinkable that Hosokawa's  approval rating will continue, but the popularity of Takemura  may continue for a fairly long time among a public who are fed  up with the high-handedness of the Ichi-Ichi lineup. Then  Takemura will fare well in elections.    [Iwami] I am of the same opinion.    [Tase] Some say Takemura is the first Vulcanian [Vulcan is  the god of fire and metalworking in Roman mythology] politician  since Miki.    [Iwami] He has Vulcanian characteristics. I have a feeling  he is a political type who is large in scale and whom we have  not encountered for some time. There is something vague about  Hosokawa, but Takemura is well-defined. He seems to be clear,  fresh, and fit. However, being attacked from both sides by the  Hosokawa and Kono parties, he will not attain enormous power.    What makes the matter complicated is that Kono and Takemura  overlap. Therefore, those who are thinking of leaving the LDP  find it difficult to say they are going to join the Takemura  party because of the difference in ideas. The focal point of  political realignment is how many members switch over to  Hosokawa and Takemura from the LDP. As Kobayashi says, the  number may be smaller than expected because the number of small  electoral districts was increased to 300.    [Tase] There are already those who have been left out of  selection in the adjustments to the fielding of candidates now  being conducted by the LDP. Since such people are close to  Takemura, they are watching his moves.    [Kobayashi] The question is: What are these people actually  going to do? Are they going to join the Hosokawa party, or are  they going to be independent? However, under this tripolar  structure, the form of government after elections is generally  clear: The coalition of the Takemura party and the Kono party  is more likely than the coalition of Takemura and Hosokawa.    [Iwami] That is when each of the three parties is unable to  hold a majority.    [Kobayashi] That is right. On the other hand, a coalition of  the Kono party and the Hosokawa party will be very difficult.  The Hosokawa party cannot afford to slip down to an opposition  party in full knowledge of the situation; therefore I think it  is likely that a chaotic situation will occur after all: The  Hosokawa party will ultimately establish a coalition government  again through union with not three, but five or six parties  other than the Takemura party and the Kono party.    [Iwami] Only the Kono party and the Hosokawa party can put  up candidates for all 300 electoral districts; the Takemura  party will lag behind them. Then the question arises: Which  one of the two will win? It is possible that one of the two  will win a majority. Then there should be a one-party  administration; otherwise, there will be a coalition government  of the Kono party and the Takemura party, as Mr. Kobayashi says.    [Kobayashi] Therefore the division of electoral districts is  important. Since Shinseito, the JNP, and Sakigake will compete  especially hard in urban areas, the JNP will have to join either  the Hosokawa party or the Takemura party, depending upon the  method of division. The division of electoral districts itself  is a power struggle. Will a report of the eighth Election  System Council concerning the division of electoral districts be  accepted, or will there be a different division? The method of  division will decide the outcome of 40 out of 300 districts.    [Tase] The question is: Who in the ruling parties will take  the initiative?    [Kobayashi] It will be easy for the ruling parties to make  adjustments in the fielding of candidates if the ruling parties  divide into the Hosokawa party and the Takemura party;  otherwise, these two parties will have to compete throughout the  urban areas. The objective is to bring the heads of local  governments to one side. When 300 electoral districts are  allocated, blank districts will inevitably come into being,  where a big city becomes a small electoral district, as it is;  therefore, victory or defeat is a matter of which camp the mayor  belongs to -- whether he leans toward the Hosokawa party or the  Takemura party.    [Iwami] However, the future trend will be decided by the  rise and fall of the popularity of Hosokawa and Takemura. Is  Hosokawa's popularity at its height now?  <H5>  The Possibility of a Takemura Cabinet </H5>   [Kobayashi] According to a survey conducted by Fuji TV's  "Report 2001," 60 percent approved of Hosokawa and 30 percent  disapproved of him. From the time the national welfare tax  became troublesome, Hosokawa's disapproval rating has increased  a little, while Takemura's strong point is that he has no  enemies.    The LDP side may be relieved at the rupture in relations  between Hosokawa and Takemura. If the two men are united, the  LDP will have no good move to make. However, if they are  divided, the LDP will have a good chance to form a coalition  with the LDP as leader.    [Iwami] This is going to be the first election under the  single-member constituency system. If the Hosokawa party holds  the advantage in each electoral district, members of the LDP may  switch to the Hosokawa party in avalanche-like fashion.    [Kobayashi] That is because the effects of election  forecasts of the single-member constituency system are  diametrically opposite those of the medium constituency system.  Under the medium constituency system, those who were said to  have an advantage over others often lost their elections. Under  the single-member constituency system, however, the forecast  that the chances that a candidate will succeed are 55:45 will  shift immediately to 90:10. To the support groups and the  influential people of the district, it does not matter which  party wins. Since there is only one link between the district  and the center, the support groups and the influential people  will be "killed" if they back the wrong horse.    [Tase] The LDP has no good candidates now. If Takemura  makes his attitude clear by parting with Hosokawa, a  considerable number of people in the LDP will be willing to form  a coalition with Takemura as prime minister. In that case, the  Takemura party and the LDP will be united instantly, not in the  form of Takemura party's returning to the LDP, but in the form  of a coalition.    [Iwami] On the other hand, it is doubtful whether today's  LDP has such centripetal force and mobility.    [Tase] Today's LDP is not what it used to be in that the  only active members are young ones who were elected three times  or less. The other day I talked to a young member who said:  "Mr. Gotoda telephones me, asking: `What is going on?'" This  was unthinkable in former times. Members who were elected seven  times or more were still not given any information. Therefore,  there is no knowing what will happen in the LDP.    As far as centripetal force is concerned, the Kono and Mori  establishment is not functioning at all, which is not a  surprise. The reason that the LDP seemed to have functioned well  so far is that the Keiseikai, the largest faction, had run the  whole thing through a kind of reign of terror. Now that the  central force of the Keiseikai has disbanded and the Keiseikai  is leaving the Sabokaikan Building, it is impossible for the LDP  to have centripetal force. The president and the three key  officials of the LDP are almost amateurish in their management  of the party. Stranded in the stream of the times, the best they  can do is dither.    I do not think that the chiefs of factions are giving  gratuities to their faction members at year's end any more.  Diet members are going Dutch at their parties.    [Iwami] The top-ranking leaders of the LDP used to rule  through skillful factional maneuvering inside the party, but now  that the factions are gone, they are at a loss what to do. They  are in a state of weightlessness. I do not think that Kono will  be able to find a new method of maneuvering, since there are  neither responses nor clues. In that respect, we can say that  the LDP is already in a state of dissolution. However, in the  provinces, the local organizations of the LDP are still the  strongest and the most massive. I think that the chairman of  the prefectural assembly of every prefecture still belongs to  the LDP. Therefore, the LDP is strong when it comes to  elections.  <H5>  The "Japan-U.S. Relationship" and the "Economy" Are the Key </H5> Points    [Tase] To change the subject, if the Hosokawa administration  were to collapse, that would be due to "the relationship between  Japan and the United States" and "the economy." The recent  rupture of the Hosokawa-Clinton talks is a serious matter.  "Mature relationship," indeed! That is a fiasco of the  administration. We should not make light of the United States.  It is no use to have a conference by summoning officials in a  hurry at this belated time. Unless the administration gives  definite directions to the bureaucrats, the situation will  deteriorate further. However, the Hosokawa administration does  not have such leadership. The matter can never be solved  Hosokawa-style -- "I have had them discussing the matter."    [Kobayashi] It is on Europe that the Hosokawa  administration is placing its hopes. Japan thinks that Europe  will side with it if it appeals to GATT. The Japanese  Government seems to be hoping for Europe's help because the  entry of U.S.-made products into Japan means a cut in the  imports of European products that have entered until now.  However, even if Japan's appeal to GATT is successful, Europe  will enter into partnership with the United States thereafter.  Europe and the United States comprise a community bound  together by common interests regarding the opening of Japan's  markets. The United States is exercising its political power to  the full for the persuasion of European countries. Japan does  not have enough power to compete with the international  political power of the United States.    [Tase] The observation of the recent negotiations of the  officials shows that the rupture occurred at the last moment.  Such a situation existed many times in past negotiations  between Japan and the United States. However, past negotiations  had been narrowly saved through a top-down approach. The  Hosokawa administration allowed the rupture to happen without  trying to do anything to prevent it. Such an approach is  impermissible even though Hosokawa is a novice at diplomacy.    [Kobayashi] It is the United Stats that gained the most due  to the change of administration in Japan. The United States had  been making concessions when Japan asked a question -- "Is it  acceptable for Japan to be socialized?" -- which was raised when  something happened to the one-party rule of the LDP. This time,  however, there is no possibility of a socialist government, and  if you do not like the Hosokawa administration, you can recall  the government of the LDP. This is advantageous to the United  States. The United States could not possibly make a concession  to Japan owing to the circumstances surrounding the Clinton  administration in the United States. However, the Hosokawa  administration failed to reach a correct understanding of the  situation. What was the current administration's understanding  of the change of the U.S. ambassador to Japan from Armacost to  Mondale? With the coming of Ambassador Mondale, the moves of  the U.S. Embassy have become very political, have they not?    [Tase] That is because Mondale is a lawyer. His way of  thinking is similar to that of a group of lawyers who work with  Mickey Kantor as the group's axis. Rendering great service to  their clients during their tenure of office is their way of  doing things. However, Japanese politics is not ready to cope  with the situation. It is natural for Japan and the United  States to clash with each other because the Hosokawa  administration lacks the ability to play the part which had been  played by the former administration -- add two things and divide  by two to get an average.    [Iwami] Takemura and others had been excluded from the inner  circle of the Hosokawa administration, and this time there was  no one around Hosokawa who could teach him the rudiments of  summit diplomacy.    [Tase] The dispatch of special envoy Kiuchi was also a  fiasco. The U.S. side was dumfounded because he visited the  United States not to bring any new proposals but only to pay a  courtesy call.    [Iwami] But the reports of the media were terrible. The  next day's newspapers praised Hosokawa in chorus, saying "the  age of the mature relationship between Japan and the United  States has come." I could not believe my own eyes and said to  myself, "What is the meaning of all of this?"    [Tase] I had been boarding together with the brains of the  Clinton administration until yesterday. If Japan's perception  of the situation is the same as theirs, it will lead to grave  consequences. The brain trusters themselves do not think that  the setting of numerical targets is a smart thing to do.  However, they say that Japan should not have broken off the  negotiations just because of that.    [Iwami] Japan's response was that the rupture of the  negotiations was a great achievement on the part of Japan.    [Tase] The Hosokawa administration is like the Konoe  cabinet, which refused to deal with the Nanking government.    At present Japan is producing an atmosphere in which people  who attach great importance to good relations between Japan and  the United States have to keep a somewhat low profile. They are  being overwhelmed by the opinions which attach great importance  to Asia. I think that this is really a dangerous omen. Despite  that, however, Hosokawa is being evaluated highly. In short, he  is not criticized, no matter how badly he manages national  affairs. I can hardly understand that.    [Kobayashi] For one thing, the media also is responsible for  that. With the establishment of the Hosokawa administration,  discussions on election systems are conducted only within the  framework of the heiretsu system. The media almost always  refuses to carry articles which point out problems with the  heiretsu system. Even monthly magazines refuse to carry articles  critical of the system.    [Iwami] In the first place, it was a mistake for leaders of  newspaper publishing companies to become members of government  committees.    [Tase] Hosokawa is never criticized for the absence of  measures to boost the economy. This is also strange.    [Kobayashi] Japan is a unique in that its government is  rarely criticized for the country's recession. It was at the  time of the oil shocks that a return to conservatism was  advocated. There are two theories for that: one is that public  opinion had it that only the LDP could solve the problem of  recession; the other is the time- lag theory. This theory  explains holds that consumers have a real sense that recession  exists only after a certain period of time has elapsed. This is  said to be the most likely reason.  <H5>  "The Opinion That Hosokawa Is Not To Blame" Is Rampant </H5>   [Tase] Which theory explains the current situation?    [Kobayashi] Neither theory can explain the current  situation. Voters still have a great distrust of LDP government.  It may be that such a level of misgovernment by Hosokawa is not  enough to dispel that distrust.    [Tase] I have another idea. I think that the people believe  that the bureaucrats, and not Hosokawa, are responsible for the  recession.    [Iwami] It may be that Ozawa's consistent claim still has  persuasive power: It is because of the misgovernemnt of the LDP  that the current government cannot take drastic measures  regarding Japan-U.S. relations and the recession. At first, the  business community was opposed to Ozawa's claim that political  reform should have priority over the budget, even if it is  carried forward to the following year, but it approved his claim  afterward. That persuasive power is still existent. In short,  it says that government by the LDP is to blame and that the  Hosokawa administration is trying to change that. Therefore, no  matter what the Hosokawa administration does, it is no longer  held responsible.    In weighing government by professionals against government  by  amateurs, public opinion still bets on government by amateurs.    [Kobayashi] The current administration has worsened the  recession not by doing something about it, but by doing nothing  about it. Since it does nothing, it is not held responsible.  That is the way it looks.    [Tase] That is right. The downfall of a government due to  policy occurs when it tries to implement something -- like  Thatcher, who initiated a poll tax. The recent national welfare  tax is a case in point.    [Iwami] The Hosokawa administration has been working out  a barrage of policies. It is advocating themes one after  another without pause. The Ichi-Ichi lineup is impatient, and  it seems that Hosokawa himself is also very impatient. He may  be obsessed that his administration will not last unless he  works out policies one after another. There is a growing voice  in Nagata-cho that the dissolution of the Diet will take place  next year, but I have a feeling that he will decide on an early  dissolution. As soon as a new new party is formed and electoral  districts are decided on, there will be a dissolution.    [Kobayashi] I think that there may be an early dissolution,  contrary to expectations. After the passage of a political  reform bill, a rumor spread at once that the dissolution would  be late. I think that was rather intentional. New political  parties, like the Hosokawa party and the Takemura party, will  have an advantage when elections are held immediately after the  formation of parties. New parties will naturally be born when  electoral districts are decided on. Then an early dissolution  is quite possible.    [Iwami] The political situation will not be quiet for the  time being. We must keep a constant eye on the political  situation.</p>

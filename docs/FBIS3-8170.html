The congress re-elected Montenegrin President Momir  Bulatovic  as president of the party. Closing the two-day gathering of 218  delegates, Bulatovic emphasised the importance of cherishing and  promoting the state of Montenegro which, together with Serbia,  forms Yugoslavia, and said that nobody had the right to break  these states. It is not in Montenegro's interest to form a  state only with Serbia, "our vital interests lie also in the  direction of Herzegovina, and we have close historical and  economic ties also with the Bosnian Serb republic and the  Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.)" said Bulatovic.    The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by the local Serbs in  those  parts within the arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia  where they are the majority population, in response to Croatia's  violent secession from former Yugoslavia and trampling on their  rights.    In 1992, local Serbs in the breakaway Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, too, formed their Bosnian Serb republic in  their ancestral ethnic lands.    Bulatovic said that Montenegro was supporting and would  continue to do so the struggle of the Serb people outside  Yugoslavia for freedom, dignity and equality, but added that it  would continue to oppose "the extreme nationalism which has  grown root under the influence of civil war, radically  confronted ideologies and narrow national interests."    He stressed that Moslems in Montenegro must by no means be  equated with the militant fundamentalists in the Bosnian Moslem  leadership, and that the Albanians who advocate secessionism and  violent methods of its achievement were few in the republic.    Bulatovic said that there must be no animosity towards  Croats  in Montenegro, because "we have never waged war on the Croatian  people, but on the proponents of the extremist greater-national  ideology" in Croatia.    He said that Montenegro had been the first to "suggest to a  wondering Europe the idea of a normalisation of relations among  the former Yugoslav republics," and that Montenegro "has no  reason for a confrontation with, for instance, Macedonia or  Slovenia."</p>

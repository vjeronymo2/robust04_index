			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: A promising merger that crosses different cultures - The Fit At first sight, SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley are like chalk and cheese: the former an understated UK merchant bank, the latter a powerful Wall Street investment house. Yet, while the two houses might find it challenging to reconcile their sharply differing corporate cultures, they do have some traits in common - including a certain blue-blooded history - and many aspects of their businesses are complementary. In particular, Warburg has a very modest presence in the US capital markets, while Morgan Stanley is among the leading Wall Street houses. It is a prominent force in all areas of US activity - equities, bonds and corporate finance - and is also a leading player in global fixed-income, foreign exchange and commodities. In Europe, Morgan Stanley has been building up a sizeable presence from its London base. but it would benefit from Warburg's strong corporate client list and trading position in the UK and on the continent. In the UK, in particular, Warburg enjoys one of the biggest and most prestigious lists of clients for corporate advisory work. Despite Morgan's European expertise in equity research and cross-border takeovers, it has made little headway in UK corporate finance and distribution, observers say. A merger could put the banks at the top of the cross-border mergers and acquisitions league table. According to Securities Data, Morgan Stanley ranked second in the year to date, with deals worth Dollars 77.8bn, while Warburg was in 10th tenth place at Dollars 19bn. The combined bank would also be a powerful force in the fast-growing area of international equities issuance. So far this year Morgan Stanley ranked third in the world, with bookrunning mandates worth Dollars 2.9bn, while SG Warburg ranked fifth, with bookrunning mandates of Dollars 2.3bn. The jewel in Warburg's crown is Mercury Asset Management, the highly profitable fund management arm, of which it owns 75 per cent. Here too the banks are complementary: Warburg is strongest in UK/European equity and international fixed-income investment, while Morgan Stanley shines in US and emerging market investing. The main area of overlap between the two is in the Far East, where both companies are significant players in the primary equity markets. There is also likely to be substantial duplication of resources on the research side of the business, particularly in Europe. Both houses have a reputation for excellent investment research, especially in equities. This year, Warburg topped the closely-followed Extel league table of UK-based analysts for the fourth year running, Morgan Stanley was in eleventh place, but also boasts several highly regarded equity analysts in London. In the US, the 1994 survey of US brokerage analysts by Institutional Investor magazine ranked Morgan Stanley sixth best, a slight slip from its fifth ranking last year. Probably its best-known analyst is emerging markets strategist Barton Biggs, whose bullish stance on China last year prompted a remarkable surge in Hong Kong share prices. The risk of merging two high-powered research teams is that some of the most highly-rated analysts may feel eclipsed by the competition - and leave. 'You can only have a limited number of prima donnas at any one bank,' says one analyst. Indeed, merging two institutions with such distinct cultures could be a painful and complicated process. 'You've got to do a lot of smoothing: strategies, technology, and, most importantly, people's egos,' says one banker. This bears the risk of demoralising staff, leading to defections. 'The best people often leave when companies undergo such radical overhauls,' he says.  -------------------------------------------------------- How the banks compare  -------------------------------------------------------- GLOBAL MERGERS  -------------------------------------------------------- Adviser                      Value      Market   Deals                          (Dollars bn)  share (%)  -------------------------------------------------------- Goldman, Sachs               85.65      14.0      145 Morgan Stanley               77.78      12.7      117 Merrill Lynch                56.86       9.3      121 CS Fst Boston/Cred Suisse    48.86       8.0      129 Lehman Bros                  46.43       7.6      124 Salomon Bros                 46.36       7.6       92 Lazard House                 35.04       5.7       79 JP Morgan                   25.44       4.2       77 Smith Barney                 22.12       3.6       65 SG Warburg                  19.12       3.1       70  -------------------------------------------------------- EUROBONDS  -------------------------------------------------------- Bookrunner                    Amnt       Market    Issues                            (Dollars bn) share (%)  -------------------------------------------------------- Merrill Lynch                 33.86       8.2        161 Cred Suisse/CS Fst Boston     27.33       6.6        144 Goldman, Sachs                21.76       5.2         91 Nomura                        20.86       5.0        186 Swiss Bank Corporation        20.20       4.9        141 Union Bank of Switzerland     16.67       4.0         78 Lehman Bros                   16.54       4.0         90 Morgan Stanley                16.24       3.9         95 JP Morgan                    15.74       3.8         88 Daiwa Securities              14.20       3.4         84 SG Warburg is placed 21st with Dollars 4.9bn of deals  -------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL EQUITY ISSUES*  -------------------------------------------------------- Bookrunner                    Amnt       Market    Issues                            (Dollars bn) share (%)  -------------------------------------------------------- Goldman, Sachs                 6.17      14.3         58 Merrill Lynch                  4.68      10.8         64 Morgan Stanley                 2.93       6.9         44 Banque Paribas                 2.77       6.4         17 SG Warburg                    2.26       5.2         22 Lehman Bros                    2.12       4.9         35 Cred Suisse/CS Fst Boston      2.09       4.8         33 Barclays Bank                  2.08       4.8         21 Robert Fleming                 1.52       3.5         12 Deutsche Bank                  1.27       2.9          6 Note: Equities sold outside company's country of domicile  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: Securities Data  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Continuing battle for grain sales forecast THE CHRONIC financial difficulties faced by China and Russia will continue to dog the international grain markets in 1993-94, according to the latest report from the International Wheat Council. The two countries are the main outlets for grain exporters, who are likely to compete vigorously for sales, the IWC suggests. China is reported to have had buying teams in the big exporting countries, 'but no new sales were apparent', says the report. 'Reported foreign exchange shortages have supplemented China's usual aggressive pursuit of lower prices.' Russia, which has amassed large debts for earlier shipments, 'will depend on new financing initiatives to meet its import needs in 1993-94'. World wheat trade fell by 4m tonnes to 103m tonnes in the year to the end of June. Chinese imports were halved, while those to the former Soviet Union fell by less than expected. However, these declines were offset by increased imports to India, Africa and eastern Europe, while demand for weather-damaged wheat for animal feed was strong. Next year demand growth in many developing countries - such as Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines - will continue to underpin world wheat trade, the report predicts. The IWC is forecasting wheat production for 1993-94 at 560m tonnes, slightly below last year but still the third biggest on record.</p>

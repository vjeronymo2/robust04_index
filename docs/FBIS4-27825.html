			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-ho,  vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social  Democratic Party, released a statement today urging the  political parties of South Korea to respond to the proposal for  the convocation of a national conference at an early date. He  said the convocation of the conference on the occasion of August  15 this year with one year away from the 50th anniversary of the  country's liberation, is the most positive and realistic measure  for sidestepping the difficulties at present and opening a way  out for the nation.    He accused the South Korean authorities of taking a negative  stand toward the proposal, alleging that it is "a peaceful  offensive," and, at the same time, keeping political parties,  organizations and individual figures of South Korea from  responding to the convocation of the conference.    The statement says:    "The political parties in the North and the South, which are  responsible for the destiny of the nation and the prospect of  the country, are obliged to play their role in the convocation  of a national conference to remove the danger of a nuclear war  and achieve national reunification in the '90s with concerted  efforts.    "At a time when scholars, men of the press, religionists,  women and even students in the North and the South want to meet  with each other for reunification and are striving to realize  dialogue for reunification, not caring for their personal  safety, it can never be justified on all accounts that the  political parties shun contacts. And it means avoiding their  responsibility for the nation that they give each other a wide  berth, putting too much stress on ideology and idea.    "The Korean Social Democratic Party, whose main political  idea is independence, sovereignty, democracy, peace and defense  of human rights, urges early bilateral contacts with political  parties of South Korea to discuss the convocation of a national  conference, considering it is the most positive and realistic  measure for overcoming the difficulties at present and opening a  way out for the nation."    The statement expresses the hope that contacts with  political  parties of South Korea will be held in Pyongyang, Seoul,  Panmunjom or any other place in early June.</p>

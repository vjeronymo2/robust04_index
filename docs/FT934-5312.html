			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (2): The capitalist spirit is unleashed - Despite impressive gains, sustaining economic growth will be hard It would be a brave person, and probably foolish, to deny that Vietnam will be among the world's fastest growing economies over the next few years. The government's 1986 decision to abandon the command economy has unleashed the country's capitalist spirit. While Vietnam remains extremely poor - the government estimates annual per capita income at Dollars 220 - growth in gross domestic product between 1989 and 1992 averaged 7 per cent. Growth is likely to be sustained this year and rise to more than 8 per cent in 1994. The move toward a market economy has profoundly affected the lives of Vietnam's 70m people. More than 1m workers and soldiers have been removed from the public sector and over a third of the country's 12,000 state enterprises have been closed or merged. Instead of experiencing an east European-style economic collapse, Vietnam has responded vigorously. Exports have grown from Dollars 1.3bn in 1988 to Dollars 2.5bn last year, while the trade balance improved from a Dollars 350m deficit to a Dollars 61m deficit in the same period. This was achieved in spite of the collapse of the Soviet Union, on which Vietnam had relied for aid and as its principal trading partner. In the shops, more food, cigarettes and beer are available than at any time in the past two decades as well as a plethora of consumer goods, from video recorders to cuddly toys. Perhaps most remarkable, this has been achieved in a period of tight monetary control - inflation has fallen from 70 per cent in 1990 to an annual rate of below 10 per cent - and without financial help from donor agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank; the US had blocked multilateral aid to Vietnam until July this year. Instead, the principal source of foreign investment has been from foreign private companies eager to benefit from a relaxed investment climate and low wages. Since 1988, more than 780 projects worth Dollars 6.8bn have been approved, with actual investment totalling Dollars 2bn. Vietnam is also diversifying its export base with the two leading products, crude oil and rice, accounting for less than half total exports last year. Exports of seafood, textiles, shoes and agricultural goods such as rubber and coffee are increasing. Against this background, it might be churlish to suggest that big obstacles exist to the government's target of doubling GDP by the end of the century. Nevertheless, while gains to date have been impressive, Vietnam may struggle to keep its development on track. Of particular concern is the banking sector. Vietnam needs to avoid the mistake of other developing countries, such as Ghana or Indonesia, which restructured their banking systems too late. The issue of the sector's bad debt, under-capitalisation and poor management must be a priority in the development process, according to foreign investors. The large number of state enterprises remains a problem. Accounts supplied by the enterprises show a third as profitable but accounts are unreliable and profitability often depends on subsidised credits supplied by the treasury and the state-owned development bank. Donors say the government must also improve its handling of infrastructure projects. The north-south high voltage power line being constructed is likely to exceed its planned Dollars 500m cost by about 25 per cent. The World Bank estimates that between 1993 and 2000, Vietnam needs to invest a further Dollars 2.6bn in the power sector and Dollars 2.8bn in roads, ports and inland waterways to maintain the pace of development. On a more positive note, the US decision to lift its objection to foreign funding allows Vietnam to call on western donors to help finance these projects. The IMF in October approved credits totalling Dollars 233m, while in early November the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank gave the green light to six projects with loans totalling Dollars 488m. The World Bank estimates Vietnam will require aid disbursements of about Dollars 550m a year in 1994-95, rising to Dollars 1bn by 1997 if its high level of growth is to be sustained. This level of disbursement, given the lead-time to initiate projects, will require far higher commitments, hence the November 10 decision by donors to pledge Vietnam Dollars 1.86bn for the year ahead. Donor finance alone, however, will not guarantee economic growth. Much will depend on the government's ability to absorb the aid efficiently and avoid the problems of, say, Bangladesh, where a backlog of projects exists. The machinery of government, which administers an annual budget of about Dollars 1.8bn, will be stretched by the influx of aid. Donors are likely to demand a more transparency in the government's finances. Important areas of revenue, particularly from oil exports, are not yet fully revealed in the budgetary accounts. But the greatest danger to economic liberalisation is that government officials may object to the social and political results of the new policy. The freeing of the economy has already increased friction between the Hanoi central government and provincial governments, particularly in Ho Chi Minh City. Provincial governments are modifying Hanoi regulations in areas such as foreign investment and taxation to facilitate greater local autonomy. The move toward a free market has also left a grey area between what is a state-owned and what is a privately-owned company. Local economists say many enterprises officially owned by provincial governments are now, in practical terms, operated for the benefit of their managers and employees. Such companies may set up autonomous subsidiaries and may have three sets of accounts: one for the government - to which a nominal sum might be paid each year - another for the workers and their profit-sharing scheme, and yet another for the managers. What appears to be happening is a slow metamorphosis of state-owned companies into private sector businesses, except that the legal ownership structure remains unclear and the companies - having failed to shake off their Soviet-style accounting systems - put more emphasis on turnover than on profit. There are reasons to be alarmed by this process. Of immediate concern is that the close relationship between the management of these 'state-owned' companies and local government is likely to suppress true private sector entrepreneurs. A forthcoming law governing domestic investment may ease this but investment data shows that genuine private companies remain almost exclusively small-scale and only a few sectors, such as retailing, have seen rapid growth. Most foreign investors form joint-ventures with local companies but of the 780 investment approvals granted since 1988, only seven have involved private Vietnamese companies. Of these, three have been revoked. Of the 200 priority projects drawn up by the government to attract foreign investment - ranging from food processing to heavy industry - none of the proposed Vietnamese counterpart companies is private sector. Replacing the command economy, therefore, is an economic system which is far removed from the free-market ideal, with a relatively small number of politically influential enterprises - some of which appear to be well-run - dominating important business sectors; the hotel industry, usually controlled by city or provincial people's committees, is one prominent example. The government, which remains Communist in name, may struggle under the new system to achieve political objectives such as an equitable distribution of wealth. The lesson from Indonesia, for instance, is that politically influential companies are reluctant tax payers and tend to hoard their riches while demanding business favours. An impure free market system would also tend to localise wealth. Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh may prosper, but other urban centres such as Hue and Danang would fall further behind. On the macro-level, economic inefficiencies would feed through to slower economic growth. Neither is it the system envisaged by the Vietnamese officials who have backed the move to a free-market economy. As one official noted, 'We are enjoying ourselves too soon, importing luxury cars when the people in the rural areas are still poor. We must try to bridge the gap'.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Foreign investment approved and implemented  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Number          Investment             Investment            of projects   approved (dollarsm)   implemented (dollarsm)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1988            37              364                       - 1989            69              539                      200 1990           108              600                      200 1991           150            1,223                      200 1992           198            1,937                      300 1993           133            1,551                      500 (to June) Total          695            6,214                    1,400  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: State Committee for Co-operation and Investment (SCCI)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

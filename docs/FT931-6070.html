			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Arts: Picking on Cherry - Jazz There is an unfortunate person sometimes heard at London jazz concerts. He seems compelled to react loudly, in the silence of a large auditorium, to whatever crosses his mind at any moment. I rather wished this tormented soul had been present at the Nu Now concert on the South Bank earlier this week, when Don Cherry first croaked into his pocket trumpet. He might have startled the old man of world music into more coherent action. That Cherry has a uniquely elusive but persuasive sound is without doubt, but his wandering concentration and arthritic trumpet playing on Monday was initially beyond comprehension. Fortunately, the rest of the Nu Now quartet - the bubbling rhythm of Bob Stewart on tuba, kinetic Hamid Drake on drums and Carlos Ward's sleek alto saxophone - delivered support with such flowing momentum that the early inertia of Cherry's playing was all but overcome. Creeping unsteadily around the piano in black tailcoat and embroidered pill box hat or squatting uncomfortably on his dais with shakers, doussn'gourni and melodica, Cherry seemed unable to penetrate material which ranged between Nu Now originals, music from Ornette Coleman and Thelonious Monk. By the end of the first set, which ground to a halt with Cherry endlessly tuning the trademark six string African guitar, the doussn'gourni, the Queen Elizabeth Hall squirmed. Thankfully Cherry appeared after the interval sounding more purposeful: especially at the piano where in a Monk medley he contrived to sound even more dislocated than the original. Ward tangled excitingly with angular rhythms from Drake, and Stewart's golden, classical tone flared in a long-awaited solo excursion. Perhaps fired by his colleagues' enthusiasm Cherry finally managed to make a mouth for the muted trumpet.</p>

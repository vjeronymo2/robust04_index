			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Letter: Demands on charities' funds not all the same Sir, There is a danger that Andrew Jack's interesting article of March 15 on charities 'Fears grow for charities as cash crisis worsens' will have created two misconceptions in the minds of your readers. First, that the funds of Britain's top 50 charities are all available for distribution. In the case of Barnardo's, the majority of assets on our balance sheet are in fact buildings which house our many child-care projects around the UK. Without investing in property which, to borrow an ugly US phrase, is 'critical to our mission', Barnardo's would not be able to provide services to children and young people to the standard we believe should be expected from a leading child care charity. When assessing a charity's overall level of resources it is usually more helpful to concentrate on analysing unearmarked reserves rather than total funds. Second, the article suggests that it is always a bad thing for charities to have expenditure growing faster than income. It is regrettably true that many charities currently have severe funding problems, but we must not overlook the fact that a small number of charities hold high levels of reserves. We should applaud those which are reducing reserves in a controlled and responsible way by accelerating new projects and incurring charitable expenditure greater than levels of income. The problem with this subject is, to paraphrase the 1988 SORP2 statement on charity accounting practice, that charities are very different and the balance sheet is not necessarily a sound measure of wealth. The only way round this is for donors to encourage charities clearly to outline their reserve policy in their accounts.

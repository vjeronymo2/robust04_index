			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Arts: The Kiev Ballet - Palais Des Congres, Paris The lyric ensembles from the Kiev Opera House have lately opened an extended season in Paris. Pleasure at seeing the ballet troupe - it was last in Paris in 1964 - is somewhat mitigated by the company's failure to understand either the nature of the Congres stage or the tensions it imposes upon a production. The dance area is vastly broad, and utterly devoid of theatrical ambience or artifice, and it can only suit arena ballet at its most vigorous. The Kirov and Bolshoy ensembles have played there, classicism ultimately triumphant, and so - with notable success - has Bejart, whose stagings seem exactly judged for its conditions. (No Bejart fan, I record that the bombast of the productions looks bold, and communicates boldly, on this exposed stage). Alas for the Ukrainians' ballet. Their operatic offerings, Khovanschina and Mazeppa, may have fared better, but the two big dance presentations unveiled at the weekend, Sleeping Beauty and Nutcracker, made for light-weight and improbable viewing. Gauzy, inadequate design; under-nourished choreographic texts; a dance-style that had as yet to accommodate itself to the arena conditions, all made for disappointment. The company's theatrical virtues, in schooling and temperament, could be seen to be dissipating in these huge and anti-theatrical surroundings. And the use of recorded music, well played by an un-named orchestra that I assume to be that of the Kiev Opera House, did not help individual soloists to appear at their best. It must be said that the long shadow of the Bolshoy is cast over the two ballet productions. But the Kiev troupe could muster neither the force of massed Muscovite dance power nor the cumulative bravura needed to carry a vision of such masterpieces to any convincing conclusion in these circumstances. It is now surely time, in the post-Soviet era, for the Ukrainians to reconsider the nature of the old repertory. Ironically, their first Beauty in 1950 was staged by Fyodor Lopukhov, one of the great traditionalists of the Petersburg ballet, for a sense of tradition is exactly what is missing in this current version (by Kiev's ballet-master, Viktor Litvinov, after Yury Grigorovich's expansive Bolshoy recension.) A particular fascination of both Beauty and Nutcracker is the way in which a precise locale (a court; a Biedermeier household) opens out to magic and fantasy. A real world is the necessary springboard for a journey into realms of the imagination exemplified by the classic dance itself. Yet the Kiev stagings, as with other Soviet versions we have seen, offer flimsy design, fly-away costuming, weightless dramatic playing, that sabotage the terrain from which the dance must spring. Unless, as with the Mariinsky and Royal Ballets, we sense the real, then the magical is denied its force. Florestan XXIV's courtiers and Councillor Stahlbaum's family must be figures as potent at the Lilac and Sugar Plum fairies. Nothing, in the Kiev presentations, compensated for a central flightiness, an imponderability of manner. The company is disciplined, well-schooled, and probably looks more so in its home theatre where it does not have to spread itself so thinly as on the extensive tracts of this stage. The corps de ballet is pleasing as nymphs, snowflakes, fairies, but it is more difficult to judge the upper ranks of the troupe under such surroundings. The leading roles in both Beauty and Nutcracker were taken by Tatiana Beletskaya and Viktor Yaremenko, able performers, though having to fight to project either dance or characterisation. The programme book, a mine of misinformation, misprints and omissions, was selective in listing any of the other artists. Fortunately it did identify the Blue Bird and his princess as Maxim Beloserkovsky, a fresh, clean virtuoso and Yelena Filipieva. Miss Filipieva is beautiful, looks young, and is a treasure. Her Florine was grand in style, serenely commanding, and had a mysterious radiance that speaks of joy in dancing. It was a most beguiling interpretation, not least because of the sweet inevitability with which Miss Filipieva showed us the dance. The Nutcracker was given in choreography by Valery Kovtun. As with Beauty, the bleaching out of drama, the rejection of the richly credible world established by Tchaikovsky's score, denied the piece its power. Everything up to the snow-flakes waltz was skimped, improbable; thereafter, Kovtun's skills produced fluent classic ensembles. On the Kiev Ballet's next westward journey, and the troupe deserves to be more widely seen, we must hope that the repertory will look more secure in style, and more rewarding to its interpreters.</p>

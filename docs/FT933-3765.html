			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Casebook MANY READERS have had an unpleasant experience at the hands of their bank, building society or insurer and it is rare to receive letters which recount a happy story. However, Freddie Earlle, who lives in London, wrote to the Weekend FT to record his father-in-law's satisfaction with the service he has received at his building society, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. 'My father-in-law is an active gentleman of advancing years. But unfortunately, he has moments of confusion,' said Earlle. During one of these lapses, he wrote to C &amp; G to find out how much money he had in his account. His letter was unclear and C &amp; G thought he wanted to close it. They therefore sent him a cheque and closed his account. He thought the cheque was his statement and therefore filed it away and did nothing. 'About three months later, he realised his mistake and deposited the cheque with the building society's local branch, which opened a new account for him,' said Earlle. The mistake meant a substantial loss of interest. Earlle said: 'He asked me to write and explain what had happened. In less than a week, the society replied. They accepted that Dad had made a genuine error, backdated the 'new' account, and so ensured no loss of interest. We cannot thank them enough.' If other societies take note of this example, Earlle believes, their customers will feel that their money is in safe hands.</p>

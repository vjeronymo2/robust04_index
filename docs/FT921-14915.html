			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Keating back on high-wire, watched by nervous markets: Former treasurer, now PM, leads Labor balancing act to restore confidence in Australian economy AUSTRALIA'S Labor government faces a difficult balancing act over the next few weeks as it seeks to restore confidence to the flagging economy without spooking nervous financial markets. Mr Paul Keating, the former treasurer (finance minister) who replaced Mr Bob Hawke as prime minister in December, got the job because Australians had lost faith in Mr Hawke's ability to guide the economy out of recession. Paradoxically, Mr Keating's mismanagement of monetary policy was partly to blame for seven quarters of flat or negative growth which has pushed unemployment to a post-war record of 10.5 per cent. Nevertheless, he appeared to be the only hope for a government traumatised by Mr Hawke's loss of direction, and desperate to achieve an economic recovery in time for the next general election, due in May 1993. Mr Keating has been uncharacteristically quiet since ousting Mr Hawke in a ballot of Labor MPs on December 19. But he has promised an economic statement in late February or early March to 'get the economy moving again'. In the meantime, the prime minister and his cabinet are travelling the country talking to state and business leaders to cast off an image of cosy Canberra-bound isolation which built up under Mr Hawke's leadership. The government is offering a stimulus intended to kickstart the economy through a mixture of tax incentives for investment, job creation schemes, and pump-priming through direct government investment at state and federal level in infrastructure projects. It is a strategy which will be sympathetically received by business groups, which have been complaining for months that the economy is in much worse condition than the government's Canberra-based economic advisers have claimed. Mr Keating's problem is that the statement must deliver a stimulus big enough to have a real impact on the economy, or it will be forgotten within days, as was a ADollars 300m (Pounds 122m) stimulus delivered by Mr Hawke in November. But it is not clear how a larger fiscal stimulus can be reconciled with the government's long-term target for a balanced budget, stable currency and a reduction in last year's ADollars 15.7bn current account deficit. The federal budget is forecast to be in deficit by ADollars 5bn this year as a result of extra spending and reduced revenues caused by the recession, but is claimed by the government to be in structural surplus  - implying that the deficit will disappear when the economy recovers. Mr John Dawkins, the former employment minister who was appointed treasurer at the end of last month, says there is scope for further relaxation of fiscal policy without endangering the structural surplus. Scepticism about the budget arithmetic was behind a fall of more than 1.5 US cents in the value of the Australian dollar last week as overseas investors sent a powerful warning about the dangers of too much pump priming. The currency regained some stability yesterday , when it recovered to close at 74.2 US cents in Sydney and at the same level later in London after intervention by the Reserve (central) Bank of Australia and the US Federal Reserve. But most economists expect it to continue to decline over the next few weeks to between 70 and 72 cents as uncertainty about the Keating statement continues. A decline of that much would not unduly concern the government, which would welcome the short-term beneficial impact on Australia's exporters of minerals and agricultural goods. But speculative pressure on the volatile Australian dollar could cause a currency crisis if Mr Keating's statement fails to demonstrate that the federal budget is under tight control. A lower exchange rate also risks re-igniting inflation, currently 3.3 per cent. The rate is expected to fall further in figures for the December quarter due later this month, but the falling dollar could worsen a forecast upward trend later in the year. The government's freedom of movement is further constrained by the current account deficit, which reached ADollars 21bn in 1989/90 before falling slowly last year, and the ADollars 133.5bn foreign debt, equivalent to about 31 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Dawkins said recently that he expected the deficit to fall to ADollars 14bn in the current year, equivalent to 3.25 per cent of GDP - low enough to slow the growth of the debt-to-GDP ratio, but not to stabilise it. However, monthly figures for the first five months of the year suggest that the deficit will again exceed ADollars 15bn, even if the economy remains in recession. The dilemma for Mr Keating is that too large a stimulus could worsen the deficit, leading to a renewed balance of payments crisis followed by another economic slowdown. But too small a stimulus could fail to take effect until next year - too late to affect the election.</p>

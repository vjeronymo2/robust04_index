			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Armed Forces commanders are fully committed to the  complex issue of institutional reorganization as decided by the  executive branch. There are many opinions regarding the  possibility of implementing it within a short period of time,  due to the lack of enough resources for the necessary purchases  of modern equipment. The highest ranking military officers are  also concerned about the reorganization's social and  geopolitical aspects, which means that today you cannot depend  on a single strategic line, or maintain a strict subordination  to certain world hegemonic powers which are always changing.    Commanders are also studying the diverse effects of the deep  political changes in the world with the disappearance of the  Soviet Union and communism. Many people do not hesitate to  affirm that these changes have deeply affected our Armed Forces.  We no longer have the "cold war" or the "East-West axis" and  have again begun to speak about the importance of the  "North-South axis," "which seeks to maintain countries such as  Uruguay in strict dependency of the North." High-ranking  military sources told LA MANANA that the affair raises questions  not only about the future equipping of our Armed Forces, but  also about its "acting philosophy and its professional morale  and ethics," the sources said.    Confirming their well-known resistance "to be merely used as  border forces," the spokesman ratified that "we will never, no  matter the order, replace the police. Before we are required to  intervene in internal problems, we need an appropriate law  protecting soldiers following orders, officers giving those  orders, citizens who should be protected from probable abuse,  and "the institutions."  <H5>  The Cost of the Reform </H5>   Confirming the real Armed Forces vision on the need to  modernize the institution and on the concrete economic reality  of the country, the sources said: "We are well aware of our real  needs. If we ask for a brigade with significant firing power,  adequate deployment speed, safe communications, and modern  equipment, we know we will need millions of dollars. But we are  also aware of the real situation of the country, and of the  social and political priorities. What, then, should we do?    That question seems to be at the center of the delay in  producing the report that President Luis Alberto Lacalle had  requested within the next 90 days.    The sources do not hesitate to say that the report will be  presented in time, and in the correct form, "because we will  fulfill the order." There is no doubt, however, that the  country's and the Armed Forces' reality will require "another  time and a different focus" to be able to also answer to the  deep changes in regional, continental, and world political  geography.  <H5>  The Reorganization </H5>   The internal Armed Forces reorganization has begun  principally in the Army. Many services have been "grouped under  a single command," while many other offices have not been  touched. In some cases they even returned to their former  department heads.    The Air Force has very few planes still operating, but it  will be receiving various kinds of planes, including two  Hercules transport planes that will be donated by the United  States.    Our ground forces have the greatest problem. This is the  branch with the largest number of personnel who "will not be  separated from the institution. They will be redistributed  within the Defense Ministry. Reliable sources said that the  institution is studying new incentives for the voluntary  retirement program. The situation is being analyzed carefully  because it might affect the financial situation of the Military  Retirement and Pensions Fund, the organization that will be  responsible for paying pensions to those who retire.    According to government sources, the president wants the  Armed Forces reorganization ready for August in order to  implement the mechanisms approved by the high-ranking military  commanders during October at the latest.</p>

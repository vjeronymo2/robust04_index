			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Glaxo Rarely can a company with such an embarrassment of riches have faced such uncertainty. In addition to price competition and government regulation, Glaxo must cope with threats to Zantac, the ulcer drug which accounts for 44 per cent of sales. The legal challenge to Zantac's US patent now in progress is the first hurdle. Generic and over-the-counter versions of Tagamet, the rival ulcer drug, are not far behind. Although yesterday's generous dividend increase marks an acknowledgment that the Pounds 1.8bn cash pile cannot grow unchecked, Glaxo has good reasons for not handing back more by way of a share buy-back. Yet Glaxo's return on capital has fallen for each of the past six years as cash has accumulated. That cannot be ignored indefinitely. So far the answer has been to plough resources back into the business at an accelerating rate. Planned research and development spending of Pounds 850m this year will be double the level of 1990. The growth of Glaxo's new drugs suggests that past investment is delivering an acceptable return. Whether the next wave will do so - in the face of tougher regulation and competition - remains open to doubt. The cash issue will then have to be addressed again, especially if Zantac's patent is secured. In the meantime a yield well above the market average makes the risks more palatable.</p>

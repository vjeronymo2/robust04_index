			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / GPT telephone factory to close GPT, a subsidiary of GEC, Britain's largest defence electronics manufacturer, is to close a telephone equipment-making plant with the loss of 250 jobs. The company blamed recession and newer technology for the closure of the factory at Kirkcaldy, Fife. It said it had reviewed all sites and decided to cut capacity. The factory will shut on March 31. Redeployment will be offered to employees 'where possible'. The company added: 'Every effort will be made to assist people to look for alternative employment.' Consultations with employee representatives has already started. GPT was formed in 1988 by the merger of the telecommunications operations of GEC and Plessey. Several of its plants have since closed. It once employed more than 3,000 people at the Kirkcaldy factory and a defunct sister plant in Glenrothes, Fife. The Kirkcaldy plant made computers for Amstrad, the electronics company, until June last year when GPT pulled out of the venture. GPT had earmarked the plant for several new projects, especially in the mobile telephone market. The schemes, such as Telepoint which was intended to be a cheaper alternative to the more flexible cellular telephone network, failed. Earlier this year GPT closed its research and development and engineering centre at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, where it employed 65 people, and it made a further 250 people redundant at Beeston, Nottinghamshire. The company still manufactures telecommunications equipment at Beeston, where it has its headquarters, and at other sites.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The political logjam over KwaZulu/Natal's capital  has been broken at a marathon session of the province's cabinet  in Pietermaritzburg. The issue: Should Ulundi be the capital  or should it be Pietermaritzburg? The cabinet has agreed to  hold a referendum on the question within 18 months and to set up  a special commission to determine which city should be the  interim capital.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Fawzia Moodley] Today's  agreement comes in the wake of a major public row between the  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], which favors Ulundi, and the ANC,  which wants Pietermaritzburg as the capital. There appears to  have been some tough talking during the seven-hour session, but  KwaZulu/Natal's interests seem to have won in the end. This was  underlined by an agreement to alternate legislative assembly  meetings between Pietermaritzburg and Ulundi, while the special  commission's report is pending.    [KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose] The referendum will  be  the one to decide where the capital is going to be. Now for the  sake of having a referendum naturally we must have a voters'  roll, which will indicate who are the residents of KwaZulu/Natal.    [Moodley] ANC provincial leader Jacob Zuma said a referendum  was the way forward.    [Zuma] The discussions with our colleagues today have made  all of us to agree to the way forward that we have agreed.    [Moodley] The agreement should ease tensions, which reached  dangerous levels after both IFP leader and Home Affairs Minister  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and ANC MP Peter Mokaba entered the debate  recently. The first sitting of the provincial legislature due  to have been held in Ulundi next week has been postponed to late  July or early August. Dr. Mdlalose said bills which were to  have been debated hadn't yet been drafted. [end recording]</p>

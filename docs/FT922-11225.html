			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Sweden pledges SKr30bn cuts to reduce deficit SWEDEN'S centre-right government promised SKr30bn (Pounds 2.85bn) spending cuts over three years to reduce the budget deficit which is forecast to reach SKr101.8bn in the 1992-93 tax year, writes Sara Webb in Stockholm. The cuts, mainly in welfare benefits, local and central government, come on top of cuts of SKr27bn from the government's 1992-93 budget in sickness benefits, interest rate subsidies on housing and grants to local authorities.

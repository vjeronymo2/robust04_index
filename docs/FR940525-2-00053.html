The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The prospective partially exclusive licenses will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. These prospective partially exclusive licenses may be granted unless within 60 days from the date of this published notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument establishing, to the satisfaction of NIH, that the grant of the respective license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 or 37 CFR 404.7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The patent application and patents are currently coexclusively licensed to Gilead Sciences, Inc., Lynx Therapeutics, Inc. and Gen-Probe, Inc. (and its included affiliate, Genta, Inc.). The NIH has determined that the terms of these coexclusive licenses do not prohibit the grant of additional partially exclusive licenses. The NIH will give full consideration to additional applications for licenses that demonstrate the applicant is qualified to develop and commercialize the inventions in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR part 404.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The patent application and patents disclose novel phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotide compositions which can be used to prevent the replication of foreign nucleic acids in the presence of normal living cells, as well as to inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cells.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barbara M.

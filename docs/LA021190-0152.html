			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OWNER GIVES UP ON OLD THEATER, DECIDES TO SELL  </P> <P> The owner of the rundown Whittier Theater is selling out because he is tired of  fighting with the city and conservationists over the fate of the Depression-era  landmark, according to an associate.  </P> <P> Peter Doerkin has put the theater up for sale, making way for a buyer to either  restore or demolish it, said Don Gerstein, an executive and spokesman for  Doerkin Properties Inc. of Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "We're tired of dealing with Whittier," Gerstein said. "We're going to put our  tail between our legs and go on to something else."  </P> <P> Gerstein would not disclose how much Doerkin is asking for the theater, which  he purchased for about $1.1 million from the Pacific Theater chain in 1987. "We  are not asking an excessive amount," Gerstein said. "We want enough to recover  our costs."  </P> <P> The historic film palace at Hadley Avenue and Whittier Boulevard has been at  the center of debate since before the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake.  </P> <P> When Doerkin purchased the theater in June, 1987, he told the council he was  going to restore it and convert it to a performing arts center. But several  months later, he asked the city for permission to replace the theater with a  $14-million shopping plaza because, he said, fixing up the theater would be a  losing proposition.  </P> <P> The council had not yet acted on Doerkin's request when the 5.9-magnitude  earthquake rocked the area in October, 1987, severely damaging the historic  building.  </P> <P> City building inspectors ordered that the theater be demolished because they  said the earthquake had made it unsafe. A wrecking crew worked on the theater  for about 45 minutes in November, 1987, before lawyers for the Whittier  Conservancy -- which had successfully argued in court that the city had to  obtain an environmental impact report before razing the theater -- arrived with  a restraining order to stop the destruction.  </P></p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: BPI makes defensive stock sale BANCO Portugues de Investimento (BPI) has reinforced its central core of shareholders by selling 7 per cent of its Treasury stock to Itausa, the Brazilian group. The sale is seen as a defensive move against Banco Santander of Spain, which has been buying BPI shares for the past three months. Santander, with its partner, the Royal Bank of Scotland, bought out Portugal's Banco Comercio e Industria three years ago. BPI is using the Itausa group as a white knight. As part of the deal, BPI purchased the Brazilian group's 12 per cent holding in another Portuguese bank, Banco Fonsecas e Burnay (BFB) for Es7.1bn (Dollars 44m) and at the same time sold the Brazilians 7 per cent of its own Treasury stock to strengthen its position against Santander's approach. The company has a widely dispersed spread of shares among many relatively small shareholders. But there is a core of investors who have signed a pact to sell to each other if they plan to quit the bank.</p>

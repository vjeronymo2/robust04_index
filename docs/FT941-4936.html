			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Incapacity bill gains majority The bill aimed at ending abuse of invalidity benefit by introducing a new incapacity benefit from April next year was given a third reading by a majority of 26 (302-276) in the Commons last night. Charges by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs that it would penalise people genuinely unfit for work were denied by Mr Nicholas Scott, minister for the disabled. A more objective medical test, which is still the subject of consultation, will determine eligibility. The benefit, which will be taxed, will be payable from the first day of incapacity for those who do not qualify for statutory sick pay. Mr Scott confirmed that existing invalidity benefit claimants would not suffer financial loss through moving to the new benefit. 'There will be no cash losers at the point of change,' he said. Mr Scott said expenditure on invalidity benefit had increased from Pounds 2.4bn in 1979 to Pounds 6.1bn in 1992-93. While expenditure would continue to grow under the arrangements authorised by the bill, it would be more clearly focused on the long-term sick. Mr Keith Bradley, a shadow junior social security minister, emphasised Labour's 'root and branch' opposition to the bill and looked to the House of Lords to make substantial amendments. Mr Jim Wallace, for the Liberal Democrats, feared the medical test would be 'mechanistic' and result in people being deemed to be capable of work when there was little prospect of them finding any.</p>

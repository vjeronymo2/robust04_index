Drozdov, deputy minister of foreign </F> economic relations of the Russian Federation, by Boris Rachkov;  date and place not given: "Russia-U.S. Business Partnership: One  More Chance?"]    [Text] The 20th century, in a large part of which the  fate of mankind has been determined by the nature of relations  between Moscow and Washington, which are situated in different  halves of the world, will soon be at an end. The polar  opposition of the superpowers personifying them made a heavy  impression on all of world history. Not a geographical  opposition, of course, but one that grew out of political,  ideological, and social contradictions. It was to this that the  cooperation of the two states, potentially boundless in terms of  mutual advantage, was sacrificed. They could long ago have  become the world's biggest business partners, but are as yet  still scrutinizing each other and measuring one another, as it  were.    "And it is not the first time that we have taken these  measurements, what is more," Nikolay Ustinovich Drozdov, deputy  minister of foreign economic relations of the Russian  Federation, says in conversation with an EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN  correspondent on Russian-American trade and economic relations  at their present stage. "Attempts at a rapprochement have been  made repeatedly, by people of several generations, it may be  said. And all such attempts have had one thing in common: They  have been imperiously dictated to both countries by some  irresistible forces and fateful circumstances which forced the  politicians of Moscow and Washington to forgo antagonism for the  sake of the simple survival of their states."    [Rachkov] You are referring, most likely, primarily to the  joint participation of the USSR and the United States in the war  against Hitler fascism and Japanese militarism?    [Drozdov] This also, of course. But not only this. Ten years  before the attack by fascist Germany on the Soviet Union, and by  Japan on America's Pearl Harbor, the entire Western world, the  United States in particular, lay in the ruins of an  unprecedented economic crisis. But that crisis stopped at  borders beyond which lay one-sixth of the land area of the  globe--the Soviet Union--where, albeit by brutal methods, the  vigorous experiment of "Stalin's industrialization" was being  undertaken. It created a tremendous demand for American and  other equipment. In order to give at least some additional  stimulus to its crisis-ridden industry the United States--the  last of the great powers, after 16 years of hesitation--finally  recognized the "Bolshevik dictatorship" diplomatically. In  exchange for our goods and gold, Washington encouraged the  supply to us of a considerable quantity of equipment, which  brought back to the American plants tens of thousands of  unemployed. But then the economy in the West picked up, and the  vicissitudes of geopolitics threw Stalin and Hitler into one  another's embrace for some time, which contributed to a winding  down of economic relations with the United States, right up  until the start of the joint struggle for survival at the height  of World War II.    [Rachkov] And then the cold shower for our business  relations  with America and the majority of Western countries was the cold  war, which dragged on for many years. Am I right?    [Drozdov] Yes, this is common knowledge. And one further  attempt, far-reaching, I would say, at the trade and economic  rapprochement of Moscow and Washington was made within our  memory even.    After all, in the first decades following World War II  supernatural force was in the full meaning of the words  concentrated in the nuclear warheads of the superpowers. And the  Caribbean crisis of the fall of 1962 just about sprang this  genie from the "bottle," which would have been lethal for the  whole world. The world was horrified at the threat of  destruction at that time, Moscow and Washington were horrified.  Under the conditions of the recognition of this global threat  and on the last waves of Khrushchev's "thaw" and in the last  months in office in the United States of the commonsensical  President John Kennedy, our countries once again took a number  of important steps toward one another. The treaty banning  nuclear tests in three spheres was signed in August 1963.  Economic contacts were stepped up. But this strongly aroused  "hawks" of all stripes also. The assassination of Kennedy and  the ouster of Khrushchev once again froze our relations for a  number of years. But the common fear in the face of nuclear  self-annihilation and the need for mutual tolerance, impossible  without economic interaction, now made themselves felt, for all  that. The start of the 1970's were, truly, marked by steps,  unparalleled for both superpowers, in the creation of the legal  foundations of trade and economic cooperation at the interstate  and public levels.    [Rachkov] I remember those years distinctly. Of all the  "projects of the century" which loomed at that time, a contract  for the supply to the United States of Russian urea for nitrogen  fertilizers in short supply there and for the supply to the CIS  of American source material for phosphorous fertilizer, which is  in short supply with us, is being realized currently to this  extent or the other. Towering up as a solid monument to that  period on Krasnaya Presnya is the Moscow International Trade  Center, which was built by the billionaire Armand Hammer, the  enthusiast of American-Russian cooperation, for a sizable fee,  of course. And, in addition, the Soyuz-Apollo brand of  cigarettes--a reminder of the impressive attempt to begin the  cooperation of the USSR and the United States in space  orbits--also still flickers in places, like the light of a  distant star. But where are all the other cherished dreams,  preliminary outlines, and projects?    [Drozdov] It is worth remembering the most far-reaching  voluntary association of business circles of the two powers  which emerged at that time for the purpose of promoting their  cooperation--American-Soviet Trade and Economic Cooperation  (ASTEC). It united on both sides over 500 firms, banks,  enterprises, establishments, and organizations. But it no longer  exists either, alas. But it cannot be said that ASTEC was  useless. On the contrary, it performed a great deal of work.  But, to be frank, it did not justify all hopes and is now being  transformed into new associations.    But, generally, the onslaught of the supporters of  cooperation of the start of the 1970's once again became bogged  down--and once again on account of the oppression of policy and  confrontation ideology. As in the 1960's the transatlantic  "hawks" plunged the United States into the Vietnam slaughter, so  at the end of the 1970's our apologies for strategists involved  the USSR in the Afghan adventure. Against the background of the  permanent Near East crisis, both were repeatedly accompanied by  Moscow's and Washington's stern and rather dangerous warnings  leveled at one another. People were not in the mood for  large-scale trade and reciprocal work on long-term projects  here. There had, most likely, to be a new turn in history which  once again revealed to the new generation of politicians and  ideologists the futility and ruinous nature of their obdurate  opposition.    [Rachkov] Following the logic of your arguments, I would  venture to maintain that this historical turn was the start of  the democratic transformations in our country at the turn of the  1990's, and in the United States, the ruling establishment's  abandonment of the view of us as the "evil empire." This turn,  dictated by the entire bitter experience of the antagonism,  which had grown wearisome, was, truly, all-sufficing and  "fateful" for mankind, as our first democrats put it. The world  for the first time breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the  cold war and both superpowers began to undertake mutually  coordinated disarmament and take new steps on the path of  economic cooperation.    [Drozdov] And once again not everything was that simple. In  the past two years Moscow and Washington have implemented very  important measures in the sphere of normalization of trade and  economic cooperation. But I would not yet venture to call them  historic, from which I am restrained by the experience of  previous disappointments. And there is still considerable work  to be done by myself and my colleagues and you journalists, and,  generally, all responsible people in Russia and the United  States for a departure as far as possible from the abyss of  confrontation, economic included. Judge by the facts.    Yes, Washington has removed many of the discriminatory trade  and political restrictions which had been established in respect  to the former USSR and which had operated in respect to Russia.  Thus Russia has for the first time since 1951 been accorded  most-favored-nation status in trade. The legislative  prohibitions on credit to us along the lines of the  Commodity-Credit Corporation and the Export-Import Bank of the  United States have been revoked. The restrictions on the special  government insurance agency of the United States--the Overseas  Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)--have been removed. Russia  has acquired the opportunity to use soft long-term loans in  accordance with the Food for Progress program. The extension to  us of the General System of Customs Preferences will contribute  to the increased efficiency of the exports of a whole number of  our commodities to the United States.    Yes, we take a positive view of the Furtherance of Reform in  New Democratic Countries Act, which has been adopted in the  United States: It provides for the abolition of more than 70  legislative restrictions established in the years of the cold  war. The reform of Cocom which is being undertaken at the  present time is reason to believe that there will shortly be  considerable movement in the direction of abolition of the  discriminatory restrictions on supplies to Russia of  research-intensive goods and technology, which have been in  effect for more than 40 years.    At the same time a number of discriminatory restrictions  preventing the building of bilateral trade and economic  relations on a firm long-term basis continues to operate in  respect to Russia. For example, the Jackson-Vanik Amendment,  which was introduced 20 years ago, gives the American side the  right at any time to unilaterally cancel the most-favored-nation  status in trade which has been accorded Russia. Antidumping  procedures, which are hampering our exports to the United States  or threatening to squeeze out of the American market a number of  important Russian raw material commodities (carbamide,  ferrosilicon, aluminum, and others), continue to operate. And  the antidumping procedures applied in respect to our exporters  are considerably more harsh and onerous than those that are  applied in respect to the vast majority of countries, what is  more.    In sum, the United States' share of Russia's foreign trade  turnover is not even 2 percent, and Russia's share of America's  trade is gauged in only tenths of 1 percent. And at the present  stage of scientific and technological development the  traditional forms of our trade and economic relations with the  United States based on the buying and selling of commodities  are, generally, exhausted to a considerable extent, evidently.  Extensive investment cooperation should, I believe, contribute  to the advancement of these relations to an entirely different  level in keeping with our desires and the immense potentials of  the two countries.    Unfortunately, here also we are still only at the start: The  share of American investments in the sum total of foreign  capital investments in the economy of Russia constitutes only 10  percent approximately ($500 million). In tiny Hungary,  incidentally, American investments constitute over $2.5 billion.  American companies explain their caution on the question of  investments in our economy by the high degree of risk connected  with the political instability in Russia. It is possible to view  this problem from the other side also, however--the political  instability is largely explained primarily by the economic  instability. An acceleration of the process of stabilization of  the Russian economy with the aid of investments of the United  States and other Western countries could contribute to a  considerable extent to political consolidation in our country.    We are prepared to take the necessary steps to attract  direct  investments of the United States in Russia. Cooperation could  encompass the leasing and concession of fuel and raw material  deposits, land, and forest tracts and the organization of joint  ventures for the in-depth processing of natural resources and  agricultural raw material, which are generally accepted in world  practice, between Western countries included. We could undertake  the sale at auction or the leasing of real estate, including  incomplete construction projects, and also the sale of  securities and shares of stock of enterprises and organizations,  the processing with the aid of foreign investments of numerous  types of waste and secondary raw material, the investment of  capital in the creation of a modern industry of tourism and  infrastructural facilities for business, and so forth.    The development of bilateral investment cooperation should  be  accompanied by a sound treaty and legal base. The first stones  in this foundation have already been laid.    Despite all this, the Russian side is endeavoring in every  way to overcome the current, not entirely logical situation  where the United States is prepared, seemingly, to cooperate  with us on a large scale and even render assistance with its  resources, but is at the same time in practice permitting  actions preventing Russia earning these resources independently,  on the American market included.    [Rachkov] Generally, a turnabout in Russian-American  business  relations appropriate to the political changes has not yet  occurred. More, the results of our December elections were  reason for certain circles in the United States, and in Russia  also, to recall the vocabulary of the times of the cold war. And  some observers are inclined to belittle the visits to Moscow of  Vice President A. Gore and President B. Clinton, which have just  taken place, including their significance for economic relations.    [Drozdov] Yes, the struggle of opposites continues, but  under  the conditions of a lower intensity, that is, under less  hopeless conditions. While not a reckless optimist, I personally  discern signs that there should no longer be an abrupt new  rollback in our economic rapprochement. Why do I think this?  Mainly because the democratic transformations in our country,  the market reforms included, and Washington's healthy  appreciation of them leave increasingly less room for an orgy of  the totally uncontrolled, suspicious forces, I would say, on  which we touched at the start of the discussion--be they chaos  in the world economy or the nuclear genie in a missile package.  There is today an opportunity to control them.    Only democracy and common sense finally enabled the leaders  of our superpowers to trust one another to the extent that they  are switching from words and small deeds in the sphere of  disarmament to actual steps. And the first truly promising  prospects for the economic cooperation of our superpowers have  been afforded simultaneously.    The visits of the top two Americans to Moscow and their  meetings with the leaders of Russia were not, truly, of direct  significance for foreign trade in its traditional form. But  together with the legal base, which was prepared not long prior  to this at intergovernmental level, they laid the first tangible  stone in the interaction of Russia and the United States in  areas which pertain to the "holy of holies" of their military  power and which had for this reason been so jealously guarded  until most recent days. I refer to the long-term contract for  the processing at plants of the United States of the nuclear  filling from almost 180 Soviet missiles into peaceful fuel for  the needs of America's nuclear power stations for a sum total of  $12 billion. Particular compensation has been specified for  Ukraine and Belarus. But the potential benefits to be derived  from such a contract by the superpowers themselves and the  world, particularly considering the fact that this has only just  begun, are immeasurable.    There is much that is symbolic here also, incidentally. I  was  present at the signing of the contract, which took place in the  hall of the collegium of the former Ministry of Medium Machine  Building--the very hall where all the serious decisions on the  creation of Soviet nuclear weapons had been adopted.    The first large-scale agreements on commercial cooperation  in  space, in which it was hard to believe just several years ago,  have been reached. These include the joint flights of American  astronauts and our cosmonauts and the creation of an  international orbital station and scientific and technological  cooperation in space. Science fiction is, you will agree,  becoming reality.    [Rachkov] So history has accorded Russia and the United  States one more chance to become worthy business partners. This  has coincided almost, Nikolay Ustinovich, with your appointment  to the office of deputy minister of foreign economic relations  of the Russian Federation in charge of business relations with  North America. What can you say about this coincidence?    [Drozdov] The said events are not to be compared, of course.  But this invests my colleagues and myself with a special  responsibility, nonetheless. Especially since I have been  entrusted also with the position of executive secretary of the  Russian-American Economic and Technological Cooperation  Commission, of which V.S. Chernomyrdin and A. Gore are the  cochairmen. The committees of the commission are led by  ministers and other high-level persons of the governments of the  two countries. This is a very serious instrument of  intergovernmental interaction in the economic sphere and yet  further evidence of the seriousness of the parties' intention  not to let slip the present and, possibly, last historical  opportunity in their economic relations. History might not  forgive any force majeure now.</p>

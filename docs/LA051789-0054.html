			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOGGER TAKES FIRST STEPS SINCE GANG ASSAULT  </P> <P> The woman jogger who was raped and beaten by a gang of youths in Central Park  last month has taken her first, shaky steps since the attack and is able to  write her name again, her doctor said.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert S. Kurtz said, however, that it remains unknown how fully she will  recover.  </P> <P> "The more small neurologic improvements are registered, the more clearly  apparent it becomes how great a distance she has yet to travel," said Kurtz,  director of surgical intensive care at Metropolitan Hospital. "She is now able  to take a few walking steps, although her gait is still broad-based and  unsteady."  </P> <P> She also can now write her name in a shaky hand, he said.  </P> <P> The 28-year-old investment banker was assaulted April 19 as she took her  nightly exercise in the park. Six teen-agers have been indicted in the crime.  </P></p>

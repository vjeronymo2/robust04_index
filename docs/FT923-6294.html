			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Deutsche Finance adds DM500m tranche to issue ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market was depressed by weak government bond markets as the dollar hit an all-time low against the D-Mark yesterday. Deutsche Finance, an arm of Deutsche Bank, added a further DM500m tranche to a recent DM500m five-year issue. The deal was aimed at German and Swiss retail investors, and was expected to be comfortably placed through Deutsche's retail network. Elsewhere, Banco Quilmes, Argentina's fourth largest private bank, launched its first Eurobond offering, a Dollars 20m two-year deal arranged by Chemical Investment Bank. The Bank of Scotland has arranged two programmes, one for Euro-notes and one for notes in the US private placement market under rule 144a. Turkish banks, seeking to lower the cost of their funds and increase liquidity in financial markets, have turned their eyes to asset-backed securities  - a new instrument defined in a capital markets decree last month, Reuter reports. Privately owned Interbank last week inaugurated the first asset-backed security with a TL4.25bn offer based on its leasing receivables. The issue, between one and 10-month maturities bearing a net annual interest rate of 72.36 per cent, was sold out on the first day of the offer. Key one-year bank deposit rates are around 70 per cent to 74 per cent and three-month repurchase agreements can currently earn 73 per cent. Pamukbank will today launch the first TL100bn part of a planned TL2,000bn securitisation backed by consumer credits and mortgages. The three-month paper will bear 67.13 per cent interest against 62 per cent Pamukbank offers on deposits. Leading high-street bank Yapi ve Kredi will securitise an entire TL1,000bn consumer credit portfolio next month. Mr Yaman Asikoglu, head of Turkey's Capital Markets Board, said export receivables of companies and credit sales by debt-ridden state-enterprises would also be eligible for securitisation. Asset-backed securities are mainly expected to replace bank deposits and become a new vehicle to increase liquidity in Turkish financial markets by recycling idle loans and thus easing deposit interest rates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The situation in Mogadishu following the deaths of  our two colleagues is extremely tense. General Fiore, the  commander of our contingent in the country, who, as you will  recall, is stationed on the aircraft carrier Garibaldi, has  given a precise order to all journalists to leave Mogadishu  immediately in order to board the carrier, where, as I will  remind you, the bodies of our two colleagues have been taken.  Filippo Gaudenzi spoke on the telephone to Gen Fiore. Let's  hear what he had to say.    [Begin recording] [Gaudenzi] What is the situation like at  present in Mogadishu?    [Fiore] The situation is always difficult, and anything can  happen from one moment to the next. For all intents and  purposes, we no longer have any information sources on the  ground because we are now stationed only at the port area and  the airport. The last 90 soldiers will board the aircraft  carrier this evening, and, in this way, our mission is over.    [Gaudenzi] In other words, does this mean that none of our  fellow nationals will remain in Somalia?    [Fiore] From this evening, when the last group will board  the  ship, none of the contingent will remain on land. Only the  diplomatic delegation, the ambassador, some administrators from  the embassy and a group of carabinieri to escort the ambassador  will remain.    [Gaudenzi] What is the morale like of the men following the  end of a mission whose balance sheet has yet to be added up?    [Fiore] This event has hit us hard because we were used to  living with these journalists. They almost seemed to belong to  us. We are very sad. The journalists had been with us for a  week, and the irony is that this evening they would have boarded  the Garibaldi to return to Italy with us.    [Gaudenzi] Do you think it significant that the two  journalists were Italian? Did they want to kill Italians?    [Fiore] Not just Italians. They wanted to kill Westerners.  There are very few Westerners remaining in Somalia, and Italians  are Westerners. Unfortunately, this is the way it goes.    [Gaudenzi] When do you expect to return to Italy?    [Fiore] We should have left this evening, but our schedule  has been altered slightly because tomorrow morning a [word  indistinct] 122 will arrive from Mombassa. We will load the  bodies of the two journalists on the 122 (?plane), which will  then leave for Italy. I believe that we will finally leave on  23 March. [end recording]</p>

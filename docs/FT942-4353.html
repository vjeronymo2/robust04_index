			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / CBI president gives strong warning on wage inflation A strong warning about the potential danger to economic recovery from wage inflation was delivered yesterday by Sir Bryan Nicholson, president of the Confederation of British Industry. In a speech to the west Midlands region of the CBI, Sir Bryan said: 'We have a bleak history of making competitive gains and then throwing them away needlessly. I am determined that this time we shall not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.' Sir Bryan highlighted sustainable non-inflationary growth as one of the three main priorities of his two-year term, with improving the competitiveness of industry and the creation of a deregulated and business-friendly Europe. He said the City needed particular restraint over inflationary pay arrangements. Recent labour-market statistics had disturbed his peace of mind, he said. 'Thanks to growth in average earnings in manufacturing of 4.75 per cent over the year to March and slower productivity growth of just 2.6 per cent, unit labour costs in manufacturing are increasing again at 2 per cent a year. Our competitors are achieving better results which we must match. Unit labour costs are now falling by 2 per cent a year in Germany and 3 per cent in the US.'</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Firm NY start lifts late-closing bourses AN intraday recovery in Germany and a strong opening in New York helped the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index recover from early lows, writes Our Markets Staff. Madrid was closed for a holiday. FRANKFURT broke below its 1992 closing low of 1,420.30, recorded last Tuesday, the DAX index hitting a day's low of 1,415.94. But the index recovered to close 7.12 down at 1,432.54. Mr Matthias Welticke of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that there were three reasons for the intraday recovery: first, closing of positions ahead of the expiry of October call and put options next Friday; secondly, the belief of many Germans, especially short-term operators, that the market will bottom out; and, finally, the apparent resistance of the DAX to any permanent break below the 1,420 level. Nevertheless, falls were the day's main individual talking points. Bayer, the premium stock among the big three chemicals, dropped DM5.10 to DM242.40, some dealers blaming a tenuous link with a hazardous materials case, others the industry association's recently bearish assessment of general profitability and prospects. Siemens, which added redundancies in its semi-conductor operations to earlier problems in its Siemens-Nixdorf computer business, extended its period of relative weakness with a fall of DM6.30 to DM539.20. MILAN ended lower, weighed down by selling linked to the exercising of call options yesterday, and as investors sold out, disappointed that a cut in interest rates had not been announced at the weekend. The Comit index fell 0.72 to 396.85 in turnover estimated at L150bn after Friday's L238bn. Dealers expected trading to be technical ahead of the close of the account tomorrow. The insurer, Ras, was one of the day's biggest casualties, falling L2,000 or 11.8 per cent to L14,900 after Friday's news that its one-for-four rights issue would start tomorrow. Fiat rose L107 to L4,181, supported by reports that Alcatel Alsthom of France was interested in buying Fiat's 25.4 per cent in Alcatel Italia. PARIS fell at the opening following Friday's drop on Wall Street and then rebounded in the afternoon as the US market opened firmer. But there was little else for Paris brokers to get their teeth into, and turnover was a mere FFr1.06bn. The CAC-40 index ended 2.29 lower at 1,655.05. The main moves in the day came in the second-liners. Among leading stocks, Michelin fell FFr4.10 to FFr174.60, Societe Generale fell FFr7 to FFr520 and Paribas added FFr10.90 to FFr291. AMSTERDAM saw dull trading as the CBS Tendency index lost 0.3 to 107.5. Pirelli Tyre Holding gained Fl 1.20 or 9.4 per cent to Fl 13.90 after Friday's plunge on news of its plan to double its share capital. KNP was down 30 cents at Fl 39.50, ahead of news after the close that it expects a sharp fall in 1992 earnings. BRUSSELS was weaker in quiet trade although Petrofina bucked the trend with a gain of 1.2 per cent. The Bel-20 index lost 2.33 to 1,092.54 in turnover of BFr557m. Petrofina recovered BFr100 to BFr8,050 after Friday's 5 per cent decline on news that Norway might close an important North Sea installation in which the group has a 30 per cent stake. ZURICH was little changed, the SMI index firming 3.1 to 1,881.5. Among banks UBS bearers gained SFr1 to SFr788. STOCKHOLM eased in thin trading, the Affarsvarlden General index falling 2.7 to 665.3 in turnover of SKr213m after SKr354m. B shares in Volvo lost SKr1 to SKr213. Reports that the car company would cut production of 1993 models by 12,000 units and was considering the closure of two of its Swedish assembly plants came after the close. VIENNA's ATX index recovered from an intraday low of 766.55 to end down 5.64 at 770.52. ISTANBUL's 75-share index gained 81.42 to 4,021.92.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           FT-SE EUROTRACK INDICES - THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- October 12 Hourly changes         Open     11.30       12.00      13.00      14.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   974.92   976.04       976.60     977.59    978.83 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1062.17  1063.95      1060.55    1062.66   1065.29  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- October 12 Hourly changes         15.00     16.00     Close    High/day   Low/day  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   980.63    984.57    984.55      985.00    974.76 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1067.87   1071.30   1069.79     1072.65   1060.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Oct 9     Oct 8     Oct 7     Oct 6     Oct 5 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     987.08    986.33    971.05    954.29    937.42 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1070.52   1060.95   1052.71   1035.93   1010.09  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

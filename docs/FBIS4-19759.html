			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Basaran Duzgun: "Confusion Over Varosha"] </F>   [Text] Total confusion has developed during the ongoing  indirect talks between the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  [TRNC], the Greek Cypriot side, and the United Nations over the  fenced area of Varosha whose transfer to the United Nations for  Greek Cypriot settlement is envisaged within the framework of  confidence building measures.    The sides understand different things by the term "Maras"  [Varosha].    This is how the sides define Varosha:    TRNC: The fenced area of Varosha is the area whose north and  west is fenced, and which extends to the sea on the east and to  the Golden Sands Hotel in the south.    The Greek Cypriot side and the United Nations: The fenced  area of Varosha is the area whose north and west is fenced, and  which extends to the sea on the east, and to "Varosha's  administrative boundary" on the south.    There is a nearly 1.5 square km difference between these two  definitions. In the Greek Cypriot and UN definition, the  "fenced area of Varosha extends 1.5 km south of the Golden Sands  Hotel." Some hotels and many unfinished buildings are located  in this area.  <H5>  The Sides Are Insistent on Their Positions </H5>   In defining the fenced area of Varosha, the TRNC used the  present definition from the very start, whereas the United  Nations indicates that from the "very start" it understood it to  be the area defined by the United Nations today, and it draws  attention to the fact that the area in question is also fenced  on the south.    In addition, the Greek Cypriots and the United Nations want  the region between the southern part of the Varosha area -- as  they define it -- and the borders (Green Line) [preceding two  words in English] to be unmanned. In which case, this region  will be transformed into some kind of a "buffer region" and the  TRNC armed forces will be forced to withdraw from the southern  border of this region. According to the Greek Cypriots and  United Nations, this is the only way to ensure reliable  communications for the Greek Cypriots between southern Cyprus  and Varosha.    On the other hand, the TRNC is opposing the seizure of  additional lands from the TRNC by putting forward new concepts,  and is stressing that this is unacceptable.  <H5>  What Installations Are Found in the Region? </H5>   According to the new map prepared by the United Nations, in  addition to the 105 hotels and hotel-apartments inside the  fenced area of Varosha, there are eight hotel-apartments and  many residential buildings and shops in the new region coveted  from the Turkish side. This region, which is the continuation  of John Kennedy Avenue and passes in front of the 1000-bed  Golden Sands Hotel on the southern border of the fenced-in  Varosha area, is a 1.5 sq km coastal strip. The residential  buildings in the region end with the house known as the  Painter's House, after which John Kennedy Avenue continues as a  dirt road until it reaches the Green Line 1 km away.  <H5>  Report on Leasing Was Not Confirmed </H5>   In the meantime, the reports in the Turkish press, which  were  also quoted by some local papers and magazines, to the effect  that "the United States wants to lease a place in Varosha," have  not been confirmed.    A high-ranking official told our newspaper that no such  proposal had been submitted to the TRNC by the American  officials dealing with the Cyprus problem.    This high-ranking official said: "No such issue was raised  during the talks held in Nicosia last week. The Americans did  not make such a proposal to us. Just like you, we too read that  in the Turkish press. We are investigating it."</p>

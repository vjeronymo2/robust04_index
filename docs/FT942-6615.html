			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Vilified defender of the faith: Yoram Sheftel proved John Demjanjuk was not Ivan the Terrible. He tells Chrystia Freeland why Yoram Sheftel is Hollywood's dream of a defence lawyer. He is tough, he is pugnacious, he always fights for the underdog, and he is never happier than when he has a chance to take on the establishment. Sheftel's skills were displayed on the world stage when he defended John Demjanjuk, the Ukrainian-American auto-worker accused of being a sadistic Nazi camp guard. For Sheftel, the trial ended in a spectacular - and unexpected - success, but also created a social catastrophe which has dogged him in the six months since his victory. In the ageing, inarticulate figure of Demjanjuk, the state of Israel thought it had found a man who could represent the inhuman face of the Holocaust for a new generation of Israelis - and to drive the lesson home tried him in a theatre hall and broadcast the courtroom proceedings live on television. Sheftel argued that the wrong man was on trial and - even more unforgivably  -he won. The legal battle, which ended in September, resulted in Demjanjuk being released by the Israeli Supreme Court after a series of appeals. But the passions associated with the Holocaust could not be calmed by a dry, judicial decision. As the international success of Steven Spielberg's film, Schindler's List, attests, the Nazi genocide retains the power to squeeze tears out of the most sitcom-saturated US audience. For Sheftel, who many still fault for being on the wrong side, the Demjanjuk trial can never really end. In spite of the evidence which convinced a hostile court, there are still articulate, educated observers who refuse to believe that his client was innocent. So, why, on this issue, do passions still outpace reason? 'I have no doubt that some people still despise me,' Sheftel says serenely. 'Some people saw this case as being about the Holocaust, the biggest issue in Jewish history. They feel that to admit that Demjanjuk is innocent is to say that the Jewish state is guilty.' Hostility towards Sheftel reached an apex in 1988 with an acid attack which very nearly blinded him. Even today, Sheftel says that some Israelis continue to regard him as 'public enemy number one'. But he wears the mass censure as a badge of honour and says that during the trial it served as a goad to putting up a more spirited defence. 'Once I decided to take on this case, nothing whatsoever could deter me,' he said. His loquacious manner and cosy, bearded appearance disguise the pugnacious attorney beneath. 'The acid attack, the daily intimidation in court, they all just made me more stubborn to succeed. It became my personal quest to show everyone that there was nothing whatsoever that would make me break down.' A few weeks ago Sheftel spoke at the Oxford Union - after the initial plan to hold a debate was scrapped because no one could be persuaded to share a podium with the defender of accused war criminals. Before his speech Oxford's L'Chaim Society hosted a dinner in his honour. Shmuel Boteach, Oxford's rabbi, began the meal with a speech meant to pour oil on the troubled waters. The rabbi described how the case had torn Israel apart, first by stirring up the passions connected with the Holocaust, then by denying that rage its release when the Israeli Supreme Court acquitted Demjanjuk. Even so, the rabbi appeasingly concluded, perhaps all Israelis, and all Jews, could take solace from the fact that the trial had reaffirmed the commitment of the Jewish state to one of the principal covenants between Jews and their God: adherence to the law. A stirring and comforting moral for a divisive experience, but Sheftel would have none of it. 'With all due respect,' he said, 'to commend our legal system because it found Demjanjuk innocent is absurd. This affair is a shame and its entire conduct was a gross miscarriage of justice. In the end, Demjanjuk was acquitted not because Israeli courts are so just, but because they had no choice.' With that, the L'Chaim Society settled down to an uneasy meal, punctuated by broadsides from Sheftel about the injustice of Israeli courts and, for good measure, occasional attacks on the US Department of Justice and the KGB. 'I think I am very much an anti-establishment personality,' Sheftel said cheerfully afterwards. 'The Demjanjuk case was a wonderful opportunity to expose the weakness of our legal system, and, in a way, of all legal systems.' That, it certainly was. Being forced, after a highly publicised, seven-year show trial, during which at one point Demjanjuk was sentenced to death, to release the accused American was a public humiliation for the Israeli legal establishment and, in the eyes of many Israelis, a debasement of the memory of the Holocaust. The US Department of Justice came out of the whole affair even more dishonourably. It stands accused by an American court of acting 'with a reckless disregard for the truth' and failing to turn over key evidence to the defence. To add insult to injury, the US has been compelled to accept on its territory the man it deported as a war criminal. The hubris of the Israeli and US legal establishments, which was eventually so painfully exposed by Sheftel, led them to behave as if the specific horror of the Holocaust gave courts a right to ride rough-shod over legal niceties. After Demjanjuk had been identified as Ivan the Terrible, a sadistic camp guard at Treblinka, the Ukrainian-American was seen as no longer deserving the benefit of the doubt. Sheftel, rightly as it turned out, criticised the photo-spread on which the initial identifications were based as biased, but the Israeli lower court dismissed his argument as a quibble. As an earnest American student, troubled by Sheftel's detailed explanation of his defence at the Oxford Union, put it: 'But, Mr Sheftel, surely the Holocaust is above legal technicalities.' To Sheftel's fury, this attitude was shared by most of Israel's legal community. 'It was apparent from December 1990 that Demjanjuk was the wrong man and that he was the victim of a show trial, but not one professor of law, not one lawyer, dared to open his mouth. 'This is a disgrace to our entire legal establishment. They all looked at this case as a case about the Holocaust, about Ukrainian collaboration with the Nazis and they felt that legal points were irrelevant, ridiculous as this may sound for professors of law.' They came to regret that judgment after the collapse of the Soviet Union gave the defence access to KGB archives which made it possible to prove that Ivan the Terrible was someone other than John Demjanjuk. But by the time the KGB and other evidence exonerating Demjanjuk became available to the defence, both the Israeli legal system and the US Justice Department were so committed to the case that 'returning were as tedious as to go o'er'. Israelis and Americans tried first to ignore, and then to conceal, the evidence. But Sheftel, an adroit spin-doctor, made that impossible by sharing his defence with the media. Ultimately, the Demjanjuk case was really two cases. For Sheftel and his client it was a question of mistaken identity and seeking justice for one elderly blue-collar worker from Cleveland. For the state of Israel and the prosecution, the Holocaust was on trial. In the end, the first case was the one which Sheftel fought and won. It is because he was convinced that he was representing a single, falsely accused man, that Sheftel, as an Israeli, a Jew, and a member of a family decimated by the Holocaust, felt no qualms about defending Demjanjuk. 'I felt no conflict at all. I wasn't defending Ivan the Terrible, I was defending a person wrongly accused of being Ivan the Terrible. If you are convinced as a criminal lawyer that your client is innocent - whoever he is  -even if your country chooses to make his case into a show trial that should not deter you.' Indeed, Sheftel reserves a special voltage of his ample righteous rage for those Israelis who felt otherwise. He believes that the low point of the trial was when a lower court judge pointed out that Ukrainians, with their history of anti-Semitism, were particularly inclined to collaborate with the Germans. An accurate generalisation in Sheftel's view, but insufficient grounds to incriminate his individual client. 'The Jews were treated horribly in Ukraine, from the 16th century to the 20th century,' he says. 'But I think it is absurd to suggest that you can make some sort of historical balance by hanging the wrong man.' Sheftel's ability to focus on a single man, against the background of a mind-numbing atrocity, remains rare. Even now, even after Israeli and US courts have acquitted Demjanjuk and excoriated his accusers, many are unable to accept that after all the hoopla, Demjanjuk is merely an obscure mechanic who had the misfortune of being born in a troubled part of the world. After it had been conclusively demonstrated that Demjanjuk was not Ivan the Terrible of Treblinka notoriety, some lobby groups, and eventually the prosecution, insisted that he was guilty of war crimes at a different camp. 'If not Ivan the Terrible, then a Terrible Ivan,' in the catchy phrase coined by US defence lawyer extraordinaire, Alan Dershowitz. The case was so flimsy - after all, for seven years the prosecution had tried to prove that Demjanjuk was a guard at an entirely different camp - that after two weeks the Israeli Supreme Court concluded that there were insufficient grounds to hold a new trial. But the audience at the Oxford Union was unconvinced. 'Demjanjuk had to be guilty of something,' a bewildered student told me as we filed out into the drizzle. 'Otherwise, why would the Israeli courts have tried him for so long. You have to believe in something.'</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS GET A FULL FINAL SAMPLING OF AMERICANA;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: ON THEIR LAST DAY IN THE SOUTHLAND, THE SAILORS TOOK IN THE RODEO AT  CAMP PENDLETON, TALKED TO THE BOY SCOUTS AND WENT SHOPPING.  </P> <P> Soviet sailors enjoying their last day in San Diego got a full dose of  Americana Friday, bartering with Boy Scouts and U.S. Marines while watching a  rodeo at Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> The sailors, who leave for their home port of Vladivostok this morning, spent  their last full day here watching the show, trading parts of their uniforms and  taking pictures with U.S. servicemen.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, they saw a flight demonstration at Miramar Naval Air  Station and shopped at the commissary.  </P> <P> The Soviets, in the United States as the third in a series of reciprocal  U.S.-U.S.S.R. naval visits, said they were surprised by how quickly the week  went by and that they had just begun to understand how much there is to see in  California.  </P> <P> Sergei Kokolov, a seaman on the destroyer Boyevoy, said through an interpreter  that he had seen a rodeo on television in Moscow but that he did not entirely  understand what the point is. "I understand it's a sport," said Kokolov, 20.  </P> <P> One of the biggest differences between Americans and his countrymen, he said,  is that "the people here are so talkative."  </P> <P> Americans will chat about anything, he said. He also found them unreservedly  friendly.  </P> <P> "Everybody who drove by on the road waved," he said.  </P> <P> While wild horses were kicking inside their pens, a U.S. Marine Corps honor  guard paraded to the center of the rodeo grounds, hoisting the Soviet and U.S.  flags. Servicemen from both countries saluted as each national anthem was  played. In the stands, those in the all-white uniforms of the visitors were  interspersed with the hosts in their camouflage fatigues.  </P> <P> But many, rather than watch, hung around the fringes of the arena, exchanging  gifts with the Marines and a group of Boy Scouts who had been invited to attend  the closed event.  </P> <P> What Americans wanted more than any other item was a T-shirt signed by one of  the Soviet sailors; finding someone to explain what they had written was even  tougher. Some wrote that they looked forward to seeing the sailors who plan to  visit Vladivostok; others simply signed their names.  </P> <P> And the Soviets found themselves puzzled by more than the meaning of rodeo.  </P> <P> The Americans' frequent use of hand motions prompted many Soviet inquiries to  the interpreters, said one, Gunnery Sgt. Kris Hankinson.  </P> <P> On the base, many were perplexed by the Marines' use of the hand signal that  means "I have a phone call for you" -- the thumb and pinky extended and the  three other fingers curled to the palm.  </P> <P> In the Soviet Union, it is customary for three people to share a bottle of  vodka, said Hankinson, and there, the "phone call" motion means "I want to  drink vodka, and I need two others to join me."  </P> <P> "They were wondering what was going on with all these officers," Hankinson  said. "They were beginning to think they were all out looking to find people to  drink vodka with."  </P> <P> Asked about his evaluation of San Diego food and San Diego women, Yevgeniy  Finko, 21, said, "The food was good, and so was everything else."  </P> <P> Finko, a seaman on the Boyevoy from the city of Frunze in the Soviet state of  Kirghiz, added that the opinions and attitudes about the United States formed  as he was growing up were quickly discarded during his visit.  </P> <P> "It's pretty much been a total turnaround," he said.  </P> <P> But overall, when asked what they liked the most about their visit, the Soviets  said they had liked many things and had not had enough chance to see them  fully.  </P> <P> "It was too little time," said Zgena Fomenko, 20, a seaman on the destroyer  Admiral Vinogradov who hails from a small village on the Volga River. "We  didn't have enough time to see all that there is to enjoy."  </P></p>

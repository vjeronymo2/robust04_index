			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Videotron falls despite 10% sales increase Expanding cable-TV operations in Canada and the UK enabled Videotron to report a 10 per cent rise in revenues for the year ended August 31, but higher depreciation and continuing problems in domestic broadcasting depressed profits overall. Net profit was CDollars 20.5m (USDollars 14.6m), or 11 cents a share, down from CDollars 25.1m, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 641m against CDollars 584m. Videotron has been investing heavily in its cable and telecommunications franchise areas in southern England, leading to higher depreciation and amortisation. However, Videotron said the UK unit would contribute more in 1995 and eventually be a significant source of income and cash flow. Videotron will also start up a trial commercial cable/multi-media system in Quebec this autumn and is expanding rapidly in the US. Newbridge Networks, a specialised telecommunication equipment maker, posted a second-quarter profit of CDollars 45.3m, or 56 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 191m, up almost 50 per cent. First-half profit was CDollars 87.2m, or CDollars 1.08 a share, up from CDollars 69.1m, or 87 cents, on sales of CDollars 363m against CDollars 243m.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown eases his hung parliament demands MR PADDY Ashdown yesterday left an escape clause in the conditions he has set for Liberal Democrat support in a hung parliament, which could allow a deal without agreement on proportional representation. In comments which only increase the likelihood of a pact between the Liberal Democrats and Labour, Mr Ashdown hinted that he might help to keep a minority government in office if the uncertainty created by a hung parliament threatened an economic crisis. Previously Mr Ashdown had said he could never guarantee absolutely how he would react if he held the balance of power, although he set a commitment to proportional representation in the first Queen's Speech of the new government as the pre-requisite for his party's support. The timing of his comments - which included a warning of the economic chaos a minority Labour government might cause - fuelled speculation that he might be prepared to make compromises. Liberal Democrat MPs will meet in London on Saturday to finalise a negotiating stance for any coalition deals. Arrangements are also in hand for a special conference to consult other party members if necessary. Mr Ashdown also dismissed reports that he was calling for four cabinet posts for Liberal Democrats in a coalition government, as 'premature and speculative'. Last night at a rally at Richmond upon Thames he sought to refocus attention on his party's pledge to raise income tax for education spending and stepped up his efforts to persuade Labour or the Tories to enter a coalition government. 'Just imagine a government which worked for partnership and consent,' he said. Earlier, on the BBC's Election Call programme, Mr Ashdown was asked if he would, in all circumstances, vote against a Queen's Speech that had no reference to proportional representation. He replied that Liberal Democrats were 'prepared' to vote down such a government, but added: 'Of course I can't give you an 'in all circumstances' undertaking. You are asking me to predict how I'd play as the batsman in the third ball of the fourth over after next.' He said that 'in any foreseeable circumstances' a minority government which put its own interests before the country's should be brought down. However, he added: 'Sensible people don't close every option.' If, for instance, Britain faced a crisis over Libya, or the pound was 'dropping like a stone', then 'obviously, everyone has to do what they think is right and, under the circumstances, for the country's good'. Party officials insisted that Mr Ashdown was not changing his position but conceded he had left some leeway for negotiations. Mr Ashdown said that under a minority Labour government 'the pound will come under very severe pressure, they (the government) will be almost immediately faced with the possibility, the prospect, of having to raise interest rates'. At his morning press conference he had promised that his party would, 'work constructively for a partnership government which lasts the lifetime of a parliament'.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Mobil will respond to Dollars 1.3bn back tax demand with lawsuit MOBIL, the second biggest US oil and gas group, yesterday said it would respond with a lawsuit to a Dollars 1.3bn US government bill for back taxes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claims Mobil owes about Dollars 300m in taxes on Saudi Arabian oil bought in 1980 and 1981. A further Dollars 1bn of interest is also being claimed. Mr Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil, yesterday disputed the tax bill. It centres on the so-called 'Aramco Advantage' issue of whether Mobil should have charged its consuming country affiliates higher oil prices for Saudi crude that was obtained below world market prices. At the time, Mobil was a minority shareholder of Aramco. Both Exxon and Texaco, two other former Aramco shareholders, are also involved in litigation with the IRS over similar back tax bills. A decision on these cases is expected from a Washington, DC tax court by mid-year. Texaco, the US energy group, yesterday unveiled a decline of almost 20 per cent in underlying 1991 earnings, reflecting lower crude oil and natural gas prices and depressed demand. Stripping out special items in the fourth quarter, Texaco's profits dropped 37.6 per cent to Dollars 295m from Dollars 475m the previous year. Net income in the fourth quarter of 1991 fell 16.5 per cent to Dollars 324m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, from Dollars 388m, or Dollars 1.40, a year earlier. Revenues declined by 25 per cent to Dollars 9.8bn from Dollars 13bn. For the full year, Texaco had underlying profits of Dollars 1.24bn, against Dollars 1.54bn in 1990. Net income in the year eased 11 per cent to Dollars 1.29bn, or Dollars 4.61, against Dollars 1.45bn, or Dollars 5.18, a year earlier. Revenues declined 8 per to Dollars 38.3bn from Dollars 41.8bn in 1990, reflecting sharply lower crude oil and product prices in 1991 which were partly offset by slight gains in crude sales volumes. Texaco's earnings from exploration and production stood 49.1 per cent lower in the fourth quarter at Dollars 175m, compared with Dollars 344m the previous year. The results were in line with expectations, and shares in Texaco added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 3/8 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

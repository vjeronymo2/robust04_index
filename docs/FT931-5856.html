			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Miner's leaders predict close vote over strike LOCAL leaders of mining unions yesterday predicted a close vote in strike ballots starting tonight. British Coal managers said industrial action would cut redundancy benefits and damage customer confidence. The miners are being asked to back one 24-hour strike followed by a 'rolling programme of industrial action'. Members of the National Union of Mineworkers have rejected a series of strike calls from their leadership since the 1984-5 pits dispute, but some local officials expressed optimism that the latest call would be heeded. The strike vote, called because of impending job losses and privatisation, is being held among members of the National Union of Mineworkers and the Nacods pit deputies' union. Union leaders traditionally exaggerate the strength of their members' militancy in the run-up to ballots. British Coal nevertheless acknowledges that the vote may be close this time because miners feel they have public opinion behind them. Mr Ted Millward, NUM secretary at Maltby, South Yorkshire, one of the 31 threatened pits, said the feeling among his members was that 'if we vote 'no' the union is going to get smashed to pieces'. British Coal said 7,379 miners had left the industry since the corporation announced plans last October to close 31 pits. Some 33,300 remain, and the corporation said all the threatened pits had enough staff to continue operations if required. The RMT transport union is also holding a strike ballot today and tomorrow. Although RMT officials have been co-ordinating their disruption plans with the two coal unions they were anxious yesterday to insist that the cause of their dispute was quite different to that of the miners. The result of the miners' ballots is expected on Sunday. The RMT result will not be known for about a fortnight. Northern Ireland's Unionist MPs are heightening the government's dilemma over Britain's coal industry by hinting strongly that their reaction to ministers' proposals will depend on whether special help is given to the province. The votes of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs and three Democratic Unionist MPs could be crucial to win Commons approval for the proposals.</p>

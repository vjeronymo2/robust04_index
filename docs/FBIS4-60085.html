			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 19, IRNA -- President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani while inaugurating Iran's first plant  manufacturing optic fiber and solar cells Thursday, said the  Islamic Republic relied less on foreign currencies during its  reconstruction era.    "The world's situation is such that we can prepare all our  needed goods from various countries, even from those which are  enemies of the Islamic revolution," the president said during  his 3-hour visit to the plant which is affiliated to the  Ministry of Post, Telephone and Telegraph. Addressing the staff  of the plant, the president said that all doors were open for  reconstruction of the country and that "our vigilant people are  ready to bear hardships to insure the prosperity of their  children in the future." He pointed to the significance of  solar energy and energies generated by wind and sea, saying that  all these types of energy could be generated inside the country.  "Such energies may not be economical at present but we should  lay the foundation of this," he added.    Referring to the government's investments in martyr Raja'i  and martyr 'Abbaspur hydroelectric power stations, he said "the  energy generated by the two power plants is cheap, sustainable  and safe... fortunately we ourselves build such dams, using  domestic resources."    He said that the optic fiber and solar cells plant, the  first  of its kind in Iran, was of great importance in area of using  solar energy. He said that it was very important that small  solar power plants be installed in mountainous and rugged rural  regions where setting up of power transmission lines would be  uneconomical.    President Hashemi-Rafsanjani said though solar energy might  be more expensive than other types of energies, its advantages  over other sorts of energies necessiated its use.</p>

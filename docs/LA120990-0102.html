			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXTENSION FOR GENERAL PLAN SOUGHT  </P> <P> The Lawndale City Council voted unanimously Thursday to seek a one-year  extension from the state to revise and enact a General Plan, which cities are  required to have in order to pass zoning laws or issue special zoning permits.  </P> <P> The city has been without a valid General Plan since November, 1989, when  voters refused to endorse the plan that had been enacted in 1976, saying it was  too outdated.  </P> <P> The request for an extension must be approved by the state Office of Planning  and Research.  </P> <P> For the last year, a General Plan review committee has been working on a  revision. In its request for an extension, city officials cited Planning  Department staffing problems and budgetary constraints as reasons for the delay  in getting a new plan before the voters.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SISTERS HAIL NUN'S COURAGE IN EL SALVADOR;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: RELIGIOUS ORDER IN ORANGE LETS ELENA JARAMILLO 'CALL THE  SHOTS' AT REFUGE FOR TERRORIZED FAMILIES. BUT CONCERN IS RISING WITH 'THE  EXTREMITY OF THE SITUATION.'  </P> <P> It was a performance to be expected from Sister Elena Jaramillo, the Sisters of  St. Joseph said.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-tall, gray-haired nun, struggling to recover from a case of  hepatitis, summoned the strength to defy Salvadoran soldiers who last weekend  rousted a tiny church and terrorized the families that had taken refuge there.  </P> <P> The nuns would not leave the church, Jaramillo told the soldiers, until the  last refugee was safely released. And despite living in a war zone, ministering  in a village where there is no running water and no electricity, Jaramillo, 53,  refuses to leave El Salvador.  </P> <P> "Of course, we are all anxious about her safety . . . but we have agreed to let  her call the shots," said Sister Katherine Gray, assistant general superior of  the Orange-based order that has counted Jaramillo a member for 36 years.  </P> <P> "She knew what she was getting into," Gray said, "and she knew there was reason  to be afraid. But she is really committed to the people there."  </P> <P> Jaramillo is the only nun from the 283-member order who is working in El  Salvador.  </P> <P> "She is wiry, really alive," Sister Sharon Fritsch, a counselor in the order,  said of Jaramillo. "She is such a people person. She can just make people feel  really energetic in her presence."  </P> <P> Fritsch said Jaramillo's love affair with the people of El Salvador began in  1986 when she first visited the country to help escort residents from San  Salvador, the capital, to their rural hometowns.  </P> <P> "She saw the reality of the danger," Fritsch said. "I went down to visit her  last year and experienced something of the same reality. But once you are in  contact with these people, there is a goodness, a steadfastness, a communion  you experience with them that is stronger than the fear."  </P> <P> Through a Christian volunteer organization called Salvadoran Human Aid,  Research and Education, Jaramillo moved in October, 1987, to a village that is  a four-hour bus trip from San Salvador.  </P> <P> On Monday, the nuns of the Sisters of St. Joseph were reluctant to provide a  photograph of Jaramillo or even name the village where she works for fear of  retribution by soldiers. Church leaders are increasingly the targets of  assassinations in El Salvador, as evidenced by last week's slaying of six  Jesuit priests at a university in San Salvador.  </P> <P> "We have been careful about what we would say to call attention to her," Gray  said. "We know that what appears in the papers here gets back to El Salvador."  </P> <P> In fact, the nuns heard about Jaramillo's harrowing weekend through a news  report and were surprised that she had provided her name and religious order.  "That she was willing to take a stand like that says something about the  extremity of the situation," Fritsch said. "She isn't somebody to walk  foolishly into a dangerous situation."  </P> <P> Fritsch last spoke with Jaramillo on Wednesday, she said, when Jaramillo was  fine. The Sisters of St. Joseph wanted to send medicine for Jaramillo's  hepatitis, but she discouraged them from doing so.  </P> <P> "She said: 'Please do not do anything. I don't want anything extraordinary  being done,' " Fritsch said, adding that Jaramillo's hepatitis is not  considered life-threatening at this point.  </P> <P> Jaramillo last visited the United States in July, when she spent a month with  the Sisters of St. Joseph. During that time, she spoke of the struggle of the  Salvadoran people and her need to stand in solidarity with them, Fritsch said.  </P> <P> The area where Jaramillo lives was devastated by war in 1980, when the parish  priest was driven out by fighting, Fritsch said. The battles destroyed or  damaged many buildings, including the church. Jaramillo and another nun share  one room as living quarters.  </P> <P> Like the rest of the villagers, the nuns cope with food shortages and the lack  of utilities. Among the activities coordinated by the nuns are classes for  children and sessions in which villagers learn about farming.  </P> <P> "They lead a very austere life," Fritsch said. "But she expressed a real joy, a  real desire to return."  </P></p>

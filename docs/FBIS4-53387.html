			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputies of the House of Representatives [HR]  believe that the government should not be provoked into reacting  emotionally to a conference on East Timor scheduled to be held  in the Philippines and there is no need for the government to  bar non-governmental organizations [NGOs] from attending the  conference. Abu Hassan Sazili, chairman of House Commission I  in charge of foreign affairs, defense, security, and  information, advised the government not to force the Philippine  Government to cancel the conference because the political system  of the Philippines differs from Indonesia's. In this regard, he  urged the Indonesian Government to provide the international  community with information about developments in East Timor.  Such a step would be better than an emotional reaction to the  conference.    Meanwhile, Theo Sambuaga, leader of the Functional Group in  the House of Representatives, hoped that Indonesian NGOs invited  to the conference would tell others about the true situation in  East Timor instead of discrediting the government.</p>

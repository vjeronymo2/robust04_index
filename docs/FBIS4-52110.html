			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Audit and  Inspection (BAI) will conduct special examinations of government  officials who have adopted an easy-going, don't-rock-the-boat  attitude, it was reported Friday.    A senior BAI official said the lackadaisical posture of many  public servants has reached a critical point, reflected in a  recent turbulence at farm and fishery wholesale markets created  by implementation of a revised act on the distribution of farm  and fishery products.    Declaring that some government officials' easy-going  attitude  is blocking the administration's reform efforts, the official  said the BAI has decided to take a closer look at officialdom.    Critics as well as ordinary citizens are blaming the recent  fiasco at farm and fishery wholesale markets on official  incompetence, negligence and indifference.    The markets were nearly paralyzed earlier this week when  wholesalers, protesting against the new act, refused to take  part in auctions, causing prices of farm and fishery products to  skyrocket at the retail level.    The new act, which went into effect last Sunday, bans  middlemen in the distribution of farm and fishery products in  order to protect producers and consumers.    But in enforcing the new law, the Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries Ministry failed to anticipate the kind of disruption  it would cause at the wholesale level and to provide an  effective alternative to the existing system. The Ministry  announced Wednesday it would put off implementation of the new  act for six months.    The BAI has already conducted a series of unannounced  inspections of governmental agencies, covering a two-week period  last month, in which it unearthed instances of officials  neglecting their duties, the official said.    The BAI plans to undertake additional examinations, he said.    Specifically, in the first phase the BAI wants to find out  whether some officials are needlessly sitting on proposals or  documents or have rejected papers on unjustifiable grounds, the  official said.    In the second stage, the BAI plans to expand the inspections  to cover officials suspected of neglecting their duties or not  handling their jobs actively, the official said.</p>

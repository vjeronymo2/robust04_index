			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Israel's army radio says Rabin planning cabinet reshuffle Israel's army radio said yesterday Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, was planning to reshuffle his cabinet in order to defuse a coalition crisis. The radio said Mr Rabin had agreed to the ultra-religious Shas party's demand to move outspokenly secular leftwing Mrs Shulamit Aloni from the education ministry. She had accepted the communications and culture portfolio instead. The crisis was triggered by the resignation submitted on Sunday by Rabbi Arye Deri, the Shas interior minister. He may now remain in his post.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool item"] </F>   [Text] New York, May 27 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem  offensive operations in central and northern Bosnia have  triggered clashes with the Serbs in the areas of Maglaj, Olovo  and Gradacac, U.N. spokesman for peacekeeping operations Fred  Eckhard said at a regular press briefing on Friday.    There is fighting also around Bihac in the west, where Serb  forces are supposed to be attacking, Eckhard went on to say.    He explained that talks were still in progress on the  withdrawal of Bosnian Serbs from the exclusion zone around  Gorazde in the southeast, but so far without any concrete  results. He noted there was no deadline or ultimatum for the  withdrawal.    Earlier this year, Moslem forces had mounted a strong  offensive from Gorazde, which should have been demilitarized a  year ago together with five other U.N.-designated safe areas in  Bosnia. When the offensive was on the verge of collapse, the  international community stepped in and ordered air strikes  against the Serbs.    Bosnian Moslem ambassador to the United Nations Muhamed  Sacirbej has written to the U.N. Security Council, accusing  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali of putting an equation  mark between the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs.    Sacirbej took exception to Butrus-Ghali's blaming both the  Serbs and the Moslems for failing to honour their undertakings  in connection with the safe area of Gorazde, and called for  bombing the Serbs who he said understand only the language of  threats and force.    Sacirbej explained that the cease-fire agreement for  Gorazde,  reached in Belgrade in mid-April by Bosnian Serb President  Radovan Karadzic and the U.N. secretary-general's special envoy  Yasushi Akashi, was not binding on the Moslem side which had not  taken part in the talks.</p>

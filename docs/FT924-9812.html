			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: 'Soft' commission deals set to spill into Europe SO-CALLED 'soft' commission agreements, which have become increasingly commonplace in the equity market, are about to spill over into European bond markets following a recent ruling from regulators in London. Investors have traditionally not paid commissions on bond trades. As a result, the development is likely to prompt concern among some fund managers' clients about whether their interests are being harmed. Soft commissions arrangements involve brokers refunding part of the commissions they receive to a fund manager in the form of services. Specific guidance on how these arrangements should work in fixed income markets was only given to certain brokers a fortnight ago by the Securities and Futures Authority, a self-regulatory organisation in London. According to the SFA, brokers can issue contract notes to their fund manager clients showing a single net price, including the broker's own mark-up, or 'commission'. However, the broker must send a complete statement at least once a month detailing its own commissions, and this has to be shown to the fund manager's client. Hoenig, part of the US soft commission group, and Thamesway, owned by BZW, have now both begun marketing soft commission services to bond investors. A third house, Tiedemann Investment Research, is understood to have been offering similar services in London for some time, though its president, Mr Nicholas Bullman, refused to comment yesterday. Hoenig said that fund managers' clients would not be harmed by the development, since fund managers would only be able to deal if the soft commission broker offered a price which was at least as good, after adding in its own 'commission', as that quoted by at least two other market-makers. Thamesway said that the extra service provided by an independent broker would justify the 'commission' involved. 'As bonds have been a principal market to date, it is very important to do - and be seen to do - a proper agency job,' said Ms Karen Morgan Thomas of Thamesway.</p>

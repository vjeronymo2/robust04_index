			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> POSTAL SERVICE APARTMENT PLAN IS GREED, PICUS SAYS  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus accused the U.S. Postal Service of  "unabashed greed" for a sketchy proposal to build an apartment complex on land  it owns in Encino.  </P> <P> Picus, echoing the concerns of Encino residents, said on Thursday that the  proposed 112-unit complex is incompatible with the single-family homes and  small businesses that surround the site next to the Encino post office branch  on White Oak Avenue.  </P> <P> "All they want is money, money, money," said Picus, who described the Postal  Service as an "uncaring, faceless bureaucracy" for its plan to lease the land  to a developer despite objections from neighbors.  </P> <P> She has introduced a motion that would prevent the complex from being built.  </P> <P> The Postal Service announced last year that it was looking for developers  interested in building on the property. It entered exclusive negotiations with  Tutor-Saliba in January.  </P> <P> The project is still in its infancy, according to Bob Vincent, director of  marketing and development for Tutor-Saliba Properties, the San Fernando Valley  development company that has been working with the Postal Service on the  project. No project plans have been developed, and Tutor-Saliba and the Postal  Service have yet to begin serious discussions on the proposal, he said.  </P> <P> "We don't really have anything in the works as yet," he said.  </P> <P> Vincent said his firm's initial proposal for the project was a 112-unit complex  on 54,000 square feet of land, where the vacant Encino Municipal Court building  now sits. He said if Tutor-Saliba were able to acquire additional land now used  for parking by Postal Service employees, the project could grow to as many as  160 units.  </P> <P> Picus and residents said a complex of that size would destroy the "stable  neighborhood" of 1950s tract homes and small businesses.  </P> <P> "The massive apartment complex proposed for this site threatens to shatter the  neighborhood's peace and privacy," Picus said in a prepared statement. "It is  totally out of scale both in size and density. The building would tower . . .  over modest homes and would house a population a dozen times more dense than  the neighborhood around it."  </P> <P> Rob Glushon, president of the Encino Property Owners Assn., said the proposed  project was "ill-conceived and makes no sense, except to those who would profit  from this stupid idea."  </P> <P> Picus introduced a motion last week that would prohibit the construction of  apartments and condominiums on the property by changing the zoning. Her motion,  submitted to the Planning and Land-Use Management Committee, would also require  the approval of Picus and the property owners association on any development on  the property.  </P></p>

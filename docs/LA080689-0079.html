			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE LEFT-HANDED COMPLEMENTS;  </P> <P> LEFTIES PLAYING A BIG ROLE IN WATER POLO TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> In a world where right means correct and right-handers have the last consumer  word, left-handers are making themselves heard.  </P> <P> The positive attributes of the left-handed are noted on shirts, bumper stickers  and other novelty items. Speciality shops cater to left-handers.  </P> <P> And at the U.S. Senior Men's National Water Polo Championship at UC San Diego's  Canyon View Pool, lefties also are making some noise.  </P> <P> Of the 103 players participating on eight teams Saturday, only 13 are  left-handed. But after four games, which whittled the field in the round-robin  tournament to four for today's finals, four of the top six scorers were  left-handed.  </P> <P> "Each good team has at least one," said Dante Dettamanti, assistant national  and Stanford team coach. Stanford, with two lefties -- 1988 Olympian Craig  Klass and ambidextrous Eric Blum -- advanced to today's championship rounds  with a 9-7 victory over Newport B and a 7-5 upset of previously undefeated and  top-seeded Newport A.  </P> <P> "You like to have them on your team," Dettamanti said. "It's an advantage. They  throw the defenders off."  </P> <P> What they were throwing on this day were goals.  </P> <P> "It's a significant advantage," said Harvard Academy Coach Richard Corso, who  with four lefties has an unusually high number on his team.  </P> <P> "They balance the front-court offense and the power play. They're important in  picks and screens, anywhere."  </P> <P> The surviving lefties going into today's final competition are those of Malibu  (4-0), Geoff Clark and goalie Craig Wilson; Stanford (3-1), Klass and Blum, and  Beach (3-1), Nick Baba and James Makshanoff. Newport A (3-1) has none.  </P> <P> The absence of a left-hander on Newport A -- packed with nine national team  members and three former Olympians -- dispels any notion that being left-handed  alone is enough.  </P> <P> "They have to be good," Dettamanti said. "If you have to choose between a weak  left-handed player and a strong right-handed player, then you always go with  the strong right-hander."  </P> <P> Malibu's Clark, the leading scorer on Australia's 1988 Olympic team, is the  second-leading scorer (14 goals in four games) in this tournament. Malibu  advanced to the final four with an 8-5 victory over Harvard Academy and a 11-9  victory over Golden Bear.  </P> <P> "Everyone knows all the best players in the world are left-handed," said Clark  with a smile. "Everyone's expecting you to shoot from the other side. You're  just not used to it."  </P> <P> Even the left-handed players don't like playing against other lefties.  </P> <P> "I myself don't like (guarding a left-hander)," said Clark, a sophomore at  Pepperdine. "Everything's harder against them. The timing's different, the  angles are different."  </P> <P> Said Bruin Polo's Alexis Rousseau, who scored 12 goals here: "Even me, I'm not  used to them. Sometimes it's surprising to be playing against them and have to  stop and think, 'oh, they're left-handed.' "  </P> <P> According to coaches and players, lefties are most effective on offense in a  six-on-five situation, when a penalty has left the defense short a player.  </P> <P> "When you're a man up, that's when you use him the most, because of  positioning," Dettamanti said. "You pass along the outside, always moving the  goalie and the defense around. Left-handers can catch and shoot the ball  immediately."  </P> <P> Said Corso: "Right-handers have to stop and shoot across their bodies. Lefties  don't."  </P> <P> And Clark has discovered that being left-handed has helped open the door to  athletics.  </P> <P> "I've had a lot of break since I was young because I was left-handed," he said.  "It's given me a lot of opportunities. Sportsmen aren't exactly encouraged to  change (hands)."  </P> <P> Besides, left-handers can add character to a team.  </P> <P> "Left-handers are a little unorthodox, a little off, anyway," Dettamanti said.  "In swimming, the breast-strokers are a little off. Left-handers are the same  way."  </P></p>

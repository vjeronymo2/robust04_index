			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said here today that "we are fully confident that Hong  Kong people can administer Hong Kong well."    He made the remark while meeting 49 newly-invited advisors  on  Hong Kong affairs and 13 newly-appointed members of the  Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.    The 49 new advisors on Hong Kong affairs received their  letters of appointment here today, bringing the total number of  advisors on Hong Kong affairs to 141. The practice to invite  advisors on Hong Kong affairs began in 1992.    Many urgent tasks remain to be done at a faster pace since  in  three years China will resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong, he  said. China has already formulated a series of important  policies on the administration of Hong Kong after 1997.    He said that Deng Xiaoping pointed out a decade ago that  Chinese people in Hong Kong have the ability to administer Hong  Kong well and that it is an idea left over by the old  colonialism not believe this.    Jiang said that Hong Kong's economic stability and  prosperity  of today are inseparable from the Hong Kong people's diligence  and creativeness. Hong Kong people will surely be able to  create a bright future for Hong Kong, he said.    Of course, he added, neither can Hong Kong's economic  stability and prosperity be separated from the mainland's  economic development.    The president said that an important purpose of setting up  the preliminary committee and inviting Hong Kong affairs  advisors is to provide a chance and channel for Hong Kong people  to participate in the cause for a smooth transition in Hong Kong  and lay a foundation for the realization of "Hong Kong people  ruling Hong Kong" after 1997.    He expressed the hope that all the Hong Kong people would  care for the affairs related to China's resumption of  sovereignty over Hong Kong and for Hong Kong's long-term  prosperity and stability, which he said are closely connected  with the interests of the Hong Kong people.    He also expressed the hope that the advisors and members of  the preliminary committee will increase their contacts with the  mainland and facilitate the Hong Kong people's participation in  the cause so as to make full preparations for the coming of the  year 1997.    Other senior Chinese leaders attending today's meeting  include Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, Li Lanqing, Zou Jiahua,  Qian Qichen, Luo Gan, Ji Pengfei and Lu Ping.    In a separate group discussion today, the new advisors and  members of the preliminary committee put forth many constructive  opinions and suggestions concerning Hong Kong's financial  policy, inflation, price of accommodation, continued employment  of civil servants, education on the youth and others issues.    Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  under the State Council, said that practice has proved it  successful to invite advisors on Hong Kong affairs.    He spoke highly of the advisors' work. They have offered a  large amount of valuable suggestions on important issues  concerning the smooth transition in 1997 as well as issues  related to the transitional period, he said.</p>

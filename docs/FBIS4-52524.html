			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Monineat: "A Very Little Hope in the Assembly </F> Session"]    [Excerpt] Some observers have said they have very little  hope in the upcoming session of the National Assembly expected  to be held on 16 May following failure of the recent two  sessions. Three topics will be raised on the agenda of this 16  May session.    The National Assembly will hear the announcement on the  outgoing and incoming representatives, debate and adopt the  1994-95 socioeconomic restoration plan and the press system  bill, and approve the appointment of Sin Sen and Kieng Vang as  the state secretaries of Interior.    Looking at the three topics, one can see that this is the  third time that the announcement on the outgoing and incoming  representatives has been raised on the agenda. It was this  topic that caused a deadlock in the previous two sessions (held  on 5 and 27 April). This matter has caused the National  Assembly to be criticized by the public and those who have been  observing the law enforcement and the implementation of the  half-baked democracy in Cambodia.    The replacement of these unqualified representatives has led  to the conflict between personal opinions and legal aspects  because a number of representatives from the FUNCINPEC [National  United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and  Cooperative Cambodia] Party have refused to accept two  candidates from the Cambodian People's Party [CPP], namely  Prince Kromkhun Chakkrapong and Mr. Sin Song.    According to a report from the National Assembly's office,  11  members of the assembly's Standing Committee have approved the  agenda on the new representatives, but one Standing Committee  member has rejected it.    Some optimists think that this session will be successful  because they believe that the FUNCINPEC and CPP will reach a  compromise so that the two representatives from the CPP can get  their seats in the National Assembly. Howevere, there are also  some pessimists on this matter.    A high-ranking National Assembly member has revealed that  Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly, has strived  to reach a compromise with the FUNCINPEC to draw its support for  his men. He will also seek the support from other assembly  members to get the approval for this agenda. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kucherenko report: "Russia's President Has Signed </F> Six Edicts Aimed at Accelerating Reforms"]    [Text] In the opinion of A. Livshits, leader of the group  of experts under the Russian Federation president, these  documents mark a switch of the reformers' main effort to the  production sphere and the imposition of order in the matter of  mutual payments.    Many difficulties lie in store for us here, however. In the  abolition of export quotas and licenses, for example. Such  privileges really do not exist in the developed world, since  everyone there has equal rights to foreign economic activity --  pay only the customs duties that are laid down for everyone. In  Russia, however, many programs at federal level, and  particularly at regional level, are funded exclusively out of  the duty-free export of valuable raw materials. This is how  local authorities and even giants at federal level secure  currency for their projects. Now all their calculations have  been canceled out. This means that we cannot avoid another  struggle at the top, opposition, and lobbying to repeal this  edict. All the more so because the president already tried to  impose order in the granting of foreign economic privileges last  year -- an attempt that failed then.    Let us take the edict "On Some Questions of Tax Policy." We  can only welcome the termination of the practice of granting  privileges which make holes in the budget, the lightening of the  tax burden, and the transfer of sectoral nonbudget funds to the  federal budget, under strict control. Here is the rub, however  -- how can this be combined with the figures for big state  expenditure, which requires big taxes? The authorities probably  reckon on collecting more taxes, since entrepreneurs and  industrialists will breathe a sigh of relief and will stop  evading their payment. But our tax service is far from perfect,  and so a new round of budget battles cannot be ruled out.    Those who wrested privileges from the government and who  hold  nonbudget funds that are not under the control of the center --  sectoral and regional lobbies -- will not surrender their  positions without a fight either. They have a great arsenal of  weapons: Strike threats, moans about the deplorable state of  industry, refusals to pay money into the federal treasury,  surges of separatism. It seems that the implementation of this  edict will be a serious test of the organization and strength of  Russian central authority.    A similar "trial of strength" will also be provided by the  document "On Additional Measures To Normalize Transactions and  To Strengthen Payment Discipline...." For, as the Central Bank  admits, we have no laws today that demand rigid discipline in  payment for goods and services. The system of control over  enterprises' compliance with financial discipline has also been  destroyed. It is possible to recall the sad fate that befell  the edict on the introduction of promissory notes. The demand  for currency accounts to be used to clear debts in the absence  of working capital treads on the corns of those same powerful  lobbies that have plastered industry with a mass of  commercial-middleman structures.    Strong resistance will also be elicited by the edicts on  ranking "naughty" enterprises with the state's controlling  packages as rigidly controlled state enterprises. For a  significant stratum of managers who are accustomed to dealing  with state property as though it were their own private property  has been formed in the country in the space of a few years.  They also learned a long time ago how to avoid paying taxes by  spreading enterprises' funds out among several bank accounts,  and the edict on restoring discipline of tax payments could put  an end to those liberties.    So we could be witnessing normal economic measures, delayed  by two years, marking the start of a tricky political campaign.</p>

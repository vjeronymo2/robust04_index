			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Insuring against terrorist damage - In A Nutshell Business tenants in leased premises must make sure that they are fully protected under new insurance arrangements agreed by the Association of British Insurers and the government to meet claims for terrorist damage, London solicitors Hill Taylor Dickinson warn. Landlords usually insure their leased buildings but pass on the cost to their tenants. If the landlord does not top up the Pounds 100,000 basic terrorist cover provided and the damage sustained is greater the tenant may have to meet the cost of the repairs. Worse still and depending on the terms of the lease, the tenant may have to continue paying rent on a wrecked building and could lose the right to bring the lease to an early end, Hill Taylor Dickinson advise.</p>

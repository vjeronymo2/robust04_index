			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> TEACHERS PICKET IN CONTRACT DISPUTE  </P> <P> Ocean View School District teachers picketed Harbour View Elementary School on  Wednesday over stalled contract talks and threatened to expand the picketing to  other schools.  </P> <P> Union representative Dane Shepard said the main issue in the dispute is the  distribution of state funds under Proposition 98, which requires the state to  allocate a percentage of its annual budget for schools.  </P> <P> The district, which receives $59 per student in Proposition 98 funds, has  offered each school $12 per student, Supt. Monte McMurray said. The remaining  $47 per student "is on the table for salary increases," he said.  </P> <P> But Shepard contended that the district has other sources for salary increases  and should give the entire $59 per student to schools for classroom use.  </P> <P> "We want that (Proposition 98) money to go directly to the classroom," Shepard  said.  </P> <P> The union has also asked the district to increase its annual contribution to  the teachers' health and welfare plan by about $900 per teacher, to a total of  roughly $4,300 per teacher. The district is offering $375 a year more per  teacher, McMurray said.  </P> <P> Shepard said teachers "are actually getting a salary reduction because they  have to pay out of pocket" for medical coverage, Shepard said.  </P> <P> Both sides are scheduled to present their cases before a state mediator on Jan.  11, Shepard said.

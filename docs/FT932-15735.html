			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dowding and Mills falls 40% to Pounds 1.8m DOWDING AND Mills, the electrical and mechanical repair company, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.77m for the half year ended December 31. That was a downturn of 40 per cent on the corresponding period's Pounds 3.03m. Turnover from continuing operations fell by more than Pounds 1m to Pounds 36.9m, but increased to Pounds 41.2m taking in the US acquisition last July which contributed Pounds 4.2m. The company has adopted the FRS 3 accounting rules with 1991 figures being re-stated. A Pounds 628,000 provision was made for the stake the company acquired following an abortive bid for Torday &amp; Carlisle, the Newcastle-based engineer, the value of which has since declined. A second provision of Pounds 380,000 was made for the cost of some 80 redundancies. The company said it had maintained operating margins at above 6 per cent in spite of a 26 per cent fall in operating profits. Interest payable rose to Pounds 421,000 (Pounds 382,000) reflecting a change in the mix of funding and because the reduction in UK interest rates did not coincide with the period being reported. Gearing fell from 22.8 per cent to 19.7 per cent due to lower capital spending and tight cash control, directors said. The interim dividend is being maintained at 0.92p and is payable from earnings per share of 0.61p compared with 1.29p.</p>

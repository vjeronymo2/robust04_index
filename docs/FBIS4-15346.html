			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX, Prime  Minister Andrey Sangheli stated that the approval of a new  government by the parliament not by names, but by the whole list  testifies to the trust of the executive power in the new  government which is "capable of pulling Moldavia [Moldova] out  of the economic crisis."    After expressing satisfaction with the government make-up,  the prime minister said that the government was formed by the  ruling Agrarian-Democratic Party which will be responsible for  the situation in all spheres, including the economy.    According to Sangheli, the Republic has all necessary  material and natural resources, the technico-economic potential  and adequate personnel for overcoming the crisis."It is just  necessary to understand that market is not an ultimate goal, but  the way to increase production and improve the well-being of the  people," he pointed out.    The prime minister said that by reducing the administrative  staff and management structures of the government 30-40 percent  saving will be reached.    IF Note: The new government of Moldavia has three ministries  and three departments less than the previous one. Now there are  17 and eight of them respectively. Until recently, the total  number of administrative personnel was 6,000 people, and their  maintenance cost 3.2 percent of the state budget. Sangheli will  have four first deputies. There will also be the new post of  the state minister for relations with the parliament.    The heads of the power ministries retained their posts:  General Pavel Kryange remained the defense minister, Konstantin  Antoch -- the interior minister, Vasily Kolmoi -- the security  minister. The present Moldovan ambassador to Belgium Mikhail  Popov was appointed as the new foreign minister. The  nationalist newspaper "Tsara" argues that this appointment was  made at Moscow's initiative and promises the change of  Moldavia's foreign policy from Europe to Moscow oriented.    According to Sangheli, in about 40 days the government will  submit to the parliament its program for the near future. The  prime minister the priorities will be the following:    -- Well-thought combination of state control and development  of market structures.    -- Intensive denationalization and reform of enterprises  through distribution of shares and privatization.    -- Agrarian reform with retaining state's influence in the  agrarian sector and simultaneous development of peasants' farms.    -- Reform of industries, support for efficient industries,  the creation of conditions for investments.    -- Anti-inflationary policy, the completion of tax reform,  the reduction of budget deficit.    "Despite the difficulties and bad shortage of funds, the  government will pay special attention to the social support, the  creation of state program for the use of labor force, support  for low-income people, the preservation of the rights to free  education and health care," Sangheli pointed out.    In his opinion, the success of the new government should be  guaranteed by professionals who have worked in state bodies  before, including in the government, and in recent year were  doing business in market and commercial structures. "They  should ensure the implementation of the new government's  strategy of reasonable combination of market mechanisms and  state regulation," the prime minister said.    Sangheli expressed confidence that relations between  Moldavia  and former Soviet Union republics, now the independent state of  the Commonwealth, will rise on a qualitatively new level. He  also does not doubt that in the near future the parliament will  ratify all agreements signed by President Mircea Snegur within  the framework of the CIS and the Economic Union which is now  being created. That, in his opinion, would enable Moldavia to  cooperate with traditional economic partners on an equal basis.    Commenting on the proposal of the Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev about the creation of Euroasian Union, Sangheli said:  "We have not received any concrete proposals. If we do receive  them, the parliament and the government will give an adequate  answer."    Commenting on the repeated appointment of Sangheli as the  prime minister, local observers point out that he enjoys respect  of the population of the Left Bank and the south of the  Republic, inhabited by Gagauzes, as well as is welcome in the  Russian Government.</p>

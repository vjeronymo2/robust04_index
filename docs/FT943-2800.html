			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Palestinian economics chief offers to resign over funding Mr Ahmed Korei, minister of economics and trade in the Palestinian Authority running self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, yesterday expressed grave pessimism over the future of the autonomy process and indicated he was on the point of resigning. In a telephone interview with the Financial Times, Mr Korei, who is also known as Abu Ala, responded to reports that he had already submitted his resignation to the PLO chairman, Mr Yasser Arafat, by saying: 'I am still not resigned officially. The final decision will come in two or three days.' He added that he would not be attending today's weekly meeting of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Palestinian sources suggested that Mr Korei might have filed a letter of resignation, and was now awaiting Mr Arafat's reaction. Mr Korei was arguably the key Palestinian architect of the Israel-PLO autonomy accords, leading Palestinian delegates through the months of secret talks in Oslo that preceded the official signing ceremony at the White House just over a year ago. He is respected by both Israeli economic officials and international donors, and his departure would be a painful blow for Mr Arafat personally and for the fragile autonomy process, which is already being undermined by the non-arrival of hundreds of millions of dollars of pledged international aid. Mr Korei is known to hold Mr Arafat responsible for some of the funding shortages, complaining privately that the PLO chairman is scaring off would-be donors by insisting on personally overseeing the disbursement of funds rather than establishing fully accountable institutions to perform the job. In a veiled attack on Mr Arafat yesterday, he said Japan, Gulf countries, the west and other donors 'want to help the Palestinian cause' but were withholding promised funds 'because they want institutions to deal with'. He noted that 'no more than Dollars 50m' had been received so far, out of Dollars 2.5bn in aid pledges. That lack of money, combined with the slow-moving pace of the autonomy process, he said, left him 'very pessimistic'. He said that, under the terms of the autonomy accords, the Israeli army should by now have redeployed away from Palestinian population centres in the West Bank, that the Israeli civil administration in the occupied territories ought to have been dismantled, and that preparations should have been well in hand for democratic Palestinian elections.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 20 (CTK) -- The Partnership for Peace  project is a partial step and the only "feasible possibility" at  the moment, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus today said, in response  to a question whether Czech-Russian military cooperation could  be considered presently.    After a working luncheon with visiting Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Klaus told journalists that as a  pragmatist who does not build castles in the air, he believed  that it was in the interest of the Czech Republic to join the  Partnership project of European security. He said he hoped he  would sign a document on participation in the project in  Brussels on March 10. "We will gradually seek ways how to  implement it," Klaus said.    He went on to say that the idea to organise any bilateral  Czech- Russian military contacts did not presently occur to him.  "However, this should not be taken as a statement of  fundamental position," he added.    Kozyrev said Russia was developing military cooperation with  some NATO countries, namely bilateral arms supplies, conducting  joint excercises and resolving problems concerning conversion of  arms factories into peace production.    "Czech leaders often emphasise that the Czech Republic is a  small country. I do not want to polemise with them -- maybe it  is small from a geographical point of view, but with regard to  its political importance it is much bigger," Kozyrev said,  adding that Russia is interested in a continued extension of  cultural, spiritual, political and economic contacts with the  Czech Republic.    "I fully agree," Klaus said.    The Czech Republic, he said, strives to become a standard  European country with all that involves, including membership of  standard European organisations, namely the European Union and  NATO. "In this context, for me, the Czech Republic's effort to  join NATO is not primarily measured by our intention to defend  ourselves against a sort of imaginatory Russian threat," Klaus  said.    Being a small country in the heart of Europe and a subject  to  pressure by its neighbours, the "entry into institutions like  NATO is always a positive step for us. But I would not twist  the meaning one or the other side," Klaus added.</p>

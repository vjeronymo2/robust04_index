			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / S African rivals agree to hold talks SOUTH AFRICA'S main black leaders have agreed to meet on Wednesday for talks aimed at breaking a cycle of township violence and accelerating a transition from white rule to democracy, Reuter reports from Cape Town. Church leaders said Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the ANC, and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, president of the Inkatha Freedom party, would meet in Johannesburg. The talks were brokered by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The two men have not held direct talks since April 1991, according to Inkatha offic-ials. Their enmity has been fanned by a war among their supporters which has accounted for most of the 9,000 deaths in black township clashes since President F W de Klerk repudiated apartheid in 1990. The leaders differ on the shape of a future democracy, with Chief Buthelezi demanding virtual autonomy for his KwaZulu tribal homeland and Mr Mandela pressing for strong central government.</p>

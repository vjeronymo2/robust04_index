			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Wimpey's building blocks It would be tempting to view Wimpey's Pounds 104m rights issue as a sign that sunny days are here again for the UK's volume housebuilders. The 55 per cent increase in Wimpey's housing sales this year and its suggestions that prices are firming only reinforces the impression. Investors taking a long view will doubtless appreciate the issue's attractions. Wimpey has lost almost 40 per cent of its shareholder funds since 1989. But now may be the time to bolster its balance sheet to gear up for recovery. Fresh money will be pumped into cheap land and Wimpey's cash-starved quarry businesses at the bottom of the cycle. Wimpey can move from defensive to offensive mode. Unfortunately, the industry's forthcoming results season could reveal a different picture. The surge in housing sales is from an extremely depressed base, with margins remaining under pressure. Wimpey's contracting market is unlikely to pick up until at least 1995. Its minerals business, too, will lag recovery. Things would grow sticky if interest rates rise again later this year. With the sector on a forward multiple of more than 20, there is little room for disappointment. Having seen Wimpey's shares run up from 67p to 187p since September, Mr Joe Dwyer would have had to have been wearing a particularly prickly hair shirt to have shunned the opportunity to tap the market. But that only reinforces the suspicion that Wimpey, at least, did not believe its shares had much further to run. Shareholders might perhaps take the hint.</p>

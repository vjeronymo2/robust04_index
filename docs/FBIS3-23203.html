			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary] A locomotive was damaged when it hit a mine  planted on a bridge between the Hat Yai and Chana rail stations.  The locomotive was on its way to pull a train with a load of  rock from Chana back to Hat Yai.    The incident took place at 0506 today in Ban Thung Phra,  Tambon Paching, Chana District, Songkhla Province, only three  kilometers from the Chana station. The explosion damaged the  front of the locomotive and the tracks. The driver and engineer  were unhurt.    Authorities found two letters from the PULO [Pattani United  Liberation Organization], one written in southern dialect and  the other in Thai, claiming responsibility for the incident.  They want the government to explain the motive behind the  recent torching of schools in the south which, they said, was  not the work of the PULO.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCO DELIVERS ITS 2ND PUNCH IN CLEANER-BURNING GAS WAR  </P> <P> Atlantic Richfield Co. unveiled its second reduced-emissions gasoline Thursday  -- this one for cars using premium unleaded fuel -- and called it the  "cleanest-burning" automobile fuel available in Southern California.  </P> <P> The new Arco product, a high-octane unleaded gasoline called EC-Premium, was  introduced at more than 700 service stations between Santa Barbara and San  Diego and was touted by Arco executives at a Los Angeles news conference and  later in interviews.  </P> <P> The company was the first oil firm to put a reduced-emissions gasoline on the  market, introducing its EC-1 -- a replacement for regular leaded gasoline -- a  year ago.  </P> <P> By introducing another low-emission gasoline -- in this case, a reformulated  product that is replacing Arco's 91-octane super unleaded in the Southland --  the company hopes to impress Congress and the South Coast Air Quality  Management District, an agency that monitors and regulates air quality in Los  Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> Members of Congress and the local district have been developing clean-air  proposals that are likely to mandate tougher gasoline emission standards and  require more use of alternative fuels such as methanol.  </P> <P> "We decided to get out front because we wanted to convince regulators and  legislators that reformulated gasoline was an alternative to regular gasoline  and the most efficient way to clean up the air," Arco Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook  said during an interview Thursday. "We thought it (EC-Premium) would be another  way to reduce pollution, and we decided to go ahead and do it."  </P> <P> Arco said tests of the new gasoline show significant reductions in hazardous  emissions. Arco has about 15% of the premium gasoline market in Southern  California, and the company said that if its current premium customers buy the  same quantities of EC-Premium, auto emissions in the South Coast Air Basin  would be reduced by 43 tons a day. Currently, vehicle emissions in the basin  total about 6,077 tons daily.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based oil firm said the new gasoline emits less carbon monoxide  and less benzene, a carcinogenic chemical. EC-Premium also has reduced levels  of aromatics and olefins, a group of chemical components that contribute to the  formation of smog, company executives said.  </P> <P> Arco is one of a number of oil companies that have introduced cleaner-burning  unleaded gasoline in the past 12 months. Since Arco introduced EC-1 last  September, a number of cleaner-burning unleaded versions have been placed on  the market. Among them are Shell's SU 2000E, Chevron's Supreme Unleaded and  Exxon's Reduced Emissions Exxon Supreme and Exxon Plus.  </P> <P> To compete, Cook said, Arco will sell its new premium at the same price as its  old high-octane product despite the fact that the new EC-Premium costs 4 cents  more per gallon to produce. He said the company hopes to make up the difference  by increasing its sales volume and market share in Southern California.  </P></p>

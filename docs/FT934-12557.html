			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Expansion for Court Cavendish COURT CAVENDISH Group, the care home operator, has acquired a privately owned 32-bed nursing home for Pounds 950,000 in cash. The Kent-based home, Loring Hall Nursing Home, made operating profits of Pounds 203,000 in 1992. The average fee rate is in excess of Pounds 400 a week. Court Cavendish is also in the final stages of negotiations with Gainsborough Homes which, if successful, will lead to a recommended Pounds 2.1m offer being made for all the issued share capital. The two acquisitions will bring the number of beds operated by Court Cavendish to 1,428.</p>

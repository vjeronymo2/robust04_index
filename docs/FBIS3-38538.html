			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kevin Brown and Ivor Owen report: "Major Masks Fury With </F> U.S."]    [Text] Mr John Major yesterday launched a concerted  attempt to paper over deep cracks in the Anglo-American  relationship in the wake of Mr Gerry Adams' visit to New York.    As Mr Major -- who is to visit Washington this month --  moved, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to  British interests caused by the almost unchallenged access to  the U.S. media which the Sinn Fein president enjoyed for 48  hours.    But the government was unable to conceal its dismay at  President Bill Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams.    Publicly, Downing Street put on a brave face. A senior  official said the Anglo-U.S. relationship was "alive and well  and extremely vigorous."    In private ministers and senior officials were bitterly  disappointed at President Clinton's decision to overrule his  most senior advisers.    One senior minister said the president appeared to have put  UK-U.S. relations and the future of the Northern Ireland peace  initiative at risk to placate the U.S.'s vocal Irish-American  lobby.    The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic  coverage given to Mr Adams by the U.S. media, and by the lack of  balancing comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.  A Downing Street official said: "Douglas Hurd worked his arse  off to get himself on American television screens. He has been  pushed off the networks by programmers who have decided that  Gerry Adams is more interesting."    The mood in Downing Street is unlikely to be improved by a  broad hint from Mr Raymond Seitz, the U.S. ambassador to London,  that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr Adams into the U.S.    Officials disclosed that Mr Seitz was called to Downing  Street for talks on Tuesday [1 February] as part of a diplomatic  drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein.  "There was a big tussle in my government about this," Mr Seitz  added.    He hoped Mr Adams' experience in the U.S. would "act as an  encouragement for him to renounce violence and condemn it when  it occurs. We will have to wait and see."    The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the U.S.  vice-president, by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by  Sir Robin Renwick, British ambassador to Washington.    Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity bore  fruit in Mr Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the  Anglo/Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned  the idea of a U.S. "peace envoy" to Belfast.</p>

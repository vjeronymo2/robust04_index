			<p>940722 FT  22 JUL 94 / Italian steel chief 'paid bribes' Mr Alberto Falck, owner of the biggest family steel concern in Italy, is reported to have admitted paying L500m (Pounds 206,600) in bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to soften their controls of his group's balance sheet. The steel magnate is co-operating with magistrates following the issuing of an arrest warrant last week by Milan magistrates investigating alleged corruption in the Guardia di Finanza in Lombardy, according to Ansa, the national news agency. Mr Falck was one of 49 people issued with a warrant on charges of alleged corruption at the moment when the Italian government had approved the controversial decree, since revoked, limiting the use of preventive detention. He was placed under house arrest. His confession emerged as Milan magistrates resumed work this week in the wake of the Berlusconi's government's climb-down on the decree.</p>

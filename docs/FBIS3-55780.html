			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Interior Minister Konstantin </F> Platonov, newly appointed commander of the Belarusian Interior  Troops, by Igor Gukovskiy; place and date not given: "We Do Not  Want To Flex Our Muscles"]    [Text] [Gukovskiy] Your appointment has met with different  kinds of reaction. Some people believe that nominating the new  commander is an attempt to remove troops from under the Interior  Ministry's strict control. The Council of Ministers is  allegedly pursuing the goal of providing governmental  structures' security in case Belarus encounters events similar  to those that occurred in Moscow in October 1993. This is why  they appointed "their man" to this post, someone who is devoted  and reliable.    [Platonov] These are fabrications. Nothing has changed  since my nomination. The functions of the Interior Troops are  the same. Article 1 of the Law on the Interior Troops determines  the status of these troops as a state-controlled armed formation  responsible for protecting lives, health, rights, freedoms, and  personal interests of citizens, society, and the state, its  constitutional structure, as well as the sovereignty and  security of Belarus.    Article 5 adds that the interior minister exercises general  control over the Interior Troops, while direct control is  exercised by the deputy minister, who is in fact the troops'  commander.    Why did they appoint me? I think because 50 percent of my  functions as deputy minister coincided with functions performed  by the Interior Troops command. Combining the two posts seems  like a sound idea to me, preventing the forming of a large  bureaucratic machine. I am an appointed functionary, just like  other interior officers.    [Gukovskiy] You said that nothing had changed since your  appointment. What would you like to change?    [Platonov] I have had too little time for these kinds of  conclusions, while there are a lot of urgent problems. These  include supplies of equipment and materials. Look how poorly  armed our interior troops are.... We will probably turn to the  government for help. The combat readiness of our troops must be  increased.    [Gukovskiy] On the first day of the [13th] Supreme Soviet  session, Independence Square in Minsk was packed with special  equipment and people in militia uniforms, reportedly belonging  to a Belarusian regiment. What kind of unit is that? Did  deputies need such a powerful shield? In my opinion, this gave  the opposition an excuse to accuse the government of using force  to step up tension. According to the Popular Front, this almost  amounted to orchestrating an unconstitutional coup.    [Platonov] The Prosecutor's Office investigated this affair  following a motion from the Popular Front. The mass media  depicted me almost as a dictator who came to arrest the  legislature on that day. This is nonsense. I simply followed  orders. Moreover, that was not Kebich or Danilov who gave these  orders, although newspapers have been describing the latter as a  monster. The orders were issued by the interior minister  himself. Can you imagine what could have happened had I failed  to perform this task and provide for the deputies' safety?    The situation was very tense. On the eve of the session,  Belarusian Servicemen Association Chairman Nikolay Statkevich  was summoned to the KGB offices and notified that in case of  unrest the blame would be put on him. Today, the Servicemen  Association is rejecting everything, but believe me that there  was a great danger of clashes and provocations.    With regard to the Belarusian regiment, I want to underline  that this is quite a different unit performing other functions.  There were no representatives of the regiment in the square.  Minsk residents simply associate this name with the activities  of the former regiment of the USSR Interior Troops used for  operations in hotspots of the former Soviet Union. This  operative regiment has been disbanded and a militia brigade has  been formed on its basis and that of a militia regiment. The  brigade protects public order in the Belarusian capital, also  during mass demonstrations.    [Gukovskiy] One of the tasks of the Interior Troops is  protecting the safety of the Republic and its citizens. In  light of this, how do you assess the activities of the  Belarusian Servicemen Association?    [Platonov] The association was registered by the Ministry of  Justice as a public movement. However, it is evidently  performing political functions. From this perspective, the  association's activities, in my opinion, are illegal. I do not  think that we should have any "armed servicemen" aside from the  Armed Forces. From whom will they protect us?    The nationalist inclination of the Servicemen Association,  the Popular Front, and other similar organizations is very  dangerous. It is good that we have become independent and won  our sovereignty, but we should not overshoot the mark. Take  disputes over the "historic" victory of Orsha, for example.  Have they contributed to Belarusian-Russian friendship? Only  one step separates nationalism and national chauvinism from  fascism. We will continue to keep close watch over any  manifestations of these tendencies.    [Gukovskiy] Do you have problems maintaining relations  with other law enforcement agencies?    [Platonov] Your question must have been prompted by the  well- known letter from the Interior Ministry and KGB leadership  to Shushkevich and Kebich. I cannot be held responsible for the  entire ministry. I have always had good relations with the KGB,  the Defense Ministry, and the State Committee for National  Security and Crime Fighting.    There are no obstacles to our work on the part of Danilov.  Today, neither the KGB nor the Interior Ministry can be left  uncontrolled. Our structure is subordinated to the Council of  Ministers and helps enforcement structures coordinate  activities, draws other ministers and departments into resolving  urgent issues, including issues of material supplies.    We are grateful to the Defense Ministry that has often  helped  us in the past, and which recently granted us one of its  garrisons for training our troops.    [Gukovskiy] How proficient are the Interior Troops?    [Platonov] We have good officers, a majority of whom have  both special military training and experience. Some 800  Belarusian officers have been redeployed to the Republic from  other regions of the CIS. They, too have problems, of which the  housing problem is the most acute. However, the active stance  taken by the government and personally by Vyacheslav Kebich, who  recently visited the troops, gives us hope that they will be  resolved.    Yet, we are disappointed with low proficiency of our active  service soldiers. Military commissariats often draft young  people unfit for the Interior Troops.    [Gukovskiy] You are urging the importance of professional  training, but as far as I know, you were nominated to be deputy  interior minister after working in the Komsomol. This fact is  often cited by your opponents. Could you brief us on the  highlights of your biography?    [Platonov] I was born in Vitebsk in 1940 in a Belarusian  family, although I was registered as a Russian because my family  was evacuated to Krasnoyarsk Kray during the war. I returned to  Belarus in 1961, graduated from the department of physics and  mathematics of Vitebsk Pedagogical Institute, and became a  schoolteacher. Then, I served in the Army and worked in the  Komsomol. My last job here was as first secretary of the  Central Committee. I studied in the Social Sciences Academy  between 1980-1983, where I wrote my dissertation. Then, my life  dramatically changed -- I was directed to work in the Interior  Ministry. Those who blame me for lack of professionalism do not  know that before entering the Academy I took a special course at  the Armed Forces General Staff and received a the rank of  colonel.    [Gukovskiy] Unlike many representatives of the nomenklatura,  you often mention your membership in the CPSU and the years  spent in the Komsomol.    [Platonov] This is not something of which to be ashamed. I  am proud that I worked under the leadership of people like Petr  Masherov. They taught me to be responsible and provided me with  invaluable moral support.    [Gukovskiy] In accordance with the law, you cannot be a  member of any party. What are your political inclinations?    [Platonov] I do not see any powerful political trend whose  ideas I would like to follow. Unfortunately, extreme left-wing  and right-wing views prevail in the political spectrum of  Belarus. Representatives of all these groups know me, because I  often attend their meetings -- that is part of my job.    Times are changing and so are law enforcement agencies.  Earlier, we tried to resolve problems by means of muscle.  Today, we have legal footing for our actions. Neither I nor my  subordinates want to provoke clashes and demonstrate who is the  boss. All issues of contention should be resolved peacefully.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam had  a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday  morning and reaffirmed the Seoul-Washington system for close  consultations on the North Korean nuclear dispute.    President Kim also explained the background of his upcoming  visit to Russia, said Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik.    Kim told Clinton that the international community's efforts  to resolve the nuclear row peacefully face a grave challenge  from North Korea's refueling operation at its 5-megawatt reactor.    Once again, Kim stressed the need for closer consultations  between South Korea and the United States on the nuclear issue,  Chu said.    The phone call, which lasted for about 20 minutes from 8:35  AM (KST), was made as Clinton was preparing to leave Washington  for Europe to attend commemorative events marking the 50th  anniversary of D-day.    The two leaders agreed that the dispute over Pyongyang's  nuclear program has reached a very dangerous point and that  their countries need closer consultations and resolute  cooperation to cope with the situation, Chu said.    Clinton told Kim that the five permanent members of the UN  Security Council are preparing to adopt a council presidential  statement on the issue.    The statement would demand that North Korea immediately stop  changing nuclear fuel rods at the reactor and guarantee  inspections by experts from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), Clinton explained.    Although the statement would make no mention of possible  sanctions against North Korea, Clinton said it would carry an  important point urging Pyongyang to fulfill its obligations to  settle the nuclear row through dialogue, according to Chu.    President Kim expressed his total agreement with the  Security  Council's initial attempt to resolve the issue through dialogue,  Chu said.    But Kim also stressed to Clinton that there may be no other  choice but to proceed with sanctions, the spokesman said.    Clinton said that if the firm cooperative system between  Washington and Seoul was maintained and Japan's and China's  support secured, no problem would arise that could not be  resolved, according to Chu.    President Kim's visit to Russia carries import if he can  secure Russian support on the issue, Clinton said.    Since China initiated the adoption of the Security Council  president's statement on North Korea last time, it would feel  obliged to go along with the United States, Japan and South  Korea, Kim told Clinton.    America's recent renewal of China's most-favored-nation  trading status would also help resolve the nuclear row, Kim  added.    Since both presidents are about to embark on overseas trips,  they have agreed to remain in touch through the phone anywhere  and at any time, Chu said.    Kim and Clinton shared the opinion that they may have to  discuss sanctions against North Korea during their trips, Chu  said.    Asked about the significance of further and apparently  urgent  consultations by Kim and Clinton during their trips, Chu said  the United Nations will have to proceed to sanctions if there is  no sign of resolution following the first warning.</p>

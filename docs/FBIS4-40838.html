			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "Aty-Baty" program] </F>   [Text] We continue our review of the leading military and  political events, of which the main item is the adoption of the  state budget for 1994. The budget allocation for national  defense was one of the fundamental complications in the  ratification of this annual financial plan. May we remind you  that at the first reading of the draft budget, the State Duma,  by a majority of votes, adopted the government proposal and  ratified the military budget in the amount of 37 trillion rubles  [R]. The Duma's decision was turned down by the Federation  Council, which deemed that the expenditure for military needs  should be R56 trillion, and the draft was returned to the lower  house for further examination. The State Duma, in considering  this issue again, came to the conclusion that it could allocate  no more than an additional R4 trillion for all military  expenditures. Thus, the maximum figure the military can count  on in 1994 is R41 trillion.    It is important to note that the shortfall in the amount  requested by the Defense Ministry will most probably be the  substantial reason for not satisfying social needs of servicemen  in the current year, primarily in respect to their housing  needs, daily life, and medical services. The most unexpected  thing in this whole affair was that Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin,  president of Russia, the person on whose backing the Ministry of  Defense counted most of all, supported the Duma's initiative in  limiting the 1994 military budget.</p>

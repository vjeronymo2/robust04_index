			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (28): Pressures will rise - Guest column / A look at the competitive challenges facing the European credit insurance industry Europe's credit insurers face unprecedented changes in their business over the next few years: the industry is continuing to consolidate; former national champions now have to face competition in their home markets; in turn they are attempting to enter foreign markets. The bigger companies are investing large sums in technology to turn their vast stores of data into immediately accessible information. This brings the advantage of greater speed for their customers, and better risk management and accurate pricing for the insurers. Competitive pressures will also increase, not abate, and the process of consolidation will continue, until Europe has only a relatively small number of large international credit insurers. These groups will have to develop their existing skills to cope with the new competitive pressures; they will also have to invest unprecedented amounts in data manipulation, in information technology and in human resources. For credit insurance, the challenge is not so much re-engineering as re-schooling. The core curriculum will be the three Rs: recession, regulation and reinsurance. Recession has always been a factor in credit insurance, which is in itself a cyclical business. When the economy grows, payments are made easily and credit insurance - too often regarded as a palliative against fear rather than a tool of financial risk management - is ignored. As recession hits, customers default and bad debts mount. Even more dangerously, after the recession has touched bottom, companies are tempted to over-trade as recovery appears, often with disastrous results. Despite these difficulties, however, the pattern used to be fairly straightforward for a domestic credit insurer working in its home economy. The current recession has been very different and the exposure of the insurers is now international. There is a further implication for companies as they trade out of recession and into recovery. Barriers to trade within the EU (and, to a lesser extent, internationally as a result of the successful conclusion of the Gatt talks) have fallen, thus creating an intermediate category between domestic and export sales, with the result that companies may be tempted to over-trade in possibly still dangerous external markets and to multiply the The regulatory environment will also present challenges to the credit insurance industry. Regulation both leads and lags commercial reality in different ways. Current levels of competition in the market are the result of a sort of deregulation laid down by the EU's directives on insurance. These have allowed commercial competition across borders and have outlawed direct government intervention. Among the consequences has been the privatisation of the short-term Insurance Services Group (ISG) of the British government's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). The ISG was an anomaly among EU members where commercial credit insurance is usually in the hands of a joint stock company responsible to its shareholders. The EU's encouragement of competition has been welcomed by customers. A British company, for example, can choose its policy from a number of insurers and obtain the right balance of premium and terms and conditions. Insurers, too, welcome the level playing field across Europe and the opportunities it brings. But there are concerns that the European Commission's most recent proposals may be placing insurers in a possibly inappropriate strait jacket. The points at issue are usually called Callut and Tuffrau after the names of the man and woman respectively who have headed up the Commission committees examining short-term credit insurance and medium-term export credit (a combined mechanism of insurance and banking to support large projects). The Callut deliberations have concerned the nature of public and private involvement in credit insurance in covering commercial and political risk. There is widespread agreement that commercial risk (bankruptcy, say, or protracted default) is properly the responsibility of the private sector, but political risk (ranging from the non-availability of convertible currency to war) has provoked different arguments. NCM Credit Insurance, the British arm of the NCM group, insures both types of risk, with the help of a small top-up contribution from the British government intended to cover the gap until the private market is mature enough to assume the whole risk. The Tuffrau proposals are of less direct importance to the credit insurance industry as such and have much greater political significance. In practice, many EU countries (including the Netherlands) use their private insurers to administer the medium term export credit system. The differences are most stark between the British and their continental colleagues. The UK, through ECGD, gives a full guarantee on export credits. Other governments limit their exposure through the insurance mechanism. Reinsurance is, in simple terms, a way for insurers to protect themselves by passing on a proportion of their premium income in return for the reinsurers' assuming a similar proportion of the risk. It also enables the primary insurers effectively to borrow the capital of the reinsurers and thus write more business than their own capital would support. The difference between commercial and political risk has an impact on the suppliers of reinsurance capacity: some reinsurers are enthusiastic providers on the combined treaties of NCM Credit Insurance, while others prefer to adopt a more conservative stance. These three Rs affect all credit insurers and, as competition and consolidation continue, their response will determine which of them will be writing business in the next century - and which will be no more than eminent names with proud histories.

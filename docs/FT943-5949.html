			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Smiles fail to hide gap between Kohl and Yeltsin German chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian president Boris Yeltsin congratulated each other yesterday on the departure of Russian troops from Germany after five decades, but the lingering divide between the two countries echoed in their speeches during a day of ceremony. Although the two men shook hands and smiled at each other, Mr Kohl was determined to use the occasion to boost his chances for re-election next month. He won re-election in 1990 after convincing Russia that it would not be threatened by German unification. A shaky Mr Yeltsin frequently referred to the role of Russian troops in saving Germany from the 'tyranny and terror' of Hitler and also to the 12m Russians who had died while ridding Europe of the Nazis. He did not mention the Berlin Wall, Stalin or the Russian control over East Germany. However, Mr Kohl did remind the audience. At the Schauspielhaus, east Berlin's beautifully restored concert hall, he said that 'the pact between the dictators Hitler and Stalin removed the last barrier to the war which the National Socialist tyranny unleashed shortly afterwards'. And he explained why he had opposed the Russians joining in next week's ceremony saying farewell to British, US and French troops from Berlin. 'Terrible harm was done to the Russian people by the Germans and in the name of the German people . . . but we Germans were destined to live through the painful division of our country,' he said. 'The blockade of Berlin, the totalitarian regime in the east of our country, the wall and barbed wire were a heavy and lasting burden on our relations.' Mr Yeltsin tried another tack. Armed with a speech written by the Russian defence ministry, he praised the Conference on Security and Co-operation (CSCE), a non-military organisation grouping western, eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics, and one in which Russia is seeking a much greater role. This, he said was 'the real forum for stability and security from Vancouver to Vladivostok'. Mr Kohl seemed not to hear. At the Schauspielhaus, and later at Treptow Park in east Berlin, home to the giant Soviet war memorial, he did not even mention the CSCE. Instead, he said the 'signed agreements between Russia and Nato on Partnership for Peace, and on co-operation with the European Union are essential building blocks for the European House'. German defence officials dutifully nodded in agreement, but the divide between the two leaders was painfully apparent.</p>

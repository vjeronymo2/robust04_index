			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 530 ] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, June 27, ELTA -- Seimas faction of  Homeland's Union delivered a letter to Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas with the request for Brazauskas to appeal  to the Constitutional Court to prevent the resolution of the  government on selling private land.    The government made the resolution on selling private land  in March, and Homeland's Union refused to agree with  it.    According to the resolution, the boards of the districts  were commissioned until August 1 to register permissions to buy  2-3 hectare lots for those who would submit requests until July  1.    Monitor of Homeland's Union Andrius Kubilius told a  news conference that this resolution violated the Constitution.  "The resolution denies the rights to the property of the former  landowners", Kubilius maintained.    He also reminded that the state could not sell out 2-3  hectare lots because it was not the owner of the land. The  state had not bought the land from the owners. The law to  allot 2-3 hectare lots for a certain category of people was  passed by the Lithuanian Supreme Council in 1990. However,  leaders of the opposition claimed that most of the lots were  alloted illegally.</p>

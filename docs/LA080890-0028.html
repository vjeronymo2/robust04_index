			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2ND BUCKEY TRIAL ENDS IN DEADLOCK  </P> <P> I was sickened and infuriated to hear of the jury deadlock on Ray Buckey.  Buckey claims he is innocent. The true innocent are the dozens of helpless  children and damaged families in this case.  </P> <P> I am a victim of sexual abuse. I was also intimately involved in a child  molestation case where the victim had physical evidence, testimony from  psychologists, and a telephone confession from the perpetrator. We watched as  the accused smirked at the child (who was forced to be present, though she was  only 6) and laughed at the parents as he plea-bargained (he pleaded guilty to a  lesser charge) his way to only 30 days in the county jail. Five years later the  girl and her family are finally leaving therapy from the horror and devastation  his crime caused.  </P> <P> My heart goes out to the children and the families of the McMartin case. To  them I say, "I believe you. I know you are telling the truth."  </P> <P> For myself I felt there was, could be, no God present to allow such travesties  to take place, and in your case, to reoccur time after time in useless  courtrooms. All I can offer is this: In my mind I see God crying too.  </P> <P> And slowly we heal.  </P> <P> MARGO N. MATEAS  </P> <P> Palm Desert  </P></p>

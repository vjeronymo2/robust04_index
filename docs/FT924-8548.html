			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Paris, Rome in new chip venture funding The French and Italian governments agreed yesterday to pour FFr5.4bn (Pounds 640m) into SGS-Thomson, their jointly controlled semiconductor manufacturer, over the next five years. The 'recapitalisation' and provision of additional R&amp;D funding of Europe's only remaining independent chip-maker was agreed at the Franco-Italian government summit yesterday. The additional French funds for SGS-Thomson will be channelled through the three state shareholders - Thomson CSF, CEA-Industrie and France Telecom. IRI, the Italian state holding company, holds a 45 per cent share in the company, with the remaining 5 per cent held by the latter's high technology subsidiary, Finmeccanica. However, it is more likely that the bulk of the Italian funds will be funneled through ENEA, the state nuclear and alternative energy research institute. This would make ENEA a shareholder in the venture and mean that Italy is emulating an ownership similar to that of France. France has been pressing Italy, which is trying to restrain its ballooning public deficit, to find more money for SGS-Thomson since September when the French government brought in CEA-Industrie, the industrial arm of its Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, and France Telecom to help Thomson-CSF out.</p>

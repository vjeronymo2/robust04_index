			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR ANSWERED OAKLAND MAYOR'S COMPLAINT ABOUT ROTHENBERG PAROLE  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian says that he listened to Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson's  telephoned complaint about Charles Rothenberg being paroled there, but that if  he had had his way there would have been no parole at all.  </P> <P> Rothenberg is the man who was released from prison in January after serving 6  1/2 years for the arson attack on his son, David.  </P> <P> The son, now 13 and severely disfigured, lives with his mother in Orange County  and says he does not want to see his father again.  </P> <P> Deukmejian issued a statement Monday saying he told Wilson that Rothenberg had  to be paroled far away from his son and that he is under 24-hour supervision  and electronic surveillance.  </P> <P> He said he also told Wilson that it is precisely because of the threat to  public safety that convicted felons like Rothenberg represent that his  Administration has worked to add 14 new prisons to the state system.  </P></p>

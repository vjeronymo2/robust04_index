			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Management: Solo sailor seeks broader horizons - Nigel Rowe reports from the high seas on the pursuit of a Big Hairy Ambitious Goal and the salary that went with it - to fulfil a dream that had become something of an obsession, I attended a conference in London on global excellence. The conference, organised by the Confederation of British Industry, the employers' organisation, had been inspired and sponsored by BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group. It was my last duty for the company. John Stopford, of the London Business School, was one of the principal speakers and, like all business school professors, he could not resist the opportunity to coin a new phrase. What British industry needed, he said, were Big Hairy Ambitious Goals. I sat at the back of the hall and smiled. Yes, I thought, I knew what it was like to have a BHAG, even if the professor and the 250 company directors present might not too readily relate to it. For I was about to compete in the BOC Challenge 1994-95 single-handed, round-the-world race. As I left the conference I took off my tie and dropped it into a waste bin in Tottenham Court Road. Perhaps it was a childish act of worthless symbolism, but I remember doing the same when I left school. I flew to the US two days later to ready my 48ft sailing boat Sky Catcher for the last phase of our preparations together - two transatlantic crossings, including a single-handed race in July, also sponsored by BOC. We left Charleston, South Carolina, just before midnight on Thursday 12 May  -it being a tradition born out of superstition that one should not begin a passage on a Friday, least of all on one that carried with it the additional stigma of being the 13th. Now, a little over a week and two gales later, we are about a third of the way across to Falmouth, and I have had time to reflect on what brought me here. My guess is a combination of balance, opportunity and curiosity (it may be some time before I can shake off the initials BOC). Very few of us achieve a healthy balance of interests and contrast in our lives. A successful business makes many demands on its managers. Life's priorities are driven overwhelmingly by those at the office. Further, the more senior one's position, the more dependant corporate man becomes on the trappings and comforts of higher office. Less and less of this experience is enriching in any but a material way and it is often poor preparation for the rest of life. I know too many people who were burned out when they retired to face a long list of things they wished they had done and now cannot. I want to avoid that. Opportunities must be grasped when they appear. But another lesson from corporate life is that they can also be created, even if at some cost. I was fortunate to be able to negotiate this opportunity and was prepared to meet the cost in terms of loss of salary and future security. But curiosity has been the principal motivation in this endeavour. I am curious about what it will teach me about myself as well as other people, places and things. I am also curious about what will be demanded of me to meet the challenge of this undertaking. I initiated BOC's sponsorship of the BOC Challenge more than 12 years ago when I had been sailing for only a couple of years. Such feats as a solo circum- navigation were beyond my imagination then. The 1994-95 race, which starts from Charleston on September 17th, will be its fourth edition. Now, I have many thousands of miles of sailing experience; but I know nothing of the windless doldrums or of the Southern Ocean with its screaming winds, icebergs and the infamous Cape Horn. I am curious about how I shall deal with all of that. Knowledge gained from a long and happy life in the corporate womb may not help me much. The author is the former chief executive of corporate relations for the BOC Group. This report was filed from Sky Catcher in the North Atlantic.</p>

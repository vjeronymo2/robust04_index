			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAST SUSPECT IN TEEN'S MURDER SURRENDERS  </P> <P> The third and last suspect in the shooting death of 17-year-old Rosendo Ibarra  has surrendered to the Orange County Sheriff's Department, police said Friday.  </P> <P> Garden Grove police had obtained a warrant for Joseph David Kehler's arrest on  charges of murder and street terrorism, and had been looking for him since  Monday.  </P> <P> Kehler, 23, walked into the Sheriff's Department in Santa Ana at 12:20 a.m.  Thursday and surrendered, Garden Grove Police Detective Mike Handfield said. He  is being held in Orange County Jail on $250,000 bail.  </P> <P> In previous statements to police, Kehler has said he drove several teen-agers  to a Garden Grove shopping center on April 30 when Ibarra was gunned down at a  pay phone there, but he said he did not know the others were planning to kill  Ibarra.  </P> <P> Handfield, however, said Friday that Kehler was involved in the plot and  supplied the gun that was used to kill Ibarra.  </P> <P> The gun was thrown out the window of Kehler's car a few blocks from the murder  scene, where police later recovered it, Handfield said.  </P> <P> "We were taken to the gun by an informant, and we had information that Kehler  was seen with a gun that matched that identical description the day before the  shooting," Handfield said. "We're alleging that he provided the gun that was  used in the shooting. That makes him a principal."  </P> <P> Two other suspects, Martin Rene Rodriguez, 21, and a 15-year-old boy whose name  was not released because of his age, are already in custody. The boy was  arrested in a police raid Monday. Rodriguez surrendered at the Garden Grove  Police Department on Tuesday. Police charge that Rodriguez fired the shots that  killed Ibarra. Rodriguez told relatives he was turning himself in because he  was innocent.  </P> <P> Kehler is expected to be arraigned in Orange County Municipal Court in  Westminster on Monday, Handfield said.  </P></p>

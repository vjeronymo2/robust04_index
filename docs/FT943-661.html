			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Saudi prince buys 25% of Four Seasons Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talaal, the Saudi investor, is expanding his fast-growing leisure and entertainment interests by paying CDollars 165m (Pounds 78m) for a 25 per cent stake in Four Seasons Hotels, the Toronto-based luxury hotel chain. The prince, who is the largest single shareholder in Citicorp, the biggest US bank, has also acquired interests over the past two years in the Euro Disney leisure group, the New York department store Saks Fifth Avenue, and the San Francisco-based Fairmont hotel chain. Most recently, he joined Accor, the French hotel group, in an unsuccessful bid to buy the Meridien luxury hotel chain from Air France. Accor and the prince were defeated by a rival bid from Forte, the UK hotel and restaurants group. Prince Al-Waleed will pay CDollars 22 for each Four Seasons share, representing a 54 per cent premium on the market price. Although Four Seasons' operating performance has improved recently, analysts have expressed concern about its debt exposure. The prince has also agreed to invest CDollars 100m to acquire or develop hotels for Four Seasons and its affiliated Regent chain, starting with a property under development in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Mr Charles Henry, a former investment banker recently hired by the prince to oversee his hotel investments, said yesterday that 'we see long-term value there which the market wasn't recognising'. Mr Henry said Four Seasons fitted Prince Al-Waleed's strategy of investing in capital-intensive, global businesses with strong brand names. The deal follows a search by Mr Isadore Sharp, Four Seasons' founder and chairman, for an outside investor with the resources to finance the chain's future expansion, who would at the same time allow him to plan for retirement. Mr Roger Garland, Four Seasons' executive vice president, said the deal would provide liquidity for Mr Sharp's estate, while minimising disruption in management. Mr Sharp, who turns 63 next week, will retain 65 per cent of Four Seasons' voting shares and will continue as chief executive. According to Mr Garland, Mr Sharp 'has no intention to sell more shares'. Prince Al-Waleed will appoint two directors to Four Seasons' board, and has a right of first refusal on Mr Sharp's remaining shares. He also has a 'piggy-back' right to join Mr Sharp in selling their shares to a third party. Four Seasons and Regent own or manage 44 hotels and resorts in 19 countries. Expansion is likely to focus on Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It has 'a long list of potential opportunities which we'll have to discuss with the prince,' Mr Garland said.</p>

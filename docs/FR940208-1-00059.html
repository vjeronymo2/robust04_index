			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments on the proposed approaches to monitoring the vacuum assist system, or vapor collection and processing systems, and any other suggested approaches are requested. In particular, the Agency requests that commenters submit data on parameters or values of parameters that might be used to better establish performance of these devices and continuous compliance with the emission standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> G. Selection of Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed standards would require an owner or operator to submit the following four types of reports:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Initial Notification,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Notification of Compliance Status,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Periodic Reports, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Other reports.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> The purpose and contents of each of these reports are described in this section. The proposed rule requires all reports to be submitted to the ``Administrator.'' The term Administrator refers either to the Administrator of the Agency, an Agency regional office, a State agency, or other entity that has been delegated the authority to implement this rule. In most cases, reports will be sent to State agencies. Addresses are provided in the proposed General Provisions (subpart A) of 40 CFR part 63.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Records of reported information and other information necessary to document compliance with the regulation are generally required to be kept for 5 years. Records pertaining to the design and operation of the control and monitoring equipment must be kept for the life of the equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Initial Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed standards would require owners or operators who are subject to today's proposed standards under 40 CFR part 63, subpart R to submit an Initial Notification. This report notifies the agency of applicability for existing facilities or of construction for new facilities as outlined in &sect;63.5 of the proposed General Provisions, whichever is applicable. A respondent must also report any facility modifications as defined in &sect;63.5 of the proposed General Provisions. This report will establish an early dialogue between the source and the regulatory agency, allowing both to plan for compliance activities. The notice is due within 45 days after the date of promulgation for existing sources. For new sources, it is due 180 days before commencement of construction or reconstruction, or 45 days after promulgation of today's proposed rules, whichever is later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Initial Notification must include a statement as to whether the source can achieve compliance by the specified compliance date. If an existing source anticipates a delay that is beyond its control, it is important for the owner or operator to discuss the problem with the regulatory authority as early as possible. This report will also include a description of the parameter monitoring system intended to be used in conjunction with the vapor processing system. Pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act, the proposed standards contain provisions for a 1-year compliance extension to be granted by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. Further discussion of compliance issues is included in section VI.H of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Notification of Compliance Status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Notification of Compliance Status (NCS) would be submitted no later than 30 days after the facility's initial performance test. It contains the information necessary to demonstrate that compliance has been achieved, such as the results of the initial performance test on the vapor processing system and results of the LDAR monitoring program. The submission of the performance test report will allow the regulatory authority to verify that the source has followed the correct sampling and analytical procedures, and has performed all calculations correctly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Included in the performance test report submitted with the NCS would be the calculation of the operating parameter value for the selected operating parameter to be monitored in the vapor processing system. The notification must include the data and rationale to support this parameter value as ensuring continuous compliance with the emission limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

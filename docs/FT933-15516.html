			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Bespak to Pounds 11.5m and shares jump 56p SHARES IN Bespak jumped 56p to 518p as the medical valve and component maker reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.92m to Pounds 11.5m in the year to end-April. The outcome reflected a first full-year contribution from US-based Tenax Corporation, which moulds plastic medical components and was bought from private owners for Pounds 33.1m in March 1992. The US company contributed about Pounds 4.8m to operating profits of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 6.79m). Group turnover, including the acquisition, improved to Pounds 61.8m (Pounds 38.8m) and operating margins from 17.5 to 18.3 per cent. Mr Bob King, chairman and chief executive, said sales of pharmaceutical valves were slow in the first six months due to significant customer de-stocking, but overall sales of pharmaceutical products had risen 16 per cent during the year. Sales of devices for laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) improved on the previous year, but increased competition and de-stocking caused a fall in business towards the end of the year. He said sales from Tenax and Bespak's rest-of-world operations grew at more than 10 per cent: 'Despite recent concerns about the healthcare market, there is a growing need in all developed healthcare markets for medical devices and systems that will safely dispense powerful drugs.' Interest receivable rose to Pounds 199,000 (Pounds 134,000). A proposed final dividend of 6p makes a 10p (9p) total. Earnings per share rose to 31.9p (24.8p). COMMENT Bespak is good at safely delivering drugs to patients. Now it is working on delivering profits to shareholders after analysts downgraded forecasts in April and the shares fell sharply. Yesterday's share price jump signalled returning confidence in the company's fundamental strengths. Its products have secure market niches and it has taken steps to broaden its once narrow customer base. Sales to Glaxo are now under 25 per cent of total turnover compared with more than 70 per cent a few years back. However, demand is changing as patents expire on the drugs its devices deliver and generic suppliers invade the market. Even so, Bespak products might be used by the new drug suppliers. Meanwhile, continued demand for its main products - drug valves for asthmatics and components for laparoscopy - is virtually assured. On a prospective p/e of 13.8 the shares look cheap compared to previous highs of 15 or 16 which the market expects to see again.</p>

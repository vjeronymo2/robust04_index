			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greece experiences record olive oil shortfall A GREEK farmer's prosperity is no longer judged by the number of olive trees he owns, but in an average year, exports of table olives and olive oil still account for almost one-quarter of the farm sector's foreign earnings. In the past few months, however, the situation has been dramatically reversed. Instead of sending up to 100,000 tonnes of olive oil abroad, mostly as bulk sales to Italy, Greece was forced to import about 40,000 tonnes to cover a record shortfall caused by last year's disastrous drought. Most came from Spain, with smaller quantities from Tunisia and Morocco. There has been little publicity over the imports, which are blended with stronger-tasting Greek oil in an attempt to disguise their origin. 'Greek consumers go to a lot of trouble to find good-quality olive oil. They often prefer to bring back a few months' supply from a village rather than buy it in the supermarket. Using foreign oil is almost sacrilege,' says an olive oil merchant from the Peloponnese. The Peloponnese and the island of Crete contribute two-thirds of total olive oil production, amounting to about 320,000 tonnes in a normal year. Last winter only 195,000 tonnes were produced, a drop of nearly 40 per cent. Producer prices doubled to about Dr1,000 (Dollars 5.2) per kilogram. The drought is blamed for a 10 per cent fall in gross agricultural product in 1990, with cereals and olives the worst affected crops. Winter rainfall was down to half the usual amount. Fruit and vegetable production suffered less, though in many areas irrigation had to be cut back. Overall drought losses to farmers were estimated at Dr200bn (Dollars 1.05bn). The table olive crop declined from 80,000 tonnes to about 50,000 tonnes, leaving virtually no margin for exports. Only 3,000 tonnes of oil have been sold abroad this year. Exports of table olives usually bring in Dollars 80m annually, while oil earns more than Dollars 200m. The best quality oil comes from a few areas where the olives are picked by hand while still slightly unripe, rather than beaten off the tree or left to drop into nets. These districts were among those most badly hit by the drought. In Laconia, a Peloponnese province where most trees are hand picked, overall production was down by close to 60 per cent. 'The crop was so small that careful picking made hardly any difference. We'd actually have a shortage here if we didn't have a reserve left from last year,' says Mr Constantine Panteleakis, the district's agricultural director. With the introduction in recent years of new varieties and improved cultivation methods, the Greek olive crop is less subject to fluctuations in alternate years, caused by the trees' biennial production cycle. While the number of olive trees remains stable at about 125m in accordance with European Community regulations, average production has risen by about 15 per cent during the past decade. Although rainfall was heavy in the past winter and considerable amounts of snow fell in mainland Greece, ground water levels are still believed to be 50 per cent below the 15-year average in much of the country. 'Olive trees are still at risk, because last year's severe drought came after two very dry winters. Even before that, the frosts in 1987 had damaged a large number of trees', says Mr Nicholas Craze of Harvest Commodities, which tracks Greek agricultural production. A good crop is, however, expected this year, with olive oil production surpassing 360,000 tonnes according to early forecasts. 'It's too early to be sure because the trees are still coming into flower but we think the Cretan crop should be well above average', says Mr Manolis Daskalakis, a grower outside Heraklion in central Crete. The Agriculture Ministry is forecasting a bumper cereals harvest this year following sharply reduced production in 1990, when Greece was struck by its worst drought this century. Snowfalls and heavy winter rain in central and north eastern Greece, the main grain-growing regions, have put moisture back in soil dried out by three consecutive years of less than average rainfall. Durum wheat output is expected to reach 1.7m tonnes, up from only 1m tonnes last year. Soft wheat should reach 900,000 tonnes, compared with 680,000 tonnes last year. Overall wheat production declined by 30 per cent in 1990.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Buchwald-Case Warning: Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider said  he may have to have his own expert examine Paramount Pictures' books because of  the "ephemeral" nature of material that has been supplied by Paramount and Art  Buchwald in their dispute over profits from the film "Coming to America." He  warned the two sides that if testimony produces only "platitudes and all kinds  of generalizations" about Hollywood accounting practices, he will ask an  outside party to sort out the truth. Hearings are expected to begin in  mid-October.  </P></p>

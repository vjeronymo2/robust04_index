			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Daf claims creation of 1,200 extra jobs About 1,200 extra jobs have been created in the businesses which arose out of the crash of Daf, the UK-Dutch truckmaker, early last year. According to Mr David Gill, managing director of Leyland Daf Trucks, another 3,600 have been created at component suppliers. Mr Gill said that of the total 1,500 were in the UK, with the rest on the Conti-nent. When the British businesses were revived, mainly by management buy-outs from the Daf receivers, they collectively employed 2,700. This total had risen to 3,200, said Mr Gill, with another 1,000 spread among suppliers. The UK businesses comprise Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, a management buy-out led by Mr John Gilchrist; LDV, another buy-out led by Mr Allan Amey; and the similar ventures Albion Automotive and the distribution company Multipart. Mr Gill's company, Leyland Daf Trucks, is the UK marketing subsidiary of Daf itself.</p>

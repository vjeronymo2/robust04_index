			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Indonesian utility to issue bonds PLN, Indonesia's state-owned electricity utility, is to raise Rp300bn (Dollars 148m) on the local capital market, the first time the company has turned to the private sector for finance. The five-year, floating rate bonds, expected to be issued by the end of the month, will carry values ranging from Rp100,000 to Rp100m each. The interest rate for the first six months will be 19.5 per cent, about 100 basis points above average bank deposit rates. The rate will then be set at 95 basis points with interest payments every three months. Indonesia requires about Dollars 30bn of investment in the power sector before the end of the decade if it is to keep pace with demand. Much of the funding is expected to be on concessional terms from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The decision to raise finance domestically has been been prompted by the government's concern at Indonesia's international debt estimated at Dollars 80bn, PLN officials say.</p>

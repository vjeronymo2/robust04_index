			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Milan - Other Markets Trade in Italian equity futures begins today but analysts expect the contract to smoulder, rather than explode into life, on its debut. The Fib-30 contract, based on Italy's 30 most traded stocks grouped in the revamped Mib-30 index, is a vital weapon in Milan's battle to become a thoroughly modern market and is expected to provide a welcome boost to liquidity - eventually. However, the anticipated benefits will be slow in arriving, due to a mix of seasonal and technical factors, with a delay in moving stocks to cash settlement likely to restrain the system's use. One analyst said the contracts were arriving at a time when volumes on the bourse were already very low. Dealers added that many houses will not be able to use the new instruments, even if they wanted to, with half of the 99 work stations requested expected to be out of action today because full communications networks are not yet in place. Stock exchange officials have predicted that the contract will draw daily trade of around L400bn, but most analysts said that was likely to be at the top end of turnover in the opening weeks, with trade in the underlying shares stumbling to just L353bn last Thursday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- During the Second  Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], Li Ruihuan, member of  the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, met and had  a cordial conversation with [Yaoxi Sulangzhuoma], a CPPCC member  who was attending the session in Beijing and the mother of the  Tenth Panchen Lama.    Li Ruihuan said: I am very pleased to meet you. The Panchen  Lama and I were good friends. His death has deprived our  country of a very prestigious religious leader, and our party  has lost a good friend. The Panchen made outstanding  contributions to Tibet's development and stability and to  China's nationality and religious work. I hope there will be  more nationality and religious figures like the Panchen, who was  dedicated to safeguarding the unification of the motherland and  to promoting national unity and economic development. This is  the basic guarantee for stability, prosperity, and development  in the nationality areas. [passage omitted] [Yaoxi  Sulangzhuoma] said gratefully: I am 78 this year and very  healthy. I am grateful to the party Central Committee, the CPC  Central Committee United Front Work Department, and the Tibetan  and Qinghai authorities for their concern for me. To express  her gratefulness, she presented a piece of scarf to Li Ruihuan.    Present at meeting were Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the  CPPCC National Committee and director of the CPC Central  Committee United Front Work Department, and deputy head of the  department Li Dezhu [Li Dek Su].</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Chong Yong-pae: A panel discussion on "How To </F> Strengthen TDX Exports" attended by Pak Song-tuk, director of  the Communications Policy Office of the Ministry of  Communications; So Sang-to, managing director of Goldstar  Information &amp; Communications; Pak Ha-ku, managing director of  Korea Communications Engineering; Ho Song-pu, director of Daewoo  Telecom; Kim No-chol, center director of Korea Telecom; Kim  Yong-ki, director of Samsung Electronics; Im Chu-hwan, group  leader of the Electronics and Telecommunications Research  Institute; moderated by Kim Chong-nam, executive director of the  Communications Industries Association]    [Text] The market for telecommunication equipment,  including private area branch exchange devices, has been  liberalized, allowing foreign companies in this field to set up  operations in the country. The limited domestic demand plus the  foreign competition in the country now leave Korean  manufacturers unable to rely on the domestic market alone. To  find a way for survival, they must strengthen exports. Following  are views of government, business and association officials on  this subject, with a focus on ways and means to increase exports  of the indigenously developed digital switching system, TDX.  (Editor)    --Kim Chong-nam: The nation's market for telecommunication  equipment has been largely liberalized by multilateral and  bilateral agreements. This is no time for our firms to stick to  the domestic market alone; they must be more active to develop  markets overseas. What is your views on how to strengthen  exports of the indigenously developed digital switching system,  TDX, including TDX-10.    --Ho Song-pu: Daewoo has so far exported a total of 20,000  circuits to Iran and 50,000 circuits to the Uzbek Republic. This  year it will concentrate more on exports, particularly to  central Asian countries. We are already pushing exports to a few  countries in that region. We took part in the bidding for 3.6  million circuits in Iran, in which three companies are left in  the final round of competition now. Of them, Daewoo is a strong  candidate. A small-type switching system was developed last  year, which we plan to export to China for the first time. In  that respect, Daewoo is near an agreement with China on setting  up a joint venture; negotiations are in the final phase.  Daewoo's total exports so far are 70,000 circuits.    --Kim Yong-ki: Samsung is already exporting to China,  Russia,  and South American and East European countries. Through the end  of last year, it exported a total of 520,000 circuits--200,000  to Russia, 120,000 to China, 50,000 to South America, and  150,000 to East Europe. We plan to focus more on countries where  we already set up our operations, exporting an additional 1.5  million circuits by the end of this year. Samsung plans to  export a small-type set, TDX-1B, to China, and the large  100,000-circuit system to Russia.    --Kim Chong-nam: Tell us about difficulties you experienced  concerning exports, and how you worked on them.    --Kim Yong-ki: First, it was the funding problem. In placing  an order for a large project, the ordering country is usually  unable to do so with its own fund alone. Potential TDX importers  are mostly poor countries. So, to promote exports, we have to  give them loans. To support their switching system exports,  Japan disbursed more than $51.99 billion and Germany $88.25  billion from their respective foreign economic cooperation funds.    Korea's foreign economic cooperation fund is 430.2 billion  won [W], of which only W92.6 billion was put out in support of  TDX exports. We have difficulties in terms of funding support,  too, for in Germany's case, it is an installment payment over 30  years at an interest rate of 0.75% to 2% per annum  but, in our  case, the rate is much higher. Because of this, Samsung suffered  a defeat in Hungary. At the last minute of signing the contract,  Hungary turned us down in favor of Germany.    They told us then that their was no problem with our offer,  the model and everything else, but the terms of funding. It  shows what is the biggest difficulty in TDX exports.    Also, when making inroads into underdeveloped countries, we  need the certification of payment but the Export Insurance  Corporation simply refuses to provide it. This is one of the  problems that should be corrected promptly. So far, there has  been not a single case in which the corporation granted the  certification.    --Ho Song-pu: Daewoo also finds the funding support the  biggest problem. In Iran's case, it demands cooperation in  funding as a precondition of bidding. In the latest bidding,  Iran demands that our bank file an official document with the  Iranian bank promising its funding support. We are worried if  the Korean Export-Import Bank will respond favorably. Concerning  our plan to export TDX-10 to Iran, we met problems with the  Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM). We wonder why  we are still subject to COCOM restrictions while U.S. firms  already set up joint ventures in Russia.    --So Sang-to: What Goldstar can do now is to set up  operations in developing countries, for we find it difficult to  make inroads into the markets of the advanced nations. But the  lack of funds is our problem, too.    --Kim Yong-ki: When we export TDX, we must invite technical  workers from the importing country for training. In this case,  the process of obtaining visas for them takes too long a time.  Also, the officially required testing procedures are too  complicated for newly developed devices.    --Kim Chong-nam: I understand that COCOM restrictions were  lifted at the end of March this year, except for exports to  Iran, Iraq and North Korea. That was after that that U.S. firms  could set up operations in Russia.    --Kim No-chol: Companies should make efforts to win the  certification of the international quality standard  organization, ISO 9000. Korea Telecom will make its efforts to  win designation as a certifying agency. Developing countries  will sooner or later demand the ISO 9000 certification on our  products. We should be prepared for it.    --Kim Chong-nam: Let's talk about the question of testing  and  evaluating on TDX compatibility.    --Im Chu-hwan: The Electronics and Telecommunications  Research Institute is preparing for equipment to be used for the  testing and evaluation. We cannot do it right now but will soon  be able to provide the service.    --Pak Song-tuk: Korea set out to develop the small-type  switching system in the early 1970's. It now has its own system.  Companies should not entirely depend on the Ministry of  Communications [MOC] in developing markets overseas. Even inside  the government, some wonder why the MOC should be playing a  leading role with exports by businesses. It is a fact, however,  that the MOC is giving greater assistance to firms trying to  make inroads into foreign markets than before. Most important in  promoting switching system exports is to gain the importing  nations' trust. In this respect, the MOC backs up businesses by  promoting trust-based relationships with importing countries.  For instance, we invite students from underdeveloped nations for  four to six weeks of training in Korea. These things help gain  their confidence. In Romania's case, students who had received  such training strongly asked their government to import TDX.  This led to TDX exports to Romania. The government's role is to  render that type of support. The government has also disbursed a  great deal of money from its foreign economic cooperation fund.  In the interest rate, too, we are constantly striving to bring  it down to the advanced nations' levels.    --Kim No-chol: The largest annual order Korea Telecom has  ever placed was 2.78 million circuits. It's order for this year,  however, is estimated at 1 million circuits. Domestic demand for  switching systems is on the decline every year. We will,  nevertheless, endeavor for an upturn.    --Kim Chong-nam: The switching system is a high-tech complex  type of computer, semiconductor and communication device. It has  a greater value added than other manufactured goods and is  highly effective in inducing exports of related equipment.  Therefore, business firms should no longer see it as separate  commodities but part of a package. They should establish export  strategy based on that concept, including tie-ups between  businesses.    --Pak Ha-ku: Korea Communications Engineering is in charge  of  supporting exports. Its duty is to curb excessive competition  and promote autonomous adjustments among the four companies in  penetrating into foreign markets. Currently, we are conducting  such adjustments with 78 importers. In the past, there were  cases in which more than one company set up operations in the  same importing country, causing the price to fall and creating  confusion in that country. We have no such problems now. Korea  Communications Engineering is doing designing and counseling  services for developing countries.    --Pak Song-tuk: Business firms should show greater concern  about foreign trainees, because they play a significant role in  their governments' choosing our models.    --Pak Ha-ku: With the switching system alone, the value  added  is limited. We should make a comprehensive approach with related  products, including lines and networks. Korea recently received  Brunei's order for 5 years of maintenance and repair services.  This shows that we can sell equipment to guarantee operations,  too.    --Kim Chong-nam: We should conduct effective promotional  activities to convince importers that TDX, our mainstay item, is  superior in quality. Dacom Corporation had been using a U.S.  model when it recently tried to add a new function. Finding that  it has to pay an exorbitant price for new software, Dacom is  reportedly considering switching to a domestic model. In short,  Dacom's case shows that the domestic model is less expensive and  better in quality. We should bring the fact to the attention of  all importing countries.    --Pak Song-tuk: International trust is important. We could  make inroads into Chinese markets because the Chinese trusted us.    --Kim Chong-nam: On the private level, a memorandum of  understanding was exchanged between the Korea Communications  Industries Association and the China Posts and  Telecommunications Industries General Corporation. As a result,  China will invite a Korean delegation in May, and a bilateral  communications cooperation program will be adopted at that time.  We will invite a Chinese delegation in the latter half of this  year. We will have them inspect our industries during the visit  and, if they have any requests then, we will add them to the  program.    --Pak Song-tuk: The Chinese corporation is sending a  50-member delegation to Korea. The members are very important  because they will make the decision on the proposed TDX import.    --Kim Chong-nam: The matter of international trust is being  taken care of by the government, and I am sure that there will  be improvement in the funding issue, too, in the future.  Therefore, all there is left for business firms to do, I think,  is to effectively use joint export strategy through tie-ups and  endeavor to develop markets overseas.</p>

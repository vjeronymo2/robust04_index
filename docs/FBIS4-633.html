			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- Politicians, VIPs and  journalists met at a central Johannesburg hotel on Tuesday [12  April] night to welcome seven international mediators who will  attempt to resolve constitutional differences between the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the African National Congress  and stem violence in Natal/kwaZulu.    Mediation spokesman former U.S. Secretary of State Dr Henry  Kissinger told the conference, which was attended by IFP leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi and ANC Natal Premier Jacob Zuma, the  country was worth the trouble.    "This is a country that's suffered like few others; been  divided like few others...it's worth the dedication and effort."    Mr Kissinger said that if anybody had told him when at the  time of Zimbabwe's independence he would be in South Africa 18  years later, "with apartheid a memory," he would have thought  the person crazy.    He said he had met both ANC leader Nelson Mandela and Mr  Buthelezi in previous years. Mr Mandela was "one of the great  figures of the epoch...and I remember how passionately Mr  Buthelezi criticised the government and the institutions of that  time".    With a nod also at Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha who  attended the conference on behalf of the government, Mr  Kissinger praised the "truly heroic effort by the chief actors  to overcome their memories, their suffering and doubts".    Mr Buthelezi said in his address his party was entering the  mediation process with expectation but also with trepidation.  The country was divided by a deep wound which had to be healed  before elections.    "The spirit of a miracle must emerge," he said.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (21): Group D - Bulgaria France against Bulgaria, November 17, 1993. One minute left, 1-1, and France have as good as qualified for the World Cup. Bulgaria break away with Penev. He passes to Kostadinov who shoots. - He scores and Bulgaria and not France have qualified. The French look dazed. Needing just one point from their last two games, they have lost both in the last minute. - Bulgaria has a poor World Cup record. In 16 attempts during the finals they have yet to win a game, but Kostadinov's goal, unexpected and brilliant as it was, will give them the impetus to break that duck. They will fancy their chances of reaching the second round, mainly because of their formidable striking options. Bulgaria will resemble an Iberian select XI. With the exception of the goalkeeper who plays in France, all of the team's foreign-based players play their club football in Spain or Portugal. Their three first choice forwards are Ivailo Yordanov of Sporting Lisbon, Emil Kostadinov of Porto and Barcelona's Hristo Stoichkov. Stoichkov is capable of winning a match almost on his own and will be one of the most marked men in America. The midfield is held together by Krasimir Balakov (Sporting Lisbon) and Zlatko Yankov, but the main area of worry for coach Dimitar Penev is the defence. Unlike previous Bulgarian teams, the present side plays open attractive football which leaves them vulnerable at the back. Gone are the days when the Bulgarians would grind out results in true communist fashion. In Mexico eight years ago they qualified for the second round with three turgid displays. They have yet to convince the public that they have turned over a new leaf. Ticket sales in Dallas, where Bulgaria play their first two games, are the lowest of all venues.</p>

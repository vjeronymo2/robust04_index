			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Italians lobby Brittan on steel ITALY'S new government is lobbying Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's Commissioner for competition policy, on behalf of the loss-making Ilva state steel group, just as discussions start today on initiating a formal procedure against the company's recent capital increases. The government has argued that Ilva's two-stage L650bn (Dollars 566m) capital increase represents urgent assistance for restructuring, rather than state subsidies, which would infringe EC rules. In a letter to Sir Leon, Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the new industry minister, has repeated the previous government's support for Ilva's plans to quote its shares and bring in new private-sector steelmaking partners. Mr Guarino has offered to come to Brussels to explain in detail the new government's position, which is identical to that of Mr Giulio Andreotti, Italy's former prime minister. The same message was conveyed to Sir Leon yesterday by Mr Federico di Roberto, Italy's EC ambassador. Commission concern about a possible strategy shift grew last month when Ilva announced a L498bn 1991 loss. The results cast doubts on the company's intentions to go public, as Italian bourse rules require companies to show three consecutive years of profits before floating their shares. There have also been delays in Ilva's plans to bring in private-sector steelmakers at its big Piombino plant in Tuscany. In its new initiative, the government has asked for more time to present its case before the Commission decides on a formal procedure. The request follows a meeting in Brussels last week between Sir Leon, Mr Franco Nobili, chairman of the IRI state holding company which owns Ilva, and Mr Giovanni Gambardella, Ilva's chief executive. Mr Nobili then discussed the outcome with Mr Guarino on his return, leading to the latest appeal. The government has stressed that Ilva's 1991 losses stem purely from the decision to divert capital gains from asset sales into a special reserve fund, rather than to cover operating losses. Plans for a flotation remain on course, as the company is expected to opt for the expedient of merging with an already-quoted concern. The most likely vehicle would be Dalmine, a north Italian tube-maker in which Ilva has a 66 per cent stake.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / International Company News: Renault float likely before year end The French government yesterday appointed adviser banks for the privatisation of Renault and appears prepared to go ahead with at least a partial privatisation of the state-owned automobile group by the end of the year. The Renault sale, valued at more than FFr40bn (Dollars 7.46bn), is one of the most important and most sensitive operations in the privatisation programme of the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur. The programme, launched last year, involves the sale of 21 public sector groups. Government officials said no decision had yet been taken concerning the timing or the scale of the operation. They said if the operation goes ahead, the government would either retain a majority stake, through a partial privatisation, or reduce its 80 per cent stake to a blocking minority holding of 34 per cent. Industry observers claimed, however, that the government could opt for the more ambitious proposal, which would involve a public offering for some of the shares, an increase in Renault's capital, and the formation of a group of long-term stable investors. Volvo, the Swedish automobile group which retains a 20 per cent stake in Renault following the collapse of the two companies' merger plans last year, could also reduce its holding as part of the operation. According to one government official, the strategy concerning the privatisation will now be discussed between the two adviser banks - Credit Agricole and Rothschild et Cie - and the privatisation commission, an independent body which advises the government on the sale of public sector assets. Renault has already appointed Banque Nationale de Paris and Lazard Freres as its adviser banks. The privatisation of Renault, a union stronghold in the post-war period is politically sensitive. But the government is keen to press ahead with a sale to demonstrate its commitment to its privatisation programme and to raise funds to ease pressure on the budget deficit, targetted at FFr300bn this year. Until recently, the government has indicated that Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group, would be next on the privatisation list. Renault, however, one of the few automobile groups to remain in profit during the recession in the sector, may represent a more attractive operation. Government officials said yesterday that the preparation of a possible Renault sale reflects its strategy of having 'two irons in the fire'. The government has already started discussions concerning the formation of a so-called 'noyau dur' of stable long term investors. Possible candidates include Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, which co-operates with Renault in formula one racing and in other areas, the Lagardere Group, which co-operates with Renault in the production of its Espace vehicles and the Suez financial and industrial group.</p>

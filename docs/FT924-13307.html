			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Chemists Lloyds Chemists' full-year figures make one nostalgic for the 1980s. Turnover is up by a strapping 106 per cent and profits increased by an almost equally healthy 78 per cent. Granted much of the expansion was on the back of paper-driven acquisitions, yet even earnings per share are 20 per cent higher. Glowing though all that may be, the difficulty with acquisitive companies is that they often move so fast it is difficult to determine what they are really worth. Rapid expansion of the chemist, drugstore and healthfood chains obscures the view of sales and profits on a comparable basis. Provisions and write-offs do not make things any clearer. And while gearing is a comfortable 22 per cent, the asset backing depends in part on the value of pharmacies as premium retail sites being maintained. It may be instructive to note that when the government tightened its payment terms to pharmacists in July, the shares fell sharply. Not only has chemists' income fallen; perhaps the value of a pharmacist's franchise has declined as well. Against all the recurring worries about aggressive entrepreneurs coming to grief, it can be argued that dispensing chemists have a stable business. However, with Lloyds on a rating half that of the stores sector, the market is clearly not prepared to take anything on trust.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt takes industrial skirmish in its stride - But a prolonged and acrimonious strike by steelworkers could harm share prices The ammunition is ready and the powder is dry. German trade unions have abandoned their traditional harmony of outlook with employers and made aggressive, mostly double-figure, wage claims. The Bundesbank has taken fright at the implications for inflation, now around 4 per cent - a heady rate for stability-conscious Germans - and jacked up interest rates to unprecedented post-war levels. So far, the German stock market has taken all this pre-battle skirmishing in its stride. In January, the DAX index of 30 leading shares showed a gain of 7 per cent to 1,687.49 as investors looked past the present economic uncertainty to the expectations of improved export performance, more robust growth in Germany (including the new east German states) and abroad. The prospect of higher consumer spending after the tax surcharge comes off in mid-year has also helped. Analysts generally expect the index to move up to between 1,800 and 2,000 this year. Yesterday the ballot called by the powerful IG Metall trade union came down conclusively in favour of a steel strike. The fact of a majority vote for a stoppage by the industry's 130,000 workers was never in doubt. When the chips are down, steelworkers support their union leaders. What counts now is how quickly and in what form strike action is called, how long it lasts, what effect this has on other sectors, and what the settlement is. In a way, the threat of a strike is seen as good news in the investment community, paradoxical and cynical though this may appear. Last year, employers awarded pay deals of up to 7 per cent. Many companies were willing to pay this at a time when the economy was still booming, especially with the stimulus from east German demand, and they were working at full stretch. This is certainly not the case today, however. Consumer demand from the east is dropping off - the domestic car market, for instance, is expected to fall by 12 per cent or more this year - and export-oriented companies in particular have been feeling the pinch. A number of companies, especially in motor components, machine tools, and engineering, have cut employment, shifted more production overseas, and slashed their dividends. So industry's mood is much more defiant than last year. This being so, the increased likelihood of moderate wage settlements is expected by investors to improve industry's longer-term competitiveness, bring down inflation, and thus induce the Bundesbank to reduce rates. Before all this happens, though, a lot of water has to flow under the bridge. Even though the unions are not in the strongest of positions, with the German economy having slowed down sharply in recent months, it may not be easy to find a face-saving formula. In the steel industry, the union initially claimed 10.5 per cent and has since made clear that it wants at least 6 per cent. The employers want to keep it below that figure. A banking strike is also on the cards, with a 10.5 per cent pay demand tabled. The banks, which have been reporting sharp profit increases for last year, have offered no more than 4.5 per cent. The negotiations that really matter for the economy, however, are those in the engineering industry. Here, IG Metall has taken a small step in the direction of moderation by recommending that regional claims do not exceed 9.5 per cent. It will be the conduct of the steel strike that sets the tone for the 1992 wage round. 'A strike that lasted less than a week would be seen as no problem at all for the market", says Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank. 'If it went on for much longer and the atmosphere turned nasty, that might be something the stock market had not accounted for'. What many investors are really looking to is the prospects for late 1992 and 1993, when company earnings should pick up considerably. At the moment, many companies in the mainstream of German industry are under severe strain. Kolbenschmidt, for instance, the quoted car components subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft, the mining, metals, and engineering group, suffered a profits slump last year. It is halving its dividend, and has shed nearly 600 jobs in Germany and abroad. MAN Roland, the printing equipment subsidiary of the MAN industrial group, is laying off 750 people because of its order slowdown. Kugelfischer, the bearing and industrial systems company, slid into the red last year and has slimmed its workforce by as much as 6,000. Metallgesellschaft, which has moved aggressively into environmental activities, had its growth trend rudely interrupted last year by a combination of economic slowdown, lower commodity prices, and adverse currency movements. Degussa, which is mainly in metals and chemicals, yesterday announced a dividend cut. For companies like these, reckons Ms Katrin Kandel of Sal. Oppenheim, the German private bank, a strike at this low stage of their business cycle could be beneficial if it helps produce a moderate cost base for the later upswing. 'Since they are looking a few years ahead, they could put up with a strike now'. Thus she reckons that stocks with a strong cyclical tendency like Kugelfischer, Metallgesellschaft, and the Thyssen steel and engineering group could be among the best performers when the stock market really picks up steam. 'The second half of this year could be when investors start discounting better earnings'. These would be fuelled by the expected cut in interest rates when the Bundesbank is happy that inflation is moving down and not up. At present, though, the central bank is not happy at all.</p>

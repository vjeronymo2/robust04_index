			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK hedges acceptance of 48-hour working week THE UK yesterday accepted in principle European Community plans for a 48-hour limit on the working week, but hedged its concession with conditions that its partners seem unwilling to grant. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary, denied that she had conceded the principle of a 48-hour working week. But she seemed to be the only participant at the ministerial meeting who interpreted her stance in that way. 'I said I could accept that 48 hours would appear in the directive subject only to a resolution of the major problems the UK has,' Mrs Shephard said. She added that the other member states - which with the exception of Ireland back the working-time directive - had made concessions to Britain. A majority of the 12 did concede that the weekly day of rest stipulated in the directive did not have to be Sunday. The main safeguard the UK wants is the right of people to work overtime above the limit and to ensure that the 48 hours a week would be averaged over 12 months, not three months as the Commission proposes. The UK also wants the working week to be decided at plant rather than industry or national level. Ms Vasso Papandreou, EC social affairs commissioner, said: 'I think (Britain) accepted the principle (of the 48-hour week), but of course with conditions which now need to be decided.' Officials from the current Portuguese presidency expect to be able to put the directive, blocked by UK opposition for nearly two years, to a vote in June. The UK cannot veto the measure because it was introduced under health and safety provisions which require only a qualified majority. Mrs Shephard said her main objective had been to avoid a vote on the measure which would have isolated the UK. This was achieved thanks to Germany, which though in favour of the directive, would prefer consensus and would not vote yesterday, to grant the new UK minister a 'grace period'. However, the UK is unlikely to win concessions which would in practice allow it to circumvent the intention of the EC law. The UK's earlier idea that proof of risk to health should be established before the 48-hour limit could be imposed found no support. Ms Papandreou pointed out that such 'risk assessment' already existed for all EC health and safety standards, 'but not to lower standards'. France and Belgium flatly opposed negotiating the working week at plant level. But this UK condition could gather support, as could a more flexible reference period over which to average the 48-hour week. Mrs Shephard said: 'This directive is something we don't like and don't need. If we were to accept it we would have to get very substantial changes.' If, as seems likely after yesterday, the UK is voted down in June, the minister carefully reserved the option of a legal challenge, which would argue that the directive was not concerned with health and safety and should have required unanimity.</p>

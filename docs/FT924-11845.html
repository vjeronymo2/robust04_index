			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: GKN spends Dollars 50m expanding US side GKN, the automotive components, engineering and industrial services group, is to invest Dollars 50m (Pounds 31m) expanding its US automotive components manufacturing activities. It is planning to increase its capacity for producing constant velocity joints and driveshafts, the company's main driveline products, to meet an expected 60 per cent increase in sales in the next three years. GKN said that it was studying a variety of locations for the new investment including expansion at its existing sites at Sanford and Alamance in North Carolina, or the establishment of an additional manufacturing site. The existing plants have been working at full capacity since April to meet increased demand. GKN is the world leader in the supply of constant velocity joints with a world market share of about 30 per cent. The company said yesterday that it was benefiting from the large increase in demand for US-sourced components from Japanese vehicle makers, which have established assembly plants in the US. At the same time US vehicle makers are fitting more constant velocity joints in light trucks, multi-purpose vehicles and four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicles with the increasing trend towards front-wheel drive vehicles. In North America GKN is now supplying Mazda for its US-built MX6 and Mazda 626 models, as well as Ford and Nissan for their jointly developed Nissan Quest/Mercury Villager multi-purpose vehicle. The Mazda contract has resulted in extra annual sales of about Dollars 15m for GKN Automotive Inc, the US subsidiary. Earlier this year GKN also gained substantial new contracts from vehicle makers in the US, which will come on stream progressively from 1993 to 1995. The volume of vehicle driveline component sets to be delivered in North America will jump from 1.7m in 1991 to 2.1m this year and to about 3.3m in 1995-96.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by V. Ilyukhin, Chairman of the State Duma Security </F> Committee: "Half Their Ill-Gotten Gains as a Bribe: There Are  Some People Who Do Not Like the Anticorruption Laws"]    [Text] On 13 May 1994 the State Duma adopted on first  reading the draft laws "On Combating Corruption" and "On  Amendments and Additions to the RSFSR Criminal Code and the  RSFSR Criminal Procedure Code." The drafts were submitted by  deputies S. Boskholov, V. Kolmakov, and V. Kosykh, members of  the State Duma Security Committee, and the author of these lines.    Clearly not everyone knows that in 1993 the bullet-riddled  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet adopted the law "On Combating  Corruption" but President B. Yeltsin refused to sign it, even  though such a law had long been needed.    The changes that have taken place in the social and state  system inevitably caused drastic changes in the character of  crime and the forms in which it is manifested. Crime today is  more organized and ruthless, better armed and larger in scale,  more professional and transnational. We still have not fully  realized or calculated the colossal harm that has been and is  being caused to ordinary workers and the intelligentsia through  the replacement of collective forms of labor and social  ownership by predatory private ownership, egoism, and  self-seeking.    In Russia today at least 3 million citizens a year are  victims of criminal acts. According to Russian Federation MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] statistics, there are more than  150 major criminal communities operating on the country's  territory. There are over 35,000 economic sites within their  sphere of influence. By virtue of its destructive consequences  and the massive loss of human life incurred, crime has become a  Russian national disaster.    Crime has become politicized and seeks to seize the leading  positions in the echelons of power. Criminal groupings now  exert direct influence on the adoption of administrative  decisions not only at rayon, city, and oblast level but at  republic level, too. They try to influence the legislative  process. And their ringleaders and ideological inspirers view  the path to power as the path to self-preservation. All spheres  of the shadow economy -- drug trafficking, smuggling,  prostitution, and gambling dens -- are under the complete  control of organized crime. It has managed to take control of  industrial production, diamond and gold extraction, the oil  industry, and the credit and finance system.    According to Russian Academy of Sciences Analysis Center  estimates, 55 percent of the capital and 80 percent of the  voting shares in Russia are in the hands of criminal or foreign  capital. This is happening not without the assistance of the  Russian Federation State Committee for the Management of State  Property, headed by Vice Premier A. Chubays.    The increase in income from crime has spawned the  large-scale  expansion of corruption in the state apparatus from the bottom  upward, and especially in the upper echelons of power. I would  probably not be wrong if I said that Russia today has the most  corrupt executive it has ever had in its entire history. And  whereas in the eighties crooks spent up to 35 percent of their  ill-gotten gains on bribing officials, now they spend 50 percent  or more for the purpose.    Corruption has affected the state structures, the credit and  finance system, and business like a blight. It has become a  dangerous brake on the transformations in the country, is  nullifying the effectiveness and significance of all state  programs, and it has jeopardized the country's national  security, constitutional rights, and civil liberties.    In 1993 more than 52,000 corruption-related crimes were  exposed. Of those people prosecuted for such actions, 42.7  percent were ministry, committee, or local power structure  personnel, 25.8 percent were law enforcement agency employees,  11.3 percent were employed in the credit and finance system, 2.2  percent were deputies, and 3.8 percent were monitoring agency  staff. In the banking system 4,300 crimes were exposed --  mainly instances of theft, bribery, and abuse of position. The  area which suffered most from lawbreaking was the privatization  process, implemented under the control of and with the  participation of the State Committee for the Management of State  Property. Last year alone the Prosecutor's Office challenged  over 2,200 unlawful privatization documents, registered more  than 2,500 complaints about violations that had been exposed,  and filed 677 law suits. Around 1,000 officials had  disciplinary, administrative, and material proceedings  instituted against them. So there is no point in Mr Chubays'  railing against just criticism of his activity. He is  personally to blame for the destructive character of  privatization, which is disastrous for Russia.    Much is being written and said about the pernicious effects  of corruption today, first and foremost by B. Yeltsin and the  Russian Government. However, no radical measures have yet been  taken to nip it in the bud. The presidential structures include  an enormous legal administration. You might think that this  administration ought to prepare draft legislative acts aimed at  preventing corruption. But no. The drafts were prepared by  deputies and a group of academics and law enforcement agency  practical personnel who are fanatically devoted to their cause  and who feel deeply for Russia's destiny. The funding of the  state's anticrime program for 1994-1995 is now being cut to the  bone by that same government. Thus it is saying one thing but  doing something completely different. That is why, despite the  massive scale of the bribery of officials, the number of people  convicted of bribe-taking last year was around 700, as against  1986 when 3,450 people were convicted of these offenses.    As you can see, there is an enormous discrepancy here. But  that is not the only point. Even the draft laws that we do  propose are torpedoed. Most often they are rejected within the  presidential and government structures as well as by deputies  from or connected with ministries.    During the vote on first reading the anticorruption laws  were  opposed by the Russia's Choice faction and, specifically, by its  leaders Ye. Gaydar, G. Burbulis, M. Mityukov, G. Yakunin, and E.  Panfilova. Clearly this is no coincidence either. For many  people corruption has become a major source of personal wealth  and an effective means of bringing down the country.    As for the official arguments cited by the opponents of the  draft laws that were presented, they essentially constitute a  long list of unsubstantiated accusations. I shall dwell on just  a few of them. Our opponents claim that the drafts are  imperfect. Of course they have shortcomings. But the draft  laws were only given a first reading. That should be followed  by the second and third readings, which enable the imperfections  to be remedied.    It was suggested to us that amendments be made to the  existing Criminal Code. But it is out of date, and work is now  underway on a new code of criminal legislation.    A large group of deputies and eminent academic lawyers well  known both at home and abroad spent a long time working on the  draft laws. They have been compiled on the basis of an in-depth  study of Russian life and legal practice. When they were being  elaborated account was taken of foreign experience in combating  corruption, of the law in the United States, the FRG, Italy, and  other countries, and the opinion of foreign experts.    Particular attention was paid to the materials of the Eighth  UN Crime Prevention Congress held in Havana in August-September  1990. The congress firmly advised all countries of the world  community to prepare a strategy for fighting corruption as a  priority area in the economic and social development of society.    In our opinion, if the drafts that we proposed to the State  Duma are adopted as laws they will constitute a major barrier  and effective antidote to the pernicious influence of corruption.    They apply not only to state employees but also to employees  of the local organs of self-government and the armed forces,  judges, deputies and their aides, people's assessors, and  jurors, as well as to employees of banks and other credit and  finance institutions and transport and communications  establishments and their enterprises, regardless of the form of  ownership.    It is proposed that once the drafts are legally enacted they  will apply throughout Russian territory. According to these  drafts persons seeking to perform state functions freely  undertake an obligation not to allow their status to be used for  unofficial personal or group purposes.    Control measures of a disciplinary, financial, and criminal  law nature are envisaged. State employees and their equivalent  will be required to submit an annual declaration of their income  and declare all bank accounts, including those held abroad, as  well as property outside Russia together with the full address.    State employees are forbidden to hold more than one post or  to take part in the activity of commercial joint-stock  companies. The draft laws offer a reliable protection against  extortion, cash handouts, and dubious gifts concealing graft.    It should be noted that under the draft law on combating  corruption not only by physical persons but also by legal  persons, organizations, and commercial structures can be  penalized for trying to bribe officials or furnish them with  other material advantages.</p>

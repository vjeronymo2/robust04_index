			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: BP looks set to achieve Dollars 1.5bn disposal target BRITISH Petroleum already appears to be more than half way to achieving its 1993 target of raising Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) through sales of non-core assets. The UK oil company is believed to have reaped Dollars 1.7bn from similar disposals in 1992, slightly ahead of its target for last year of Dollars 1.5bn. The cash raised will be used to reduce the group's borrowings of around Dollars 16bn. Gearing at the 1992 year end is expected to be over 90 per cent. BP cut its dividend last year and announced it would shed 20,500 jobs around the world by 1995 in a drive to reduce costs. The group has received indicative bids in the region of Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m for its consumer products division, of which the main part is the Manchester-based Robert McBride. The division, which has annual sales of around Pounds 300m, is part of BP Nutrition which BP put on the block last year. SG Warburg is compiling a shortlist of bidders, believed to include several financial institutions. However, completion of this transaction is still a couple of months away. The first sale to be completed this year is likely to be that of BP's consumer food group to Sara Lee, the US textiles, food and consumer products company, for about Pounds 70m. This disposal is expected to be followed by the completion of the Dollars 456m sale of BP's 49 per cent holding in the Olympic Dam mine in southern Australia to Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa. Both of these deals were agreed last November.</p>

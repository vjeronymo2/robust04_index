			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report COCOA futures peaked at a new 40-month second position high of Pounds 983 a tonne before slipping all the way back to close at Pounds 967 a tonne in the near March position, Pounds 2 below Friday's level. Dealers said there was no fresh news, people were just becoming more wary as the market approached the psychologically significant Pounds 1,000. 'I think people believe it's gone too far too fast,' one trader commented. The COFFEE market spent the day trying to build a base following its recent correction and the January contract closed at Dollars 1,173 a tonne, up Dollars 1, after trading between Dollars 1,165 and Dollars 1,177. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices edged off their lows, but still remained easier. News that Kennecott workers at Bingham Canyon had reached a tentative agreement removed a potential prop from the market as the three months position fell Dollars 10 to Dollars 1,690 a tonne. NICKEL trading slackened in the afternoon, with the market paying less attention to the events in Moscow which had prompted early firmness. The three months price closed at Dollars 4,170 a tonne, up Dollars 57.50 on balance. Compiled from Reuters</p>

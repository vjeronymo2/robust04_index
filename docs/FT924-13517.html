			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Book Review: Right out of step DANCING WITH DOGMA Britain under Thatcherism By Ian Gilmour Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 16.99, 328 pages This is a book addressed to the Tory party. In it Lord Gilmour argues that Lady (then Mrs) Thatcher hijacked the true Conservative tradition; that Thatcherism was wrong in principle, unpleasant in implementation and disastrous in outcome; and that more than Mrs Thatcher's departure is needed for the party to become once again true to its principles and an agent of good government in its widest sense. First, Gilmour - a Cabinet minister until he was sacked by Mrs Thatcher in 1981 - argues that the economy was seriously mismanaged. He is caustic on the crudity of the early monetary dogmas and their spectacular failures in practice. But many - even some who were enthusiastic at the time - now accept this. More important is his demonstration of how little in the way of an economic miracle we have actually had. During Mrs Thatcher's tenure of office, the economy and investment are seen to have grown considerably more slowly than in preceding decades, while unemployment and the balance of payments were much worse. Second, Gilmour presents Mrs Thatcher's social policies as regressive, divisive and immoral: 'The treatment of the poor was unforgivable.' Not only did the gap between rich and poor widen during the Thatcher years, but the income of the poorest 10 per cent actually fell in real terms. Gilmour is scathing about the sustained attack on child benefits and on the contrast between the subsidy of Pounds 5.5bn to the middle classes in the form of mortgage tax relief and a subsidy of less than a tenth of that to council tenants. Housing benefits for those on low incomes were cut nine times. Gilmour's third attack, which he sees as having underpinned the other two, is that through dogmatic ideology and force of personality, brooking no argument and tolerating no dissent, Mrs Thatcher destroyed or enfeebled all institutions or individuals that stood in the way of the aggregation of power at No 10. 'I must prevail,' as ex-colleagues have reported her as saying when decisions were made. For Gilmour, as for Disraeli (and many other Tory politicians and theorists), one of the main aims of a Conservative government should be 'the maintenance of the institutions of the country'. He chronicles a long list, with many entertaining and horrifying examples, of Mrs Thatcher's often successful attempts to emasculate them, including the cabinet, parliament, the Church, the media, the universities and especially local authorities. Gilmour presents a powerful, well-documented case, well-written though occasionally too splenetic for its own good. But if it was all as awful as this, how did Mrs Thatcher survive and thrive for so long? One reason is the electoral system. She never got more than 47 per cent of votes cast and there is some evidence that the country as a whole moved leftwards during her terms. A second is that there was another side to the case. Her foreign policy, though uneven, scored some notable successes to which Gilmour pays tribute in an interesting chapter. Much more important, however, were the famous domestic victories over the enemies of enterprise. Gilmour mentions all of these, but somewhat grudgingly. He does not properly convey the extent of the frustration and demoralisation at the end of the Callaghan administration - the absurdly high levels of taxation; the irresponsible use of power by many unions and local authorities; the awful way in which many nationalised industries were run; and the serious degree of under-management in the big public expenditure programmes where the relationship between decisions and their costs was often minimal. No wonder that a highly visible and in many respects successful attack on these things was welcomed and supported long after it became clear that other muddles, inequities and tyrannies were appearing in its wake. But there is a third reason. For most of the 1980s, most people felt much better off. The UK imported much more than it exported. Much lower taxation for the better-off and massive borrowing meant that most people could live beyond their (and the nation's) means. The proportion of GNP taken by consumption rose by 7 percentage points, an enormous and unprecedented shift away from savings and investment. Not exactly the economics of Grantham, though enjoyable while it lasted. Now the party is over. We are in deep and seemingly endless recession. Will Mrs Thatcher's successor reject Thatcherism, as Gilmour wishes, and return to a more traditional conservatism? The omens are not good. John Major certainly began by attaching himself to a dogma - commitment to the ERM - that Mrs Thatcher didn't believe in. But he attached himself with a single-minded fervour that would have done her credit. And now that it too has collapsed, the retention of a single economic objective, with a collection of things to be taken into account to achieve it, looks more like the scrapings from the bottom of the old policy barrel than an attempt to see the country's problems as a whole and enlist help from all quarters in solving them.</p>

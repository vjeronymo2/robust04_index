			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead TESCO, the UK's second-largest grocery retailer, will be hoping to reassure the City with a healthy rise in full-year profits on Tuesday. Its shares have been under pressure on the stock market amid fears that its sales growth is lagging behind that of rivals J Sainsbury and Argyll, owners of Safeway. Most forecasts are clustered around the Pounds 580m mark, compared with Pounds 545m last year, although some are as high as Pounds 585m. Full year figures on Monday for 1992 from MB-Caradon, the building products and security printing group, are expected in the region of Pounds 120m to Pounds 125m, against Pounds 106.4m in 1991. Lower interest charges and a solid performance from the managed businesses are behind the expected rise. The main point of interest is how the group will reinvest the Pounds 473m proceeds of the sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, announced last Friday. TIP Europe, the trailer rental company, is expected to announce disappointing interim results on Tuesday. The company's Mobiel subsidiary, which supplies temporary buildings in continental Europe, is understood to have run into management and planning problems. Analysts have downgraded forecast full year forecasts from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 6m while interim profits are likely to be about Pounds 2.4m from Pounds 3m last time. The dividend is also in danger of being cut for the third year running. Sun Alliance Group, the composite insurer, is expected on Thursday to report a loss for 1992 of around Pounds 150m, a recovery from a loss of Pounds 466m a year earlier. However, it is likely to maintain the dividend. Mirror Group Newspapers, buffeted by board room upheavals including the recent departure of Lord Hollick, is forecast to produce on Monday pre-tax profits of between Pounds 27m and Pounds 33m (Pounds 47.3m) for 1992. Any comments by the management on editorial direction will be closely scrutinised, particularly by the Labour party, which is worried that the Daily Mirror might drift to the right politically. First-half pre-tax profits on Monday from Highland Distilleries, maker of Famous Grouse scotch whisky, will be boosted by the company's decision to equity account its 35.4 per cent stake in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky blender. However, analysts expect the underlying pre-tax figure to reflect pressures on volume sales and prices of new and mature whisky. Forecasts suggest the outcome will be between Pounds 13.5m and Pounds 14m, 5 per cent to 8 per cent below last year's Pounds 14.7m.</p>

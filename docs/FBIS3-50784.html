			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari </F> concerning events in Chiapas State, made in Veracruz on 6  January; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] The violence that has affected a region of the state  of Chiapas is being generated by a group divided into two  factions, as has been stated before: on one hand, a violent and  armed group which is trying to disrupt peace within the  communities, public peace, and harm government institutions; on  the other hand, there is a group of Indians, several of whom,  according to what they have told the media, were forced to arm  themselves against their will. This is why we have determined  this is not an Indian uprising but, rather, a deliberate action  by this violent faction that heads the rebellion.    There has never been a country in which such an action has  led to social advancement for those who have less, nor has such  an action ever brought about democratic progress. The events in  Chiapas sadden all Mexicans, because even after recognizing  inequalities, as we have done, for many years Mexicans have  worked together for generations to open the way for respect,  dialogue, and peace.    In addition, it is not fair to make attempts on anyone's  life. They are all Mexicans; they deserve the greatest respect.  At the same time, it is disturbing that, by taking advantage of  this situation of violence in this region of Chiapas, some are  trying to damage the name of Mexico, which has taken so much  time and effort to build. Therefore, this is an action that  goes against national interests. This armed group is against  Mexico. Several Indian and rural communities have rejected  these people.    The roads of participation are open to everyone. New avenues  may be opened if we persevere in our way of doing things. No  one wants a Mexico in which liberties are reduced in an effort  to guarantee security. Standing before you, I want to point out  the fact that violence does not generate more freedom or  democracy but, rather, hatred and political narrow-mindedness.    The Army and the state's security forces are fulfilling  their  duties in accordance with the law. The government's actions  have had two purposes: the first, to protect the lives of the  civilian population; and the second, to reestablish normalcy in  the region. The actions of the government of the Republic are  within the framework of the Constitution. The law will be  applied strictly. The authorities' firm action will not be  exercised against the communities, which we respect and support,  or against the many organizations that work in the area in a  dedicated manner and with which we have held dialogues.    There is a clear commitment to respect for human rights.  There is a national consensus in favor of peace. In light of  the events that have taken place in Chiapas State, this Monday I  asserted, before the Permanent Commission of the Congress of the  Republic, that within no region of Mexico are differences so  great that they preclude our capacity for dialogue, nor is there  enough distance to undermine our fundamental unity. This will  always be the way things are.    At the same time, I want to express my gratitude for the  responsible support stated today by all the political forces of  the country -- support against violence. By standing united, we  Mexicans will continue to progress and will be able to make  Mexico's democratic life stronger for the wellbeing of everone  and, above all else, for the wellbeing of our children.</p>

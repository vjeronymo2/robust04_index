			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOE MILLER FIRED AS SAN CLEMENTE COACH  </P> <P> Joe Miller was fired as the baseball coach at San Clemente High School, the  school's athletic director, Jim McNaught, said Monday.  </P> <P> Miller was dismissed from his position in June, at the end of the school year.  </P> <P> The Tritons were 22-64-1 overall during Miller's four years as coach. San  Clemente was 13-47 in South Coast League play during that time and never  finished higher than fifth place.  </P> <P> McNaught said Miller's won-loss record had nothing to do with the dismissal,  which was handled by principal Jim Krembus.  </P> <P> Miller, who was the head coach at Fountain Valley in 1982, will remain at the  school as a science teacher.  </P> <P> McNaught said he expected a new coach would be hired before the start of the  school year. He said Krembus was in the process of interviewing candidates for  the job. CHRIS FOSTER  </P></p>

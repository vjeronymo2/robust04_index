			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Nuclear division wants sale in 1996 - Privatisation AEA Technology, whose forthcoming privatisation was confirmed by the government yesterday, hopes a sale will be made after the financial year ending March 1996. The company wants to build a track record following its separation last year from other divisions at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, whose responsibilities include overseeing decommissioning and safe handling of nuclear liabilities. AEA Technology is a science and engineering business which sells technical, safety and environmental services and products to industries and governments throughout the world. It is thought to be worth at least Pounds 200m, has an annual turnover of Pounds 250m and expects profits this year of Pounds 10m compared with Pounds 5m last year. The company employs 4,000 people and sees no likelihood of this declining. Growth areas include over-seas work, where turnover increased by 40 per cent last year and is expected to grow this year to about Pounds 60m. This year is also expected to see a 50 per cent growth in private-sector business in the UK.</p>

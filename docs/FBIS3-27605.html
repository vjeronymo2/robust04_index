Comrade Jia Qinglin said: Last year, expressway builders  worked day and night for Fujian's expressway projects. The  provincial party committee, provincial government, and people  throughout the province are thankful to them. We must build  highways if we want to live a happy life. Since the deepening  of reform, more and more people have understood the importance  of building expressways and have acknowledged your achievements.  Owing to speedy economic development in the province, however,  Fujian's transportation facilities have become incompatible with  economic construction. Therefore the people throughout the  province urgently feel the need to have expressways built. In  this situation, you have a heavier burden to undertake and a  more glorious task to fulfill. We should seize the opportunity  and do a good job in expressway construction. [words indistinct]</p>

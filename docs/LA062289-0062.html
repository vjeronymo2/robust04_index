			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SPIRIT' OF COCTEAU PROVES ELUSIVE  </P> <P> "I don't know whether to say thank you or I'm sorry" is the way Deborah  Slater's tribute to Jean Cocteau began at the Gallery Theatre in Barnsdall Park  last weekend.  </P> <P> That pretty much sums up the reaction of this writer to the strange  triple-header in three short acts by different performers under the suspect  title "In the Spirit of Jean Cocteau."  </P> <P> Cocteau would have had grave difficulty finding his spirit in these pieces by  Slater, Blue Palm (Jacqueline Planeix and Thomas Crocker) and Kedric Robin  Wolfe.  </P> <P> "Died Suddenly," written by Julie Hebert, was Slater's tribute: part  voice-over, part movement, part acrobatics, traveling between a swing and a  divisible couch.  </P> <P> It made pronouncements and struck poses notable chiefly for the fact that they  had no recognizable connection to Cocteau.  </P> <P> Crocker and Planeix secured a personal safety net by invoking Cocteau's whimsy,  throwing some French into their act (titled "Cocteau en Californie") and  leaving it at that. Their bushy-tailed kidding around was Crocker and Planeix,  with their miniature Eiffel Towers and inflatable blue palm, doing what they  usually do: a sort of postmodern George Burns and Gracie Allen routine with  dance.  </P> <P> This time it was subdivided into still briefer routines that paid lip service  to Cocteau, such as "Watching Cocteau" ("Watching Cocteau is like watching  oneself watching Cocteau . . ." Hmmmm?), "Kiddie Korner Kokteau" (or what kids  think of Cocteau, which is not much) and "Cocteau Eyewitness News at Ten"  (don't ask).  </P> <P> If Cocteau was playful, he was not silly or haphazard. The whimsy sprang from a  fermenting intellect, the art had composition and style, the writing was  emotionally anchored and intense. Such foolishness as "Cocteau was a typical  Frenchman; he smelled bad and said smart things that were wicked" (from Kiddie  Kokteau) is self-serving drivel that means nothing and demeans everyone.  </P> <P> Sandwiched between the other two acts, Kedric Robin Wolfe's "You Want to Know  About Cocteau" came closer to the mark. He, at least, borrowed some of the  poet-artist-playwright-film-maker's own words to tell us about the transports  of love, Cocteau's despair at the death of Raymond Radiguet (the author of  "Devil in the Flesh," dead at 20, over whom he fairly lost his head) and the  uncharted mysteries of opium -- a particularly searing and beautiful account of  one man's submersion and recantation.  </P> <P> But why was it necessary to bend and twist the body while expressing all this?  What did it lend beyond the possibility of a pulled muscle? And why the fright  wig? Or the line down forehead, nose and chin, in a vain (both senses of the  word apply) imitation of Cocteau's stylized drawings? Were there no mirrors in  the dressing rooms? No directors to advise?  </P> <P> None were listed. The show is come and gone and these questions are now largely  rhetorical. But beginning Friday at the Gallery Theatre, this Cocteau Centenary  Festival continues with "Jean Cocteau -- Mirror Image," a one-man  interpretation by Ian Abercrombie of a text by Crispin Thomas. That show has a  director (Robert Robinson) -- an encouraging sign.  </P></p>

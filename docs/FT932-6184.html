			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: Train will have to take strain Sir, As part of the transport secretary's 'big public debate' on motorway charges ('Motorway charges scheme provokes opposition', May 27), I put forward a view which has so far been ignored - real investment in the railway network to make it financially advantageous to travel by rail rather than by road. Charging motorway users in order to raise money for more new motorways will not reduce congestion, nor will rail privatisation entice more people to travel by train. They will just add to motorway congestion. At some point we will have to accept that unlimited private road travel is not possible, both economically and environmentally. It might as well be now.

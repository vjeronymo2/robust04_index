			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: THE FUZZY NEW ROLES OF TODAY'S FATHERS  </P> <P> Few women will be surprised to learn that when they marry, they choose a man  "just like dear old dad."  </P> <P> I loved my dad. I have a picture of both of us on a river bank in Covington,  Ohio. He is holding a 29 1/2-pound carp. We look like we just won a lottery. A  couple of hours after that picture was taken, my dad ordered me out of the boat  with my mother and said if I so much as stepped foot in it again, it would be  over his dead body. I made too much noise and scared the fish away. He ordered  my mom to do something with me. He didn't care what!  </P> <P> He was always saying that. "Do something with her. Make her stop crying. Feed  her. Take her to the bathroom. Clean her up. Better take her temperature. She's  calling for you." (This in the middle of the night.)  </P> <P> I was his child, but I was Mom's job. They didn't have "bonding" in his day.  When I was born, he was nowhere in sight. That was a woman's job, too, and he  got "out of the way" and let her do it. It was the same thing with discipline.  "Listen to your mother when she speaks. She has my permission to whip your  backside, so don't think you can get away with something while I'm gone."  </P> <P> So what did he do? To begin with, he was the head of our family. He spoke for  us. He planned the vacations. He dictated when we ate and when we slept. Even  when I was little, I had the sense that when he left the house in the morning  with his lunch, whatever he did, he did it for us. He provided our lives with  the basics and a few goodies. He was the tower of strength that we could lean  on. Even when I was afraid to go into the basement, he never was. On rare  occasions when he kissed me or cried, it made me feel wonderful that I could do  that to him. There was never any question of being wanted and loved.  </P> <P> Frankly, I don't think my father would be judged a good one by today's  standards. And maybe that's what we're doing to the fathers of the '80s --  judging them by a father standard we no longer support.  </P> <P> Somewhere between my dad and today's fathers, the rules changed. New lines were  drawn. Expectations were added. Their roles are fuzzy, to say the least. One  moment they're supposed to "share the child," and the next they're being told,  "I'll raise my son alone. Just make sure your support checks are on time." One  minute their presence is vital, and the next, in a world according to Garp, a  single mother wants a child but not a husband. If they're confused, maybe it's  because many have emulated their fathers. That's where they learned about  fathering.  </P> <P> The "father track" is still under major construction. There are breakdowns,  detours and sometimes nine miles of bad road on the march to where they're  supposed to be.  </P> <P> Women may marry someone who is like "dear old dad," but if they're lucky,  they'll get more than they bargained for.  </P></p>

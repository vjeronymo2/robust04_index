			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Balladur in plea for training places FRANCE'S prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday asked employers to increase the number of young trainees from 450,000 to 650,000 within a year, to help fight near-record unemployment. This was his most concrete demand at a meeting with the 24 senior representatives of the Patronat employers' federation, which he called chiefly to show workers he is trying everything to prevent unemployment rising in the recession. Patronat executives said that the real problem was not training young people but taking them on full-time, under French minimum wage law. Mr Francois Perigot, the Patronat president, had earlier yesterday stressed that he had no power to order his members to do anything, and that in general employers could only follow the market. Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, a Patronat vice-president, described the meeting as highly positive and said it was natural that 'having incorporated much of what the employers wanted in his programme, Mr Balladur should want to distance himself a bit from them'.</p>

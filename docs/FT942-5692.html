			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Names told to pay extra Pounds 70.3m More than 4,000 Names on the loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates at Lloyd's must pay a further Pounds 70.3m before the end of next month, GW Run-Off, the agency now managing the syndicates' affairs, announced yesterday, Richard Lapper writes. The Names, whose assets support the market, have already faced demands for Pounds 700m and will eventually lose more than Pounds 1bn. A court action by 3,095 Gooda Names against their agents began in April. The case, in which the Names are seeking compensation of more than Pounds 600m, will resume on Tuesday. Names on two of the syndicates - numbers 290 and 298 - face a further cash call of Pounds 30.5m in January next year. However, Mr Ken Randall of GW Run-Off said he was hopeful that this second call could be deferred if a new facility, designed to provide syndicates with short-term credit, was launched as expected. Negotiations about the facility - which could provide between Dollars 500m and Dollars 1bn in credits - are continuing.</p>

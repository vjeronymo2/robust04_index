The Defense Ministry said in the announcement that, in view  of recent progress on the North Korean nuclear problem, South  Korea and the United States have agreed on Team Spirit '94's  conditional suspension.    "In view of this progress, the governments of the Republic  of  Korea and the United States have decided to suspend Team Spirit  '94 with the expectation that the IAEA [International Atomic  Energy Agency] inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities  will be successfully concluded and that practical discussion  toward the resolution of the North Korean nuclear question will  be undertaken through the exchange of special envoys between  South and North Korea," the statement said.    "If the above steps are not fulfilled," it continued, "the  governments of the Republic of Korea and the United States will  reconsider the decision to suspend Team Spirit '94."    After the announcement, a ministry spokesman explained some  of its terms.    "It's fundamentally up to the IAEA to judge if the  inspection  has been successfully concluded. We think every inspection  activity of the IAEA inspection team should be carried out  without any restrictions and the results of the inspection  should be understandable to the IAEA as well as to the  international community."    Last Saturday, Pyongyang told Washington it would allow  unrestricted IAEA access to seven declared facilities and accept  Seoul's proposal to hold working-level talks on exchanging  presidential envoys.    In return, Washington was to suspend this year's Team Spirit  and conduct high-level talks with North Korea later this month.    At the beginning of the announcement, the government judged  that progress has been made on the nuclear issue.    "Recently, progress has been achieved on the North Korean  nuclear question, as North Korea has agreed to accept the  inspection activities which were requested by the IAEA of the  seven declared nuclear facilities. North Korea has also agreed  to reopen working-level contacts in order to discuss the  exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea."    Meanwhile, Defense Ministry officials explained that the  government suspended Team Spirit because IAEA inspections of  North Korean nuclear facilities began on Thursday and  inter-Korean contact on exchanging special envoys has resumed.    The South Korean Government was to announce the suspension  of  the military exercise Tuesday afternoon on condition that North  Korea cooperated with the IAEA nuclear inspections and agreed to  hold the working-level contact on envoy exchanges Tuesday.    But since Pyongyang postponed the contact until Thursday,  Seoul also delayed announcement of the military maneuvers'  suspension.</p>

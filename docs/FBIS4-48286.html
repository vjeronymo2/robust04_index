			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>   [Text] From banned organization to one of the biggest  political parties in Parliament. The South African Communist  Party [SACP] reached the end of the road when between 40-50 of  its members were sworn in as MP's. In addition to this, three  communists were appointed to cabinet with two former members  also represented in government structures. The SACP is now one  of the strongest parties in Parliament with only the ANC, with  between 191-201 MP's, and the NP [National Party] with 82 MP's,  better represented.  <H5>  Poor Threat </H5>   However, the SACP has delivered a poorer performance than  expected with its three cabinet members and only one out of 12  deputy ministers. The communists in the cabinet are Mr. Joe  Slovo, minister of housing, Sydney Mufamadi, minister of safety  and security, and Jeff Radebe, minister of public works. Among  the deputy ministers is Mr. Alec Erwin, the deputy finance  minister, a card-carrying member of the SACP.  <H5>  Effectiveness </H5>   This information was confirmed this week by an SACP  spokesman, Mr. Jeremy Cronin, but Mr. Cronin says that the SACP  does not look at "red hats" in parliament and in cabinet, but  rather at the effectiveness of the appointments. Overlapping  alliances are a noteworthy characteristic of the 252 MP's of the  ANC alliance who took their places this week as parliamentarians  of South Africa's new majority party. Although all of them  swear allegiance to the ANC, some communists and others are  members of both COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions]  and the SACP. Mr. Erwin is one of these -- officially a COSATU  candidate but also a member of the SACP. The SACP, unlike  COSATU, did not have a separate list of candidates where it is  clearly stated that a specific parliamentarian belongs to the  party. According to Mr. Cronin, by this weekend the SACP head  office did not yet have a complete list of SACP members elected  to Parliament. The SACP, however, is prepared to make such a  list, of communists represented in Parliament, available at a  later stage.  <H5>  Jay Naidoo </H5>   It is significant that COSATU, with its reported 1.3 million  members and representative of 14 trade unions, performed poorer  that the SACP, concerning the election of members to Parliament  as well as with appointments to the cabinet. The SACP  apparently only has 60,000 registered members. Against the  SACP's 40-50 parliamentarians, COSATU could only get 21 of its  members into Parliament, and its former Secretary General, Mr.  Jay Naidoo, the only cabinet minister. Mr. Naidoo, minister  without portfolio, was appointed to oversee the ANC's  Reconstruction and Development Program. Other known COSATU  members elected to Parliament are: Mr. Phillip Dexter  (apparently also a communist) of the trade union for health  workers, National Education Health and Allied Workers Union;  Moses Mayekiso of the South African National Civics Organization  (SANCO), also a member of the SACP; and Randall van den Heever,  teachers' union leader. Although only three communists are  serving on the cabinet, the minister of transport, Mr. Mac  Maharaj, is a former member. One of the executive deputy  presidents, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, was a member of the SACP but  resigned from the party a long time ago. Opponents of the SACP  have alleged that this was for "strategic reasons."  <H5>  ZUMA's </H5>   Another cabinet member with communist links is Mrs.  Nkosazana  Dlamini Zuma, minister of health. Her husband, Mr. Jacob Zuma,  leader of the ANC in Natal and member of the Natal Executive  Council, is also apparently a member of the SACP. The minister  of water and forestry, Prof. Kader Asmal, was involved with  Marxist groups in Cape Town for a long time, but according to  experts this does not mean that he is a member of the SACP.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISE  </P> <P> I wish to reply to the column "Wright Crumbles in Panic Politics" by David S.  Broder (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 12). I think the headline on this column is just one  man's opinion because House Speaker Jim Wright showed great courage in taking  the stand that he did on the vote for a pay raise. He showed great leadership  in standing up to all those who wanted him to protect them, yet did not have  the nerve to speak out so that the people could hear them. Shame, shame on many  of our government workers.  </P> <P> Now how can Broder say the American people are the long-term losers? We won.  And, it makes me laugh when I hear the rebuttal that good people will not run  for office or may think about resigning. Every time there is an election, we  have many people running for the same office and spending thousands of dollars,  sometimes much more than the office will pay.  </P> <P> Wright did take the heat, both from his own colleagues and from the people at  large, and that shows a very strong man. If his "buddies" even think about  removing him from the speakership it will show how hypocritical they really  are.  </P> <P> It is time the people speak up again and demand another way for increasing the  pay of lawmakers. The current method is ludicrous, and if attempted again there  will be another outcry of the people.  </P> <P> ALPHA LEE DAY  </P> <P> Bellflower  </P></p>

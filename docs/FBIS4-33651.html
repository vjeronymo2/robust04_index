			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Santiago, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean President  Eduardo Frei today urged ministers and leaders from the  Coalition of Parties for Democracy [CPPD] to strengthen the  governing coalition, not to yield to populist temptations, and  to explain the government's actions.    The president was the main speaker at the meeting between  the  government and CPPD leaders. The five-hour meeting was attended  by ministers of state, government officials, and the main  leaders of the governing coalition's parties.    In his speech, Frei said the Common Pact must be upheld  without yielding to populist temptations, and reiterated that a  high-quality, excellent, and also personalized government that  works with the people must be consolidated.    Frei said: "The CPPD must be safeguarded and its influence  extended throughout the country because this is the only way to  ensure a spirit of consensus at a nationwide level."    The president warned that although opposition groups  sometime  adopt attitudes that promote conflicts and polarization, "the  search for agreements that grant legitimacy and grandeur must be  pursued."    He also mentioned the need to maintain a strict fiscal  discipline and a sound macroeconomic policy and admitted that  the current government, which came to power on 11 March, is  subject to greater pressure than the previous administration  because those demands that were made timidly have now become  stronger.    Frei urged coalition leaders not to yield to populist  temptations and asked them to reflect on the consequences of an  irresponsible position in this regard.    Frei later accepted criticisms of his 21 May speech for  failing to mention human rights, and added that he did not think  it necessary to continue assessing the transition process and  its problems.    He mentioned that it is obvious that in a responsible  democratic system human rights should be fully respected and  added that, regarding constitutional reforms, every possible  effort will be made to make the institutions completely  democratic since this is Chile's historical tradition.    Frei said an attitude of respect for the people in the  written and common law must be strengthened and said that soon  he will "solemnly and publicly" announce Chilean recognition of  the women and men who gave their lives for their fellow citizens  during the years of the military regime (1973-1990).    He added that the country will thus learn the testimony and  examples set by church members, attorneys, and political and  social leaders to whom, he said, we owe our appreciation.

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers as region responds to slide in Dow LATE buying by public pension funds came to the aid of share prices, and the Nikkei average recouped an earlier decline prompted by the overnight fall on Wall Street, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei finished a net 93.31 higher at 17,009.63, after falling to the day's low of 16,760.81 in the morning session as investors were discouraged by Tuesday's tumble in the Dow. Index-linked buying and support from public funds prompted the rally in equity prices just before the close. Volume contracted to 200m shares from 229m. Declines still outscored gains by 521 to 413 at the close, with 188 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks was finally up 0.94 at 1,293.27, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 2.35 at 1,038.54. Investors were inhibited by another rise in the yen, which moved above the Y1.20 level against the dollar for the first time since October. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, expressed concern over the sharp fluctuations. Mr Masao Suzaki, an economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said Japan would probably have to endorse a higher yen in the face of a surging trade surplus, which rose by 39.4 per cent last month amid increasing pressure by the US on the Japanese government to lift domestic demand. Some export-oriented, high-technology issues were sold on the stronger yen. Hitachi receded Y7 to Y678, falling below its 1992 low of Y685. Electric power companies, in contrast, gained on the same score. Tokyo Electric Power moved forward Y10 to Y2,590, Tohoku Electric Power Y40 to Y2,370 and Shikoku Electric Power Y20 to Y2,500. Retail issues encountered bargain hunting by foreign investors. Mitsukoshi advanced Y18 to Y740 and Tokyu Y13 to Y569. Dealers dabbled in Aids-related stocks. Nagase, a chemical trading company, was the most active issue of the day, climbing Y21 to Y874. Kanematsu, a medium-sized trading company, rose Y26 to Y412. Housing-related shares were also bought by dealers. Daikyo, the leading condominium builder, moved ahead Y29 to Y884. Sekisui House, which had been sold ahead of its equity-linked bond issue, recovered Y24 to Y979. Nichias, a construction materials maker, put on Y18 at Y487. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 73.64 to 18,332.64 in volume of 71m shares. Roundup THE REGION offered a moderate and by no means unanimous response to events in New York. AUSTRALIA partially recovered to end with the All Ordinaries index only 10.8 down at 1,601.3 after an early 1,593.3. Turnover came to a heavy 146.52m shares worth ADollars 370m. The index was dragged down by the US-linked News Corp, down 50 cents at ADollars 29.94 in turnover of ADollars 50.24m. Banks, particularly ANZ, saved the market from worse damage. ANZ topped industrial turnover for the second day amid continuing takeover speculation, and closed 9 cents stronger at ADollars 3.40. NEW ZEALAND was less fortunate, the NZSE-40 index falling 20.94 to 1,600.71. Volume was heavy at NZDollars 65m, some NZDollars 41m of that due to Telecom, down 8 cents at NZDollars 2.75 after a sharp rise on staffing cuts on Tuesday. Fletcher Challenge slipped 6 cents to NZDollars 2.55 after posting interim profits at the top end of expectations. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index declined 12.80 to 1,616.56 in volume of 120m shares, against 118.3m on Wednesday. KUALA LUMPUR added further profit-taking to the Wall Street influence and the KLSE composite index finished 9.20 lower at 625.81. BANGKOK was unable to recover from a wave of early panic selling over the announcement that First City Investment was forced to defer repaying matured deposits. The SET index closed at 973.24, down 13.41, with the banking, finance and property sectors suffering the most. TAIWAN, seemingly untouched by the Dow, climbed 3.3 per cent in hectic trade. The weighted index ended 126.43 higher at 4,001.16 on a wave of late buying, turnover expanding from TDollars 31.8bn to a very heavy TDollars 43.25bn. Financials, which had been rallying on signs of improving profits and links to the premier-designate, Lien Chan, remained particularly strong. HONG KONG finished moderately higher after a day of wide swings on rumours that Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political future could resume. The Hang Seng index closed 21.84 ahead at 6,087.46 after opening 36 points down. Turnover shrank from HKDollars 4.29bn to HKDollars 3.27bn. Sun Hung Kai Properties topped the actives list and advanced HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 31.75.</p>

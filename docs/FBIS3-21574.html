On Saturday, in the course of his visit to the USA, Leonid  Kravchuk told journalists that a stoppage of Ukrainian plants  and factories because of gas shortages is real, and that it may  jeopardize the implementation of all the previous accords,  including the agreement concerning nuclear disarmament.    According to Shmarov, "the president hinted that, if  economic  pressure is brought to bear on Ukraine, the expectation that all  of the country's resources will be accumulated to accomplish  that task would be futile."    "So far we have requested Russia to raise supplies to the  fixed level -- 100-105 million cubic meters a day," Shmarov  said. "At the same time we urged local governments to halt gas  supplies to plants and factories in order to give gas to the  populace to hold out till the cold ends."    Shmarov believes that Russia's actions connected with  reduced  gas supplies have no political tinge. The Gasprom is a  joint-stock society, and our debt should be paid to it," he said.    The deputy premier confirmed the reports that the first  train  carrying nuclear warheads crossed Ukraine's border with Russia  on Saturday. According to him, in a cable sent to the Ukrainian  government, Russia's Premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin, "guaranteed  to ensure nuclear fuel supplies in accordance with our  understanding within March."    As Shmarov said, early this year Russia delivered a  consignment of fuel for the nuclear-power plant in Chernobyl,  but that fuel was delivered under the "goods against money"  scheme.    Under the agreement concerning Ukraine's nuclear  disarmament,  Russia supplies nuclear fuel in exchange for nuclear warheads  only for the nuclear-power plants in Zaporozhye, Rovny and  Southern Ukraine.    "Another consignment of nuclear warheads is being prepared  to  be despatched from Ukraine," Shmarov said. However it will be  despatched "only if we see adequate actions on the part of  Russia," he added.</p>

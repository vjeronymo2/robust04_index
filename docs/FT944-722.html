			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Finnish strike called off An indefinite strike due to begin on December 26 in Finland's paper and pulp industry, the country's biggest exporting sector, was called off yesterday when employers and the trade unions accepted a settlement proposal by a state arbitrator. The Finnish Forestry Industries Federation complained that the 13-month agreement, giving an average 6 per cent increase in wages, eroded the sector's international competitiveness. But the award was significantly less than the 10 per cent union claim and rejected most union demands for a cuts in working hours. The settlement, more than three times the current annual rate of inflation, will fuel fears of an inflationary upturn in Finland.</p>

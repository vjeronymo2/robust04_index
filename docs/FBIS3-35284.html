Mujalli Nasrawin, a Jordanian who used to be a member of the  Ba'th party which rules Syria and Iraq, told AFP that  al-Suwaydani was freed on Monday for health reasons.    Himself released from a Syrian jail after 22 years, Nasrawin  had called Saturday on Damascus to free al-Suwaydani, expressing  fears he might die in al-Mazzah prison after having suffered an  attack of hemiplegia.    Al-Suwaydani, a Sunni Moslem, was army chief-of-staff on the  side of Salah Jadid, whose Ba'th party faction clashed with  al-Asad's in the late 1960s.    At that time al-Asad, an Alawite Moslem, was air force chief  under president Nur-al-Din al-Atasi, a Sunni.    In 1968, al-Asad ousted al-Suwaydani, who was jailed a year  later. In a 1970 coup, al-Asad overthrew al-Atasi to take over  as president.    Al-Atasi was freed in April 1992 and died last December in a  Paris hospital, while Jadid died last August in a Damascus jail.    Some 20 political prisoners have been in jail in Syria for  more than 20 years, most of them arrested during al-Asad's coup,  according to international human rights groups.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Earn more while keeping a rein on your risks - In the latest in her series on investing for income, Debbie Harrison suggests how people who are reluctant to invest in ordinary shares can still obtain a rising income Many investors, particularly pensioners, need to squeeze as much income as they can from their ventures and are reluctant to take any risks with the capital. The trouble with this approach is that inflation eats into the real value of both capital and income. That is why most advisers say that even income-orientated investors should have at least some equity-based investments in their portfolios if they can afford to invest over the medium to long term. If you cannot, or will not accept the risk of ordinary shares, it is worth considering a half-way house: investments which offer some capital protection plus a rising income. This week, we cover four of these: index-linked gilts, index-linked corporate debentures, stepped preference shares of spilt capital investment trusts, and escalator bonds. Index-linked gilts Issued by the government, these guarantee to increase both the six-monthly interest payments and the 'nominal' or original capital investment due at redemption in line with increases in the retail prices index. Since the starting RPI used is eight months before the date of issue, the final value of the investment can be calculated precisely seven months before redemption (RPI figures are published a month behind). Like conventional gilts, the index-linked variety are traded actively, so the price and real value can fluctuate significantly between the issue and redemption date. Gerry Loughrey, economic strategist with stockbroker Albert E. Sharp, explains: 'These are market instruments, and the value will rise and fall according to inflation and interest expectations, the economic and the political environment. 'At present, investors could be interested in index-linked gilts because they provide a hedge against political instability. If a Labour government is elected and inflation rises, both income and capital would be protected fully.' Investors seeking absolute guarantees from their income-yielding portfolio may be tempted to put all their money in gilts. In this case, Loughrey would recommend a balance between conventional gilts, which offer a comparatively high fixed income but no index-linking of the capital value; and index-linked gilts, which offer a low initial income but protect the income and capital from rising inflation. Loughrey says that in a more general portfolio of income-yielding investments, index-linked gilts could represent between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the holding depending on the investor's attitude to risk. It is also possible to buy the corporate equivalent of index-linked gilts, but these debentures represent a small market at present - mainly utilities and investment trust companies. Corporate index-linked debentures These work in a similar way to index-linked gilts, paying interest twice a year which, along with the original capital investment, is linked to the RPI. Michael Dyson, director of BZW Capital Markets, says: 'The main benefit of the corporate version is the higher coupon, or interest rate, payable. 'The real yield on corporate index-linked is around 5.1 per cent at present on the Severn River Crossing debenture (issued to raise funds for the new Severn Bridge), whereas the real yield on index-linked gilts is around 4 per cent.' Phillip Payne, sterling and fixed interest analyst with stockbroker Capel-Cure Myers, has reservations about corporate index-linked debentures. 'Our first preference is the gilt market because of its liquidity and yields. There are only five or six corporate issues around at present, and most of these are expensive to trade compared with gilts. So, they would be suitable only for the longer-term investor.' Escalator bonds These share some of the characteristics of gilts. The account pays a pre-determined rate of interest for the first year, then increases the rate by a fixed amount for subsequent years. Typically, the increase is 1 per cent for the first four years and 3 per cent for the fifth, although you will lose part of the interest payment if you pull out early. Angus Jones, account manager at Capel Cure Myers said: 'Escalator bonds could be attractive if interest rates remain low. They might form part of a deposit portfolio, but are not a substitute for equity investment.' Stepped preference shares of split-capital trusts These offer an income which is guaranteed to rise each year at a fixed rate, and a fixed redemption price for the shares when the trust is wound up. The four biggest names in this specialist market are General Consolidated, River &amp; Mercantile, Scottish National and TR Technology. Each investment trust offers a different yield and annual increase, depending on the risk profile of the underlying assets. The factors to consider are the investment profile (level of risk); the present dividend yield; and gross redemption yield (the total return expressed as an annual percentage, assuming the share is bought at the present price and held to maturity). General Consolidated invests in UK medium-sized companies. Present yield 3 per cent; 7.5 per cent annual increases until January 1997; gross redemption yield 9.2 per cent a year. R&amp;M invests in UK high-yielding stocks. Present yield 4.9 per cent; 5 per cent annual increases until April 2000; gross redemption yield 9.5 per cent a year. Scottish National invests in UK high-yielding stocks and convertibles. Present yield 5.7 per cent; 5 per cent a year increases until September 1998; gross redemption yield 9.2 per cent. TR Technology invests in international technology companies. Present yield 6.0 per cent; 5 per cent a year increases until April 1998; gross redemption yield 10.8 per cent a year. Loughrey says: 'It is important to remember these are not bonds. You buy into an equity investment which is structured to pay an income - the risk level depends on the underlying assets in which the trust is invested.' For those prepared to accept the risks, the yields can be much higher than index-linked gilts and corporate bonds. Preference shares, as their name suggests, have first call on any income the trust receives. Joanne Eaves, assistant personal equity plan manager with R&amp;M, stresses: 'There is no way that these annual increases would not be paid. They are attached to the class of share at the time of launching the trust, and are guaranteed through to the wind-up date.' Postscript: The four investments are likely to appeal to different types of investor. Escalator bonds are the easiest to understand and offer some of the best immediate yields. If inflation and interest rates in the United Kingdom rise more than expected over the next five years, however, escalator bonds will provide no inflation-proofing for your capital - and even the increased income might look less competitive than it does now. Index-linked gilts are a safe choice for anyone who can afford the low starting yield, and they offer capital protection and inflation-proofing so long as you can hold them to maturity. The other two offer potentially greater rewards - and risks. INDEX-LINKED GILTS Net income or yield: Non-taxpayer: 2.1%-4.5% 25% taxpayer: 1.56%-3.38% 40% taxpayer: 1.26%-2.7% Key facts: Income paid twice a year, gross if purchased through National Savings Stock Register (details from post offices), net of basic rate tax if purchased through a stockbroker (reclaimable for non-taxpayers). No capital gains tax liability. Comment: Low initial income but both capital and income protected against rising inflation. Investors with less than Pounds 5000 to invest in index linked stock should use the National Savings Stock Register because stockbroker charges render this level of investment uneconomic. CORPORATE INDEX-LINKED DEBENTURES Net income or yield: Non-taxpayer: around 5% 25% taxpayer: 3.75% 40% taxpayer: 3.0% Key facts: Income paid twice a year net of basic rate tax (this is reclaimable for non-taxpayers). No capital gains tax liability on qualifying corporate bonds. Comments: Small market at present, more utilities expected to enter in the future. Higher interest than index linked gilts. No minimum, but not recommended for investments under Pounds 5,000. Corporate index-linked debentures can be expensive to trade so best held for the long term. ESCALATOR BONDS Net income or yield in first year: Non-taxpayer: about 6% 25% taxpayer: 4.5% 40% taxpayer: 3.6% Key facts: Available from several building societies and banks. Return of capital guaranteed. Minimum investment varies (Pounds 2,000 for Barclays). Typical rates (based on Barclays' account): 6 per cent year one, 7 per cent year 2, 8 per cent year three, 9 per cent year four, 12 per cent year five. Income paid monthly, annually or at end of term. Comment: Only attractive if you think interest rates will remain low. Less secure than gilts. If a building society becomes insolvent all you get back is 90 per cent of up to Pounds 20,000. STEPPED PREFERENCE SHARES OF SPLIT CAPITAL TRUSTS Net income or yield: Non-taxpayer: 4%-7.6% 25% taxpayer: 3%-5.7% 40% taxpayer: 2.4%-4.56% Key facts: Income and redemption value guaranteed by the trust. Dividends paid net of basic rate tax (reclaimable for non-taxpayers). Any capital gain on sale or redemption will be assessed for CGT. Comment: Small market. Equity investments always entail possible risk, but to date no trust has failed to deliver. The higher the risk rating of the underlying assets, the higher the income. Not economic to purchase through stockbroker for amounts less than Pounds 5,000.

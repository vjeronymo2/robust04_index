			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> SHELL SYMPATHIZES WITH MANDARICH  </P> <P> Coach Art Shell can sympathize with offensive tackle Tony Mandarich of the  Green Bay Packers, the second player selected in the 1989 NFL draft.  </P> <P> A Hall of Fame offensive tackle, Shell thinks it takes time for a player to  develop at that position.  </P> <P> "It's not easy to come up to this level and play, especially at tackle," Shell  said. "Youcan hide a guy at guard inside, but a tackle is out there by  himself."  </P> <P> Is Mandarich making progress?  </P> <P> Packer Coach Lindy Infante said: "Far too much has been written about his  progress. He was analyzed so severely that there's no way he could ever live up  to the expectations that people wanted to place on him."  </P> <P> Quarterback Don Majkowski of the Packers sprained an ankle in the 24-20 loss to  the San Francisco 49ers last week, but he is expected to play Sunday against  the Raiders at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> Running back Keith Woodside (ankle injury) and linebacker Brian Noble (foot  injury) of the Packers are listed as questionable.

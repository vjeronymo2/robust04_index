			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KINISON DUE -- OR IS HE?  </P> <P> Sam Kinison fans, eager for the chance to see the comedian in a small venue,  are plucking up tickets quickly for an advertised April 23 date at the Laff  Stop in Newport Beach. The first show at the 280-seat club is sold out and  tickets -- at $25 a pop -- are selling fast for a 10 p.m. show. There may be  bad news for ticket-holders, however: Though the club insists that the date is  firm, Kinison's assistant says it has not yet been finalized.  </P></p>

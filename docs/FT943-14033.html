			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK government's plans for senior civil servants 'unwise' and 'should be scrapped' Sir, You are right in saying ('Politicians and civil servants', July 14) that the government's White Paper needs to be judged by 'the degree to which it preserves a non-political civil service that can serve governments of any persuasion'. If there is a change of government at the next general election, incoming ministers will be advised by senior civil servants, who will by then have served a government of the same political persuasion for an uninterrupted 17 years. They will be willing and able to give unbiased advice. But anything which has happened to reduce their traditional independence can only add to the suspicion which they will inevitably face from a new government. It would thus be most unwise to weaken the tenure of senior civil servants at this stage. Even a strengthened appeal procedure would be a much less effective safeguard of independence than the present appointments system. Furthermore, the comparison between the role of senior civil servants and heads of leading businesses - never very exact - becomes less and less meaningful as more civil service functions are hived-off or privatised. The role of the senior civil servant will be less the management of large departments and more the traditional ones of offering disinterested advice to ministers and watching over the public interest. There is therefore no need to introduce procedures which are appropriate to the private sector but which carry grave risks of political interference if applied to senior civil servants. This part of the government's plans should be scrapped. Michael Franklin, 15 Galley Lane, Barnet, Hertfordshire EN5 4AR</p>

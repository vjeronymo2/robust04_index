			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Economics: US inflation fears may ease FEARS in the US that inflation is about to pick up should be allayed this week if economists' expectations for May producer price inflation prove correct. The median forecast is for a rise of 0.2 per cent on the month, following an unusual 0.6 per cent jump in April. A sharp 0.4 per cent rise in the so-called core measure of producer price inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, added to concerns in April. The core measure for May is forecast to have risen by 0.2 per cent. Many analysts believe that the April figures should prove to be an exception rather than the start of a new trend. In April, price increases for new cars and tobacco products contributed half of the price rise in the total. Last month, by contrast, food and energy prices probably declined slightly after a few months of volatile, but mainly large increases. Retail sales figures are also out in the US this week. They are expected to have risen more moderately last month than they did in April. Car sales were again strong in May following a 3 per cent rise in April. According to analysts at Midland Global Markets, cars have been the strongest sales component since the recovery began. Building materials are also expected to have grown robustly in May. In the UK, April consumer credit figures are out today. They are expected to be slightly less robust than in March, reflecting the weakness of retail sales activity during the month. On Thursday the Central Statistical Office releases the 1993 edition of Regional Trends, which brings together a wide range of statistical information on the regions of the UK.

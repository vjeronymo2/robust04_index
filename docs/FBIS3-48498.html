			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pak Ui-chun on interview with Kim Sok-kyu, ROK </F> ambassador to Russia, with unidentified reporters; date and  place not given]    [Text] "I am sorry to see that the ROK public is negative  and critical about Russia and it has a tendency to disdain  Russia ever since the pending issues, including the economic  cooperation loan, were brought into the fore after the fervor  and bubbles of the early stage of amity burst."    Kim Sok-kyu, ROK ambassador to Russia, who made a temporary  home visit on 22 January to discuss state affairs with his  headquarters after 10 months in his position, said it is  important to correctly perceive Russia and stressed that the ROK  should further strengthen diplomacy toward Russia in the  direction whereby Russia can be secured as a support force in  reunification and security.    Following are questions posed to and answers given by  Ambassador Kim:    [Reporter] How are things in Russia these days?    [Kim] After the new parliament was formed, the conservatives  and communists launching the congress became more notable than  expected because radical reformers had hurt various classes,  such as the unemployed and beneficiaries of the pension system.  It will take two years before the situation in Russia  stabilizes. However, there will be no change in Russia's policy  on the Korean peninsula.    [Reporter] How do you assess the Russian Government's recent  proposal of supplying, and jointly developing and manufacturing  weapons?    [Kim] The issue on the military exchanges between the two  countries is an issue to be examined on a long-term basis and,  in my personal opinion, it is worthwhile reviewing. The reason  the Russian Government made such a proposal is that there is no  other way for Russia to reimburse the economic cooperation loan.    [Reporter] How efficient are the Russian weapons?    [Kim] They should be deemed highly efficient, taking into  account that Russia once competed with the United States as a  superpower. Russia is currently selling weapons to various  countries.    [Reporter] How about the issue of President Kim's visit to  Russia?    [Kim] The Russian Government keeps asking when President Kim  Yong-sam can visit Russia. However, I have not received any  kind of a commitment from the government. If President Kim  visits Russia this year, a year marking the 110th anniversary of  the establishment of the ROK-Russian diplomatic relations, it  will be a golden opportunity for both countries to revitalize  relations.    [Reporter] What about the issue of compensating the bereaved  families of victims of the Korean airliner?    [Kim] I have already asked the Russian Government for  compensation. The Russian Government, however, seems to have the  notion that more solid information should be provided by the  United States to clarify the issue.    [Reporter] How big is the trade volume between the ROK and  Russia?    [Kim] Last year, bilateral trade amounted to $1.9 billion,  $0.6 billion in exports and $1.3 billion in imports. However,  the trade volume is expected to reach up to $10 billion by early  2000 and Russia will become one of our biggest markets. In  Russia nowadays, electronic goods manufactured by domestic  companies such as Samsong, Goldstar, and Daewoo are selling like  hot cakes. Due to the fact that Russia grants the Generalized  System of Preference (GSP) to the ROK goods, they are relatively  cheaper than Japanese goods and, consequently, are competitive.</p>

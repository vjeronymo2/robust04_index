			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / BSkyB and Ansett help lift News Corp 24% A surge in profits from its two associate companies, BSkyB and Ansett Airlines, more than offset a small decline in earnings from core operations at News Corporation, and allowed Mr Rupert Murdoch's media and film group to post after-tax profits, before abnormals, of ADollars 1.21bn (Pounds 580m) in the 12 months to June. This was nearly 24 per cent up on the ADollars 979m made in the previous year. Net profits after abnormals reached ADollars 1.33bn, up from ADollars 864m. This reflected a ADollars 123m gain - largely on the sale of the group's interest in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) - compared with a ADollars 115m charge last time. Revenues were 8.7 per cent higher at ADollars 11.6bn. Much of the improvement came from the two associates, whose combined contribution to profits more than doubled from ADollars 177m to ADollars 394. Ansett, the Australian airline owned jointly by News Corp and TNT, saw operating profits almost quadruple, while passenger volume rose by more than 13 per cent. The airline attributed the improvement to increased business travel, better yield management, advertising and cost control. BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster in which News has a 50 per cent stake and where Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, also has a stake, saw operating profits rise 170 per cent. News Corp's figures were also helped by a ADollars 70m drop in interest charges, to ADollars 667m, as a debt reduction and rescheduling programme continued. Operating profits from core operations were 6.2 per cent lower at ADollars 1.6bn, with strong increases on the film and television side offset by declines in newspapers and magazines/inserts. The latter was due to the newspaper price war in the UK, which cut operating profits there by 37 per cent; to the sale of the SCMP interest; to higher than expected start-up costs at a new Melbourne printing facility; and to competitive pressure in the coupon industry. Overall, the newspapers division made operating profits of ADollars 436m, against ADollars 671m, while magazines and inserts contributed ADollars 339m, against ADollars 402m. By contrast, the film division multiplied operating profits to ADollars 141m, from ADollars 53m, while television made ADollars 466m against ADollars 373m. The book publishing side produced ADollars 208m. Earnings per share, based on profits after outside equity interests but before abnormal items, rose 12.3 per cent to 64 cents.

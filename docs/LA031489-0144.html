			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> TWO QUIT LIFE POSTS ON NOBEL PANEL OVER LACK OF SUPPORT FOR RUSHDIE  </P> <P> Two members of Sweden's prestigious Academy of Letters, guardian of the Nobel  Literature Prize, resigned their life memberships today over the committee's  refusal to fully support author Salman Rushdie.  </P> <P> Novelists Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten said they could no longer be  members of a body which had failed to condemn Iran's death threats against the  Indian-born British author of "The Satanic Verses." Iran's leader Ayatollah  Ruhollah Khomeini last month called on Muslims to kill Rushdie for blasphemy  against Islam.  </P> <P> The announcement of the novelists' resignations came as a shock to the Academy,  whose members are elected for life.  </P> <P> "It would have been better if they had been loyal to the Academy and let us  know first," said Sture Allen, the Academy's permanent secretary.  </P></p>

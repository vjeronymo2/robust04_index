			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview for a Netherlands daily, DE  VOLKSKRAND, Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Assembly of the  Srpska republic, spoke, among other things, about the massacre  that took place in Sarajevo on Saturday [5 February].    [Begin Krajisnik recording] We do not have any information  at present. The only thing that we know is that the Serbian  side did not do it. However, we have some indications,  suspicions, that there is even a possibility of this having been  committed by a third side, neither the Serbian nor the Muslim  side, but a side that does not want an agreement to be reached  between the Muslims and the Serbs. We had been on a very good  way to signing a document similar to the document and the  statement signed between the Serbs and the Croats, and just at  the time of this rapprochement, we found ourselves in the  situation of these talks being undermined. We cannot say what  forces these are. There are too many interested parties that  would want the war to continue here and that do not want  rapprochement between the Muslims and the Serbs.

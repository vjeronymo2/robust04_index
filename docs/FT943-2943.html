			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poland's privatisation plans are feasible Sir, Ms Swiatkowski Cannon's Personal View (September 9), contained many misunderstandings and mis-representations about Poland's mass privatisation programme (MPP). As an adviser to successive Polish governments in helping to establish and implement the programme, I would like to put the record straight. The author argues that the programme is centralised and bureaucratic. Inevitably, governments are always involved in the early stages of privatisation as it is state assets which are being disposed. The approach we have evolved is to give substantial responsibility for the actual restructuring of companies in the programme to national investment funds (NIFs). They will have substantial autonomy, operating at arm's length from the government, deciding how best to restructure the companies under their managements prior to public flotation. These funds will be managed by qualified professional firms, selected after competitive tender. Quality investment banks, fund managers and consulting firms have already been shortlisted for this purpose. Several international institutions - European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, World Bank, British Know-How Fund and the European Union - support the programme through the provision of funding and technical assistance. Maybe this is a minor point but it shows the confidence which the international community has in the privatisation programme. The author says that the programme is too limited, in that only some 400 companies are intended to be covered by the programme. Again this misunderstands the position. The MPP is only one element of a multi-track approach to Polish privatisation. The principal objective within the MPP is that the companies included should have the potential after restructuring to be strong and viable, with good growth prospects. We have to date identified about 400 such comp-anies. The suggestion that the programme cannot satisfy popular demand for equity and participation in reforms is also not true. Potentially, all 27m adult Polish citizens will be able to participate in the programme, acquiring, for a small registration fee, a security which is likely to have a substantial market value, and will be traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange - one of the best regulated stock exchanges in Europe. We are sure that the MPP specifically meets the need for mass participation in the restructuring of Polish enterprises and, regardless of the political environment, is feasible.

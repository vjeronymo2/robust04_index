			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Vehicle and equipment manufacturers that use regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines would be required to use appropriate certified nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines in their vehicles and equipment after August 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on whether a separate effective date for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers should be established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, if so, whether that date should be three months after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 1, 1996 effective date for nonroad engine manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (that is, November 1, 1996). It appears, based on best available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, that the start of large volume equipment production is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately November 1 of every year. EPA is considering this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate effective date because it is concerned that equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers have small inventories of noncertified engines that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could not be incorporated into equipment by the August 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date. EPA would consider extending this flexibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six months, that is, February 1, 1997, if manufacturers could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantitatively demonstrate that the increased risk of stockpiling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncertified engines by the equipment manufacturers would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimal and the inventory buildup would be normal. EPA also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on whether a separate effective date for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment manufacturers should be based on introduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment into commerce, rather than the date of equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The August 1996 effective date allows engine manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over two years of lead time from the date of this proposal, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than one year beyond the 1995 implementation date imposed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB. EPA is not proposing the same effective date as CARB in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to allow manufacturers some lead time between the CARB and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal effective dates to bring preempted engines into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance; however, EPA requests comment on the feasibility of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995 effective date for federal standards, particularly for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines that are not preempted from state regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA acknowledges the need for sufficient lead time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform research, develop testing capacity, apply emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control technology, and manufacture clean engines, EPA's view is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that engine manufacturers have been aware for a considerable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time that emission regulations were likely to impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their products in the near future. In 1990, CARB was required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) to develop emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for lawn and garden and utility equipment engines by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December of 1990. In November of 1990, Congress amended the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal Clean Air Act, requiring that EPA study emissions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad engines and vehicles by November of 1991 and promulgate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable regulations by November of 1992 if these sources were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found to contribute significantly to air pollution. At a public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workshop held in March of 1992, EPA discussed the importance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from small SI engines, announcing its intent to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable regulations. Consequently, manufacturers have known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since March 1992, at the latest, that EPA was planning to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards applicable to their products, and have already had more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than two years to assess emission control technologies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop testing capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several state and environmental interest groups have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed concerns that a 1996 effective date delays the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realization of reductions of in-use air pollutant emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessarily and limits the ability of many states to adhere to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the schedules mandated in the CAA for reasonable further progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toward volatile organic compound reductions from 1990 levels and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard. Manufacturers have argued that a 1996 effective date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offers too little lead time given that this proposed rule covers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various categories of equipment that California is preempted from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

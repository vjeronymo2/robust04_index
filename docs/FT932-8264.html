			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / BSN warning hits food shares SHARE prices of leading European food companies fell yesterday after Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN, France's largest food manufacturer, said it was ready to cut prices to defend market share. He said the company was operating 'in an unprecedented economic crisis', while retailers were demanding larger discounts and providing stiffer competition with cheap private-label ranges. Mr Riboud's remarks added to investors' recent fears that international recession and the growing power of food retailers would intensify price competition. His comments follow cautious forecasts by other large food and consumer groups in the US and Europe, and what were widely considered disappointing first quarter results from Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch manufacturer. Many branded international manufacturers of consumer products have been jolted by last month's decision by Philip Morris to cut the US price of Marlboro cigarettes. Shares in BSN, which on Monday reported a 5.7 per cent drop in first-quarter sales, fell FFr11 to close at FFr863 yesterday. In London, Mr Riboud's comments added to anxiety about the impact of sterling's recent recovery on food groups with a large international exposure. Cadbury Schweppes fell 9p to 447p and United Biscuits by 9p to 412p, while Unilever fell 22p to 1036p in London and Fl 1.80 to Fl 193.20 in Amsterdam. In Zurich, however, Nestle registered shares rose SFr15 to SFr1130. Mr Riboud said BSN aimed to offset the impact on profit margins of any price reductions by cutting costs. The company might also have to weed out weaker brands which were squeezed between market leaders and private label products. Analysts believe BSN is most vulnerable to price competition in mineral water, of which it is the world's second largest producer.</p>

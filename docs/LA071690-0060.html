			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: EL TORO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER LAND SWAP TUESDAY  </P> <P> A land swap that would provide residents a community center and playing fields  and speed completion of Alton Parkway will be up for initial approval by the  Board of Supervisors at its regular meeting Tuesday.  </P> <P> The swap proposed by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who is seeking the board's  "conceptual approval," involves the Foothill Ranch Co., which will be allowed  to build a commercial development on a 73-acre parcel off El Toro Road that is  now owned by the county.  </P> <P> Vasquez called the plan a "truly unique opportunity" because it would allow  construction of the recreational facilities and completion of Alton Parkway, a  major roadway that can divert traffic away from neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Vasquez has proposed exchanging the county's 73-acre site for Foothill Ranch  Co.'s help in building the El Toro/Lake Forest Community Center and playing  fields. The proposal also calls for joint parking facilities for recreation  areas and nearby Saddleback Community Church, and for the company to construct  a low-rise business park.  </P> <P> In addition, the swap would require the company to acquire a portion of land  needed by the Marine Corps at El Toro for future base housing. The county wants  to complete Alton Parkway, which cuts through Marine Corps property. Instead of  buying the right-of-way, the county has reached an agreement with the Marine  Corps to have Foothill Ranch Co. acquire land for base housing, and in return  the county will be awarded right-of-way for the completion of Alton Parkway.  </P> <P> Commercial development of the 73-acre site would be restricted to preserve the  Aliso Creek corridor in its entirety. It is estimated that only about 30 to 40  acres of the site would be developed.  </P> <P> Although the county parcel is an open-space area, Vasquez said he has been  advised by the county Environmental Management Agency that the area's natural  open-space value is "extremely limited" because of the planned extension of  Portola Parkway and other access roads.

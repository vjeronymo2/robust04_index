			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Alcoa down to Dollars 76m in first quarter ALCOA, the world's largest producer of aluminium, suffered a drop in profits and revenue in the first quarter. It reported a decline in the quarter's earnings to Dollars 76m, or 89 cents per share, from Dollars 97m, or Dollars 1.14 per share, last year. Revenues were Dollars 2.3bn, down 7 per cent, from Dollars 2.4bn in the first quarter of 1991. Although shipments increased to 666,000 metric tons from 648,000 metric tons a year ago, the first-quarter earnings decline reflects lower prices for alumina, ingot and most fabricated aluminium products. Alcoa said markets this year were not expected to improve until aluminium from the former Soviet Union, which went to exports last year, was redirected to internal uses and western economies improved. First-quarter results included Dollars 8m, or 10 cents per share, from the sale of investments in Venezuela. The comparative quarter in 1991 included exchange and other adjustments of Dollars 10.2m, or 12 cents per share, related to operations in Norway. Return on shareholders' equity dropped to 6.1 per cent during the first quarter, compared with 7.5 per cent last year. But the company said that, excluding special charges in the fourth quarter of 1991, the first-quarter results were better than those of the preceding period. Alcoa said its effective tax rate for this year would be lower than in 1991, before special charges, due largely to favourable settlements of prior years' taxes by Alcoa Aluminnio in Brazil and tax law changes in Norway. The company's earnings in 1991 fell 79 per cent to Dollars 62.7m as the price for aluminium plunged to approximately 50 cents per pound, its lowest in real terms.</p>

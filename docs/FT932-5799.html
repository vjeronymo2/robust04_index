			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Arts: Kraft at the South Bank - Concert Magnus Lindberg deserves every moment of the attention currently being paid to him in London. This young (b. 1958) Finn is a composer with bags of individual imagination, energy and - at times - plain cheek, and he has the resources to carry through even the wildest of his musical ideas. Last week's short spell of South Bank concerts devoted to his music culminated, on Saturday evening, with perhaps the wildest idea so far: Kraft, given its British premiere by the Philharmonia Orchestra under Esa-Pekka Salonen (a longtime Lindberg collaborator and champion). This piece has developed a considerable and rather notorious reputation since its Helsinki premiere in 1985. One heard and saw why: Kraft is a Happening, a jeu d'esprit with a rude, rebellious flavour. Lindberg, originally commissioned by the Helsinki Festival to produce a concerto for piano instead took the opportunity to martial vast orchestral forces, disperse them over a large hall, and at times set them (musically) at each others' throats. On the surface the piece consists of 45 minutes of drum-bangs, gong-crashes, and fierce brayings from brass-groups forming and re-forming at different points of the Festival Hall, interspersed with surreally placed quiet solos. A spirit of choreographed chaos is typified by the group of seven young men (from the Finnish avant-garde chamber-group Toimii, conductor Salonen among them) in white tennis togs nimbly haring around the Royal Festival Hall stage and auditorium as though on a musical treasure hunt. A catch of rubbish-dump items (including a Volvo bonnet) serving as percussion instruments dangles from the front of the platform; at one point the sound of bubbles blown in a bucket of water is amplified to serve as 'orchestral accompaniment'. The notion of experimental music-theatre seemed to be revived: and yet, for all the confrontational aspects, the polychoral groups of instrumental voices pugnaciously competing, the descent into visual farce, it is the suggestiveness of Lindberg's actual notes that constantly holds the ear, drawing it below the surface into a world of complex, ambiguous and even rather mysterious musical suggestion. A possible dramatic theme can be traced - of individual freedom of expression (embodied by the cello, clarinet and piano solos, all full of 'personal' riffs and curlicues) at ever-growing risk in a rigidly depersonalised world (symbolised by the concluding savagery of full-orchestral repeated chords). But what ultimately lends Kraft its memorable quality is the unpredictable wit, the freedom of expression, and the fleeting touch of musical grace that can descend on even its loopiest episodes. I don't know exactly how and why the piece 'adds up'; but I insist that it does.</p>

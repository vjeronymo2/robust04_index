			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMENDMENT OUTLAWING FLAG DESECRATION KILLED  </P> <P> The Senate, in a dramatic showdown today with President Bush, decisively  rejected a proposed constitutional amendment to outlaw desecration of the  American flag.  </P> <P> The amendment, which would have been the 27th, was once considered almost  certain of passage. But grass-roots passions cooled, senators feared tinkering  with the 200-year-old Bill of Rights and Republican co-sponsors defected.  </P> <P> The vote was 51 to 48 in favor of the amendment, 15 short of the two-thirds  majority voting that was required for passage. A vote breakdown showed 33  Republicans and 18 Democrats voting for the amendment, and 37 Democrats and 11  Republicans against.  </P> <P> "In my view, the flag should be at half-mast after this vote," said Senate GOP  leader Bob Dole of Kansas.  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the Senate vote, saying: "Senators  demonstrated today that they understand that the right of dissent is a  fundamental principle of our society. A majority, no matter how large or  impassioned, cannot censor others or dictate how they express their political  views."  </P> <P> Congress, in response to a Supreme Court decision invalidating a Texas law that  banned flag burning, has already passed a bill making it a federal crime to  physically desecrate the flag.  </P> <P> Bush, who had sounded the call for a constitutional amendment, said that he  will allow that bill to become law without his signature and that the statute  is certain to be tested in the courts.  </P> <P> Deputy White House Press Secretary Alixe Glen said Bush was "disappointed" by  today's vote and emphasized that Administration lawyers had said from the start  that the statutory approach chosen by Congress will not withstand a court test.  </P> <P> Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine, a former federal judge  who led the fight against the amendment, said the nation has never tampered  with the Bill of Rights in 200 years "despite the worst that fate has hurled at  us."  </P> <P> Mitchell said, "Principles which have stood the test of time should not be  lightly discarded. Liberties that have seen us through civil wars and world  wars should not be tampered with."  </P> <P> But Dole, a wounded combat veteran of World War II, stood behind cartons of  petitions for the amendment and charged that the Senate was giving Americans  the "cold shoulder" by "too many lawyers who still think they're on the high  school debate team."  </P> <P> Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  insisted that there never was more than a "scant majority" for the amendment  and added: "We saved the flag, and we preserved the Constitution."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE BETWEEN U.S., MEXICO  </P> <P> The report published about the outcome of the meeting between U.S. President  George Bush and Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in Monterrey,  Mexico, states that "the Mexican government showed a new willingness to give  American companies a role in its state-owned oil monopoly" (Part A, Nov. 28).  That view is further stressed in your editorial ("President Salinas Shows the  Oil Card," Nov. 29), by presenting Salinas as gambling with a new card, "the  oil card," which, in turn, is seen as "a stunning crack in long-held Mexican  policy."  </P> <P> Such an interpretation springs from a guarantee loan requested by PEMEX, the  Mexican oil company, to the U.S. Export-Import Bank, in order to finance oil  drilling plans in Mexico. The $1.5-billion guarantee loan request is part of a  much broader investment program that PEMEX has been negotiating recently with  several international financial institutions. In fact, the possible credit has  already been included in the 1991 budget submitted to the Mexican Congress on  Nov. 15.  </P> <P> Furthermore, foreign participation in PEMEX drilling activities is far from  being new. The presence of both domestic and foreign private companies in the  Gulf of Mexico drilling wells has been common since the late 1970s.  </P> <P> In the case of international credits aimed at financing goods and services  provided by foreign firms, PEMEX's practice has been to extend payments to  contractors with financial resources. At no time has the practice been, nor  will it ever be, sharing or compromising oil reserves ownership or PEMEX's  assets.  </P> <P> Let it be stressed once again that the free trade negotiations will not include  two issues: oil and migrant labor.  </P> <P> It should be evident that there is no "oil card" being played by President  Salinas. Mexico's oil policy is firm and straightforward.  </P> <P> MARTIN TORRES, Press Attache  </P> <P> Consulate General of Mexico  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

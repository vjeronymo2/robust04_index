			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Minority to fight Slovakia plan More than 3,000 elected officials from Slovakia's Hungarian minority agreed at the weekend on a plan designed to protect and expand ethnic Hungarian rights in Slovakia. However, they pulled back from possible confrontation with the government by dropping demands for an autonomous Hungarian province with its own parliament. There are about 600,000 ethnic Hungarians, representing 12 per cent of the population, in Slovakia. They live mostly in provinces bordering Hungary in a wide arc stretching from Bratislava, the Slovak capital in the west, to Kosice and the Ukrainian border in the east. Local representatives who met in a packed sports' hall in the southern Slovak city of Komarno on Saturday, agreed to campaign for the establishment of a single administrative district comprising either one or three regions that would guarantee 'basic freedoms and human rights' for ethnic Hungarians. These proposals counter government plans included in a broader administrative reform that would divide the areas inhabited by ethnic Hungarians along north-south axes, thereby diluting Hungarian representation at local and national level. The meeting was called by an organisation established by mayors concerned at what they perceive as growing discrimination against the Hungarian minority. The removal of bilingual road signs earlier this year, and the passing of a law forcing Hungarian women to add the Slovak 'ova' to their family name, have caused widespread resentment.</p>

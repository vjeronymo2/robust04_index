			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [VoyenTV "Bearing South" video report; from the "Military </F> Review" program]    [Text] Now a few words about one of the most important  military-political events of the week. Russia and Ukraine, not  without some help from the U.S. President, have finally managed  to agree on the future of Ukraine's nuclear potential.    At the meeting of three presidents -- the Presidents of  Russia, the United States, and Ukraine -- Leonid Kravchuk  confirmed Ukraine would join the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  as soon as possible as a state without nuclear weapons. [video  carries montage of shots showing troops handling weapons  components; the "VoyenTV," Ministry of Defense Television Studio  logo is shown at top right of screen] It is presumed the first  200 nuclear weapons will be withdrawn from Ukraine to Russia  within 10 months. Altogether about 2,000 nuclear weapons must  be dismantled in Ukraine.    [Begin Maslin recording] In their statement the presidents  emphasized the importance of ensuring the security and  reliability of nuclear weapons until they are dismantled. At  the same time, the state of affairs regarding nuclear safety on  the territory of Ukraine continues to worsen. Storage depots  are packed beyond standard limits with warheads and nuclear  munitions that have been removed from service.    This is intolerable and besides everything else, it has  brought about a considerable increase in radiation levels. This  has been confirmed by chief designers from Arzamas-16 who  visited Pervomaysk on Ukrainian territory in September last  year. The warranty periods of most component parts have  expired. [end recording]    The signed agreement promises that nuclear weapons, which  are  dangerous not only when used but also when improperly stored,  will stop being used as bargaining chips in political games.</p>

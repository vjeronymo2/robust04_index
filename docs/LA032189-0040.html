			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COCAINE VICTIMS;  </P> <P> PROSTITUTES: EASY PREY FOR KILLERS  </P> <P> She was found in the mud by children looking for discarded spray cans among the  unfinished concrete pillars and dirt mounds of a Century Freeway construction  site. They stumbled upon the crumpled body of Renatha Yvette Simpson not far  from the Figueroa Street corners where she had sold herself, $10 at a time, to  buy cocaine.  </P> <P> A week after Simpson's 24th birthday last November, she became a Los Angeles  homicide statistic, fitting a familiar category of victim -- women involved to  at least some degree in prostitution. An average of more than one prostitute a  month is killed in the city, 69 all told in the four years from 1985 through  1988, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.  </P> <P> "I think that's the highest-risk occupation there is," Cmdr. William Booth  said. "Mercenaries are way behind prostitutes. . . . There is just nothing that  carries the risk with it, in peacetime, as streetwalking prostitution."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Death on the Streets  </P> <P> Recent reports that a serial killer has been preying on Southside prostitutes  and last month's arrest of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy accused of  killing three streetwalkers last year are but a part of the story of death on  the city's dingy prostitution strips.  </P> <P> Ready-made victims almost by definition, streetwalkers have become even more  vulnerable since crack cocaine laid claim to the inner city. Crack has  dramatically altered the streetwalking scene as women forsake caution and the  protection of pimps to hustle for the next high, police and people who work  with prostitutes say.  </P> <P> At times they are so drug-dazed that they fail to recognize undercover vice  officers who have repeatedly arrested them, much less the subtle danger signals  of a potential killer. Rather than taking their customers to the relative  security of a motel room, they often drive down the block to park in the dark,  down a dead end street or next to a vacant lot. It's cheaper and quicker.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anonymous Corpses  </P> <P> When they turn up dead, dumped into an alley or parking lot, their lives on the  streets offer few clues as to who ended them. They arrive at the morgue as Jane  Does, their past frequently an unreliable web of aliases, temporary addresses  and false birth dates.  </P> <P> "We're all out here doing it for drugs. Cocaine is our pimp," said Mary, a  husky-voiced hooker eating a pink Popsicle on Figueroa Street, a bleakly  monotonous strip of commerce, salvation and escape. Motels, liquor stores,  storefront churches and auto salvage yards abound. Day or night, streetwalkers  saunter up and down the dirty sidewalks, alone or in twos and threes, hopefully  scanning passing cars for a "date."  </P> <P> Certainly, "Renee" Simpson's fall to Figueroa was precipitated by cocaine.  </P> <P> "The girl was on it very bad," said Winnett Price, who shared a crowded South  Broadway apartment with her family and Simpson in the weeks before Simpson's  death. "I used to sit and talk to her about it and say all this is not  necessary. . . . I tried to tell her to slow down. She'd sit there and listen  and cry for a while."  </P> <P> Simpson worked with Price's mother and sister on a crew that cleaned office  buildings. When she was finished, she would go home, eat a big meal and wait  until midnight.  </P> <P> "It's like she had a job. . . . She'd be in and out the door from 12 to 5 in  the morning," Price said. Simpson would work the streets, get some cocaine, go  back to her room, and when she needed more crack, return to the dimly lit  street corners to smile at cruising men. In that part of Los Angeles, drug  dealers are never far away.  </P> <P> If Price warned her of the risks she was taking, Simpson would laugh: "I can  handle it."  </P> <P> She lived, after all, in a world where 2-year-olds are slaughtered in their  front yards in drive-by gang shootings, where the next customer may have AIDS  (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), where an argument can quickly flare into  a brutal knifing.  </P> <P> To a 37-year-old woman arrested for prostitution one night last week, the  danger of what she was doing isn't much greater "than waking up every morning  and stepping out the door. You don't know what's going to happen. You walk down  the street and every day somebody's getting killed."  </P> <P> She was an out-of-work, licensed vocational nurse who has been on cocaine for  nine years. Now and then, she says, she would take a ride with a stranger to a  motel room for a quick $10. It will buy enough rock cocaine to keep her high  for an hour.  </P> <P> She was arrested in the parking lot of a motel, chilled bottle of peach wine  cooler in hand, by a Southeast Division vice detail.  </P> <P> The same detail picked up Simpson last Nov. 11, three weeks before she was  killed. It was around midnight. Simpson stood at the intersection of 99th  Street and Figueroa, surrounded by a weedy vacant lot, a fenced-in auto  transmission shop and two stucco houses.  </P> <P> "You want a date?" she asked the undercover vice officer when he pulled up. To  his "yes" she replied, "Take me down the street." She wanted $10 in exchange  for a quick sex act, according to the police report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called a Standout  </P> <P> In the vice office, they remember Simpson. "She stood out," Sgt. Steve Grenier  said. "She was not the regular prostitute." She had some class and seemed to  come from a pretty good family. She smiled for her mug shot and thanked the  undercover officers who arrested her. She was going to beat her cocaine habit.  The arrest would help turn her life around.  </P> <P> "She was living in a dream world where she thought she was going to get out of  this," Grenier said.  </P> <P> Every night the sergeant sees women who haven't gotten out, women whose  drug-ravaged faces line the pages of the vice mug book. Antoinette's decline is  documented in color. She's a 22-year-old coke freak who has been arrested 10  times for prostitution. In her first booking photo, taken in 1984, her gaze is  soft and attractive. Four years later, she stares into the camera with  washed-out eyes. Her face is scarred and haggard.  </P> <P> "A lot of these girls are just like zombies," Grenier said. "The men are able  to pick them up time and time again."  </P> <P> When they're arrested, "They normally don't have any ID, or jewelry. They don't  have anything. A lot of them don't have a place to stay that night. . . .  They're just going from rock to rock."  </P> <P> The greater their appetite for cocaine, the more easily victimized they are.  </P> <P> "It seems to me, and I have no statistics, like more prostitutes are being  killed now than before," said Los Angeles Homicide Detective Pat Marshall, who  works in South-Central Los Angeles, where 41 of the 69 prostitutes slain in the  last four years were killed. "When cocaine became very, very prevalent . . .  then we started seeing more and more being injured or killed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Just Happen  </P> <P> While Booth said some of the 69 prostitute slayings are likely related, police  say the killings are often just a product of drugs, temper or a soured business  deal. A customer will demand his money back after he has had sex, a  streetwalker will try to rob the john, an argument will erupt and turn violent.  </P> <P> "These girls are at the whim of any psycho who wants to do something to them,"  observed Capt. Jim Docherty, commanding officer of the LAPD's administrative  vice section.  </P> <P> There are no official estimates of the number of prostitutes in Los Angeles.  The number of citywide prostitution arrests has more than doubled in the last  decade, from 3,644 in 1978 to 7,975 in 1988, but LAPD officials say that may  simply reflect increased police activity, rather than increased prostitution.  </P> <P> Police sweeps have greatly reduced streetwalking in Hollywood, police say,  leaving the gritty main drags of South-Central the city's streetwalking center.  Elsewhere in Los Angeles, prostitution tends to take more sophisticated,  expensive and less hazardous forms, such as escort services.  </P> <P> The Friday before Simpson was killed, she phoned her mother, Josann Davidson,  and told her, "Mama, I love you."  </P> <P> "She would not let a month go by without being in touch," recalled Davidson,  sitting in her Inglewood apartment a few feet from a large color photograph of  Renee, looking sunny and cheerful.  </P> <P> Simpson's mother and stepfather, Joe Davidson, never knew for a fact that she  was using drugs, but they had suspected it ever since she was in her early  teens. "She never did want me to see that side of her. She always hid that from  me," Davidson said. Her daughter left the Davidsons' well-kept home more than  two years ago, when they voiced their suspicions and told her they would not  tolerate drug use. She stayed with relatives, including a favorite aunt, but  they too eventually asked her to leave. Then Price's family took her in.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kept in the Dark  </P> <P> The Davidsons did not know that Simpson had been arrested for prostitution. "If  I'd known that (she was streetwalking), I would have stepped in," said Joe  Davidson. "She would have known we knew about it."  </P> <P> Simpson grew up in a solid working-class household in Compton. Her stepfather,  who had taken care of her since she was a toddler, is a master aircraft  mechanic. Her mother is a beautician. A half-brother attended college.  </P> <P> Simpson's street life, Joe Davidson said, was something "she chose. She had all  the opportunities of any young lady around."  </P> <P> She dropped out of high school in the 11th grade, later obtained an equivalency  degree and enrolled in the Job Corps. But she never managed to hold more than a  string of menial jobs. "She wanted to be better, but I don't think she was  willing to take the step to be better," Josann Davidson said.  </P> <P> "Renee was a very sensitive person. She felt rejected a lot, she felt unloved,  no matter what we did," Davidson continued. Her daughter wanted the fast life  and "I wasn't a fast-life-type person."  </P> <P> "Renee always viewed me as a strict, stern mother."  </P> <P> Detective Marshall started working homicide 13 years ago. Then, he said, a girl  "had a pimp. She hung out with other girls." If she was found dead, "We had  avenues of investigation. . . . You don't have that with a prostitute who's a  strawberry (the street name for a woman who exchanges sex for drugs). They're  not hanging out with anybody.  </P> <P> "No one knows what they're doing," he said. Detectives encounter a litany of "I  don't knows" when they question relatives.  </P> <P> Of the 69 prostitute slayings recorded since 1985, police say only 22 have been  solved. "I would not say we as investigators have a great deal of success in  solving prostitute-related murders," said Detective Paul Mize of the LAPD's  South Bureau.  </P> <P> It is not, they insist, that they are not trying. Rather, they say that in many  prostitute killings they are confronted with a dearth of leads and a surplus of  frustrations.  </P> <P> "The obvious difficulty in working these cases is nobody cares," Mize  commented. The woman's family cares, but the street community is hardly  scribbling down the license plate numbers of suspicious looking drivers. "There  are rarely any eyewitnesses, and if there are, they make themselves invisible."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Computerized Data  </P> <P> The Police Department did not computerize homicide records until 1985, and  officials say they thus have no way of knowing whether prostitute-related  slayings are on the rise.  </P> <P> Lt. John Zorn, a member of the "Southside Slayer" task force formed a number of  years ago, when it appeared that a serial killer was preying on Southside  prostitutes, says he doesn't think there has been an increase in the killing of  street women. But he concedes, "The situation has not changed a great deal over  the period of time (since the task force was formed). The problem still exists  that there are murders of these women."  </P> <P> The task force compiled a list of 17 women, most of them prostitutes, strangled  or stabbed on the Southside between 1983 and 1986. Then "we established there  was not a serial killer, that we were looking for a number of suspects," and  they stopped keeping a list.  </P> <P> Arrests were made in four of the 17 cases. There was one conviction, an Alabama  prisoner is accused of killing one woman, and Louis Craine, an unemployed  construction worker, is going on trial this month in the strangulation murders  of five Southside prostitutes between 1984 and 1987, including two on the  Southside Slayer list.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shooting Deaths  </P> <P> Last month reports surfaced that Los Angeles police were investigating another  possible serial killer who may have shot as many as 12 Southside prostitutes  during the last three years. Police have refused to comment, but they recently  arrested Rickey Ross, a veteran sheriff's deputy, on charges that he fatally  shot three prostitutes late last year and dumped their bodies in South Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Still, Zorn said, "I don't have evidence to indicate there are a large number  of serial killers preying on prostitutes."  </P> <P> Renee Simpson was strangled and left in the dirt at a freeway construction site  that has obliterated part of the graffiti-smeared neighborhood where she last  lived and bought drugs. Toxicological tests revealed there was cocaine in her  blood when she was killed. No arrests have been made in her case.  </P> <P> On the back of the program for her Dec. 5 funeral service is a tribute from her  aunt La Verne: "Renee, you have gone home to rest and you have no more worries.  . . . Your sweet smile, your dancing eyes, I will miss, and my beloved niece,  Renee, I will always love you."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Following the untimely death in Rwanda yesterday  of President Cyprien Ntaryamira and of two of his ministers, the  speaker of the National Assembly, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, has  addressed a peace message to the Burundian nation. What were  the contents of his message, (Christophe Burunziza)?    [(Burunziza)] As we reported to you last night, the speaker  of the National Assembly began his message by stating that the  Burundian people had once again been hit by tragedy. Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya went on to say that the president of the Republic  yesterday went to the Republic of Tanzania in order to meet his  counterparts in the subregion.    On his way back to Bujumbura, President Ntaryamira traveled  in the same aircraft as Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana.  The tragic deaths occurred as the presidential aircraft was  landing at Kanombe International Airport, Kigali. All the  passengers, the speaker of the National Assembly continued, were  killed. [passage omitted]    The speaker of the National Assembly once again called on  the  Burundian people and friends of Burundi to remain calm and keep  their courage up in spite of these present unfortunate, trying  times. This was necessary, Ntibantunganya continued, because  the Burundian parliament and government were continuing to  perform the functions vested in them. The speaker of the  National Assembly urged the whole population to safeguard  security. He called on all Burundians to transcend the current  situation so that we could together all look for the true path,  which would open new horizons for us, especially in seeking to  strengthen peace and security, so that the government and  parliament could jointly look for a way out of the present  crisis for Burundi.    That is why, the speaker of the National Assembly added, a  committee in charge of examining the development of the current  situation was set up yesterday to allow all Burundians, without  exception, regain peace and security. The committee is composed  of the following officials: National Assembly Speaker Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya; Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko; Defense  Minister Gedeon Fyiroko; (Corneille Buzigye), the chairman of  the Front for Democracy in Burundi parliamentary group; (Vames  Vantsuhye), coadministrator general of documentation; and  Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu, the Army Chief of Staff.

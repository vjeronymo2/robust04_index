			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The day after - Ballot Box Neil Kinnock's 'green' credentials may come under early strain if he wins the election. The Labour leader is down to appear in a United Nations rally at Westminster Central Hall on April 10 in support of the Earth Summit in Rio. A victorious Kinnock might have more pressing engagements on his hands. One of his fellow speakers is scheduled to be Paddy Ashdown, who may also be otherwise engaged - bargaining with Kinnock perhaps. Michael Heseltine is billed to appear as well, but, unlike the others, he is described as 'invited but yet to confirm'. Does this mean that the environment secretary is more confident about the election outcome than the others - or less?</p>

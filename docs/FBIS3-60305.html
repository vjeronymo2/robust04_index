			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatol Darafeyew, chairman of the Belarus </F> Republic State Committee on Ecology, by Valeryy Charnyawski:  "`Today No One Has the Right To Profit at the Expense of Others  and Poison the Environment Expense.' Chairman of the Belarus  Republic State Committee on Ecology States His Views on  Environmental Problems"; date and place not given]    [Text] We are not living well today, and we are  treating the environment even worse. We note, moreover, that  almost everybody sincerely blames everybody else for the  crisis--while presuming, of course, to be the forests' and  rivers' best friend and protector.    One suspects, however, that the long suffering  environment might wish to submit some bills to many decent  citizens. In this regard, we have a question for the republic's  chief ecologist:    Charnyawski: Anatol Maksimavich, excuse my  bluntness, but in matters of ecology we are barbarians and  ignoramuses. You know more examples than I. Here is one: last  year in Pukhavitski Rayon, during a hot dry spell, some  blackened firemen were putting out a fire in a peat bog, while  literally a kilometer away from there some healthy youngsters  were arrogantly "having some fun" with a routine bonfire. Common  logic protests against such barbarism; admonishment is not  enough, punishment is needed!    Darafeyew: I don't need to argue something that is  so obvious; in past years not enough was done to protect the  environment and create a healthy habitat for human beings. I  will emphasize that conditions today are even worse and, in many  cases, simply critical.    People's treatment of the environment? Your Pukhavitski  example is just one small typical event. Almost 99 percent of  fires, including forest fires, are due to individuals who  destroy the environment and yet consider themselves decent  citizens. Recent events all over the CIS have shown the barbaric  depths people can sink to in relations with one another, so why  not take out their wrath on the environment, which cannot answer  back?!    Politics, the ideology of confrontation, the ruined economy,  and skyrocketing prices are also factors. Food is such a problem  that poachers of all stripes have launched, so to speak, a  "massive assault" on the forests, rivers, and lakes. And if  state and civic organizations responsible for the protection of  wildlife and fish resources don't take appropriate measures, in  two or three years we won't have any forests or wildlife, and  the only rabbit we'll see is on banknotes....    Charnyawski: And then the very existence of  homo sapiens will be in question....    Darafeyew: I say that in order to prevent this  frightful occurrence we need to exert massive influence on the  people's consciousness and enhance human reason--naturally,  along with new laws and state measures designed to impose more  liability for damaging the environment.    By the way, for the most active segment of society new  environmental laws have done practically everything needed to  make them feel like they really are the masters in this matter.  For the first time in our history, ordinary citizens and  individuals have the right to demand and receive detailed  information from state organizations and officials. They have  the right to propose bans on the construction of ecologically  hazardous facilities, and to institute suit in court to recover  damages done to their health or property as a result of  violations of environmental laws.    Charnyawski: But so far, what you call the "active  segment" is decidedly in the minority. I am not a pessimist, but  I regret to say that our "ecological barbarians," whose name is  legion, couldn't care less about these new rights of theirs. All  they care about is the "right" to plunder nature and damage it.  That's why enterprise directors (who are all "men of the  people") largely behave that way, and their ability to "conquer"  nature has grown a hundredfold. Let's recall, incidently, the  relatively recent amounts of fines levied, which are ridiculous:  10 rubles for an individual, 100 rubles for an executive. And  how are we to "pressure" the numerous violators now, if nobody  fears God, the Devil, or the law?    Darafeyew: Never mind; everybody looks after his  own pocket. Fines today are not what they were once, neither is  the principle of exacting them. In connection with the passing  of the Law "On Protection of the Environment," the question of  economic regulation of the exploitation of natural resources and  environmental protection has taken a brand new turn--the  economic mechanism has come into play. A harsher system of  fines, court actions, and penalties for dumping harmful wastes  in the environment has been created, applicable both to  enterprises and to individuals.    Penalties now are more than a slap on the wrist. The  starting  point is the minimum salary, followed by higher rates. If our  agencies or, for example, the foresters of the Ministry of  Forestry, gets their hands on somebody, it is going to go very  hard on them.    What's sad is that we have long had a working example right  next door in Europe, and other places besides. In our country,  as you know, we spent decades indulging in ideological  self-glorification, saying that the capitalists were rapaciously  plundering the environment; we never wrote that they were  protecting it.    To be sure, we also have started to fight the despoilers of  nature, but only since the "new era," I'd say. I'm referring to  a case in the late spring of 1990 in which, due to the criminal  negligence of an operator in the Navapolatski Palimir  Association, 90 tonnes of acetone cyanohydrin--a powerful  poison--were dumped into the Western Dvina. The chief engineer  was fired, while the operator wound up in court. So that one way  or another we do have some experience "putting scoundrels in  their place."    Charnyawski: Anatol Maksimavich, I notice you have  mentioned the new "Law on Environmental Protection" several  times. For good reason, I think. I propose, therefore, having  commented on the deplorable state of society today and the fact  that under such conditions environmental protection cannot be  much better, you give some thought to what that protection ought  to be in fact and how everything new is to be instilled in human  consciousness and actual practice. There is plenty of doubt, and  all of it real.    One article in the Law states that enterprises are to  provide  your committee with information about accidents, emissions, and  other negative phenomena--and all "free of charge!" As if I  would work against myself if I were the director! If I did that,  where would I wind up in a day or two?!    Darafeyew: A businessman's personal ambitions are  one thing, the interests of the state are quite another. What is  at issue here is the overall monitoring of the environment. The  republic is creating an ecology monitoring system which will be  implemented by the State Committee on Ecology and other agencies  empowered to do so. Like it or not, anyone involved in the  production process is obliged by law to submit detailed  information in order to create a general ecology information  bank.    Are you saying people will cheat? That's quite possible. In  addition to departmental control our own control will be on hand  in the enterprises; organs of the State Committee on Ecology  keep track of production conditions using their own instruments,  and discrepancies show up quite often. Let me remind would-be  conspirators that they will be liable--perhaps even criminally  liable--for submitting false information or failing to submit  information.    You have said that the departmental control service often  takes violators under its wing to protect them from liability.  We know that, and that's why our relations with them are  critical. Because our State Committee is now a  supra-departmental body, we have the right to check up on  everybody, on any ministry or department. If we find any  cheating, it will be punished. Let everyone keep in mind that  users of natural resources themselves bear responsibility for  improper use of resources and treatment of the environment. This  is only civilized and fair; the principle is stipulated by the  laws of all developed countries.    The trouble is that we are in the clutches of the "wild"  market and the economic crisis. In such conditions, I agree,  implementing the new legislation is going to be painful to  production collectives.    Charnyawski: Let me get back to the mentality of  business executives, because some of them are really in a fix.  Just how, if you please, can a man tell the world that  everything in his plant is leaking and smoking, the plumbing is  shot, yet production has been met? What if the enterprise has to  be closed as a polluter? What then, thousands of people on the  sidewalk out of work?    On the other hand, there are lots of monopoly plants whose  collectives are coddled too much. All the profits and  considerable state subsidies are plowed into wages, and nobody  thinks about the ecology or perfecting the technology. Overall,  there is a slide into truly savage capitalism and rapacious  exploitation of resources.    Darafeyew: There's real food for thought. There  are many enterprises where salaries are high and they are  spending hard currency for--excuse the expression--glad rags and  Toyotas in the West, but as for investing to improve the  ecological situation, no way. The new law proposes a new  approach: make them pay big for improper use of resources.  Unhappy with the big payments? Then fix your technology. That's  it.    Remember that under the command economy, enormous  investments  were made in new technologies, but hardly anybody thought about  technological progress, and ecological spending was nowhere. The  economic policy of the Law "On Protection of the Environment"  will definitely change this mentality. No one will be allowed  anymore to profit at the expense of others and poison the  environment while not investing a ruble to renovate it.    Consider this fact, which has not had much play here in  Belarus. At the conference on environmental problems and  development, which was held in Brazil under the auspices of the  UN, the whole world proclaimed the priority of the ecology. We  do, after all, live in a civilized world. But if we don't  civilize ourselves on the plane of ecology, we will remain  isolated "savages"--and it will be reflected both in our  standard of living and in relations toward us.    When it comes to our aging industries, how can we shut them  all down? There's just one way--by using economic levers and  ecology laws, to pressure their collectives so that they will at  least start to gradually change their technologies. Consider the  West: do you think they've closed all the heating and power  facilities that run on coal? They could have, because the cost  of smoke scrubbing technologies comes to about 70 percent of the  cost of the enterprises. What they did was redesign them the way  they should be.    Charnyawski: With a bit of fantasy we might  imagine that in time we might make industrial and other  enterprises act "polite." But what about having the military pay  for the damage done to the environment and human health? Anybody  who knows those unapproachable and unassailable gods the  generals will probably never believe it. In Hungary, Poland, and  the Czech Republic, claims are literally pouring in against  former Soviet military installations for environmental damages.  But in our case.... If anybody is going to pay a fine, it will  come from the budget, which means from the taxpayer's pockets.  Isn't that right?    Darafeyew: You're mistaken there. Times are  different now, the old taboos are gone that used to keep people  outside the gates of the military. As far back as two years ago,  there were cases in which military units were severely punished  for damages to the environment and ecological accidents.    We now have operating a special group to service military  facilities and grant them ecological certification. Now,  military commanders are ranked the same as civilian  executives--the same approach applies to all: if you do damage  you can just pay the penalty. You refuse? There are  environmental and military procuracies to take care of that.    To be sure, they do keep a "cut" for themselves, for their  military cost--and it all comes from the state budget. Now,  however, commanders also bear individual responsibility for  ecological violations. In the new amended Administrative Code  (as amendments to the law), all this will be stipulated  legislatively. Relations between the State Committee and the  Defense Ministry are generally good, and whenever some commander  violates ecological regulations--maliciously--we can complain  about him to the ministry, and the next time you look he'll have  one less star on his epaulet.    Charnyawski: Once everything is on a civilized  footing, in the future, society will be able to boast that the  "military impact" on the ecology has been reduced to a minimum.  But who will protect us from depredations against the  environment by the local Soviets which have been given such  expanded powers by this legislation?    I believe that many local leaders are ecologically ignorant.  They might, for example, put up a hazardous asphalt plant in a  summer residential area or commit some other unpardonable  stupidity for hard currency. Do you know, Anatol Maksimavich,  where rayon bosses sometimes put monies from the ecology tax and  non-budget environmental funds?    Darafeyew: Now I agree with you there. Officials  of rayons where there are big industrial polluters will do  anything to see to it that the latters' fees for the use of  resources go into their own coffers and stay there. What the  other rayons get is the pollution plume. In such cases, no funds  remain to form ecology programs in the oblasts and the republic.    But such rayon bosses, even when they do get the money, are  not overly concerned with creating any "ecological paradise" in  their area. Their aspirations are much more primitive--first, of  course, to make a lot of money along with their apparatus; next,  to acquire various prestigious "toys." In other words, they act  on the principle "After us the deluge; who cares about the  ecology?"    To a certain extent, of course, the local Soviets have to be  independent, but they are also supposed to comply with general  laws. The alternative is legal nihilism and anything-goes, with  all the consequences. The Supreme Soviet should guarantee  compliance, along with our State Committee within the limits  stimulated by the Law.    I say that because there is a dangerous tendency to bring  hazardous and polluting technologies into our country from the  West. Consider this: someone has even proposed bringing  contaminated soil into Belarus for processing, for which they  would pay us in hard currency. As if we didn't have enough  contaminated land after Chernobyl!    Again, one German firm proposed that Belarus buy (!)  briquettes made from the sludge of treatment plants for use  as... fertilizer. They don't rate us very highly in the West if  they're trying to foist things off on us that even poor Africans  would refuse. But we have to remember that we have plenty of  local-yokel anti-ecologists who would make a deal like that for  dollars or marks. Naturally, agencies of the State Committee are  standing guard over the state's interests, but how can you keep  track of every wheeler-dealer in the market? Remember, then,  that whenever such a scheme is uncovered, its perpetrators will  be severely punished.    Charnyawski: And so, Anatol Maksimavich, we come  to where we started from: We have to have penalties, especially  in such a neglected sector as the ecology. It is clear that our  society is not yet prepared, either spiritually or mentally, to  pass the needed ecological legislation. Will we ever overcome  this block in the general consciousness?    Darafeyew: I'm not inclined to be a rosy optimist  either by position or experience. And I won't predict that we  are soon going to have English-style gardens and lawns  everywhere and that the air will become crystal clear. Our  optimism must be pointed toward the realization that through  concerted efforts we can survive and not slide into ecological  catastrophe. That is our chief problem of survival as a nation.  All it takes is for each one of us, to some extent, to be the  patriotic master of our land and a wise human being.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hindustan Lever bid for Tomco cleared The Indian Supreme Court has cleared the way for Hindustan Lever, the Indian affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine, to acquire Tata Oil Mills Company (Tomco), a soaps and detergents manufacturer which is part of Tata, India's largest industrial grouping. The court rejected five petitions asking for special leave to challenge the merger. The main petitioner, Hindustan Lever Employees' Union, had taken the case to the Supreme Court after the Bombay High Court dismissed its plea to block the merger in May. Employees' unions of both companies challenged the merger after workers feared they would lose their jobs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Exceprt] Bujumbura, 17 Jun (AFP) -- A French soldier was  shot dead overnight by a guard on duty in front of the former  royal palace here, Burundian military sources said Friday [17  June]. The death of the unidentified non-commissioned officer,  who was killed overnight Thursday, was confirmed Friday by the  French defence attache's office here. The office said a probe  had been opened. It refused to give details of the shooting but  stressed it had been "neither a political nor an anti-French  act."    The Burundian sources said the soldier was a training  advisor  for the Burundian presidential guard and had been killed after  failing to heed warnings from guards as he headed toward the  palace in a drunken state.

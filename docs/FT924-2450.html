			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Women's retirement age of 65 backed SOCIAL SECURITY ministers are backing an increase in the state retirement age for women from 60 to 65, with the savings being used to help cushion the impact for some groups, as their preferred way of equalising pension ages. After a 12-month consultation ends this month, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is expected to announce next year his proposals for conforming male and female retirement ages. The Treasury has put strong pressure on Mr Lilley to increase the female retirement age. Before consultations began, the Treasury wanted a retirement age of 67 included as an option, it emerged this week. The state retirement age for men is already 65. A decision will be taken after further discussions with the Treasury and in cabinet. Lowering the male retirement age to 60 has been all but ruled out and a compromise of 63 is receding as a possibility. A flexible decade of retirement has been rejected as unworkable. Making many women work for five years longer will be politically unpopular but the impact will be softened by phasing in the changes over at least 10 years, possibly longer. Mr Lilley hopes that the estimated Pounds 3bn annual savings would not all return to the Treasury but be used to help particular groups. In August the Social Security Advisory Committee, which advises the government on pensions policy, said savings from the increase to 65 could be used to help pensioners whose working lives were badly paid and interrupted. Most would be women. Other options would be to allow earlier retirement on lower pensions or to offer better pensions for those who are dependent only on the state. No consensus emerged from the 4,000 responses received from companies, pension experts and representative organisations during the government's consultation. Social security ministers believe the increase can be justified also because people are living longer and increasingly likely to have an occupational or personal pension. They wish to focus resources more closely on those most in need. The move to equalise retirement ages follows a European Court ruling outlawing different pension benefits.</p>

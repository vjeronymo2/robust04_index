			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ihor Nedyukha, candidate of technological </F> sciences: "Once Again About the "Shield" and "Sword"]    [Text] According to the press, the Ukrainian Nationalist  Assembly [UNA] has sent the chairman of Ukraine's Security  Service, Ye. Marchuk, a statement (the text was supplied),  containing a request to evaluate President L. Kravchuk's  activity during the negotiations with the presidents of the  United States and Russia on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. This  statement, in fact, accuses the Ukrainian president of  violations of the law to the extent of high treason.    However, the impression arises that the UNA leadership had  not read Marchuk in HOLOS UKRAYINY 12 December 1992 where he  insisted on the expediency of Ukraine's staying under the  "nuclear shield of Russia," in other words, on the current  policy of the total nuclear disarmament of Ukraine.    For that reason, I find it inappropriate to demand that  Marchuk does the evaluation. This conclusion not only applies  to the UNA appeal, but also to the analogous statement by the  Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party [UKRP].    The validity of the above interpretation is confirmed, at  least, by the fact that the transfer to Russia of the "Sword" --  the tactical nuclear weapons -- is known to have been completed  on the night of 5 and 6 May 1992.    It remains to be hoped that opponents of the Ukrainian  president in the ranks of the UNA and UKRP will also agree that  the same people must be among those who have planned and those  who are implementing the measures for withdrawing the entire  "Sword" and "Shield" (strategic nuclear weapons) complex from  Ukraine.</p>

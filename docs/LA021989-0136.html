			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILIAR PARIS  </P> <P> Always saving the Travel Section for last, what an extra treat to see the  wonderful picture of Paris (Jerry Hulse, Feb. 5). I noticed that he took the  beautiful photograph of the Seine and Notre Dame from Pont de la Tournelle. At  that exact location I was married aboard a 60-foot cruise boat with Notre Dame  as a background. We lived in Paris two years.  </P> <P> STEVE LEONARD  </P> <P> South Laguna  </P></p>

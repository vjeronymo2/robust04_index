			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, February 17 (XINHUA) -- British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd said today that the prospect of air  strikes on Bosnian Serb position around Sarajevo is now more  remote thanks to Russia, according to a BBC TV report.    It is reported here that Russia has decided to send troops  to  Sarajevo to help enforce a ceasefire and persuade the Serbs to  withdraw heavy weapons by next Monday [21 February], as demanded  under a U.N. ultimatum backed by NATO.    Hurd said the Russian move fitted "admirably" with the NATO  initiative.    "If this works on the ground, there is now a much better  chance than before of avoiding air strikes," he added.    But he warned that the air strikes would go ahead if the  U.N.  conditions were not met.    Meanwhile, the U.N. confirmed today that the Bosnian Serbs  have started a major withdrawal of heavy guns around Sarajevo,  press reports said here.    U.N. Bosnia Commander Lt-Gen. Sir Michael Rose is reported  to  have said that he was confident that the U.N. ultimatum would be  observed.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic announced that the  siege  of Sarajevo was "over."    "We do think that war in Sarajevo is finally over," he said  after talks with Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin.    As part of the Moscow plan, 400 Russian soldiers would be  moved to the Bosnian capital from Croatia.    And another significant contingent would be deployed once  Russia has settled "legal requirement."    But Bosnian Government Vice-President Ejup Ganic rejected  the  deployment of Russian U.N. troops to control Bosnian Serb heavy  weapons.    He held that Russia is not neutral in the case of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and it didn't go along with the NATO peace  process.    "We are certainly not welcoming Russians to guard Serbian  weapons," and "we would rather let them keep our weapons than  Serb weapons," he said.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Barclays charges move - At a glance Barclays is to give personal customers advance notice of charges on their bank accounts, although no date has yet been set for the process to start. This gives customers time to query charges before they are imposed, and helps stop people going unintentionally overdrawn because of charges. Barclays has been pre-notifying business customers for some time. Some other high street banks, including NatWest, already give their customers advance warning of charges, and it is likely to become a requirement under a new banking code of practice. Lloyds recently announced it would introduce the practice.</p>

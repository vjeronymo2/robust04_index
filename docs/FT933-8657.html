			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Rover plans big expansion in making engines ROVER, the UK carmaker, is planning an ambitious expansion of its engine programme during the mid 1990s including the production of a new top-of-the-range V6 engine. The new engines, which will also feature the introduction of a 1.6 litre version of its successful 1.1 litre and 1.4 litre K Series engines, will allow Rover to reduce significantly its dependence on Honda, the Japanese carmaker. Rover is developing the V6 engine from its present K Series family of power units and is expected to launch the new engine in its 800 series executive car range in 1995. It would replace the present 2.7 litre V6 Honda engine, which the Japanese carmaker now makes only for Rover, and would represent a considerable cost-saving for Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace. The K Series engine, launched in 1989, is now made in four-cylinder 1.1 litre and 1.4 litre versions to power the Rover Metro and some versions of the Rover 200/400 series cars, while the UK carmaker also buys a more powerful 1.6 litre engine from Honda for the Rover 200/400. The new 1.6 litre engine for the K Series will be introduced next year in the Rover 200 to replace the Honda power unit produced at the Japanese carmaker's plant in Swindon. Rover's engine production is based at its Longbridge, Birmingham plant. At present Rover buys all of its 2.0 litre and 2.3 litre engines for the Rover 600 from Honda. The Japanese carmaker holds a 20 per cent equity stake in Rover vehicle operations, and the Rover 200/400, 600 and 800 series are based on Honda technology. Rover has entered discussions with Kia Motors, the South Korean carmaker, which is considering producing a version of the Rover V6 engine in Korea to power an executive car it is developing for launch in the second half of the 1990s. Kia is also discussing the engine project with other carmakers in Japan and Europe. Weekend, Page X</p>

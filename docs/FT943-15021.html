			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Shy lenders on the high street - A bar to corporate borrowing from building societies is being removed When Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society bought Girobank in 1990, it was not allowed to take over the bank's commercial lending portfolio. To have done so would have contravened the 1986 Building Society Act. In retrospect, Alliance &amp; Leicester might be grateful that it was spared the dreadful losses many commercial banks suffered in the recession from lending to smaller companies. But government plans announced last week mean that, subject to members' approval, building societies will be able to expand dramatically their lending to corporate customers. According to Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, this will provide a welcome new source of funds for business and 'introduce a new element of competition into an area traditionally dominated by a small number of high street banks'. Are building societies likely to want to compete with high street banks and would this move be welcomed by borrowers? Under the 1986 act, the societies have been able to lend if their loans are secured on assets such as pubs, hotels, nursing homes and factories. 'Some regret doing it,' says Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association. They will now in theory also be allowed to lend against any type of asset, or even unsecured. The BSA has given this part of the government's proposed changes a lukewarm reception. But they welcome the changes at the smallest end of the market. In the past, societies lending to sole traders had to stop lending if they incorporated. 'We did not see why we had to withdraw because the sole trader incorporated,' says Coles. The reaction from small-business lobby groups has also been less than universally enthusiastic. They welcome any move that increases sources of lending because that would tend to bring down the cost of borrowing. But they would not want a return to the experience of the past five years when, they say, over-zealous lending has been followed by a cooling of banks' enthusiasm. The plan to increase competition is most likely to be thwarted, however, by the building societies' own reluctance. The most compelling example of that disinclination can be found at Abbey National, which shed its building society status in 1989 when it became a publicly quoted bank. Since then Abbey National has made no move into commercial banking and says it has no intention of straying beyond its personal finance market. The societies are fully aware of how badly the banks were damaged by the recession. Their losses are well recorded. But the societies are just as scared of the bad publicity that banks received after cutting overdraft lines and calling in receivers. 'Most societies will be very wary and approach commercial lending tentatively,' says Coles. 'They will see what the banks lost in the early 1990s and what happened to the banks' PR.' Chris Smith, analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, also doubts that societies will now rush into commercial lending. Small and medium-sized corporations are repaying more than they are borrowing at the moment, meaning the societies would be chasing a share of a shrinking market. If the societies moved quickly into commercial lending they would risk picking up only those accounts the banks were happy to lose. Longer term, however, Smith believes building societies might consider taking on the main lending banks, but only if there were first significant mergers of societies and if returns from lucrative mortgage lending showed signs of a long-term decline. For the time being, it seems, companies seeking loans will be making appointments with high street bank managers and not their counterparts next door in the building society.</p>

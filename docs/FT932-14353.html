			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Russian banker pours scorn on credit curb: Russia - Referendum THE chairman of Russia's Central Bank has described the agreement between the government and the bank on limiting credit expansion as meaningless, and predicted it will be broken. The agreement has been represented in meetings between the Russian government and leaders and officials of the Group of Seven industrialised countries as evidence of increasing control over the bank. The government has accused the bank of fuelling inflation and undermining reforms by issuing large credits to state enterprises. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the bank chairman, confirmed at the weekend he had agreed with Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister in charge of economics and finance, that credit expansion in the second quarter be limited to an additional Rbs2,800bn-Rbs3,000bn, a 30 per cent rise. But Mr Gerashchenko - who has clashed with Mr Fyodorov since the latter demanded his sacking - said the agreement was 'really a trap' for Mr Fyodorov because he would not be able to keep government spending within these limits. 'We at the bank reckon that the budget deficit in the second quarter of this year will stand at about Rbs2,500bn. So he will need to ask us for more credits, I would think, by the middle of May.' The position of Mr Fyodorov, the cabinet minister most closely identified with economic reform since the forced resignation last December of Mr Yegor Gaidar, former acting prime minister, may also be undermined by the appointment at the end of last week of Mr Oleg Lobov as a first deputy prime minister with a brief to take charge of the economy. Mr Lobov's rank puts him above Mr Fyodorov.</p>

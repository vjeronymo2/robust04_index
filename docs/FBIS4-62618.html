			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Russia wants to pay only 40  per cent of its foreign debt payable in 1994 and hopes the Paris  Club of creditors would accept the proposals at talks in the  second half of June, according to Deputy Prime Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin who told a press conference on Tuesday that  such a position is called by the existing financial  possibilities of the country.    Shokhin, who is the main foreign debt negotiator, said the  federal budget envisages only a little over four billion dollars  to cover all external debts while Russia owes the Paris Club one  billion dollars of interest only for the first quarter of this  year. The total Russian debt amounts to 80 billion dollars.    Shokhin said that if Russia is made to cover the whole debt  payable in 1994 this would mean curtailing of other budget  appropriations or higher inflation. "We hope that the Western  partners will understand that if Russia fulfils its foreign debt  commitments in full volume, this would inevitably result in  surpassing the budget-fixed amount for servicing the foreign  debt which means either curtailing other appropriations or  spiraling up inflation", he stressed.    Shokhin recalled that the Paris Club had twice met the  requests of the Russian Government taking into consideration the  difficult reforms in the country. The creditors had first  agreed to freeze for 15 years the payment of 15 billion dollars  of the Russian debt and then rescheduled the payment of last  year interest for the first four months of 1994.    Russia is currently preparing concrete proposals to the  Paris  Club which will be submitted before the G-7 summit in Naples,  according to Shokhin.</p>

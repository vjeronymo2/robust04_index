			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Revisions expected to bring down cost - VAT on company cars Substantial changes to the company car market, with all leased and many purchased company cars expected to be made cheaper for employers and potentially more attractive for employees, will be brought about by VAT treatment revisions announced by the chancellor. The revisions will for the first time allow the leasing companies, which provide about 800,000 of the 2.4m company cars currently on the UK's roads, to reclaim the 17.5 per cent VAT on their car purchases. This should allow the leasing industry to pass on to its clients significant cuts in rental costs. The measure, which will take effect from next August, will cost the exchequer Pounds 140m in the first year and Pounds 100m in 1996-97. The revisions will also allow companies buying their cars, as Mr Clarke put it yesterday, 'wholly for business use' to reclaim the VAT on their purchases. It was uncertain last night what criteria would be used in deciding whether a car had been acquired 'wholly' for business. All company-leased or company-purchased cars are expected to qualify. However, it was understood in the industry that where purchased cars were partly for private use, a proportion of the VAT would be non-reclaimable, depending on the percentage of the car user's mileage for non-business purposes. In the case of leased cars where private use is involved, only 50 per cent of the VAT on the leasing company's charges will be reclaimable. One of the most significant effects of the changes will be to eliminate a VAT 'double whammy' hitherto suffered by banks, building societies and other financial institutions unable to reclaim VAT which has effectively kept them out of the leased car market entirely. 'Having to pay VAT, through the rental charge, once on the purchase price of a leased car and again on the rental company's charges has effectively debarred the financial sector from the leasing market,' Mr Neil Pykett, managing director of Cowie Interleasing and chairman of the accounting and taxation committee of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, said last night. 'Today's changes go a long way to remedying a situation which has rankled with the industry for years.' According to tentative industry estimates last night, there could be a cash saving to a company leasing a Pounds 12,000 car wholly for business use of about Pounds 1,100 over a three-year lease period. From employees' point of view, the revisions can be expected to discourage some company car users from opting for cash alternatives to cars. This is because, in cases where the cost of their provision to employers falls, so may the value of the cash alternative offered by employers. Alternatively, any savings could take the form of the offer of a better car. Mr Clarke said yesterday that the main aim of the revisions was to iron out a 'distortion' in the new car market which has arisen since 1992 when taxi, short-term car rental companies and driving schools were allowed to reclaim VAT on their vehicles. However, the issue of whether businesses should be able to reclaim all VAT on company cars as a matter of course has become controversial.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: EC closer to accord on capital adequacy THE EUROPEAN Community deadlock on common capital adequacy standards for EC securities firms could be loosened this week following agreement in Geneva last week on international capital rules. European Commission officials will this week try to engineer a deal between feuding EC member states on the draft capital adequacy directive. One described the international agreement as 'pretty helpful' to the EC negotiations, which aim to establish a parallel capital adequacy regime. The Commission is expected to produce a new compromise text today, for discussion by national representatives tomorrow and Wednesday. Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, who heads the Commission directorate responsible for financial institutions, was an observer in Geneva and may report to the Brussels meeting on the outcome. EC discussion about the capital adequacy directive has been characterised by disputes between countries such as Spain and Germany - which want to apply tight bank-style rules to securities firms - and others, notably Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands, which want to preserve the distinction between the regulation of banks and brokers. Banking and securities regulators were split along roughly the same lines, but the Geneva meeting appears to have narrowed the gap. They have, for example, reached general agreement on the ratio of subordinated debt to other capital which can be counted for regulatory purposes. Commission officials believe some EC members will consider the 2.5:1 compromise too loose. The new EC text differs in some unspecified details from last week's international compromise, which will still be the subject of long negotiations between bank and securities regulators. But the broad rapprochement between regulators may persuade bickering EC governments that it is worth forging a parallel deal which could be fed into the renewed international debate later this year.</p>

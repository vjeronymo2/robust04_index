			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Increase at Cummins underlines turnround CUMMINS Engine, the world's largest independent manufacturer of diesel engines, yesterday announced a big increase in first-quarter earnings and forecast the second quarter would be even better. The figures underscore the turnround at the company, which suffered severely when the US truck market was hit by the 1991 recession. It reported net earnings of Dollars 41.1m, or Dollars 2.24 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.05bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 5m, or 20 cents, on sales of Dollars 881.3m in the same period of last year, excluding accounting changes. The figures were better than the Dollars 2-a-share earnings forecast at the start of this month by the company at its annual meeting. Cummings said it expected that 'second-quarter sales and earnings will exceed those of the first quarter, assuming economic conditions do not deteriorate.' It said its mid-range engine sales continued to grow as the company finished its third quarter of shipments to Ford Motor for its medium truck range. Bus and light commercial vehicle business improved significantly, mainly due to demand for the Dodge Ram pick-up, which is powered by Cummins' B series engine. There was also a substantial increase in engine shipments to North American heavy truck market. Results were also helped by the company's drive to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. Sales in certain international markets, particularly the UK, remained depressed, however.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Sidorov under the "Frank Talk" rubric: </F> "Where Does Our Strength Lie? Reflections on the Results of the  Agrarian Party of Russia Central Council's Latest Plenum"]    [Text] The most pressing question at the plenum was the  cadre question. Yes, the elections to the State Duma were a  success, as were the elections to the local organs of  self-government. But everyone understands perfectly that  success, like lightning, never strikes in the same place twice.  Thus Mikhail Lapshin, chairman of the Agrarian Party of Russia  [APR], stated bluntly that without mass support the party would  not get far. The time for rejoicing is over; it is time to get  down to the routine donkeywork of creating primary party  organizations. And the APR, alas, so far does not have a great  number of them. In 20 of the 88 federation components the party  has not yet been registered at all.    "Work -- there is heaps of it. But what is the mood like?"    "We need the Ministry of Agriculture structures to help us  to  create primary party organizations. Let there be a vertical  chain of command, so that the chiefs of rayon agricultural  administrations join the APR themselves and give orders to their  subordinates..."    "It is very difficult to act on a voluntary basis. We need  full-time organizers, funding...    It is very difficult to work in this area. In nine years  many rural leaders of subdepartments and farms have been  infected with greed. Without them it is difficult to create  primary organizations on the spot."    I deliberately do not give the names of these people who  proved themselves so helpless in the most important party task  -- organization. This weakness is nowadays characteristic of  all Russian parties. And the one which manages to cast aside  ambitions and reliance on instructions from above the most  quickly will win at the next elections and will continue to win  thereafter. It is no accident that Aleksandr Zaveryukha, member  of the APR Central Council, having heard his fill of the  "valuable" conclusions cited above, said bluntly and angrily:  "Our strength lies within ourselves."    You could not put it more accurately. One after another the  Central Council members ascend the rostrum and say:    "An agrarian party without its own press organ is  unthinkable. All its decisions, decrees, and ideas fail to reach  rnak-and-file members. We must have our own news organ and seek  links with the agrarian press."    As if this press is hiding from the agrarians. During the  recess I tried to find out by degrees which Central Council  member subscribes to which agrarian newspaper. I did not manage  to find out. However much I searched while on assignments on  the bare notice boards of agro-industrial complex trade union  committees and rayon agricultural administrations and in offices  -- I have nowhere seen an agrarian newspaper. The agrarian  press is nowhere to be seen either in villages or in rayon  centers, let alone oblast cities. So what is the sense in  newspapers publishing information about the work of the APR, if  no members of the party subscribe to them or read them?! Of  course, the distribution of a newspaper once again requires  effort and the loss of free time, and, when it comes down to it,  money. But after all, there is no other way.    Party members, for example, must engage in propaganda. Like,  shall we say, explaining to rural laborers the essence of the  law on bankruptcy. At the plenum this law was rubbished by all  but those who could not be bothered. But in his speech Vice  Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha objected:    "We should know this law; after all, it says that a farm  which declares itself bankrupt is to be given financial  injections for two years in order for it to try to get back on  its feet. Then it is given the right to voluntary flotation,  and much else. It would be no bad thing for some farms to seize  upon this law, rather than damn it...."    Boris Chernov from Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, speaking of the  experience of land redistribution in his area, defined its  results as a hopeless failure. But he said:    "To survive, we must work creatively."    But how can you work creatively, if many people do not read  even the laws?! Of course, to reject them is far more simple.  Yes, the reforms are punishingly difficult, but it is hight  time to release that not everything in them is without rhyme or  reason. Experienced rayon agricultural production leaders say  that the time has come to study every farm individually, and if  necessary, break them up into smaller units. Formerly it was  possible to drive a tractor 20 kilometers to a field from the  central farmstead for a few kopeks. Today this trip costs  thousands. It was correctly observed (unfortunately, off the  record) that we have not managed to forge an agrarian complex,  and that, although being apparently of the same mind, each of us  is in fact plowing his own furrow. All this should not only be  known, but brought to the attention of the party rank and file,  of the ordinary rural laborers. How is this to be done without  funds, offices, or direct telephone links? It is the simplest  thing in the world to dress up like a man of the people, as  respectable Western congressmen do on the eve of the elections,  and set off for remote villages and farms in order to help  people, and your own party at the same time, in word and deed.  Politics, like any other art, requires sacrifices.    Incidentally, about big-time politics.    A party which has in its ranks such cadres as State Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, vice premier of the  Russian Federation Government, APR Chairman Mikhail Lapshin, a  highly experienced manager; Aleksandr Davydov, chairman of the  Agro-Industrial Complex Employees Trade Union Central Committee,  an able tactician and organizer; and many others, can only be  envied. After all, it was only thanks to them that the party's  Central Council did not in their majority commit a fateful  mistake, and did after all give their consent to the signing of  the well-known "Agreement on Accord and Peace," putting forward  a number of very important prior conditions which would prevent  the president and the government from implementing the previous  policy of the virtual destruction of the agrarian sector of the  Russian economy.    "We should not try to smash through walls where there are  doors," Ivan Rybkin objected to his party comrades. "The  agrarian faction is one of the most respected in the Duma. And  we should do everything to bequeath to agrarians a firm  legislative basis. We should learn the art of compromise."    The APR Central Council's plenum was a stormy affair,  characterized by disputes and searches for the truth. One would  like to hope that all the conclusions drawn during the  discussions will serve as a reliable foundation for the  construction of a true champion of agricultural workers -- the  Agrarian Party of Russia.</p>

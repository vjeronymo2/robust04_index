			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LATINO LEADER SAYS COUNTY FACES PRESSURE TO REDISTRICT  </P> <P> The success of a historic voting rights lawsuit in Los Angeles County has  placed local government officials under the gun to consider redistricting plans  in Ventura County, a Latino rights advocate said in Ventura on Saturday.  </P> <P> "Every county is now vulnerable to these kind of lawsuits," Richard Martinez,  executive director of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, told  a group of about 50 local Latino politicians and activists.  </P> <P> On Friday, a federal judge approved a reapportionment plan for the Los Angeles  Board of Supervisors, which Martinez said sets an important precedent and opens  a window of opportunity for Latinos in Ventura County.  </P> <P> The plan is designed to help the first Latino win a seat on the powerful board.  </P> <P> "For counties like Ventura this means that for redistricting in 1991 they are  going to be under the gun," he said.  </P> <P> Although no voting rights lawsuit has been filed in Ventura County, Martinez,  whose agency oversees voter registration efforts in 13 western states, said it  is only a matter of time.  </P> <P> "The issue is who will exercise the political leadership of the Latino  community," he said.  </P> <P> Martinez was the keynote speaker at Ventura College for the "Latino Political  Empowerment Voter Registration and Redistricting Conference." The conference  was attended by Latino council members, city officials and congressional  candidates from Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.  </P> <P> The conference -- the first of its kind in Ventura County -- was part of a  statewide effort by a coalition of organizations to increase Latino political  participation.  </P> <P> It was sponsored by organizations such as Latinos for Fair Representation, the  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the National Assn. of  Latino Elected Officials.  </P> <P> Martinez criticized at-large elections in cities such as Oxnard, where more  than half of the population is Latino but only three Latinos have ever been  elected to the City Council. One Latino, Manuel Lopez, sits on the five-member  council now.  </P> <P> Martinez said 27% of California's population is Latino, yet only 5% of all the  state's elected politicians in federal, state and local offices are Latino.  </P> <P> Martinez said he foresees a voting rights lawsuit in Ventura County initially  targeting a small school district where boundaries dilute the voting power of  minorities.  </P> <P> The success of such a suit could pressure larger government agencies, such as  the county, to voluntarily consider redistricting, he said.  </P> <P> He pointed out that Los Angeles County spent more than $3 million to fight the  redistricting lawsuit. Martinez guessed that county officials working with  tight budgets might be reluctant to fight such a suit.  </P> <P> Andres Herrera, an aide to Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, said an  immediate step toward achieving fair minority representation is increased voter  registration. However, he acknowledged that getting residents to register to  vote is difficult and time-consuming.  </P> <P> "Today is the first step in a long journey we have," he said.  </P> <P> Marco Antonio Abarca, an attorney for the California Rural Legal Assistance  office in Oxnard, outlined the conditions that he believes are necessary to win  a redistricting lawsuit.  </P> <P> He said such a lawsuit will be most successful if the city, county or district  has a cohesive Latino population, a geographic concentration of Latino voters  and a history of ethnic discrimination.  </P> <P> "You have to build this evidentiary base first," he said.  </P> <P> Lopez noted that Ventura County residents have one of the highest participation  rates in the country for responding to the 1990 census.  </P> <P> He said the census results will be vital to a redistricting effort because the  census will give an up-to-date record of the number of Latinos living in the  area.  </P></p>

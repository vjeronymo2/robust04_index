			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: The price of money in the real world - How finance directors make thechoice between debt and equity Debt or equity - how does the finance director of a large company decide how to raise money? One consideration is the cost of financing. According to business school theory based on workby the Nobel Prize winners Professor Franco Modigliani and Professor Merton Miller, the cost of financing is similar whether with debt or equity. In other words, it should not matter to company finance directors whether they choose one or the other. In practice, however, corporate financiers argue that the costs of equity and debt are not the same and that a variety of factors apart from cost estimates can influence how a company raises money. The cost of debt is easy to measure - it is the interest rate paid by a company on its bank loanor bond. If a company decides today to issue a 20-year bond it will have to payabout 2 percentage points over the yield on a similar-dated gilt, so the cost would be about 12 per cent. However, unlike the cost of debt, which is fixed at the date of issue, the cost of equity varies. If the cost of equity is thedividend yield, the current cost of raising equity is about 5 per cent, which is cheaper than the cost of debt. But because investing in equity is riskier, investors usually require a higher return from equity. So, while a company could choose to minimise the cost of equity by keeping the dividend low, such a strategy would prove unpopular with shareholders who want their investments to outpace inflation and expect dividends to increase: hence one would expect the cost of raising equity to increase over time. Tax treatment can also affect the cost of financing. With debt, interest payments are tax - deductible. With equity, advance corporation tax paid by a company on dividends may be offset against the corporate tax liability, although companies with a high proportion of overseas earnings are at a disadvantage as they cannot receive the full tax relief. However, even though the result is to reduce the cost of debt, most company directors and corporate financiers deny that the tax consideration is important enough to influence a financing decision. If theory suggests that the cost of debt and equity are the same, why have so many UK companies announced rights issues in recent weeks? Professor Elroy Dimson of the London Business Schoolpoints out that other factors influence a company's decision to use one form offinancing over another. a clear sign that many companies feel overburdened with debt and want to strengthen their balance sheets. Companies such as Tesco, the food retailer, and Redland, the building materials group, recently raised money through rights issues as neither company wished to increase its level ofgearing. Added to this, institutions have been flush with cash and hungry for equities in which to invest - and the surge in the UK stock market, coinciding with the results season, has provided a good opportunity for companies to issue shares. Redland raised Pounds 280m through its rights issue to fund acquisitions in those countries suffering from recession. 'The key issue faced by any finance director is whether to fund the company with debt or equity, and thatdepends on the risk profile, in other words the gearing and interest cover,' said Mr Gerald Corbett, Redland finance director. Gearing is the ratio ofdebt to equity, while interest cover is the number of times the fixed-interest payments made by a company to service its loan capital are exceeded by earnings. Redland prefers its gearing to be below 40 per cent - and it is now 34 per cent. The optimum level of gearing is subjective. Institutional shareholders - who typically in the UK have quite a high proportion of their investments placed in equity rather than in bonds - are often uncomfortable with gearing of more than 50 per cent. Mr David Morgan, investment director at M&amp;G, warns that investors must pay close attention to gearing levels particularly if the company concerned is in a cyclical business. Different funding strategies are not mutually exclusive, but can be dictated by the options available, according to Mr Tony Rice, finance director at British Aerospace. For example, a company may prefer to use a UK rights issue to fund a UK acquisition, but if it wants to make an overseas acquisition, it may match currencies and use a foreign currency bond. BAe recently raised Pounds 150m of 18-year sterling bonds, but this does not preclude it from making a rights issue later on, says Mr Rice. The cost of the bond issue - of 12 per cent before tax, or 7.8 per cent after tax - is 'tolerable,' he says, and the inverse yield curve means that long-dated paper is cheaper than short-dated paper. However, the fact that the government and utilities companies may be borrowing at the long end of the market convinced Mr Rice that 'it was better to move sooner rather than later' incase demand from institutions for long-dated corporate paper dried up. For every director who can cite the corporate finance theory learned at business school, there are half a dozen who eschew the theory and cite their own reasons for preferring one form of financing over another. In the words of one corporate financier: 'Even if raising money through equity were more expensive it does not mean you don't do it - we live in the real world and in the real world companies are judged by their shareholders and by the people who lend them money, not by their economic models.'</p>

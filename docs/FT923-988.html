			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Mrs Maxwell alleged to control Liechtenstein trusts MRS Elisabeth Maxwell is the power behind secretive Liechtenstein trusts linked to the business empire of her late husband, an MP alleged yesterday. Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP for Dover, suggested to the Commons social security committee that Mrs Maxwell had a side letter that gave her authority to 'pull the strings' of the trusts. He said Mrs Maxwell called an extraordinary general meeting by telephone from Grand Canaria two days after Robert Maxwell died last November, and instructed the board to appoint her two sons Kevin and Ian as directors of Maxwell Newspapers Inc, which owns the New York Daily News. The committee was questioning accountants from Price Waterhouse who are administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation. Mr Shaw was asking about the level of co-operation from lawyers controlling the Liechtenstein-based trusts and the Maxwell Foundation, which controls a series of US-based companies linked to the Maxwell business empire that continue to trade. Mr Mark Homan of PW said that there had been 'encouraging' contact between his firm's lawyers and those controlling the Maxwell trusts. But in response to the allegations about Mrs Maxwell, he said: 'We don't know who is behind those trusts. It is not the sort of thing that Liechtenstein lawyers normally answer.' There are believed to be about 12 trusts, several of which may own shares in MCC and Mirror Group Newspapers and were used as part of an alleged share support operation to sustain the market price of the two companies. Mr Frank Field, chairman of the committee, said he had not seen the documents to which Mr Shaw referred. Also at the hearing, Mr Homan said he was 'considering the possibility' of legal action against Coopers &amp; Lybrand, auditor to most of the Maxwell companies until the collapse of the empire. He disclosed that total professional fees incurred so far during the administration totalled Pounds 15m, including Pounds 7m from the accountants. He said so far sales of assets had realised Pounds 59m, but that he anticipated substantial future sales.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Youth Training scheme challenges the 'thick' image: A Northumbria initiative aims to put quality before quantity in tackling unemployment 'Most people think you are thick if you go on Youth Training,' says Ms Katie Wetherston, who believes her decision to join the scheme instead of going to college like most of her friends, was the best thing she has ever done. Ms Wetherston is one of a few hundred young people involved in an innovative re-modelling of YT in Northumbria. She says she has received the same business and finance qualifications as her friends but a better training for the world of work. She is a YT trainee at Snyder General AAF, which makes heating and ventilating systems. Her training scheme is being evaluated by the government for the 'modern apprenticeship' it wants to launch in 1995 as part of a drive to improve craft, technician and supervisory skills in the UK. The Northumbria scheme is a radical move. Traditionally YT has been overwhelmed by the politics of youth unemployment. The government guarantees a place on the scheme to all unemployed young people. And most local training and enterprise councils, which administer the scheme in England and Wales, have gone for volume over quality. Normally YT lasts two years and individuals, who may or may not be employed, work towards semi-skilled qualifications - level 2 of the National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). Many trainees drop out before achieving qualifications. The Northumberland Tec is going further, subsidising employers to provide higher quality training to craft and supervisory levels. These are level 3 or level 4 NVQ standards, which can require up to four years training. The scheme has attracted young people of the calibre of Ms Wetherston, who has nine GCSEs, because it offers progression to a high-quality qualification. Snyder General likes it because it gets more financial help to produce a highly skilled and motivated employee. But it costs money. The Engineering Training Authority estimates that while it costs up to Pounds 7,000 to provide training to NVQ level 2 in engineering, it could cost an employer who took the young person on as a full-time employee up to Pounds 20,000 (discounted for productive work) to train and pay wages to NVQ level 3. 'The amount of additional funding the government is offering does not seem to be sufficient to fund a major expansion,' said Mr Ken Jones, chief executive of the Engineering Training Authority who nevertheless is keen to explore the new apprenticeship. The Department of Employment, which spends about Pounds 800m a year on YT, has not been explicit about funding of the new scheme. Maintaining the budget - given that rolls on YT will fall because of more people staying on at school - will mean the amount it will spend per person aged between 16 and 19 on improved career advice and work-related training will rise by up to 25 per cent over the next three years. Those on the modern appren-ticeship are likely to receive more. An incentive for employers may be a repackaging of subsidies, with more in the first year when the trainee is normally at college and therefore unproductive in the workplace. A number of issues are still to be explored. There will be a large-scale debate within Tecs and the government as to how young people will be selected for the scheme. To attract employers there is a need to distance the new scheme from YT. But this could also ghetto-ise those left on mainstream YT. A key element of the new scheme will be that employers will be asked to sign a pledge with the young person that they will see the training through to successful completion. There is no such arrangement for YT. Both parties will have to take the arrangement more seriously, so that employers feel more confident about investing in training and trainees become more motivated than at present to stay on a training scheme.</p>

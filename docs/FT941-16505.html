			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / People: Jardine's Scottish tradition When one of Hong Kong's most prestigious jobs is vacated in March - taipan of Jardine Matheson, the colony's oldest hong - it will be taken up by Alasdair Morrison, 45-year-old managing director of its associate, Hongkong Land Property Company, writes Louise Lucas. While other hongs have done their bit by replacing top-level departees with local Hong Kong Chinese, Jardine is keeping up the older tradition of having a Scotsman at the helm. At a Christmas function, Nigel Rich, the present taipan who leaves the colony in March to become group chief executive at Trafalgar House, and Morrison, both Scots, were resplendent in kilts. It may be fitting attire for the managing director of Jardine Matheson, which has a thistle as its emblem, but Morrison may find he has more need to reach for his skean dhu in the challenges ahead. To the Chinese government, Jardine compounded its original sin - the group started life as an opium merchant - by distancing itself from the colony. The group was the first to re-domicile in Bermuda and to switch its primary listing to London. Finally, it publicly supported the democracy proposals put forward by Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong and architect of the blueprint for an expanded democracy ahead of 1997. Beijing could stand no more; it told the hong to gui xi (literally go west, but also go to hell) and then gloated as the group's share prices took a hammering. When it comes to facing these and other issues, analysts and peers say Morrison is capable, sure-footed, an obvious heir to the throne. His ultra-conservative style is just the ticket for acting guardian of a holding company tightly controlled from London by Messrs Henry and Simon Keswick, the controlling shareholders.</p>

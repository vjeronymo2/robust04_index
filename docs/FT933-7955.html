			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Lower London Metal Exchange COPPER and ALUMINIUM prices during the afternoon uncovered good buying interest, which resulted in busy markets and, in copper's case, a final rally. Traders said a late afternoon collapse in copper prices was due to US-based selling touching off liquidation and stop-loss selling orders, which pushed the three months delivery price down to Dollars 1,895, against an earlier high of Dollars 1,913. But strong buying below Dollars 1,900 eventually turned the market and last business was at an unchanged Dollars 1,905 a tonne. Aluminium eased to the day's lows in the early afternoon after news that the closure-threatened 263,000-tonnes-a-year Romanian smelter had only been operating at 110,000 tonnes a year. The three months position dipped to Dollars 1,186 a tonne but good trade buying was evident below Dollars 1,190. COCOA futures closed lower in London, depressed by another failed attempt in New York to breach key resistance at Dollars 1,017 a tonne for the December futures position. The strength of sterling also added to the downward pressure. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI) Involvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters recommend that the FAA recognize the merit in delegating complete program oversight responsibility to the cognizant PMI, once an operator has an approved program in accordance with the alternative provision of proposed paragraph (b). These commenters point out that justification for issuing the proposed AD is based on the premise that certain operators may not have a sufficiently comprehensive maintenance program currently in place to address the blue ice safety concern. However, once a proper maintenance program for handling the blue ice safety concerns has been approved by the FAA and adopted, there is no longer a safety concern to warrant oversight by the Seattle ACO. The administration of handling this program should be subject to oversight by the PMI and, as is normal for the regular maintenance program as a whole, the PMI should be the FAA official with the authority to approve any future adjustments to the leak check intervals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the FAA agrees that the PMI may be permitted certain oversight of the proposed alternative maintenance program provision of the rule (discussed above with regard to recordkeeping), the FAA does not agree that the PMI should be tasked with approving adjustments to the leak check intervals. In order for the PMI to have some basis for changing the intervals, he/she would need to know (1) when to expect the valve to start leaking, and (2) how to ensure that the leak check interval does not allow the valve to reach that point. These two important items are related to the concept of ``failure threshold criteria.'' The FAA has reviewed available service history data (as well as comments submitted to this and previous NPRM's) to evaluate which valves, if any, appear to have ``failure threshold criteria,'' and what those criteria are. While certain failure modes for valves have been identified, the failure threshold criteria are difficult to define in many cases. For example:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. ``Normal'' seal wear will eventually cause a valve to leak. Such seal wear should be a relatively predictable cause of failure for any given operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Developmental problems related to valve or installation design problems (i.e., use of incorrect seal materials) may cause leakage after the initial installation, but after the design ``fix'' is made and installed, leakage from this type of problem should stop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Entrapment of waste materials on valve sealing surfaces can cause leakage; but this does not appear to be related to the valve's time-in-service, in that such entrapment is as likely to occur on the first cycle as on a later cycle. Entrapment of waste matter on the sealing surfaces has been known to cause an increase in operating torque of the valve handle; this would be a failure threshold criterion for ball valves [which the FAA has incorporated as part of the maintenance requirements for the in-line drain valves, as specified in proposed paragraph (b) of this supplemental NPRM]. For certain other types of valves, however, entrapment of foreign matter does not yield such an indicator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The valve may be damaged during service on any particular cycle, assuming it is in a position where it is accessible during normal servicing. Such damage during servicing, or even incorrect servicing (i.e., failure to install the plug in a donut valve), may be failure modes especially for service panel-mounted valves, which are accessible. However, they are not failure modes for in-line drain valves because these valves are not accessible during normal servicing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As one can readily recognize, different valves may or may not be susceptible to these modes of failure, depending upon the valve design, installation location, maturity of design (all fixes incorporated), and other factors. The data available to the FAA simply do not indicate which failure modes are most likely to cause leakage for any particular valve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the most recent analysis and data available, however, the FAA has determined that only the in-line drain ball valve, as installed in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, dated July 30, 1992, may have specific failure threshold criteria. A PMI could use these criteria as a basis for adjusting leak check intervals with some degree of confidence that the valve would not be allowed to reach the point when it would be expected to start leaking. Given the high reliability of these valves (which have a very low total number of leaks from any cause), and the element of relative predictability of failure modes (change seals regularly to avoid seal wear problems, fix the valve if high operating torque is evident, etc.), the FAA has determined that it is appropriate to allow these valves to be leak checked at intervals of 5,000 flight hours (equivalent to a ``C'' check). The FAA considers it impractical, however, to allow the PMI to extend the leak check interval only for these in-line drain ball valve installations. In any case, a leak test at ``C'' check intervals provides assurance that operators are following correct maintenance procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current data do not convince the FAA that service panel-mounted valves have been demonstrated (unambiguously) to be as reliable as the ball valve. The ratio of failures from ``unpredictable'' failure modes to failures from ``predictable'' failure modes is not known for these valves. In light of this, a PMI would have no data on which to base an extension of a leak check interval for panel-mounted valves with the assurance that the valve would not fail within the adjusted interval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> MUSBURGER WAS JUST ON THE AIR TOO MUCH  </P> <P> I don't think this many people have been happy about a guy losing a job since  Richard Nixon resigned.  </P> <P> This week's news of CBS' decision to end contract negotiations with Brent  Musburger, making Monday's National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball  title game his final assignment for the network, didn't seem to put the crimp  in anyone's day. In fact, judging by some of the smiles in this office, it made  several people's days.  </P> <P> What was it about Musburger that engendered such antipathy? He doesn't project  the noxious personality that Howard Cosell sometimes could. He doesn't fill air  time with the inanities of Gary Bender.  </P> <P> No, Musburger is a master in the studio setting, a highly efficient conduit of  information. So what is there not to like about a conduit?  </P> <P> But he was more than that -- which is part of the problem. Musburger the  play-by-play man is not nearly so masterful. Certainly competent, Musburger too  easily gets carried away. Every game is not Armageddon. In fact, every game is  not necessarily the day's biggest game.  </P> <P> That may have been the biggest worry baseball fans had about the prospect of  Musburger as major-league announcer -- that he would Brent his spleen too much  on the air, disturbing the pastoral pastime.  </P> <P> The larger part of The Musburger Problem, however, was his constant presence.  Week after week, game after game, there was Brent. Any of his faults thus  became magnified.  </P> <P> Consider two other criticisms of Musburger: his image as a shrill shill and his  overuse of the first person singular. A typical Musburger introduction, so the  criticism goes, would be something like this:  </P> <P> "You are looking live, on CBS, at Anaheim Stadium, where, just moments from  now, on CBS, the Los Angeles Rams, coming off a big win against the Atlanta  Falcons, will meet Mike Ditka's Chicago Bears, on CBS. Mike told me a few  minutes ago that his team is ready to go. I asked the Rams' John Robinson about  that, and he told me, 'Brent, so is my team.' I just got off the phone with  God, and He told me that we should have great weather for today's game, on  CBS."  </P> <P> Hyperbole aside, how unusual is it for a television announcer to promote his  network's offerings? And is Musburger the only man with a microphone ever to  trumpet himself in reporting quotes?  </P> <P> It all goes back to being on the air so much. (Of course, for $1.75 million a  year, he should have been on a lot.) As the song goes, little things mean a lot  -- even when they shouldn't. Last fall, after Musburger took to wearing glasses  during "The NFL Today," a CBS Sports publicist answered a call by saying she  hoped I wasn't calling about Brent's glasses. Apparently, she had fielded more  than a few calls from the press about the spectacles spectacle.  </P> <P> In the end, Musburger was let go because he apparently wanted to be before the  camera more than CBS wanted. In essence, he lost his job because he wanted to  work too much (try that one out on your boss). CBS wants to showcase Jim Nantz,  Greg Gumbel and James Brown. Spread those assignments around. That way, nobody  can get too annoyed about how Nantz combs his hair.  </P> <P> Where will Musburger end up? There are lots of rumors, the best of which may be  the one that places him with Turner Broadcasting. Sure, it's cable, but Turner  has a good number of major-league properties -- the National Football League,  National Basketball Association, Atlanta Braves, Goodwill Games.  </P> <P> There are a few other things going on at CBS, such at this weekend's Masters  golf tournament. Remember, this is the golf tournament with hardly any  commercials.  </P> <P> If you like ESPN's whip-around NCAA basketball tournament coverage, you'll love  the way it's planning to cover baseball. The cable network's 171-game,  regular-season schedule really will involve about 300 games because of regional  coverage.  </P></p>

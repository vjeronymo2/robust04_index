			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers look at landfill issue A NEW levy on dumping waste in landfills would encourage more incineration and recycling of rubbish, according to a report commissioned by the government. The report, by Coopers &amp; Lybrand for the Department of the Environment, says a levy on landfills - licensed pits for dumping rubbish - would be feasible. Its main effect would be to increase the amount of waste sent to incinerators, but in the long term it would make recycling more commercially attractive. Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said the report 'forms part of the government's programme of work to explore the use of economic instruments in environmental policy'. Environmentalists welcomed the encouragement a levy might give to recycling, but were uneasy about an increase in incineration. The issue of disposal of solid rubbish has become increasingly controversial as the shortcomings of each method have become clear. Following environmental pressure, the terms of licences for landfill operators have been steadily tightened. The report argues that landfill costs will rise 'substantially' before 2000 even without a levy because of tighter rules and the difficulty of finding new sites.

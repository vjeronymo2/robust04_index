			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CIF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GOAT BECOMES THE HERO AS MONTGOMERY NIPS SERVITE  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery High guard Kirk Jones went from goat to hero as he hit a  three-point shot with 33 seconds left in overtime to give Bishop Montgomery a  47-46 win over Servite on Wednesday night at Servite.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery (11-3) recorded its second straight Angelus League victory  without a loss after dropping 38 straight. Servite, ranked No. 9 in the CIF  Southern Section 3-AA, fell to 8-7 overall and 0-1 in league.  </P> <P> With seven seconds to go in regulation time, Bishop Montgomery was tied with  the Friars, 41-41, and junior guard Jones stood at the free throw line after  being fouled while shooting with a chance to win the game.  </P> <P> With a rowdy Servite home crowd jeering, Jones missed both free throws, forcing  the game into overtime.  </P> <P> But Jones saved the Knights as he drilled a three-point shot with :33 left in  the overtime, giving Bishop Montgomery its 47-46 lead.  </P> <P> "Some people would say to take Jones out after missing those free throws,"  Bishop Montgomery Coach Doug Mitchell said. "But he's a tough kid, I knew he  would come back."  </P> <P> Jones' three points were the only points he made all night, but they came at  the right time.  </P> <P> "I'm a defensive player, but if I have to make a shot I'll do it," Jones said.  </P> <P> Jones' heroics were set up by senior Darrell Daniel, who scored a game-high 27  points, more than half of the Knights' total.  </P> <P> "What can you say about Darrell Daniel?" Mitchell asked. "You can say he  virtually slayed the Friars by himself, but he will correct you."  </P> <P> "I have a lot of confidence in our team," Daniel said. "We were a little  confused, but then we started knocking the shots down."  </P> <P> Servite led 13-6 after the first quarter and 23-18 at halftime. The Friars were  frustrating the Knight offense and patiently wearing down the defense.  </P> <P> The third quarter began with a 6-0 Servite spurt, making the score 29-18, but  Daniel led a Knight charge, scoring 13 points in the quarter, including five  consecutive baskets to give Bishop Montgomery a 35-34 lead with one quarter to  go.  </P> <P> Servite led in the overtime, 44-41, but Daniel hit a 22-foot three-point shot  to tie the game.  </P> <P> Servite sophomore forward Adam Anderson hit two free throws after Daniel's  shot, making the score 46-44 Servite.  </P> <P> Anderson's free throws were followed by Jones' dramatic bomb, sparking a wild  victory celebration by the Knights and a happy ride home through the Orange  County fog.  </P> <P> El Segundo 65, Pius X 53 -- Senior guard Scott Panfil scored 27 points,  including four three-point shots, and center Ken Talanoa added 14 points and 14  rebounds at El Segundo to lead the Eagles to their first Camino Real League  victory.  </P> <P> El Segundo (7-8 overall, 1-2 in league play) opened a 17-4 lead but Pius X  managed to stay within striking range and got as close as eight points in the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "We needed a win badly," said El Segundo Coach Rick Sabosky, whose team opened  its first season in the competitive league with losses to St. Bernard and St.  Monica. "We played well and played hard for the most part."  </P> <P> Panfil hit several baskets down the stretch to help the Eagles maintain a  comfortable margin.  </P> <P> Forward Rod Titus paced Pius X with 15 points.  </P> <P> St. Anthony 69, Serra 66 -- St. Anthony stole an inbounds pass and scored a  layup in the final seconds of the fourth quarter to tie the game, and the  Saints won it in overtime at Serra.  </P> <P> Leading by one point with 11 seconds left in regulation, Serra went to the  free-throw line after St. Anthony was called for a technical foul. Serra made  one of two free throws but lost the ball on the inbounds pass.  </P> <P> In overtime, Serra guard Steven Johnson hit a three-point shot to tie the  contest, 66-66. St. Anthony then broke the Cavaliers' press and converted a  three-point play. Johnson's last-second three-point shot was off target.  </P> <P> Serra dropped to 5-6 overall and 1-2 in the Camino Real League, while St.  Anthony stayed in first place at 3-0.  </P></p>

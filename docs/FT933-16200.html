			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa remains in the red LUFTHANSA, the German airline, had an operating loss of DM482m (Dollars 284m) in the first five months of 1993 despite an 8 per cent cut in staff costs compared with the same 1992 period, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. A Lufthansa spokesman gave no comparative figure, but said the loss in the January-May period of 1992 had been considerably higher. He said the carrier had saved about DM231m on staff costs in the past 12 months. But average earnings per passenger in the period had fallen by 11 per cent to DM336. Lufthansa continues to believe that it will be able to halve its 1992 operating loss in 1993. It expects 1994 to be a profitable year if the global economy recovers and a spiral of declining prices ends. The airline had a 1992 group loss of DM391m against a 1991 loss of DM426m. In the 1993 first quarter it reported a parent company loss of DM245m compared with a DM386m loss in the same period of 1992. In the first five months of 1993 group costs fell by 5 per cent, or DM336m, from the same 1992 period, while group income fell by only 1 per cent or DM71m.</p>

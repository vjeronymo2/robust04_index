			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GOINGS ON SANTA BARBARA;  </P> <P> WEEKEND'S ATTRACTIONS;  </P> <P> CHAMBER, JAZZ, FOLK, BLUEGRASS AND BLUES FILL MUSICAL BILL  </P> <P> Earth Day celebrations all over are attracting some of the biggest names in  entertainment, and Santa Barbara's is no different. Try the names Jackson  Browne, Kenny Loggins and Jim Messina. Throw in some Hot Corn (bluegrass),  Queen Mab (Celtic) and reggae, Andean, jazz and Mexican folk music, and you've  got yourself a solid day's worth of activity. These acts will be at Santa  Barbara City College from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Sunday. In all, there will be 12  musical acts, more than 120 informational booths, children's activities, art  and photo booths, food and guest speakers, including state Sen. Gary K. Hart  (D-Santa Barbara). No parking will be available on the campus, so organizers  are urging people to take advantage of the free shuttle service. For more  information on the shuttles, call 564-6849. For information about the event,  call 564-6848.  </P> <P> The Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival will enter its 18th season this summer.  It's been featured on CBS' "Sunday Morning," on the BBC, on PBS and on NPR  (just about all the big-time initials, in fact).  </P> <P> It attracts the most talented up-and-coming and already established performers.  And on Monday, six festival participants will perform at Campbell Hall on the  UC Santa Barbara campus as part of their current tour.  </P> <P> Musicians include violinist Ani Kavafian, who has performed with almost all of  the nation's top orchestras, and cellist Carter Brey. Brey will be making his  second visit to UCSB.  </P> <P> Cellist Timothy Eddy, who has toured the nation with the Marlboro Music  Festival and has recorded with Columbia Records and several other companies,  will perform, as will Paul Neubauer, who in 1984, at 21, became the principal  violist for the New York Philharmonic.  </P> <P> The concert starts at 8 p.m. Tickets are $16, $14 and $12. Call (805)-961-3535.  </P> <P> If you're tired of politely oohing and aahing over your child's drawings of  stick-figure people standing next to tilted box-shaped houses, you may want to  bring the little darling up to Santa Barbara sometime during the next two  weekends.  </P> <P> That's when the city's Architectural Foundation is holding its second annual  Kids Draw Architecture day, to give children the opportunity to sketch the  County Courthouse, Mission Santa Barbara and de la Guerra Plaza under the  watchful eyes of local architectural designers.  </P> <P> "We want to increase awareness that the buildings are out there and that they  were actually designed" by someone, Program Director Tom Jacobs said. "When you  draw the buildings, you see all the pieces of it and the care that went into  it. They'll be learning about drawing, they'll be learning a little about the  architecture profession and they'll be learning about Santa Barbara's  heritage."  </P> <P> Last year about 125 children participated.  </P> <P> "It's really amazing to see how children see things. Some were very precise and  some had an individualistic style," he said. "You'd be surprised at what a 6-  or 7-year-old can do. You don't think of a child going out and drawing a  building, but they really get absorbed."  </P> <P> There will be three sessions, all free: 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday at the County  Courthouse, 1100 block of Anacapa Street; 1 to 3 p.m. Sunday at Mission Santa  Barbara, Laguna and Los Olivos streets; and 1 to 3 p.m. April 29 at de la  Guerra Plaza, de la Guerra Street. For more information call (805) 965-6307.  </P> <P> And now for that age-old question . . . if you attended a blues concert and no  blues artists showed up, would you hear the blues?  </P> <P> Don't worry, it's purely hypothetical. Organizers of tonight's blues concert to  benefit Santa Barbara's Special Olympics had a sticky problem but now  everything is under control. A while back, they decided to have a blues  concert. All they needed was a top-notch blues artist to show up. And they  managed to find one, in guitarist Elvin Bishop.  </P> <P> Bishop will headline the show at the Graduate in Isla Vista beginning at 7:30  tonight. He'll be joined by two Santa Barbara acts, the Pontiax and Phil Cody,  and by L.A.'s Jimmy Woods and the Immortals. Tickets are $18 at the door.  </P></p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Fines warning for directors - At A Glance Directors of British companies will be liable for penalties of up to Pounds 5,000 if they do not file their accounts on time. The deadline is July 1. Companies' House, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, says that the level of the fine depends on whether the company is public or private, and how late documents have been filed. Public companies have seven months to file and private companies ten months. Directors of companies which refuse to file documents can be taken to court and prosecuted. Those which file late and do not pay the penalties swiftly will be passed on to a private debt collector.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin </F> Posada in Santa Fe de Bogota by Emisoras Caracol News Director  Dario Arizmendi in Caracol's Santa Fe de Bogota studios; from  "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Arizmendi] At 0704 we greet Colombian Foreign  Minister Noemi Sanin Posada. Good morning.    [Sanin] Good morning, Dario.    [Arizmendi] What is the significance for Colombia of its  chairing the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] for the next three years?    [Sanin] For us, this is very important recognition of  Colombia's international policies. It is very important that  110 countries have unanimously thought that Colombia could chair  the NAM for three years and can host next year's meeting of the  110 presidents.    [Arizmendi] In this case, who will preside over the meeting?  The president or foreign minister?    [Sanin] The head of state and president of Colombia.    [Arizmendi] Do you not feel nostalgic that, after working to  achieve this honorable designation for Colombia first, to  receive the unanimous support of Latin America for Colombia's  candidacy, and later to obtain the support of 110 countries, you  will leave the post of foreign minister on 7 August and will not  enjoy something you engineered?    [Sanin] No. As long as Colombia maintains its leadership and  is able to coordinate the NAM forum, I will be very satisfied.  This will give Colombia an opportunity to have greater  negotiating and coordinating ability to deepen ties with these  110 countries. This is very important for our country, and we  are very satisfied with the recognition of President Gaviria's  policies.    [Arizmendi] Mrs. Foreign Minister, isn't NAM an organization  that has lost importance in recent years? Isn't it a  bureaucratic organization?    [Sanin] That is not true. [words indistinct] obviously had a  reason to exist when the Cold War was still going on and the  world was bipolar, but today problems of developing countries  are not yet over. This makes it necessary to have a policy or  strategy to counter these problems. This will permit us to have  the opportunity to negotiate problems at the United Nations.  The NAM is very much heeded at the UN Security Council.    A great deal of progress has been made in the area of  disarmament thanks to the independence of countries that had  colonization problems. A lot has been done in the area of the  environment. Important positions were negotiated during the [UN]  Earth Summit. [words indistinct] prevented taxing developing  countries.    Regarding human rights, we must establish important  positions  to prevent this issue from being politicized. In other words,  we will be able to improve the negotiating capacity of  developing countries in all areas and among ourselves.    [Arizmendi] You have led President Cesar Gaviria to the post  of OAS secretary general, and you have also led Colombia to the  presidency of NAM for the next three years. With this political  success, why didn't you run for the presidency of the Republic?    [Sanin] [sighs] My work is here at the Foreign Affairs  Ministry, but I also want to tell you these accomplishments are  not mine. They belong to Colombia and its policies, as well as  to the seriousness of our country. I thank you very much for  your words, but it was not time for me to run for president.    [Arizmendi] This was not the moment, but does that mean the  right moment may come later?    [Sanin] One never knows.    [Arizmendi] You are not upset with our question?    [Sanin] Well, I don't think anybody would be upset with such  a question.    [Arizmendi] Could you give this idea some thought and  perhaps  run for president within four years?    [Sanin] I am now fulfilling my duty to work for Colombia,  and  this is a good job and a good campaign. [laughs]    [Arizmendi] A few days ago we interviewed Dr. Ernesto  Samper Pizano on our program "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast.  We also did so on our television program "Face to Face." He  told us that you were virtually the only Colombian who can  afford to be taken to the presidency in the next government. He  said that if you choose to, you could remain in the Foreign  Ministry, but that you could perfectly well go to the Colombian  Embassy in Washington, to the United Nations or to any Colombian  diplomatic mission abroad. Which of all those posts would you  like? Would you like to remain as the head of the Foreign  Ministry?    [Sanin] Look Dario, I have been so busy in the Colombian  Foreign Ministry that I really have not had a chance to think  about 7 August. We have the upcoming Ibero-American Summit, and  we have to coordinate details on the environment. We have to  prepare the commission for the transition of power to the next  government. I truly have not had time to think of anything else.    [Arizmendi] Mrs. Minister, what is there left for you to  round out Colombia's international endeavors?    [Sanin] We are reaching agreements with several countries.  We are going to sign some agreements with (?China). We have to  do well in the Ibero-American Summit, which 21 chiefs of state  and the king and queen of Spain will attend. We are going to  hold important talks on the Ibero-American community. We have  to further integrate Latin America. We have to sign the free  trade agreements on the Caribbean and Central America. The  foreign trade minister is working arduously in that direction.  We are rounding out our mission and are working to finish it.    [Arizmendi] Mrs. Minister, the women's conference will be  held in Beijing next year. This coming Tuesday, 7 June, the  president will officially launch Colombia's programs and  preparations with a view to that summit. As foreign minister  and as a woman, what role have you had or will you have in this  important world event?    [Sanin] I am inside the vehicle and cannot hear your  question  well, would you mind repeating it?    [Arizmendi] Mrs. Minister, I am asking you about the  international women's conference that will be held next year in  Beijing and whose official acts will be launched this coming 7  June by the president of the Republic. As a foreign minister  and as a woman, what will be your participation in this event?    [Sanin] I beg your pardon, but I am inside a vehicle passing  through a street where there is a lot of interference. As soon  as I arrive in my office, we can talk because I can't hear a  thing.    [Arizmendi] Do you hear me, Mrs. Minister?    [Sanin] No, I'm sorry, I have interference. We'll talk again  as soon as I get to the office.</p>

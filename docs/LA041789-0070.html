			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SABATINI CHANGES HER STRATEGY AND STOPS GRAF'S STREAK  </P> <P> Gabriela Sabatini ended top-ranked Steffi Graf's 31-match winning streak with a  3-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory in the final of a $300,000 women's tournament Sunday at  Amelia Island, S.C.  </P> <P> It was Graf's first loss since Nov. 19, 1988, when she was beaten, 6-3, 7-6, by  Pam Shriver in the Virginia Slims Championships at New York.  </P> <P> "I was definitely not playing well," said Graf, who made 60 unforced errors, 29  of them on her usually tough forehand. "My serve was terrible."  </P> <P> Sabatini, ranked third, took control of the match in the second set when she  built a 5-0 lead. After the first set, when she tried to match Graf's power  from the baseline, she changed her strategy. Her high topspin groundstrokes  kept Graf pinned deep on the clay court.  </P> <P> "I started using my mind more," Sabatini said after picking up the $60,000  winner's check. "She started making mistakes. My game was bothering her."  </P> <P> Sabatini broke Graf's serve in the first game of the third set and made it  stand up until Graf broke back in the 10th game to tie the score, 5-5.  </P> <P> It seemed Graf would steal the match, but Sabatini broke Graf's serve to go up,  6-5. She then held on to win as Graf netted a forehand volley on match point.  </P> <P> Sabatini also beat Graf in the semifinals of this tournament last year, 6-3,  4-6, 7-5, before losing to Martina Navratilova in the final.  </P> <P> Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden won his first pro tournament, wearing out  Yugoslavia's Bruno Oresar with an overpowering forehand for a 6-2, 6-0 victory  in the $200,000 River Oaks tournament at Houston.  </P> <P> Gustafsson, who earned $40,000, hit 28 forehand winners, most of them to  Oresar's backhand. Oresar got $25,000.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Luiz Mattar of Brazil won a $230,000 tournament at Rio de Janeiro by  beating third-seeded Martin Jaite of Argentina, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.  </P> <P> The 2 1/2-hour match, held on a specially constructed court on Copacabana  Beach, was delayed several hours because of heavy rain.  </P> <P> Mattar earned $40,000, while Jaite, ranked 64th in the world, won $20,000.  </P> <P> Playing a powerful serve-and-volley game, Ronald Agenor of Haiti defeated  top-seeded Kent Carlsson of Sweden, 6-3, 6-4, to win his first Nabisco Grand  Prix title at the $125,000 Athens International tournament.  </P></p>

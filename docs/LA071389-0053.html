			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICNICS  </P> <P> There is nothing like a cool-looking, cool-tasting picnic under a hot sun.  We're talking about ice-cold drinks and refreshing foods that are cool to the  lips and yummy, besides. Behind the scenes, however, the host-cook wants the  workload to be as minimal as possible. Who wants to work up a sweat in the heat  of summer, no matter how much you love your family and guests? I remember a  hostess who worked so hard on her Hollywood Bowl picnic she was laid up for 2  1/2 days afterwards from fatigue. Imagine how that made us, her guests, feel.  </P> <P> You want to enjoy the picnic too. You want a menu that is simple, yet  glamorous, almost work-free. You want it to survive the trek to the picnic site  and you want to have it served with the least fuss possible.  </P> <P> We've created several menus to keep the cook cool and the guests at ease.  </P> <P> The first menu calls for cold shrimp to use with cocktail sauce. You can buy  the shrimp already cooked. You can also purchase the cocktail sauce, although  we heartily recommend our recipe. No cooking there.  </P> <P> The cold beef requires cooking or barbecuing the meat. To avoid last-minute  work, plan on an extra steak on the fire the next time you barbecue, and freeze  the steak to use for the picnic salad recipe whenever needed. Slicing the steak  will be that much easier partially thawed, anyway. You can assemble the  ingredients in a large covered container and use the same container to toss and  serve the salad at the picnic.  </P> <P> Dessert is even easier. Store-bought ice cream pops are shipped to the picnic  in a compact ice cream freezer (frozen overnight). Or you can pack them in dry  ice, which is available in package form.  </P> <P> The Thai Picnic calls for peanut soup, an easy recipe from a Velvet Turtle  restaurant that we've used with great success over the years. You can serve it  cold for a summer picnic and hot in the winter months. Put it in a thermos to  serve from cups. No spoons necessary here.  </P> <P> The Papaya Stuffed With Curry Chicken can be completely assembled and chilled  in advance and set on a tray lined with plastic wrap to tote to the picnic.  We've scattered ice cubes on the tray for a cooling effect once at the picnic.  All you do is serve each self-contained papaya boat from the tray. The Thai tea  also is poured from a thermos to serve ice cold with lace cookies, store-bought  or otherwise. Our recipe is a honey.  </P> <P> In a Caribbean-style menu we chose smoked oysters for appetizers on tortilla  chips instead of fresh ones for convenience and safety. You can add any  toppings you desire or the Mexican-style ones suggested on our menu. The  chicken drumsticks (select nice, fat ones at the market) can be marinated and  cooked a day in advance since they are served cold, anyway. They will keep just  fine in the refrigerator until ready to tote.  </P> <P> Rice and beans are served cold as a salad. Use leftover rice and canned beans,  as we did, or make your own from-scratch beans. This salad too can be prepared  a day or two ahead. In fact, day-old salad tastes better, because flavors have  been allowed to develop.  </P> <P> You can serve the chicken and rice in a manner shown here with drumsticks stuck  into the mounded rice for convenient service, or separately in plastic  containers. For convenience, the coconut cream can be served from the can in  which it comes for dipping the medley of fresh finger fruit sticks (it's a  pretty can and it has a lid) or transferred as we have done in the photograph  shown.  </P> <P> We stress rice salad for summer picnics because you can use leftover rice from  an evening meal (make sure you make enough to accommodate the recipe). Rice is  a hardy food that also travels well. Assemble the rice, shrimp and and other  ingredients at home and top off the salad with caviar at the picnic.  </P> <P> The Individual Tiramisu (Italian trifle) desserts require no cooking, but they  should be made no sooner than a day ahead for ultimate freshness, unless  frozen.  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD BOWL MENU  </P> <P>  Old-Fashioned Shrimp Cocktail  </P> <P>  Cold Beef Salad Maxine  </P> <P>  Assorted Ice Cream on Sticks  </P> <P>  Store marinated shrimp and cocktail sauce in separate containers to assemble  on the site. Or arrange shrimp over a layer of sauce in small, deep plastic  containers with lids to carry to picnic. Completely assemble cold beef salad  and store in chill-proof container. Toss at the site.  </P> <P> Assorted ice creams or ice pops, such as coconut ice pops, Eskimo Pies, fruit  bars or other favorite ice cream on sticks can be carried in frozen freezer  container (such as Donvier ice cream maker) or packed in a container filled  with dry ice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHRIMP COCKTAIL SAUCE  </P> <P> 3/4 cup chili sauce  </P> <P> 3/4 cup catsup  </P> <P> Dash lime juice  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> Few dashes hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish  </P> <P> Dash dry mustard  </P> <P> Combine chili sauce, catsup, lime juice, Worcestershire, hot pepper sauce,  horseradish and mustard.

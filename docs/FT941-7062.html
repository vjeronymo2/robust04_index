			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Japanese raises Pounds 162m in conversion issue A conversion share issue by Fleming Japanese Investment Trust has raised Pounds 162m, making it the largest investment trust C share issue on record. The institutional placing accounted for Pounds 94.9m of the total, after which the maximum size for the trust was set at Pounds 250m, so that there would be no need to scale back applications in the public offer. The trust is already the largest fund in its sector with assets of Pounds 309m, and the issue will increase that by more than 50 per cent. Heavy demand for funds offering exposure to the Japanese market, at a time when recovery is expected to take off, has pushed the share price of most investment trusts in the sector to a premium to net asset value. Fidelity Japanese Values, a new investment trust specialising in smaller companies which is currently in its public offer period, has also experienced strong demand from institutions. Conversion of the Fleming C shares is expected to take place on March 21, when dealings in the new shares will start. One warrant will be attached to every five shares.</p>

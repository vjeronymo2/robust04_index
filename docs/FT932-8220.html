			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Green light for expansion talks: The prospects for a Community of 16 DENMARK'S Yes to Maastricht means talks will go ahead on EC membership by 1995 for Sweden, Finland and Norway and Austria. However, it is by no means a foregone conclusion that the citizens of all four applicants will want to join. Opinion polls indicate that probably none of them could muster a majority for entry at present - and all of them will hold a referendum before deciding. The four governments are looking to the Danish outcome to lift waning enthusiasm about membership. As Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, underlined last month, 'the Danish No (of last June) broke an upward trend for unification all over Europe'. A Yes now, she said, was a vital precondition to turn that trend around. All applicants except Finland need big turnarounds, and all need perceived victories for often uncompromising demands. Moreover, it has been made clear that they must accept not only existing EC legislation, but the full Maastricht treaty. Opt-outs of the type conceded to Denmark and Britain are only for existing members of the club. As Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner in charge of the negotiations, made clear on Tuesday night as the Danish results came in: 'If the outcome. . . . had been No, there would have been no Maastricht treaty and no basis on which to conduct the enlargement negotiations.' This rigid posture is the official policy of all 12 existing member states; not even the UK has demurred. Getting the negotiations started before ratification of Maastricht was a feat in itself. The original, federalist-minded six member states suspected that semi-detached late-joiners such as Britain and Denmark wished to dilute European political and monetary union by taking in their own former colleagues in the European Free Trade Association (Efta). Southern member states such as Spain worry about a shift northwards in the EC's centre of political gravity. The caricature of both views is that the British and the Danes want simply a loose free trade area with a few indispensable political frills. However, the new entrants say they want to participate in the monetary union, and the common foreign and security policy laid down by Maastricht. Though all except Norway are militarily neutral, they are cautiously receptive to an eventual European defence arrangement in the post-cold war era. Moreover, they favour a 'deepening' in areas such as environment and social policy, with more of the majority voting which Britain sees as eroding sovereignty. With negotiations at an early stage, it is not clear whether the applicants can get satisfaction. Even less clear is whether federalists like the Benelux countries will insist that decision-making procedures designed for six members, already creaking with 12, must be reformed before the EC expands to 16 and more.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An official source has denied that the forces of  unity protecting constitutional legitimacy are shelling  residential quarters in Aden. It is a sacred duty for these  forces to protect citizens, guarantee their security, and  preserve the country's stability. It is the gang of rebellion  and secession who is carrying out such treacherous acts of  hostility. They sold themselves, their consciences, and their  minds to the devil, imagining that this would help them  internationalize the Yemeni issue and promote it in foreign  media and in public opinion. Therefore, they attribute these  ugly criminal acts to the forces protecting and national  achievements and the people, foremost of which are unity,  democracy, and constitutional legitimacy.    The source said the gang, which is committing crimes against  the people and the homeland, has won nothing internally but the  rejection and hatred of all Yemeni people throughout the  country. These criminal acts will never achieve their  illegitimate and unpatriotic objectives. They will backfire on  the perpetrators, bringing just and deterring punishment.    The source said that cease-fire initiatives and the  political  leadership's efforts to entrench them and the state's  constitutional authority are based on an ability to confront all  acts of hostility and to state practically that the opportunity  for dialogue has never been closed, in light of the principled  and declared bases. Many opportunities have been provided for  many of those who have been misled to speak and to define their  positions bravely and to be confident that they will find in the  ranks of unity and constitutional legitimacy all safety,  protection, appreciation, respect, and understanding of all the  pressure and the means of repression exercised by the rebels to  draw them by force into the tunnel of disgrace and destruction.    The source said the rebels are stepping up their hostile,  hysterical action against the places in which the forces of  unity and constitutional legitimacy are located in the  al-Huswah, al-Basatin, Shaykh 'Uthman, Madinat al-Sha'b,  al-Mansurah, [?Amad al-Mindarah], [?'al-Kyus], Bi'r al-Nasirah,  Bi'r Nasir, al-'Imad, and other places. They are fiercely  shelling civilian and economic installations in Little Aden,  believing they have no way to achieve their illegitimate  objectives other than more destruction and the escalation of the  death machine that engulfs them. The forces protecting unity  and legitimacy are working to silence the rancorous military  hotbeds that never responded to all the cease-fire initiatives.    The source emphasized that all Yemeni people are determined  to stop the machine of destruction run by the rebels and to  silence it forever so there will be no solutions except one  based on understanding and dialogue, not on intransigence and  the demented and rancorous use of the machine of destruction.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Official Cuban Foreign  Ministry sources today denied to EFE that President Fidel Castro  had suffered a stroke and said "he is in perfect health."    The sources also denied Castro had been admitted to "Cimex"  Hospital in Havana for a checkup.    The sources said Castro is not scheduled to attend the  meeting between the Cuban Government and Cubans living abroad  that begins on Friday, but they added that he will attend the  next National Assembly of the People's Government meeting  scheduled for 1 May.    Although Fidel Castro has not been seen in public since 2  April, when he met with Chinese Deputy Planning Minister Hao  Jianxiu, other sources said the Cuban president presided, as  usual, at Monday's Council of Ministers meeting.</p>

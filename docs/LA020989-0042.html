			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> A COLD FACT CONFRONTS MASTER'S HARRISON  </P> <P> Chris Harrison thought that he had escaped.  </P> <P> After spending his college baseball career at Oral Roberts in Tulsa, Okla., and  coaching last season at Gordon College in Wenham, Mass., Harrison thought that  athletes were the only flakes he would be dealing with as an assistant coach  and sports information director at The Master's College.  </P> <P> Then, starting Monday, snowflakes began to appear on the baseball field at  Master's campus in Newhall.  </P> <P> "We were shoveling ice off the field," said Harrison, who has coached in the  Netherlands and taken Athletes in Action teams to Czechoslovakia and Poland.  "Last year in New England we were playing games when the windchill was in the  20s. This is like New England right now."  </P> <P> Winging it: Joey Kirk has been doing more sitting than scoring this season for  the Wichita Wings of the Major Indoor Soccer League, but the former Cal State  Northridge All-American probably will see action tonight when the Wings visit  the Forum for a game against the Lazers at 7:35.  </P> <P> Kirk, a forward, has been slowed by tendinitis in his left knee. He has played  in just nine of the Wings' 27 games and scored his first and only point of the  season a few weeks ago in a game against the Dallas Sidekicks.  </P> <P> "It's been frustrating, sitting in the stands for two months," said Kirk, who  missed the Wings' first trip to Los Angeles in December. "I should have some  goals, to tell you the truth. Hopefully, I can get untracked in front of my  family and friends in L. A."  </P> <P> The Wings are in fifth place in the seven-team MISL.  </P> <P> Bad call: Quite a production was made over the appearance Tuesday of Loyola  Marymount standout Hank Gathers at Cal State Northridge's home basketball game  against Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Drum roll, please. The announcer introduced, "the NCAA's leading scorer and  rebounder, from Loyola Marymount University, Bo Gathers . . ."  </P> <P> Bo? Wrong. Hank.  </P> <P> Bo would be Bo Kimble, Gathers' teammate at LMU.  </P> <P> Instead of applause, the announcement drew groans.  </P> <P> Hank Gathers was in attendance to watch his brother, Derrick, CSUN's leading  scorer.  </P> <P> Add Gathers, D.: If he plays to form, expect Gathers to score a lot of points  for Northridge tonight in its home game against Bakersfield.  </P> <P> In CSUN's past four games, over a two-week period, Gathers has been  consistently inconsistent. He had two good shooting performances on Thursdays,  followed by off nights on Saturdays.  </P> <P> On the Thursdays -- against Chapman and Cal Poly Pomona -- Gathers averaged 23  points and was a combined 15 for 28, including 11 for 20 from three-point  range. In Saturday games -- against Cal State Dominguez Hills and UC Riverside  -- he had a 13-point scoring average and totals of nine for 32 and five for 16.  </P> <P> Youth is served: Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin would have been satisfied if  his team had left the Ventura gym clinging to a semblance of dignity with which  it had arrived.  </P> <P> "They're introducing the Ventura lineup and then they introduce ours,"  Beauchemin said. "I'm thinking, holy cow, I hope we can keep this one within  fifty."  </P> <P> Glendale won, 87-80.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros, composed entirely of first-year players, had finally gelled. Or  so some of the players thought.  </P> <P> "After the Ventura game I told them, 'It's a great high but don't get too high  because there's always a low,' " he said.  </P> <P> He was a bit more profound than he might have hoped.  </P> <P> Glendale proceeded to lose three consecutive games, including one to hapless  Santa Barbara, which was 0-6 in Western State Conference play.  </P> <P> "A young team will beat teams you don't expect them to beat and lose to teams  they should beat," Beauchemin said. "It's the nature of the beast."  </P> <P> Points aplenty: Guard Steve deLaveaga ran his streak of scoring in double  figures to 77 consecutive games with 34 points for Cal Lutheran against  Westmont College on Tuesday. But with only five games remaining, deLaveaga will  not reach the NCAA record of 104, set by Lou Stevens of Widener University in  Chester, Pa., from 1985-88.  </P> <P> DeLaveaga, a senior, has scored 34 points in each of his past two games. He has  scored in double figures in every game since Dec. 9, 1986, when he scored 31  points against Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> More points: Vanessa Hornbuckle, a former Newbury Park High player, set a  Cuesta College single-game scoring record with 41 points against College of the  Canyons. Hornbuckle is averaging 24.9 points and is second in the Western State  Conference in scoring behind Canyons' Tressie Millender, who averages 25.4  points.  </P> <P> A win the easy way: Moorpark College has picked up a win in basketball by  forfeit. Salt Lake City, which defeated the Raiders in an early season  tournament game, had to forfeit the win because it used an ineligible player,  former Crenshaw High standout John Staggers. Moorpark is 17-10.  </P> <P> Passing fancy: Former Calabasas High quarterback Darren Del'Andrae is following  in the footsteps of some outstanding passers at Portland State.  </P> <P> Del'Andrae signed with Portland after setting two national junior college  passing records while at College of Marin. The 6-0, 180-pound junior-to-be  completed a record 406 passes in 765 attempts for 4,546 yards in his 19-game  junior college career.  </P> <P> In his last game for Marin, Del'Andrae attempted a record 75 passes, completing  41.  </P> <P> Del'Andrae is expected to contend for the Vikings' starting position, left  vacant by All-American Chris Crawford, who completed his eligibility last  season. Crawford shattered most of the Portland State passing records  previously held by Phoenix Cardinals quarterback Neil Lomax.  </P> <P> New position: Mark Gieseke, a former Westlake High and College of the Canyons  standout, has been moved from the outfield to first base at Cal State  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Gieseke, a senior, batted .477 and was an All-American last season.  </P> <P> Staff writers Mike Hiserman, Ralph Nichols, Gary Klein and Sam Farmer  contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

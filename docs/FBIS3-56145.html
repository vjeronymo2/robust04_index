			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondents Vladimir Glod and Aleksandr </F> Lyushkevich for TASS]    [Text] Minsk January 12 TASS -- "The U.S. President's visit  to the republic is not only of tremendous political and economic  importance. It will also have great moral significance,"  Belarusian Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko told a news  conference in Minsk on Wednesday.    The visit will break through the information vacuum caused  by  the fact that Belarus was not a sovereign state and will help it  acquire its political face in the international arena,  Kravchenko said.    He added, however, that President Bill Clinton's visit to  Belarus is not incidental. This is a recognition of its  tactful, logical and well-balanced foreign policy, he said.    The minister noted that during the talks the sides will  discuss compensation to Belarus for nuclear disarmament. The  visit will also give a fresh impetus to the development of  bilateral relations between the two states. He did not rule out  the possibility that a set of agreements may be signed after the  visit, including agreements on investment privileges and  protection of investments, on scientific cooperation and banking.    As for the programme of Clinton's stay in Belarus, there  will  be a 30-minute welcoming ceremony at the airport. Then the U.S.  delegation will proceed to Kuropaty, the burial place of the  victims of Stalin repressions. In Kuropaty Clinton will also  meet with Belarusian opposition leader Zenon Poznyak,  confidential sources told the BELINFORM news agency.    Closer to noon, Clinton is expected to hold talks with  Belarusian Parliament Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and Prime  Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. Clinton will also meet with  Belarusian deputies. After the talks Clinton, Shushkevich and  Kebich will attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the war memorial  in the city centre.    The U.S. President will address young scientists with a  15-minute speech at the republican Academy of Sciences. At  Minsk airport Clinton will meet with U.S. diplomats working in  Belarus and then leave for Geneva.    In the evening, Shushkevich will hold a news conference.  Clinton will not be present. It has been known, however, that  the American side plans to hold a news conference at the Hotel  Planeta where foreign journalists will be staying.</p>

S.: "Before the </F> Coalition Summit: Prime Minister Pawlak Accepts Marek Borowski's  Resignation"]    [Text] "Yes, I think Mr. Borowski's decision was made with  deliberation and consideration, and it should be treated as  such," said Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak in a television  interview in reply to the question of whether he would accept  the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Borowski. "I am  prepared for a compromise," commented Aleksander Kwasniewski on  the prime minister's statement. "I believe that the prime  minister's statement offers a chance for such a compromise. We  will talk."    The meeting of the coalition, which has been planned for a  few days now, will be held this evening. The leadership of the  Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which held a session yesterday, gave  definite support to the prime minister.    The leaders of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] publicly  and personally forwarded several invitations to talks on the  government conflict to Prime Minister Pawlak. They did not want  to comment on the fact that, since Saturday [5 February], the  prime minister has failed to devote a couple of hours to such a  meeting. They did not have an agreed opinion on how internal  PSL conflicts affect the personality of the prime minister and  to what extent decisions of the SLD leadership will be binding  on his behavior. However, the dominant opinion in the SLD  faction was that, in the current economic situation, neither  side intends to risk another early parliamentary election, and  the conflict has to be settled by Wednesday.    A private conversation between Kwasniewski and Pawlak alone  will resolve the problem. According to unofficial information,  such a meeting had to take place before the Monday meeting of  the PSL leadership. Kwasniewski had said at a previous meeting  of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement Council [OPZZ] that he  would try to persuade the prime minister to not accept Marek  Borowski's resignation. He had also mentioned the possibility  of achieving a compromise.    As we were told in the faction, in case a timely agreement  was not reached, the only obscure issue could be the behavior of  the president, who had thus far kept silent but who could also  appear in Warsaw at any time, convene the government, and join  the game.    He is entitled to do this by Paragraph 2 of Article 38 of  the  Small Constitution, which reads: In matters of exceptional  importance to the state, the president can convene and preside  over a meeting of the Council of Ministers.    During Saturday's meeting of the leaders of the Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], one of the left-wing  politicians stated that the entire conflict actually resolved  itself into a reply to the question of how to manage the  government efficiently. This quite deceitful formulation  originated from the reluctance to tease the partner's ambition  anew. However, a reply to this question is essential, and  Deputy Prime Minister Borowski's resignation was a tactical game  that sooner or later will force the leaders of the coalition to  discuss the essence of this matter.  <H5>  PSL: To Survive, Not To Yield to Domination </H5>   Retain the coalition, accept Borowski's resignation (that  is,  decline his demands), and not be dominated or incapacitated by  the SLD--this is what members of the Chief Executive Committee  and the Chief Council advised the prime minister to do on Monday  night. Opinions on the crisis and the methods for settling it  seem to have been very concurrent among the leadership.    Following an hour-and-a-half-long meeting closed to the  press, Prime Minister Pawlak and Minister Strak left by the  underground garage, avoiding journalists. Vice Chairman  Stefaniuk said that the PSL did not see any danger to the  longevity of the coalition, nor did the PSL threaten the  coalition in any way. In Jozef Zych's opinion, the SdRP  resolution adopted on Sunday "creates the basis for an  optimistic view of cooperation with the PSL."    Zych stressed carefully that the PSL will not get involved  in  the government matters to which he ascribed Borowski's  resignation and his demands. Meanwhile, the problem of the  coalition or the PSL also includes the establishment of  principles in the economic, social, and staff policy. "This  coalition was born in a difficult situation, and we must not  allow some problem that I am convinced is not the most  significant one to decide whether the coalition exists," said  Zych.    The unanimous opinion prevailing among the PSL leadership is  that the fact that Pawlak held back last week's outburst of the  SLD's dissatisfaction, even at the cost of losing some  supporters among his constituents, is positive. Had the prime  minister applied the same weapon--toughness--and presented his  own blatant version of developments, had he listed the points of  the agreement that the SLD failed to execute, the coalition  would not have been able to meet in its current composition.  These points include, for example, Leszek Miller's demands to  amend the budget ("Does the prime minister have to discipline  the number two person in SLD?") and the OPZZ's draft law on  repealing taxes on excessive wage increases submitted in early  December.    Borowski's resignation is perceived within PSL circles as a  tactical maneuver aimed at scoring some propaganda success for  the sake of athe SLD and thus aimed at taking success away from  the PSL and the prime minister, who is Kwasniewski's potential  competitor in the presidential race. Activists for the peasant  movement are saying that the dismissal of Kawalec had been  agreed upon by leaders for both parties two weeks before he was  dismissed by the prime minister. Pawlak dismissed Kawalec  because he waited in vain for a decision by Borowski.    The conflict inside the coalition did not have an impact on  increasing tensions within the PSL. On the contrary, Chairman  Pawlak's opponents inside the party expressed their unanimous  support for him.  <H5>  Prime Minister's Methods </H5>   Depending on the situation, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  applies two methods alternately (sometimes simultaneously):  silence and disappearance. The most recent case (before the PSL  authorities held a session) of the prime minister appearing in  public was at 1400 on Friday. From what he said at the time, it  could not be concluded that he intends to reject the conditions  set by the coalition partner.    After that, he was simply unavailable, and not only to  journalists. On Saturday evening, Aleksander Kwasniewski, while  commenting on reports that the prime minister went to meet with  fire brigade members, said with malice that he does not think  the situation amounted to a trouble spot yet.    One of the SLD leaders, who expressed his irritation while  responding to a question on how it feels to talk to the prime  minister, said Pawlak is a black box: You talk to him and there  is no response. You do not know what he thinks because he does  not reply; he does not even show on his face whether he even  hears you. As can be concluded from statements by members of the  Cabinet, the prime minister's silence is his usual style and not  just a mask he puts on for journalists.    So far, both methods have proved effective. The net result  is that it is the coalition members who get anxious and nervous;  they keep looking for the prime minister, and they wait for a  message from him. And he, having failed to make any  declarations, has all of the possible paths open in front of  him, and he keeps gaining time, which he needs if only to think  things through.  <H5>  The Consequences of That </H5>   It is the SLD politicians who made efforts to clear up the  conflict as soon as possible and to hold a meeting among the  coalition members. But Prime Minister Pawlak announced as early  as Friday that negotiations within the coalition would take  place on Tuesday. He was right.    The SLD made it possible for it to be maneuvered into the  position of someone trying to obtain something. This was  determined first of all by the situation arrangement and not by  mistakes by SLD leaders, at least at the point when the conflict  became publicly apparent.    Waldemar Pawlak is the prime minister. He can continue to be  the government's chief, even if the SLD ministers leave. It  would be a minority cabinet then, even if Sejm deputies for the  Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms and the Confederation for an  Independent Poland joined in. It seems that, at least for the  moment, that is the only possibility with this parliament. The  Union of Labor stresses its similarities with the PSL in terms  of party programs but not with such a minority arrangement. A  government with neither the SLD nor the Democratic Union must be  condemned to the Belweder's support. The prime minister's  dependence on the president and his minister of state would then  increase along with the term of office of the minority cabinet.  Then Waldemar Pawlak, instead of strengthening his position  (which is most probably what he is after right now), would be  strongly dependent on another power center.    Speaking during a television interview, in which he reported  that he will accept the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister  Borowski, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak expressed his  conviction that the coalition continues to function.    "Every one of us, while making a decision, should consider  its consequences very carefully. We have opportunities to work  for Poland in different posts," he said.    According to the prime minister, the dispute is not about  procedural issues but about an answer to the question: Are we  going on, down the road of a simple, liberal continuation, or  will we be creating a prosocial policy that would be open to the  needs of the economy but also to those of society? Speaking on  the topic of differences in approaching the budget, he admitted  that a budget does not necessarily have to be a convenient  formula that can be easily summed up on paper. But what it must  do is meet society's expectations. But the government will not  present a new draft budget because it bears full responsibility  for what it already submitted. He said the budget is based on  the real situation and that it is implementable.    "We have an excellent candidate for the post (occupied by  Marek Borowski). He is a member of our party, but I cannot  reveal his name before I talk to the prime minister,"  Kwasniewski told REUTER late last night. The information was  denied by Zbigniew Siemiatkowski of the SLD.</p>

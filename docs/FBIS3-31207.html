"I should however say that the Yugoslav-Romanian  relations have managed to maintain the well-known  characteristics of traditional friendship, a high level of  understanding, confidence, interest and readiness for  collaboration. Obviously, in conditions of unjustified and  inhuman sanctions which Romania too, has to observe, despite the  tremendous damages it sustains, the concrete collaboration in  the economy, and even in culture and sports, has recorded  terrible losses. Suffice it to mention that the goods exchange  between our countries before the sanctions stood at $500 million  for the first half of 1992 and was showing an upward tendency.  Many deals started together were stopped, but both parties are  making efforts for the existing links not to be severed, and for  waiting for the period after the embargo is lifted with ready  documents and articulated ideas for the continuation of  collaboration at high pace. I would mention one more important  fact: Romania shows great readiness to get adequate approval  from the sanctions committee to make humanitarian exports to  Yugoslavia (food, medicines, raw materials for farm production,  fuel for schools and hospitals' heating), which helps keeping  the relations of friendship and a certain amount of trade.    "The official Romanian visit by the foreign minister of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is yet another contribution to  the continuity of the Yugoslav-Romanian top-level dialogue that  has not been broken. I would only mention Romanian President  Ion Iliescu's visit to Yugoslavia and the Bucharest visit by  Yugoslav Prime Minister Kontic, both paid in the latter half of  1993. In this respect, as well as for the purpose of finding  solutions to the Yugoslav crisis, in which Romania has proved  understanding, flexibility and readiness to help settling the  crisis and maintaining the stability in the area, the Yugoslav  minister's visit has been a full success achieved at the fittest  moment."</p>

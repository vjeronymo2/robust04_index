			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Paris upbeat over Algiers PM FRENCH Foreign Minister Alain Juppe yesterday said Algeria's new Prime Minister Redha Malek was in favour of rescheduling his country's foreign debt, and could lead the troubled North African state to crucial economic reform, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Malek 'was prepared to study rescheduling Algeria's debt - something his dismissed predecessor firmly opposed. This would allow Algeria to win international credits and modernise its economy,' Mr Juppe said in a radio interview. He said France was well disposed towards the new premier, a former foreign minister and ambassador to Paris, who he described as a modernist determined to reform the economy and fight Islamic fundamentalism. 'Algeria needs more economic reform and more political dialogue with democratic forces. We are prepared to help,' Mr Juppe said. Mr Malek was appointed at the weekend to replace Mr Belaid Abdesselam whose austerity policies over the past year have been denounced as a failure by political parties, trade unions and business leaders. Some experts predict that on present trends Algeria will be unable to service its estimated Dollars 26bn foreign debt by mid-1994. Economic reform to create jobs for the fast-growing population is seen as the key to success against Islamic fundamentalists, who would have won a parliamentary election in January 1992 if the authorities had not halted the vote. Before Mr Belaid's dismissal, Mr Juppe had bluntly urged Algiers to speed up economic and democratic reform to put an end to a social crisis which he called very worrying. He yesterday said in Paris he was determined to help restore stability in Algeria and would keep firm control over fundamentalists living in France. 'The government has made it quite clear that there would be no complacency towards religious extremism whose ideas are not ours and are even hostile to us,' he said. Paris has banned two magazines published in France by groups supporting Algeria's clandestine Islamic Salvation Front.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DEAR YELENA': SOVIET MENACE  </P> <P> The most important fact to remember about Ludmila Rasumovskaya's "Dear Yelena  Sergievna" is that it was written in 1980, when Brezhnev was in power and  Afghanistan was becoming the Soviet Vietnam.  </P> <P> This is crucial information. Bear it in mind while watching Moscow's Theatre on  Spartacus Square production of this Soviet play during its all-too-brief  sojourn at Cal State Dominguez Hills. The context single-handedly lifts the  events from the realm of social to political speculation. Or, rather, it  combines the two.  </P> <P> It also explains why this play was banned in the U.S.S.R. for nearly 10 years.  The piece -- which is performed in Russian, assisted by a clear synopsis and  low-key (sometimes too low-key), simultaneous translation conveyed over  earphones -- is about an impromptu birthday party.  </P> <P> Four students arrive one evening at the apartment of their math teacher, Yelena  Sergievna (Oksana Moysina). They bring champagne, a cake and a gift of  expensive wineglasses.  </P> <P> Imagine her surprise.  </P> <P> These are warm, energetic, enthusiastic young people. They sing songs, play  music, dance and draw the teacher into their merriment, making her feel valued  and important.  </P> <P> But while Sergievna is in the kitchen for a moment, we begin to discover that  things might not be quite what they seem. The student Vitya (Sergei Pinegin)  reveals that he stole the wineglasses from his parents' home. And there's a  still more troubling hidden agenda for the visit. Vitya and his companions --  including Lilya (Irina Manulova), her fiance, Pasha (Viktor Mosienko) and the  blond, enigmatic Volodya (Oleg Horitonov) -- are really there to get the key to  a safe that holds the results of their math tests.  </P> <P> A case of prankishness? Guess again. The students turn out to be a selfish,  privileged bunch who need the grades to get into university (and avoid  Afghanistan?). They'll stop at nothing to persuade Sergievna to hand them the  fateful key. When the teacher demurs, the evening degenerates first into  drunken debauchery, later into full-blown hooliganism. The more she resists and  they fail, the more they perversely redirect the by-now senseless violence upon  themselves.  </P> <P> It is a gripping, exhausting, at times breathtaking piece, written in five  arias: Sergievna's eloquent speech of resistance and morality, pitting her own  idealism in the front lines of World War II against the students' self-serving  vandalism -- and the arias of each of the four students, who reveal themselves  chillingly more like fascist than communist youth.  </P> <P> Volodya emerges as the demonic leader of the pack, who, in his mounting  frustration, eventually gives in to that bankrupt masculine last resort: rape.  </P> <P> The Spartacus production of "Dear Yelena" is not for the squeamish. Nor is it  the first since the ban on the play was lifted. In May 1989, Atlanta's Alliance  Theatre imported a well-acted but much tamer theatre verite version of this  play, produced by Moscow's Mossoviet Theatre. The Spartacus actors, with  director Svetlana Vragova and designer Nikita Tkachuk, are into a far more  stylized theater of menace.  </P> <P> Pinteresque might have been the word for this production, except that it is  excessively verbal, even strident at points in the second act, and that the  make-up and action become more and more ritualized as events get more and more  out of hand. The rancor and bile bring it closer to Albee in "Who's Afraid of  Virginia Woolf?"  </P> <P> There are items that remain open to question. Is it logical that at the height  of the violence, Sergievna, who has staunchly resisted all along, would  suddenly give the arrogant Volodya the key? It is a curiously unmotivated  gesture -- a Pyrrhic victory as well, since by then the game has been lost by  pretty much everyone.  </P> <P> Rasumovskaya's rationale for these developments is murky at best, as if the  frenzied symbolism has by then run away with the play -- it stops more than it  ends. But a lot up to then is intoxicating stuff, and director Vragova's  sizzling production at the hands of this vigorous four-year-old company packs  one heckuva wallop.  </P> <P> "Dear Yelena Sergievna" is being presented at the University Theatre on campus  by the spunky Pacific Theatre Ensemble, Cal State Dominguez Hills and the city  of Carson. On its own, as part of a cultural exchange, the ensemble hopes to  send "Aliens," Steven Morris' new contemporary adaptation of Pushkin's "Eugene  Onegin," to Moscow. (A reading of "Aliens" will be held on campus Saturday and  Sunday to help raise funds for the trip; for information, call 213-516-3588.)  </P> <P> In the meantime, and with no lack of gratitude for what we got, the only  regrettable aspect of all this is the brevity of "Dear Yelena Sergievna's "  run. It is being performed only three more times but deserves a much longer  run, preferably in a more centrally located venue. Theater anyone . . . ?  </P> <P> At Cal State Dominguez Hills, Victoria and Tamcliff in Carson. Friday and  Saturday, 8 p.m., with a final performance Sunday, 7 p.m. $12.50-$17.50; (213)  516-3588.  </P> <P> </P></p>

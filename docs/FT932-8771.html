			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Legal challenges bog down EC treaty: No German court ruling on Maastricht is likely before end of July THE German constitutional court in Karlsruhe is considering 18 separate challenges to the Maastricht treaty, and no decision is expected before the end of July. The challenges go to the heart of the issue of whether the German government, and the parliament, can legally transfer to EC institutions the sort of sovereign powers contained in the treaty. In spite of an outward appearance of calm, there is clearly some nervousness in Bonn that constitutional court judges could call the ratification of the treaty into question, or at least delay final confirmation of the decision. That could make Germany, in spite of its large parliamentary majority in favour of the treaty, the last EC member state to deposit its ratification decision in Rome - home of the Treaty of Rome. Senior officials in the government are confident the court will not question the ratification itself, but it may call for more restrictive accompanying legislation, requiring even greater democratic control over EC decision-making. The complainants, however, led by Mr Manfred Brunner, former chef de cabinet to Mr Martin Bangemann, the senior German EC commissioner, believe they have an outside chance of upsetting the process, and even of forcing the government to hold a referendum on the issue. The challengers include four Green Party members of the European parliament, who charge that the Maastricht treaty provides for inadequate democratic control of EC decisions; an independent member of the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament in Bonn, who claims his democratic rights as an MP have been restricted; and the two main extreme right-wing parties, the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU) and the Republicans, as well as a dozen more or less distinguished individuals. The core of their challenges concerns the fact that the treaty will affect fundamental constitutional rights safeguarded in the country's Basic Law, and which cannot be amended even with a two-thirds majority of parliament. The articles in question are Article 1, on the protection of human dignity, and Article 20, which sets out the basic principles of Germany as a democratic and social federal state. The latter goes on to state that 'all state authority emanates from the people. It shall be exercised by the people by means of elections and voting, and by specific legislative, executive and judicial organs.' Mr Brunner and his fellow plaintiffs claim the transfer of sovereignty to Brussels and EC institutions, in areas such as economic and monetary policy, foreign policy and the like, offends against those articles. They also maintain that the EC is not democratically controlled because the European parliament lacks adequate powers, and therefore properly controlled German powers will be exercised by inadequately controlled EC institutions. In spite of urgent efforts by Bonn to speed the processes of the constitutional court, the judges in the second chamber, who are hearing the case, are overwhelmed by at least two other important issues: liberalising the abortion law, and allowing German troops to serve outside the Nato area.</p>

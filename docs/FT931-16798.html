			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Indian steel plant planned CAPARO Industries of the UK has teamed with the state government of Orissa to set up a 3m-tonne integrated steel plant at Duburi in Orissa. Mr Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, will lay the foundation stone in March. The project is to be implemented in two or three phases, with the first phase capacity fixed at 1m tonnes. Implementation of the first phase will require an investment of about Rs50bn (Pounds 1.13bn), including a foreign exchange component of at least Rs20bn. Caparo plans to invest Rs2bn in the equity of Kalinga Steel and the Orissa government Rs1bn. In the first phase, Kalinga will produce hot rolled coils. While the plant will use imported coking coal, its requirement of iron ore will be met by the state-owned mines at Daitari in Orissa. Steel will be produced through the blast furnace route. Kalinga Steel, according to Caparo chairman Mr Swraj Paul, will have to export up to 20 per cent of production to pay for the import of coking coal. Mr Biju Patnaik, chief minister of Orissa, who recently visited Germany to meet the suppliers of technology and machinery and equipment, said on his return: 'If everything goes well from now on, then the project work at Duburi should start by early March. The gestation period of the first phase of Kalinga Steel, according to Mr Paul, will be 3 1/2 years. Indian companies are planning to more than triple the country's alumina output to exploit large bauxite reserves in the eastern state of Orissa, Reuter reports from Bombay. At least three big export-oriented projects, all involving some form of foreign collaboration or joint venture, are planned to produce 2.9m tonnes of alumina a year eventually. Their total cost is estimated at Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.44bn). 'Orissa will be a major alumina producer by the turn of the century,' said Mr GV Kasargod, general manager for planning and development with engineering company Larsen &amp; Toubro. The projects, expected to start production from 1997, will triple India's output of alumina - or aluminium oxide, used to make aluminium  - from the present level of 1.3m tonnes to at least 4.2m, industry sources said.</p>

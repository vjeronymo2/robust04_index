			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Vitaliy Churkin, special  representative of the Russian Federation president and deputy  Russian foreign minister, who is on a mediatory trip to former  Yugoslavia, met Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the presidium of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Momcilo Krajisnik, head of parliament of the  Bosnian Serb republic, and General Michael Rose, commander of  the UN Forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo. Commenting on  the outcome of his trip, the high-ranking Russian diplomat  stated today in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent  that at these meetings there was discussion of questions of a  settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We are now working on the  idea of extending the experience of disengagement of forces on  the lines of confrontation of Croats and Muslims to the  Serbian-Muslim front. Disengagement of Serbian and Muslim units  could be started with Maglaj, where the situation is the most  complex. If this can be achieved on the whole line of combat  operations, the war in Bosnia will be practically ended,"  Vitaliy Churkin said. [passage omitted]</p>

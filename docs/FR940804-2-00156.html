			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD also believes the proposed N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PROVE system is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11), and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15A(b)(9) requires that rules of an Association not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Section 15A(b)(11) requires the NASD to formulate rules governing the quality of fair and informative quotations. Section 11A(a)(1)(C) finds that it is in the public interest to, among other things, assure economically efficient execution of securities transactions. The fundamental purpose of N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PROVE is to assist investors in achieving prompt, efficient executions of their small orders and to provide an opportunity for price improvement within an automated execution environment. The integrity and efficiency of Nasdaq for public investors and market-making participants is critical and the NASD believes that N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PROVE will provide benefits to both constituencies. The design of N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PROVE is not anti-competitive as it affords all market and limit orders an equal opportunity for price improvement regardless of whether the orders are preferenced or unpreferenced. In addition, to the extent that preferenced orders may be handled differently than unpreferenced orders, because market makers have entered into preferencing arrangements with known customers, market maker's effectively will have waived the protections offered them by the system. N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PROVE may also enhance the quality of quotations in the Nasdaq marketplace as market makers participating in the service may be encouraged to narrow the spread and improve the best inter-dealer quotations in Nasdaq in order to be first in priority and continue to receive unpreferenced order flow through N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PROVE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, the NASD believes the N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PROVE is fully consistent with the significant national market system objectives contained in Section 11A of the Act. The facilities of N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PROVE would advance these objectives by offering efficient execution of investors' small orders, by maintaining market maker participation through the automated delivery of orders with the ability to reject those orders if trades have already occurred, and by offering the opportunity for price improvement to N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PROVE orders. The system's functionality will more accurately reflect market makers' affirmative obligations to provide liquidity to the market, without depriving market makers of legitimate exceptions from the firmness requirements contained in SEC Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

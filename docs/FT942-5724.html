			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Dollars 100m joint venture to extend UK network Nortel Matra Cellular, the mobile communications equipment joint venture between Northern Telecom of Canada and Matra of France, has won a Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) contract to extend One-2-One, the UK digital cellular network launched last September. The contract marks a significant advance for Nortel Matra, which makes its cellular infrastructure in Paignton, England, and in France, as it seeks to establish itself as a supplier to Europe's new digital cellular network operators. Ericsson, the Swedish supplier, installed the first section of One-2-One's network. Nortel Matra said it won the contract because of its advanced 'smart antenna' technology, giving its cellular base stations for One-2-One's digital Personal Communications Network (PCN) system greater range than those of other suppliers. In 1990 Northern Telecom bought STC, one of the UK's largest telecoms suppliers, and has used the UK as a base to expand into mainland Europe. One-2-One, which now covers only the London region, aims to extend to the UK's top 30 conurbations by 1996. With the launch in April of Hutchison Microtel's Orange network, the UK has four cellular mobile operators. Cellular operators in France and Germany will start building PCN networks this year.</p>

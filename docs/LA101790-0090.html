"Everyone thinks I have all these  enemies.... There are three or four guys I don't get along with, but there's 45  or so others."  </P> <P> Said quarterback Jack Trudeau: "Everybody will put it behind them and give Eric  a chance to make up for the things that happened. If he plays well, he can  certainly help us."  </P></p>

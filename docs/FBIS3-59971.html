			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Peruvian National Police, through the National  Antinarcotics Directorate (Dirandro), have seized more than 8  tonnes of basic cocaine paste and cocaine hydrochloride and  arrested more than 4,000 persons for the illegal trafficking of  drugs during operations at the national level between January  and October 1993.    Dirandro has also seized valuable chemicals, war materiel,  laboratories, houses, and communications equipment.    To October 1993 the Dirandro has carried out 3,358  operations  and arrested 4,353 persons.    Dirandro agents who are active in the daily fight against  trafficking say the breaking up of drug organizations throughout  the country is the result of intelligence operations.    Dirandro considers the Huallaga area to be important because  it is one of the main regions where cocaine is produced.    Dirandro agents say that the various police departments in  the area cooperate closely in the capture of traffickers and use  special intelligence equipment.    Dirandro agents also operate in the Maranon, Tambo, Ene,  Tambopata, and Aguaytia coca basins.    Operations have been intensified to locate the production  centers that harm the country in Caballococha and in the Amazon  Trapezium.    Peruvian Air Force planes control the airspace,  complementing  the land and river actions carried out by the other  organizations.    Dirandro is acting against the retail sale of drugs and the  control of chemicals in urban areas. In accordance with Decree  No. 25023, the police organizations implement the rules and  regulations regarding chemicals and drugs and determine the  control operations.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Bundesbank accuses politicians: Bonn urged to show more willing to push through spending cuts THE Bundesbank yesterday stepped up the pressure on the government and opposition in Bonn to summon the political will to cut spending. By damping inflationary expectations, and helping slow wage inflation, the central bank had won an important battle, Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the bank directorate, claimed. But the government's fiscal position had so far not improved, he said in Cologne. The total public borrowing requirement this year would reach about 7.5 per cent of gross national product, equivalent to 90 per cent of domestic savings, he said. Although he appreciated the scale of the problems, he urged acceptance of the Finance Ministry's proposals for cuts in all areas, including reductions in the social welfare and unemployment budgets, so far resisted by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). Final proposals, due within the next few days, 'can only be implemented if the political will and readiness to co-operate are great enough', Mr Issing said. Social cuts must be approved in the SPD-controlled Bundesrat (upper house). The force of the arguments for deep cuts was underlined in the Bundesbank's latest monthly report which showed how greatly government borrowing had influenced growth in money supply. In the last two months for which figures are available, the M3 measure, the most important factor in formulating interest rate policy, has exceeded the target range. According to the report, in the first four months of this year, total state borrowing accounted for 50 per cent of all lending to non-banks. In the same period last year, when M3 was already above target, the proportion was 20 per cent. Meanwhile, growth in direct credit to the private sector had slowed from an annual rate of 8 per cent in the first quarter of 1992 to 5.5 per cent in the comparable period this year. Business and industry's bank borrowing had grown 2.5 per cent. The Bundesbank appears increasingly anxious to resume the cautious but consistent programme of small cuts in short-term discount and Lombard lending rates which stopped last month after the scale of the public-sector financing difficulties became known. In a modest further move yesterday, the bank reduced the rate at which it supplies funds to the money markets from 7.60 to 7.59 per cent. Although it could not have been smaller, the cut was considered important by Frankfurt economists in the light of the fact that it was the first change since May 12. Although this hyper-cautious approach has been much criticised inside and outside Germany, Mr Issing said some people tended to overlook that 'the downwards direction had been unaltered throughout'.</p>

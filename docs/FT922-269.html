			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Amato cuts Italian cabinet posts: Fifty-first post-war government is committed to institutional reform PRESIDENT Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last night swore in Italy's 51st post-war government. Headed by Mr Giuliano Amato, the new government has committed itself to implementing urgent measures to restore the country's public finances and to introducing institutional reform. Mr Amato, 54, failed to obtain the formal backing of any of the parties outside the outgoing coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. This four-party coalition was discredited by a large protest vote in the April 5 general election and their majority has been reduced to 16 in the 630-seat chamber of deputies. Despite a fragile majority and serious internal differences, especially within the Christian Democrats, Mr Amato is expected to survive tomorrow's vote of confidence in parliament. The new government fills a power vacuum which has lasted nearly three months. Mr Amato has faced considerable difficulties in building up a consensus and took the unusual step last week of issuing a 23-page policy paper to the 16 parties represented in parliament. The paper laid out four priority areas for action - restoring Italy's public finances, the fight against organised crime, institutional reform, and cleaning up public morality. At one stage over the weekend he was close to giving up as the party bosses persisted in their traditional tactic of dictating the composition of the government. However, backed by President Scalfaro he has achieved a measure of independence. This is reflected in the reduction of the cabinet from a record 32 to 24 portfolios, new faces and the presence of six 'technicians'. The Christian Democrat leadership also sprang a surprise by insisting that anyone wishing to hold a ministerial post had to resign from parliament to demonstrate the cabinet's independence from the parliamentary party. Nine new ministers are Christian Democrat, six Socialist and two each from the minor coalition partners. Mr Amato has retained the three unwieldy finance ministries but the choice of ministers underlines his commitment to curbing the public sector deficit. The Treasury goes to Mr Piero Barucci, currently managing director of Credito Italiano, and the budget portfolio is held by Prof Franco Reviglio, an academic who has been finance minister as well as head of ENI, the state oil concern. In a significant move, the Ministry for the South - the worst area for wasted public investment - has been merged into the Budget Ministry. The Ministry of State Shareholdings has been incorporated into the Ministry of Industry which should accelerate privatisation. The only politician in an economic portfolio is Mr Giovanni Goria, the reformist Christian Democrat premier from 1987-88, who takes over as finance minister. Notably absent is Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing premier and veteran Christian Democrat politician. Although tipped to move to the Foreign Ministry, the party has preferred to let the younger generation advance. The new foreign minister is Mr Enzo Scotti, former interior minister. Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC Environment Commissioner, returns to take over the environment portfolio.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT TO SHOP: THROWN FOR A LOOP BY RODEO DRIVE  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: I have some relatives coming to town who saw the film "Pretty Woman"  and loved it. I thought it would be fun to take them to some of the shops Julia  Roberts went to in Beverly Hills. Could you list them?  </P> <P>  -- A.M., West L.A.  </P> <P> DEAR A.M.: That movie was the ultimate shopper's dream, wasn't it? What we'd  give to be able to spend limitlessly on Rodeo Drive -- and have a pizza thrown  in as well. Fortunately, you don't need a Swiss bank account to check out some  of the stores that either provided merchandise or were featured in the movie,  namely:  </P> <P> * Boulmiche (9501 Santa Monica Blvd.) offers ready-to-wear designs from young  European designers.  </P> <P> * Valentino (414 N. Rodeo Drive) is where Roberts picked up many of her  exquisite suits, that red gown and the dress she wore in the polo match scene.  </P> <P> * Fred Joaillier (401 N. Rodeo Drive) features pricey gemstone baubles and  watches.  </P> <P> * Gucci (347 N. Rodeo Drive) hardly needs explaining for those familiar with  the leather handbags, luggage, shoes and accessories that made logo-flaunting a  national past-time.  </P> <P> * Mr. Guy (previously on Rodeo, now at 301 N. Canon Drive) wasn't filmed for  the movie, but the store did provide Richard Gere's finely tailored Cerruti  1881 suits.  </P> <P> * The Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel (9500 Wilshire Blvd.) is where the couple  lived out their Cinderella fantasy. If you can't afford the Presidential Suite  at $3,000 a day, it's a nice place to have afternoon tea and watch the world go  by.  </P> <P> By the way, Entertainment Weekly magazine totaled up what Roberts' wardrobe  would have cost had Gere actually purchased it for her: a stunning $26,804.48,  including some outfits custom-made by the film's wardrobe designer, Marilyn  Vance-Straker. When life imitates art, it can get pretty expensive.  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: I'm one of those "big, beautiful women." My problem is, despite all  the new stores specializing in clothing for people my size, I haven't found any  that carry really sexy lingerie. There's plenty of basic, utilitarian underwear  and a some very elegant robes and teddies out there for women in larger sizes,  but they're still too prim for me. I want something that sizzles.  </P> <P>  -- G.K., Pacific Palisades  </P> <P> DEAR G.K.: There's a new catalogue for the Delta Burke set that should suit  your needs just swell. It's called Oh! Such Style and features bustiers, bikini  underwear, garter belts, laced-topped thigh-high stockings and one item that  shall go unmentioned here. Trust us: It's in the truly trashy tradition.  </P> <P> In addition, the catalogue has more conservative styles, such as terry-cloth  robes, peignoirs, teddies, caftans and slips. Styles are designed for  full-figured women equivalent to dress sizes 16 through 28. Prices range from  $5 for a pair of nylon stretch stockings to $126 for a three-piece satin pajama  set. For a free copy of Oh! Such Style, call (800) 835-2246 ext. 272.  </P></p>

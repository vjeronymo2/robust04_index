			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIETNAM WAR STATUE;  </P> <P> NURSES FACE MONUMENTAL FRUSTRATION  </P> <P> Diane Carlson Evans got the idea in 1983 when she visited a Minneapolis art  display saluting Vietnam veterans. "Everywhere I looked," she recalled of the  artwork there, "I saw men."  </P> <P> She had been an Army nurse in Vietnam, and it was clear to her that the role of  women in that war -- their valor under fire and constant exposure to death and  the horrors of combat -- was being ignored.  </P> <P> So, hauling her old footlocker from her parents' farmhouse in Minnesota, Evans  pulled out her fatigues for the first time since she had left Vietnam in  August, 1969. Dried blood still stained her boots.  </P> <P> The tattered uniform no longer fit, but she persuaded a young friend to dress  in it and pose as a nurse. Rodger Brodin, the sculptor and Vietnam veteran  whose work had caught her eye in Minneapolis, agreed to work on a statue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3,000 Volunteers  </P> <P> It wasn't long before Evans and 3,000 volunteers nationwide, using miniature  models of Brodin's work, had raised close to $1 million to have their statue  placed at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington. Veterans' groups were  enthusiastic and Congress liked the idea, too. Even actress Loretta Swit, who  played the Army nurse "Hot Lips" Houlihan in the TV series "MASH," voiced her  support.  </P> <P> All along, Evans and the others assumed that their statue would be placed near  the V-shaped Vietnam Memorial, a powerful wedge of black granite that has been  credited with helping heal the psychological wounds of forgotten veterans. And  as the money added up, they began to envision a dedication ceremony for  Veterans Day, 1989.  </P> <P> But while Evans had lived through bloody battles half a world away from her  home in Wisconsin, she and the other nurses who set out to honor the 10,000  American women who served in Vietnam weren't prepared for the bureaucratic  jungles of Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Power Within Her'  </P> <P> In a letter to Evans, sculptor Brodin had once waxed poetic about his creation,  a war-weary nurse cradling an upturned helmet. "There's a power within her," he  wrote, "that even I cannot describe."  </P> <P> J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery of Art and a key figure in  deciding which designs get chosen for memorials in the capital, had less  trouble with an assessment. "The poor nurse," he said recently, "looks like  she's about to upchuck."  </P> <P> Which just about describes the feeling of the nurses after four years of  legislative and bureaucratic battles that have left their design rejected on  aesthetic grounds. Along the way, the grass-roots campaign was split by a power  struggle. Lawsuits and charges of internal mismanagement abounded, and the  future of the entire project is still in doubt.  </P> <P> "I think we did it backwards," concedes retired Air Force nurse Linda Spoonster  Schwartz, legislative affairs director of the group, The Vietnam Women's  Memorial Project. "We're very good nurses, but trafficking in politics is not  our second nature.  </P> <P> "If you want to commit suicide or have a coronary," she adds ruefully, "I can  handle that quite well."  </P> <P> From the start, the Vietnam Memorial has been a project cloaked in emotion and  controversy. Its original design by Maya Lin, the daughter of Chinese  immigrants, was a wall inscribed with the names of more than 58,000 Americans,  including eight women, who died in the war. At first it was bitterly attacked  as a mournful "gash" that inspired feelings of shame.  </P> <P> Emotions rose shortly after the memorial's dedication in 1982, when  then-Interior Secretary James G. Watt, bowing to demands from many disgruntled  veterans, decided almost single-handedly to place near the wall a bronze statue  of three fighting men designed by sculptor Frederick Hart.  </P> <P> Watt's move was later criticized by women veterans, who felt that Hart's  depiction of three males, symbolizing the 3 million men who served in  Indochina, ignored the contribution of the 10,000 American women who also  served. Watt's action also prompted Congress to pass new laws governing the  selection of monuments -- laws that, ironically, now effectively pit the  Vietnam nurses against the influential Brown, head of the five-member federal  Commission of Fine Arts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Site Selection  </P> <P> Under Congress' selection process, there first must be legislation establishing  that a particular person or group should be honored. Next a site is selected.  And only then is a design chosen by the Commission of Fine Arts and the  National Capital Planning Commission, which also dislikes the Brodin statue.  </P> <P> In the case of the nurses, Brown seems to imply, two people in Minnesota simply  made a statue and decided they were going to cram it down the throats of  official Washington and visiting tourists for hundreds of years to come,  regardless of whether others found it appropriate or aesthetically pleasing.  </P> <P> "The poor sculptor got assured (by the women) that whatever he did would  automatically be plunked down there," Brown says of Brodin. "He came and  testified and seemed a reasonable type. I don't know that they are stuck always  having the same artist. We try to focus attention on these memorials on a  national level, not just a group in Minnesota."  </P> <P> Brown would rather see the Vietnam women's salute become part of the  All-Women's Memorial, a $25-million monument and museum planned for the  entrance to Arlington National Cemetery to honor all women who have served in  the U.S. armed forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Among Great Monuments'  </P> <P> "It's going to be very large scale, very prominent and take its place among the  great monuments of Washington," Brown says, adding pointedly:  </P> <P> "One would hope that any subgroup of those gallant women who served in all wars  could see their way clear to submerging their own particular anxieties and have  that memorial symbolize everyone. But this (Vietnam group) is the era of the  'me generation,' so we'll have to see how it goes."  </P> <P> How it has gone so far is not what might have been expected, given the  project's aim to promote sisterhood and healing among Vietnam nurses. A power  struggle over alleged misuse of more than $300,000 in donations resulted in the  ouster last summer of co-founder Donna-Marie Boulay, who says she is  "overwhelmed" by the injustice of her removal.  </P> <P> During the skirmish two lawsuits were filed -- one against the board by two of  its members, and a copyright suit against Stuart Pharmaceuticals, the project's  primary donor, by Brodin. Although both suits have since been dropped,  friendships have been severed and feelings have been bruised. Some women have  become so distraught over the project's difficulties, according to legislative  director Schwartz, that they had to seek counseling, take medication or be  hospitalized.  </P> <P> "What people don't understand is that women see this statue as finally, after  20 years, a sign that our government cared about what they did," Schwartz says.  "Women vets have had more difficulty readjusting to civilian life than even  some of the men because of the kind of work they did. Nurses experienced death  and dying on a daily basis and were exposed to hostile fire constantly."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mother's Letter  </P> <P> She cites a letter to the group by the mother of a nurse who served in Vietnam.  "(The) daughter committed suicide while she was waiting for the statue's  dedication," Schwartz said. "She said if the statue had already been up, her  daughter would not have committed suicide."  </P> <P> (Brown agrees that this has been the most emotionally charged drive for a  memorial that he can recall. When told that some women were hospitalized after  the commission rejected the statue design, he said: "I'm sorry if it seemed to  have that effect. There are a lot of women who were pretty upset at the whole  idea that it should grow into these kinds of proportions.")  </P> <P> Details of the internal strife began to trickle out when the group, after  raising money to fund and erect the $135,000 statue, asked Congress for  legislation authorizing it. Sensing concern about the group's financial  dealings, Congress ordered an audit which revealed -- to the surprise of some  project members -- that more than $385,000 had been spent on public relations  and consultants.  </P> <P> In addition, some project members were dismayed about the spending habits of  Boulay, who they say ran up large, poorly documented travel charges. When she  traveled to Washington on project business, for instance, Boulay had stayed at  the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, one of the city's most luxurious.  </P> <P> "I certainly did, several times," Boulay acknowledged by telephone from her  Minneapolis law office. "The reason I did was I got a very big discount as a  lawyer." A Ritz-Carlton reservations clerk said the hotel does have special  rates for lawyers, the least expensive room rate in the last few years having  been $105 a night.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suit Filed  </P> <P> Last May, Evans and another board member, Karen Johnson, filed a suit against  other board members, charging them with failure to supervise Boulay and  maintain proper corporate and financial records.  </P> <P> Boulay, they charged, had endorsed the television series "China Beach" without  approval, spent corporate funds beyond board guidelines and caused, by her  failure to work with sculptor Brodin, a copyright suit to be filed by Brodin  against Stuart Pharmaceuticals, the project's major corporate backer with a  pledge of $500,000. (In his suit, Brodin accused the firm of using the image of  his statue improperly in a promotional manner.)  </P> <P> The women's suit was dropped within five days, but it was the start of a major  shakeup. In June, the project moved its headquarters from Minneapolis to  Washington. A month later, the board voted to remove Boulay "for cause" and  adopted a revised budget "to reflect a more respectful attitude toward the  supporters and contributors." It also discontinued some of the expensive public  relations contracts.  </P> <P> Evans said that Boulay's mistakes were "not intentional, just bad judgment,  nothing malicious. Some of the costs got carried away for public relations."  The fact that their friendship as co-founders was severed "hurts," she said.  "It can't help but hurt."  </P> <P> The board's actions "boggled my mind," says Boulay, who insists that the money  spent on public relations was necessary to persuade Congress to pass a law  authorizing the statue.  </P> <P> Yet, despite the expensive lobbying campaign, the project settled last October  for legislation that is not statue-specific. A Senate provision specifying that  the memorial consist of a statue at the Vietnam Memorial was amended by the  House after critics complained that such language would circumvent the very law  Congress had passed to stem the tide of monuments in Washington. The women's  group decided to support the House version and asked the Senate to pass it,  which it eventually did.  </P> <P> Boulay now predicts that the legislative change could doom the statue. "I would  dearly, dearly love to be 100% wrong," she said, adding: "I'm morose on the  subject."  </P> <P> The newly organized group has paid off enormous debts, retooled its budget  process and resolved to move forward. "We've really turned it around," Schwartz  gamely maintains. "This project has never been in a better position than it is  right now."  </P> <P> But that's if you consider a holding pattern good position. Before the Brodin  statue can be placed as part of the memorial, the group must clear several  time-consuming hurdles.  </P> <P> First, it must persuade the new secretary of the Interior, Manuel Lujan Jr., to  advise Congress that a women's Vietnam memorial be placed in what is known as  Site 1, which includes the 2.2-acre site of the Vietnam Memorial.  </P> <P> Assuming Lujan does recommend Site 1, which is anticipated, Congress then must  vote to place the women's memorial near Lin's wall and Hart's statue. The  legislation passed last October contains such a recommendation, but it is  non-binding.  </P> <P> And unless Congress also specifies that Brodin's design is the one to be  selected, Evans and her group will then find themselves right back where they  started: before J. Carter Brown and the Commission of Fine Arts, seeking  approval of the statue.  </P> <P> Brown shows no signs of a change of artistic heart. He is more enthusiastic  about the idea of a bas-relief, perhaps depicting a large-scale war nursing  scene. A statue of one white Army nurse, he says, might only compound the  problem: Veterans not literally symbolized by the figure -- black and Asian  women, or service women who weren't nurses -- would feel excluded in the same  way the women felt excluded by the statue of the men.  </P> <P> And he is concerned that adding more and more elements to the Vietnam Memorial  may set off an endless parade of interest groups seeking their own monuments.  </P> <P> Although having an open competition to design the memorial "would certainly be  one way of getting out of a preconceived idea," Brown says, "I would hate to  see a competition that would exacerbate the situation of hitching to a  particular star."  </P> <P> Even though one of their own paid consultants recommended that they consider  placing Brodin's statue at or near the all-women's site, the nurses are adamant  that the memorial be placed at the Vietnam Memorial or nowhere, and that it be  the Brodin statue or nothing. They used models of the statue to raise money,  they note, and they claim it is already famous and promoting healing.  </P> <P> "We won't accept anything other than a statue. That's not equal," said Evans.  "For five months, Rodger and I worked on that statue, and we didn't tell  anybody. Then we heard there would be a statue of three men at the wall. I  wasn't bitter. I just felt empty. We decided we would work on the statue and if  we liked it, we would try to put it on the Wall."  </P> <P> The idea of a bas-relief is greeted no more enthusiastically. "If the men's  statue doesn't detract from the memorial, why would a woman?" asks Evans. "A  bas-relief or a plaque would seem second-rate and make the women feel  second-rate."  </P> <P> (To that, Brown responds, "If they could get the bronze doors of Ghiberti I  wonder if they would think that's second-rate. I'd hate to see people make up  their minds on purely extraneous political grounds without considering it as a  design question.")  </P> <P> Placing the memorial at the all-women's site, across a bridge over the Potomac  River, "sends a message similar to the back of the bus," said Schwartz.  </P> <P> In retrospect, Evans concedes that starting with a specific statue meant they  went about this effort "backwards. We made mistakes. Perhaps we really didn't  know the process." Adds Schwartz: "I think the project now has learned a lot."  </P> <P> The group's target date of Veterans Day for the dedication "may not be  possible," Schwartz concedes. "It's a cherished notion that's dying hard, but  there's still a glimmer of hope. It's not easy to do this."  </P></p>

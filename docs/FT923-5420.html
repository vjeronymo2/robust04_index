			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Boustead advances 6% despite Singapore fall BOUSTEAD, the industrial trading group recently acquired by Jack Chia-MPH, the Singapore-based trading company, has announced a 6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992. Mr Jack Chia, the eponymous chairman, plans to use Boustead's London quote as the base from which to expand his group in Europe. He is currently making a mandatory offer for the minority in Bousteadco Singapore, the listed subsidiary. Boustead's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.04m to Pounds 1.1m on sales of Pounds 38.4m (Pounds 40.7m). Several businesses in the UK showed profit increases while market conditions in Singapore remained depressed. Profits at Bousteadco Singapore declined by 22 per cent, although they showed an improvement over the second half of 1991. The overseas tax charge rose from Pounds 221,000 to Pounds 401,000 because, under Singapore law, Boustead could not offset losses between subsidiaries against tax. There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 348,000, being provisions covering the closure costs of overseas divisional activities after the profit on the disposal of Bousteadco's travel and shipping agency business. Earnings per share and the interim dividend are unchanged at 0.7p and 0.35p respectively.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Losses rise in fourth quarter for Bowater Bowater, the US newsprint manufacturer, saw operating losses rise to Dollars 19.8m in the fourth quarter, up from Dollars 12.5m a year earlier. During the quarter, the group sold 68,000 acres of landholdings for an extraordinary gain of Dollars 48.9m. Including the gain, Bowater reported net fourth-quarter income of Dollars 4.9m, or 12 cents a share. This compares with a net loss of Dollars 20.9m, or 59 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1992. Sales in the latest quarter were Dollars 340.4m, down from Dollars 363.2m a year ago. Mr Anthony Gammie, chairman, said sluggish demand and excess consumer inventories kept prices for newsprint and coated papers depressed. Although pulp prices declined during the quarter, Bowater has announced price increases for early 1994. 'We are encouraged by the 2.1 per cent increase in US newsprint consumption in November 1993, and hope this improvement will continue into 1994. We also hope that the newsprint price increase announced for March 1 will go into effect,' Gammie said. For the year, Bowater recorded a net loss of Dollars 64.5m, or Dollars 1.84 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.35bn, compared with a loss before accounting charges of Dollars 92.9m, or Dollars 2.64, on sales of Dollars 1.36bn in fiscal 1992.</p>

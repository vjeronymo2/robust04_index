			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Morrison Construction down 10% MORRISON Construction, the privately-owned Scottish building company, increased turnover and operating profits in the year to March 31 but experienced a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. The pre-tax line was Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 5.7m) on sales ahead 9 per cent to Pounds 193.2m. Operating profit was up 4 per cent at Pounds 5.6m. In 1989 Morrison increased in size by two and half times when Mr Fraser Morrison, chairman, and his family acquired the outstanding 80 per cent of the company from Charter Consolidated. The group operates in both Scotland and England, but avoids the south-east. The building and property development division proved successful last year but the small housebuilding sector lost money and the civil engineering division encountered problems on a pipeline contract although it continued to operate profitably. Morrison, which has no other foreign operations, was the only British company to win emergency repair orders in Kuwait after the Gulf war from the US Corps of Engineers, a fact which Mr Keith Howell, finance director, said was due to the company's ability to promise speedy mobilisation and to its existing contacts in Saudi Arabia. The Pounds 12m worth of orders in Kuwait produced Pounds 1m of operating profit which Mr Morrison called an 'excellent result.' Morrison now has nil gearing and enjoys positive cash balances. Mr Morrrison said he expected only a gradual recovery in construction markets. Mr Howell said that seeking a Stock Exchange quote was an option the company was 'holding open until the time is right.'</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: IBCA positive on Nordic banks Banks in the Nordic region, battered by heavy loan losses, are on the road to recovery and some are likely to see individual ratings raised this year, IBCA said yesterday. The European rating agency said improved results in 1993, with major banks in Denmark, and Norway and some in Sweden swinging back to profit, were attributable largely to favourable market conditions but it warned the situation had not yet returned to normal. 'Further falls in interest rates, if any, will be relatively limited and net interest revenue in many Nordic banks looks set to come under pressure from intensified competition,' IBCA said. 'Similarly, capital gains on securities are not expected to be as high as in 1993,' the agency added. But it also said there was an improvement in the underlying financial condition of many banks as loan loss provisions were on a downward trend and anticipated continuing improvement in 1994.</p>

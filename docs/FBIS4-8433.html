			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Helsinki Commission Observers Reports on the Violation of </F> Minority Rights in Greece" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, April 13 (ATA) -- The Helsinki Commission  published in the DIGEST of January an article on the minorities  in Greece, commenting as following:    "Human rights observers increasingly report that groups and  individuals in Greece face persecution for expressing opinions  contrary to those of the government on issues concerning The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.    Longstanding tensions between Greece and its neighbours,  exacerbated by upheaval in the Balkans, have apparently led to  the increased restrictions on the free speech.    Over the past two years, Amnesty International, Helsinki  Watch, the International Society for Human Rights, and the U.S.  State Department have expressed concern to Greek authorities  regarding cases where individuals have been prosecuted for the  contents of their speech or writings.    During that time eight cases were brought against 21  individuals criticized the Greek Government's policy toward  Macedonia, or for recognizing themselves as part of a Macedonian  minority in Greece.    The situation of the Greece's ethnic Turkish citizens who  reside mainly in Western Thrace, has continued to be a focus of  rights observers.    While the Greek Government acknowledges the ethnicity of the  Turkish minority-formerly considered Greek Muslims, various  forms of discrimination are still reported, including official  harassment, occasional flare-ups of anti-Turkish violence and  use of the citizenship code to revoke the citizenship of ethnic  Turkish citizens who travel or live abroad for extended periods.    Outspoken ethnic Turkish members of the Greek Parliament  have  also faced attempts to have their immunity stripped so legal  action could be brought against them for various statements.</p>

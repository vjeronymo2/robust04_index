			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THESIS AUTHOR FINDS NICHE AT BLACK COLLEGE  </P> <P> While growing up in suburban Columbia, Md., Suzanne Malveaux lived in an  integrated neighborhood. She attended predominantly white schools. At Harvard  University, where she graduated with honors last June, her roommates were  white, yellow and black.  </P> <P> Yet, Malveaux said she keenly felt her black identity. She also wanted to find  out what it would be like "to be a member of the majority for the first time."  </P> <P> To explore both points, she spent a semester at Howard University, going to  classes, living in a dorm, working at the radio station.  </P> <P> She also gathered material for a senior thesis on students who transferred to  Howard, one of the nation's best-known black universities.  </P> <P> Last spring, her research was summa cum laude at Harvard. The 298-page thesis,  based on interviews with 50 students who transferred to Howard from  predominantly white schools primarily for social reasons, was named the best  undergraduate thesis in sociology at Harvard and won a $1,500 prize as one of  the best theses in any Harvard department this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Large and Diverse  </P> <P> Although she went to Howard looking for a "black university," what Malveaux  found there was less clear-cut. More than 80% of Howard's students and faculty  are black. Most of the rest are foreign. Very few are American whites.  </P> <P> Yet Malveaux said in her thesis that Howard is more similar to the  predominantly white colleges than she and most transfer students expected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Cold and Aloof'  </P> <P> Its student body is large and diverse, she wrote, frequently "apolitical" and  often "cold and aloof." Although most transfer students come "with the explicit  expectation of meeting a friendlier, more receptive black community," she said,  "I found that to a newcomer, Howard was not supportive or nurturing. It was a  large (diffuse) commuter college in the heart of one of D.C.'s most  economically depressed communities. Registration was a four-day rude awakening  to Howard's large bureaucracy and defensively scared freshman body."  </P> <P> Yet Malveaux said that she, like most transfer students, "found a niche," based  not on race but on interests and background. There, she felt comfortable and  thrived.  </P> <P> By transferring to a predominantly black university, "race becomes much less of  an issue" for the students than it was at their previous schools, she said.  They are able to develop as individuals, not "as a representative of the black  race."  </P> <P> Malveaux said about three-quarters of the transfer students in her survey would  recommend Howard to their black friends.  </P> <P> But Malveaux said she decided to return to Harvard. "I had gone through three  years of Harvard, and I enjoyed it," she said in an interview. "I think black  students should go where they are comfortable and where they are challenged."  </P> <P> Kenneth Tollett, a professor of higher education at Howard whom Malveaux  consulted in preparing the thesis, said it confirms his view that black  colleges provide a congenial setting that allows many black students "to move  from isolation to the mainstream without the destructive and demeaning  competition with whites."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The 'Trial Period'  </P> <P> For nearly all of the black students who make up about 7% of Harvard's  undergraduates, there is a "trial period . . . of proving his-her 'blackness,'  " Malveaux wrote. "Everyone wants to assert, in one way or another, 'I didn't  lose it coming here. I didn't lose or give it up to be here. I didn't lose my  black identity because I'm here at Harvard.' "  </P> <P> At Howard, she said, students have an opposite concern: "How will I stand out  in this crowd and make a name for myself?"  </P> <P> Malveaux, 22, graduated from Centennial High School in Columbia. Her father,  Floyd Malveaux, is a professor of medicine at Howard. This coming school year,  she will be working and studying at the American University in Cairo.  </P> <P> Overall, Malveaux said, what the transfer students most dislike about Howard  are its administration and living conditions, but that is more than offset by  positive feelings toward professors and students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Polling the Students  </P> <P> Richard Seltzer, a political science professor at Howard, said these findings  are consistent with a poll of undergraduates he and his classes took several  years ago. Last spring, criticism of the Howard administration and poor housing  conditions were key points in the student protest that disrupted the university  for several days.  </P> <P> Nathan Glazer, a professor at Harvard who was one of the readers of Malveaux's  thesis, said it "makes the case for black colleges that is the same argument  made for single-sex schools. . . . They really are places where race or sex  isn't an issue and students can develop themselves on some other basis."  </P> <P> David Riesman, a Harvard sociologist who served as a thesis adviser to  Malveaux, said that "one of the virtues of going to Howard is not being forced  to fit into a mold . . . of what it means to be a black student, which may be  sitting at the back of the classroom."  </P> <P> The thesis said 55% of the students surveyed said they moved to the front of  the classroom when they transferred to Howard, instead of sitting in the middle  or rear. About 68% said they participated more in class discussions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Active Role  </P> <P> Malveaux suggested that the students may take a more active part in class  because Howard generally has smaller classes than those at the students'  previous colleges. She said the students may also move forward because they  have changed majors and are more interested in the subject matter.  </P> <P> But she said the most frequent reason given was that the transfer students feel  much more comfortable because they are "no longer . . . singled out as a  minority."  </P> <P> Malveaux said some of students said they felt like "quota fillers" at the  predominantly white schools, admitted only to show affirmative action. But at  Howard, she said, most felt proud to be "at home," and comfortable enough, with  their own race a majority, to develop as individuals.  </P></p>

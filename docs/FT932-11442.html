			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Continental again passes dividend CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, has decided it would be 'premature' to pay its shareholders a dividend for 1992, in spite of a return to profitability after steep losses in 1991. The company said yesterday that in view of the difficult economic climate shareholders would be better served if profits were transferred to reserves. This will be the second successive year shareholders will receive no dividend. Continental reported net group profits for last year of DM133m (Dollars 82.6m) after a loss of DM128.2m in 1991. The parent company made a profit of DM38m, against a loss of DM417.1m the previous year. The profits turnround was expected, but the figures imply a sharp downturn in the second half of last year as Continental made profits of DM118m in the first six months of 1992 alone. Mr Gunter Sieber is resigning his post as board member responsible for passenger vehicles due to 'differences of business policy'. He is being replaced by Mr Wilhelm Schafer, previously chief executive of Semperit Reifen in Austria.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Hallvard Bakke, Storting member and </F> leader of Social Democrats Against the EU: "Norway, the Nordics,  and the EU"]    [Text] The arguments against Norwegian membership in the  European Union (EU) are equally important no matter what Sweden  and Finland do, according to Storting member Hallvard Bakke  (Labor, Hordaland), the leader of Social Democrats Against the  EU.    Ragnar Nordgren asked in ARBEIDERBLADET on 10 January if  supporting EU membership if Sweden and Finland join is  compatible with membership in Social Democrats Against the EU  (SME). We do not scrutinize the hearts and minds of anyone who  wants to join SME, but such an attitude is incompatible with  SME's views. The arguments against membership are equally  important regardless of what Sweden and Finland do. At the same  time I do not see that Swedish and Finnish membership would  introduce decisive new elements that would invalidate these  arguments.    In our opinion, EU membership would lessen democratic  influence on our own national development. It would be harder to  combat unemployment, there would be greater disparities in  Norway, Norwegian authorities would lose their influence on  economic policy, it would be harder to preserve and strengthen  the welfare state, and the labor movement would be weakened.  Regional, resource and residential, and environmental  considerations will be just as important even if Sweden and  Finland become members.    It will also be just as important for us to be able to speak  with our own voice in international organizations. If one  believes that small countries can occasionally play a role  precisely because they are outside the big power blocs and that  the Nordic voice has made a positive contribution to the  international community, this supports the argument that it will  be more important for Norway to stay out of the EU if Finland  and Sweden join, although I realize that Nordgren does not share  this view.    In an article in ARBEIDERBLADET on 13 January, Peder  Figenbaum saw fit to "remind" me that the most important reason  why Norway is applying for membership is that our partners in  the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have done so and that  if Finland or Sweden says no, the Norwegian application will  lose much of its purpose. He may be right that Norwegian support  would then collapse due to the strong EU opposition in this  country. But it is not correct that Norwegian membership depends  on Sweden and Finland also becoming members.    Obviously it is important to clarify this matter. Therefore  I  asked party leader Thorbjorn Jagland last year if the Labor  Party supports membership if Sweden and Finland do not become  members. I was told that the party leadership had not yet  discussed this. Later that year, in response to a similar  question, deputy leader Jens Stoltenberg stated that the Labor  Party supports Norwegian membership regardless of whether or not  Sweden and Finland become members.    And that is the only logical position. It would certainly  seem strange if proponents regard the usual arguments for  membership -- that Norway "belongs to Europe," that we must join  in order to influence EU policy, control financial forces, and  change the EU in cooperation with other Social Democratic  parties, as well as for security and environmental reasons -- as  being so unimportant that they do not apply if Sweden or Finland  remains outside.    Figenbaum presents some arguments suggesting that Finland's  and Sweden's relationship are also important for us. He mentions  the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, relations with our  Nordic neighbors, and, the most important consideration for him,  our relations with Europe. Figenbaum claims that the government  views the EEA agreement as "absurd" if the other applicants  become EU members. If so, it would mean that the government  prefers a trade agreement of the kind we had up to 31 December,  which also has Center and Socialist Left (SV) support. I do not  think this is true and I do not know where Figenbaum thinks he  got it from.    The EEA agreement expands free trade to include services and  public tenders and also regulates competitive conditions so that  they are the same within the entire EEA area. There is no reason  why the EU should not want to have such an agreement with Norway  and Iceland even if Sweden, Finland, and Austria become members.  Figenbaum says our situation will be "pretty hopeless with an  unguarded 1,300-km border with the economic and political  superpower that the EU will undoubtedly be and only little  Iceland to back us up." I do not know what kind of encroachment  Figenbaum imagines Norway has to fear from the EU. Personally I  have no doubt that the EU will continue to live up to its  agreements and desire good relations with Norway.    In 1972, EC supporters said it would present no obstacle to  expanded Nordic cooperation if Norway and Denmark became members  and the other three countries remained outside. So it is hard to  see that we could not have good Nordic cooperation now with some  Nordic countries that are EU members and others that are not.  And even if Sweden, Finland, and Norway should all become EU  members, surely we will continue to include Iceland in Nordic  cooperation. With respect to relations with the EU, if Sweden  and Finland are members, we will have three close friends and  neighbors inside the organization. Surely that would not make  cooperation and contacts with the EU more difficult.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / BP nears complete withdrawal from nutrition with Dollars 425m sale BRITISH Petroleum has sold Purina Mills, the largest supplier of animal feeds in the US, to a management group for Dollars 425m (Pounds 289m) in a move that almost completes BP's departure from the nutrition business. The company has also sold its chain of petrol stations in Sweden and a stake in the Swedish petroleum storage company, ODAB, to Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, for a price estimated by Swedish analysts to be Dollars 160m. The sale of the 240 Swedish petrol stations marks BP's exit from Scandinavian retail petrol sales and is in line with the company's strategy of quitting petrol markets where it has not achieved a significant market share. BP has already made Dollars 1.5bn of disposals since January and these two sales mean it has reached its target of selling close to Dollars 2bn of assets in the full 12 months to reduce net debt, which stood at Pounds 9.3bn in March. 'These sales will lead to a very definite improvement in BP's balance sheet,' said Mr Nick Antill, industry analyst at Hoare Govett, the UK stockbrokers. BP is commited to continuing its divestment policy to the tune of around Dollars 2bn next year as well, a move which will reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to around 70 per cent from almost 100 per cent at the end of last year. The sale of the Missouri-based Purina Mills brings the proceeds from BP Nutrition divestments to Dollars 1bn. The company announced it would sell the division about 18 months ago and has now sold the largest parts of the business. It is also in negotiations over the sale of its pet foods business. Five businesses remain in BP Nutrition, including: European seed and animal products, fish-farming, grain trading, animal breeding and pre-mixed animal feeds. The sale of Purina Mills was financed by the Sterling group, a private financial organisation based in Houston. Statoil purchase, Page 26</p>

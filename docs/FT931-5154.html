			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Bosnian peace talks in balance after suspension INTERNATIONAL peace talks to end the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina continue to hang in the balance after being suspended until the end of this week in New York. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, said before leaving for Sarajevo progress had been made in the negotiations on a map dividing the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. But diplomatic observers remain sceptical about the Moslems' or Serbs' political will to conclude an agreement at this stage. 'There's no question that the fighting that has been going on (in eastern Bosnia) has made the talks much more difficult,' Mr Cyrus Vance, one of the two international mediators, said. Though Mr Izetbegovic said he would be returning to the US later in the week 'with the intention of moving the discussions forward to a successful conclusion', there are indications that his colleagues in the Bosnian government are much less ready to compromise. Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, who is reported to have visited Washington last Friday to put the case against acceptance of the plan tabled by mediators Mr Vance and Lord Owen, again struck a warning note at the weekend. 'The president (Mr Izetbegovic) needs to respond to the proper authorities, who are not very pleased that lines may be drawn on the basis of ethnicity and, as a result, the reception is lukewarm,' he said. Nor does the declaration made by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, after the suspension of the talks on Saturday hold out much hope that he will prove more flexible in the future than in the past. While promising that he and his political colleagues would try to find 'the possibilities for further compromises', he claimed that the Bosnian Serbs had made the biggest compromises so far. Moreover, he warned that, if US President Bill Clinton's threat to tighten sanctions against the Serbs if they did not stop fighting was carried out, 'we would leave the conference'. It is virtually certain that Mr Izetbegovic will return to New York with more demands for territorial adjustments to the provincial map, which are likely to prove unacceptable to the Bosnian Serbs. Following the acceptance last week by the Bosnian Moslems of the ceasefire and military disengagement provisions of the proposed peace settlement, the mediators pulled out all the stops to persuade Mr Izetbegovic to endorse their map. If he had, it would have left Mr Karadzic as the only leader of the warring parties not to have endorsed it, and thus much more vulnerable to international pressure. The mediators' tactic of isolating Mr Karadzic, as they did earlier in the negotiations when he was ultimately 'persuaded' by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to accept the new constitutional framework for Bosnia, has thus been thwarted for the moment.</p>

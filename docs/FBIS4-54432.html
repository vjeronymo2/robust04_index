			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 26/4/1994 -- Romanian  participants in the Bucharest Crans Montana Forum generally  shared the opinion, emphasized in statements to ROMPRES, that  the meeting, very well organized, offered an excellent  opportunity to debate political and economic issues of general  interest.    Mircea Cosea, minister of state, president of the Council of  Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform:    "I see the forum as a success. I think the forum is very  important for three reasons: It has greatly contributed first  to a change in the Romanians' manner of getting in touch with  foreigners. Then, it has been rather large. There have been a  great many companies, banks, and international companies  interested in the way how one can invest, in what domains and  priorities. There are a few proposals for the setting up of  banks and many interests in oil processing, chemistry,  agriculture, and, particularly, in the infrastructure and  development of services. Third, Bucharest has arrested  international attention again. It is an event that has called  attention to us again. We have proved we do have facilities to  organize international meetings."    Teodor Melescanu, Romanian foreign minister:    "This year's Crans Montana Forum was a meeting of European  standing in a European country and I am very pleased with its  organization and results as concerns Romania's image, in the  political and economic domains."    ``The possibility we have taken advantage of in order to  demonstrate that our country can be a bridge between Europe and  several zones confronted with big issues -- the Middle East,  ex-Yugoslavia, Central Asia -- has not been wasted.    ``Also, understandings of economic collaboration were  concluded, inter-state relations were established, and these are  the concrete results of the Bucharest meeting.    ``On an internal plane, it has been an opportunity to  demonstrate the Romanians' big possibilities to gather their  energies when needed.''    Emil Constantinescu, president of the Democratic Convention  of Romania, an opposition coalition of Romania:  ``This event has been first of all meant, I think, to improve  Romania's image abroad which -- as we all know -- is negative,  and to sustain the idea that Romania is apt to ensure the  holding of an international conference at a Western standing.  And I think it has succeeded in their respect.    ``I have noticed two tendencies: One to exaggerate the  formal facet, based on pomp and formalism and which belongs  especially to the Romanian organizers, in the well-known  traditions, and, on the other hand, the tendency of the Swiss  organizers of the Crans Montana Forum, who wanted to ensure the  climate of informal events and meetings, in which the sincere,  open talks are prevalent. Contingent upon the relation between  these tendencies, we can expect the consequences. Sure, if  important was only this protocol, then, it might be termed  easily as having used for propaganda purposes the presence of  many political VIPs in order to credit the current power with  successes, especially for domestic use. The second tendency,  however, could have substantiated something more serious and I  think it has done so partly, that is, direct and facilitate  concrete contacts''    National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca:    ``I have a rather long experience as regards the  participation in international meetings. So, I can say that  those who do not have such experience could have been a little  disappointed to see that concrete problems have not been settled.    ``But meetings of this kind are not expected to settle  issues  right away. However, this stage of talks, probing, pioneering  in some domains is absolutely necessary and it happens prior to  the settlement of the respective specific issues.    ``In this respect, the Crans Montana Forum in Bucharest, by  its inspired theme `The Emerging Markets,' by the conditions of  organization and especially by participation, has helped in the  efforts Romania is making to tear down in a certain way the  unnatural psychological barrier and also to join in the flow of  ideas and values.''    Napoleon Pop, state secretary, head of the European  Integration Department:    ``This forum usually covers a wider area, not only one  direction, and it has always happened so because the efforts for  integration cannot be separated from what is happening as global  phenomena in this world. Also, you have noted that the forum  has pursued and emphasized precisely certain directions with  which Romania is willy-nilly connected: the Middle East  conflict, the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, the Balkans  cooperation, the relations with the European Union, and the  regional cooperation. All of them major themes of great  interest to Romania. The decision for integration and all our  efforts in this respect cannot be isolated from what is  happening around us.''    Viorel Salagean, Romanian National Unity Party senator,  member of the Senate Commission for Privatization:    ``The Crans Montana Forum conference has definitely been a  gain for the country, for the Romanian political class, and for  businessmen, both Romanian and foreign, present here.    ``I am sure to many of the foreign guests who have been in  Romania for the first time now and who have participated in the  forum, it has been a great surprise.    ``I have noticed many concrete contacts and, what is even  more important, foreign businessmen have had contacts with  Romanian politicians and cabinet members.''    Aurel Ghibutiu, president of the Chamber of Commerce and  Industry:    ``For the international business circles, the Bucharest  forum  has been a unique opportunity to meet and start advantageous  collaboration actions.    ``For four days both in an organized framework and in the  lobbies of the Parliament Palace, talks were conducted with  businessmen from Romania and from a big number of countries, in  Asia and eastern Europe. I have seen their full satisfaction at  the opportunity they have had in Bucharest to establish contacts.    ``The consequences will show up soon. We have already  prepared a number of missions to go to several countries and  materialize the talks conducted in Bucharest. So, I believe  Romania has made a remunerative investment the results of which  will be obvious very soon.''    Dan Matei Agaton, minister of tourism:    "It is very difficult to appraise the immediate effects.  Anyway, we have launched a new form of tourism -- tourism for  conference purposes and I think we have launched it at a  European level. So, I am sure we are able to organize any time  any international meeting, at whatever level. I think it has  been a test for everything tourism at top level means in  Romania. Since the World Population Congress, held in the '70s,  our country has not organized another event of such a wide  scale. The travel companies have been directly involved. I  think the test has been passed successfully. We are waiting now  for the reactions of the others. I am sure the image of  Romanian tourism will change for the better."</p>

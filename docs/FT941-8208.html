			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Focus on Greenspan testimony Following last week's Bundesbank-led easing of monetary policy across Europe, attention now switches to Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, who delivers his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to the House Banking sub-committee tomorrow. Mr Greenspan's bi-annual appearance, where he is called to explain his views on the economy, will be watched for indications of the likely future course of US monetary policy. The Fed lifted interest rates by 25 basis points earlier this month, the first tightening of policy in five years. Although that move was well received, the dollar has subsequently weakened on the back of a trade dispute with Japan. The dollar last week fell to a six month low of Y101 against the yen and was generally weaker across the board. Since the tightening of policy, US economic data has presented a mixed picture, leading some to wonder whether the Fed might not have moved prematurely. Weakness in US bond prices, however, shows that many investors believe the Fed will respond to some inflationary signs with a further tightening. Given this uncertainty, Mr Greenspan is sure to be closely questioned to ascertain his views on the outlook for inflation and interest rates. In Europe attention will focus on Germany and France. While last week's cut in the discount rate by the Bundesbank has paved the way for a cut in its key repo rate, few see this happening until the wage dispute in the engineering industry is resolved. France, meanwhile, was the only key EMS country not to cut rates last week. Thursday's meeting of the council of the Bank of France will provide an opportunity to fall into line. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, argues that pressures are building on France to ease policy. The G-7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers takes place in Frankfurt on Saturday. US/Japan trade tensions will probably top the agenda. The meeting may provide the spur for Japanese proposals aimed at breaking the logjam.</p>

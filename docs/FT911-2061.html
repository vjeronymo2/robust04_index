			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Cheap and plentiful - and made in a Chinese jail: Revelations of millions of dollars of exports to the west produced behind bars GOT A Red Star sweater in your cupboard? A New Life T-shirt and pair of jeans? Or even, down in the workshop, a ZY 5140 vertical drill? If so, someone (not necessarily you) is breaking the law since these and thousands of other items are made for export in China's prisons. The import of prison-made goods is forbidden in the US under the Tariff Act of 1930, and in Britain by the Foreign Prison-made Goods Act of 1897. There has always been a suspicion that among the billions of dollars' worth of goods the Chinese export lurked many a circuit board or pair of socks originating behind bars. Remy Martin, the French cognac company which has a joint venture making white wine in China, last year admitted to having used prison-grown grapes, while in March packaging for the US company Joseph E. Seagram was spotted awaiting assembly in a Shanghai prison. William D. Paterson, director of Adidas South Korea, reportedly last year saw thousands of shoes in a Canton prison headed for the US market. At the request of Congress, the US Customs Service is investigating the possible use of prison labour in the making of socks, plastic shoes and other clothing exported to the US. The US State Department believes that China's prison exports amount to at least Dollars 100m worth, but AsiaWatch, the US-based human rights group, thinks it may be much more. AsiaWatch has published documents which show that some prisons have even set up processing and joint ventures along with foreign companies (from Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong). These revelations come at a time when US-China relations have already nose-dived because of suspicion of Peking's involvement with Algeria's new nuclear reactor (too big to be experimental, too small to be a power station, just right for producing weapons-grade fuel), recent missile sales to Pakistan and Syria, lukewarm support for US policy in the Gulf, virtual dumping of exports in the US, growing protectionism and constant infringements of US copyrights. 'It's a measure of how angry (President George) Bush is with the Chinese that he agreed to see the Dalai Lama,' said one Washington researcher. In its turn, the President's meeting with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader in mid-April enraged the Chinese, who see any courtesies towards the Dalai Lama as support for renewed Tibetan independence. The AsiaWatch documents include ones that urge penal establishments not already in the business to take advantage of the cheap labour so conveniently available. Chinese prisoners receive almost nothing for labour performed in uniformly grim conditions. US state department officials who visited a Canton prison last year observed that the inmates were paid only 3-3.50 yuan a month (30-40 pence). The AsiaWatch documents also show that low-cost manufacture in prisons for export (and concealment of the conditions under which they are produced) is a deliberate policy. Qin Guishan, official of the New Life Cotton Cloth Mill of Nantong County, Jiangsu province (a prison-run mill) says: 'The export authorities have energetically helped us develop our mill into a base for export. . . . We won praise from customers in Japan, the US and West Germany. . . . Prisoners are not allowed to have direct contact or talks with foreign businessmen (so) no secret has ever been leaked.' 'Our advantage lies in the full utilisation of the rich convict-labour resources for the development of labour-intensive products,' writes He Liang, another prison official. 'The reform-through-labour enterprises charge fees for their services that are 10-20 per cent lower than those charged by other enterprises.' Many held in China's prison have not been through a court. Labour re-education, as distinct from labour reform, is an administrative punishment ordered by the police or other authorities. Even in the courts, which hand down labour reform sentences, justice is hardly seen to be done since the accused are considered guilty before trials (which are often secret) begin. Though the maximum labour re-education sentence is three years, this can be and often is extended year by year. Many political prisoners, whose actions  -putting up posters or writing critical articles - are not offences in other countries, are sentenced to labour re-education. Torture is not uncommon, and has been officially admitted. Often when prisoners complete their sentences, they have to remain on site, working in prison factories or farms. The prison-goods legislation has only once been successfuly applied in the US (to Soviet canned crab-meat in 1951) and never in Britain, as far as spokesmen for the Customs and Excise Service could remember.</p>

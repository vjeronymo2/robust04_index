			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Shareholders not much in evidence Sir, As chairman of a modest public company, County of Kent Developments, I have just presided over my third annual general meeting. As on the two previous occasions, in spite of there being some 300 on the register and their being properly notified, not one shareholder (save the directors) attended the meeting. This may indicate absolute confidence in the board of directors or the total despair on the part of the shareholders. However, the question I pose runs as follows: is three consecutive AGMs of a public company without a shareholder in attendance (save the directors) a record or are there others among your readers better qualified for inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records? John Reeve, J F Reeve, Copse Close, Cedar Road, Hook Heath, Woking, Surrey GU22 0JJ</p>

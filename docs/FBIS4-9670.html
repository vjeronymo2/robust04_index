			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Poleni Castello Branco] </F>   [Text] Rural workers, fishermen, and Indian tribes  countrywide will promote a movement against hunger, misery, and  for jobs. They will take their proposals to the government in  April.    The movement will be entitled "Cry of the Earth." The  movement is being organized by the National Rural Workers  Confederation [Confederacao Nacional dos Trabalhadores na  Agricultura], the CUT [Sole Workers Center], and the Landless  Farmers Movement, as well as other entities that plan to join  the action in favor of citizens and struggle for jobs movement.    This new movement has five main objectives: agrarian reform,  labor rights, social security and health, and policies for the  environment and energy fields. Those who are promoting this  movement plan to begin negotiating these objectives with the  government next month.    Landless farmers representative Gilberto Fortes has asserted  that more than 16,000 families must be settled in the rural  area. He said this problem could be solved by expropriating land  where marijuana plantations are found, as the Constitution  establishes. Representatives of this movement also want to fight  to ensure the expansion of the program to feed workers and the  rural workers' right to severance payments.</p>

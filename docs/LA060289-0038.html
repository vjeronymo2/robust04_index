			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. J. DIAMOND: QUESTIONING THE QUIRKS OF CREDIT CARDS  </P> <P> People are attacking banks again over their credit cards.  </P> <P> Consumer advocates complain that some banks apply finance charges from the date  of a purchase rather than the date it's posted to a cardholder's account, thus  getting some extra days of interest. A California state court recently ordered  Wells Fargo Bank to refund $5.2 million to cardholders who were illegally  overcharged for paying late or exceeding their credit limits. In Alabama,  there's even a move to tax the profits that out-of-state banks make from  Alabama cardholders.  </P> <P> This lucrative little side venture of the banking business now handles charge  volume of $188.3 billion a year, the "largest single source of profit for bank  holding companies," says David Robertson, vice president of the Nilson Report  in Santa Monica, a newsletter for the credit card industry. Forty percent of  that volume goes through the top 10 card issuers.  </P> <P> Oddly, consumers, who gladly use and abuse the credit, seem uneasy with it,  always griping about fees and charges -- at least those they understand. Until  recently, they focused on interest rates, which now average almost 19% and can  reach 22%. Banks say such rates are necessary if they are to offer relatively  easy credit, and they do, marketing their cards more widely now, to less  qualified people, leading in many cases to greater losses. In fact, some banks,  says Robertson, have to write off more than 5% of the volume owed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrangements Seem Bizarre  </P> <P> More basic criticisms should suggest themselves. After all these years, it  still seems a bizarre system of lending money and assessing finance charges.  Typically, the money advanced by the bank is lent interest-free if the consumer  pays it all off when due; if he doesn't, it becomes, retroactively, an  interest-bearing loan.  </P> <P> The arrangements seem equally bizarre. The loan's principal is not, as everyone  thinks, the amount that was due, but (usually) the unpaid balance of that one  month, plus the "average daily balance" of the next month's new purchases.  "I've never understood average daily balance," says Edgar Dworsky, spokesman  for Massachusetts's Executive Office of Consumer Affairs. "Subtract this and  add that and take the square root of the distance from here to Geneva."  </P> <P> The minimum payment required on the "loan" may be 1/36th of what's due, or  1/48th, or perhaps 3% -- amounts that hardly encourage paying it off. And  interest rates are fixed or variable, although "all rates are actually variable  because even 'fixed-rate' cards are raised and lowered at will," says Elgie  Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a Virginia-based consumer  group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Soliciting Customers  </P> <P> There are even bizarre ways of soliciting new customers. They may be  "pre-approved" but need re-approval when they accept the offer. They may also  have to sign an agreement to abide by terms that won't be sent until later,  along with the card.  </P> <P> The current gripes are more limited but still provocative. Banks defend the  practice of applying finance charges from the date of purchase ("transaction  date") because, having authorized the charge, "we're liable for the purchase  from the date it's made," a spokesman for Chase Manhattan says. Some point out  that today's technology may make transaction and posting date the same: A  merchant's receipts, turned in at day's end, may move through the network, from  the merchant's bank to the cardholder's bank and be posted to an account the  same night.  </P> <P> But most banks assume several days' difference, still no big deal to the  consumer, says a spokesman for Chemical Bank in New York. At a rate of 19.8%,  that's less than $.05 per day per $100 owed, or $.25 for the "average of five  days" between purchase and posting. But if half of a big bank's million active  cardholders pay that 25 cents on just one purchase a month, that's $125,000 for  the bank that month in extra revenue.  </P> <P> The Wells Fargo case involved about $23 million in late fees and over-limit  charges assessed cardholders from July, 1982, to May, 1987. The class-action  suit -- one of several similar suits pending against California banks --  challenged the bank's charges for late payment ($3 to $5) and over-limit  spending ($10), which under California law must reflect the bank's costs.  Actual costs were much lower, said the plaintiffs, giving the bank an illegal  profit. The bank claimed that its costs actually exceeded the fees, but the  jury ordered refunds of $5.2 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Broad Marketing  </P> <P> Some critics blame today's fees and rates on the broad marketing of cards,  because the losses on higher-risk accounts must boost the cost of cards to all  cardholders. But lowering income thresholds isn't necessarily dangerous given  the sophistication of today's screening, which assesses "other criteria" as  well, says Mike Sczuka, Wells Fargo executive vice president, including "the  length of time they're on the credit bureau, the number of retail accounts they  have, their credit lines and line utilization."  </P> <P> Some have neither income nor past performance. Citibank, says Citibank  spokesman Bill Ahearn in New York, has 1.5 million college student accounts,  which are good risks "for deep psychological reasons: They don't want to screw  up and ruin their credit histories."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Access to Credit  </P> <P> There could be some question whether a person should have his own credit before  he has his own money, but no one asks it. A basic principle is that credit  cards are egalitarian, says Robertson, which means "giving everyone access to  an unsecured line of credit."  </P> <P> Banks have at their hands a simple way to head off the questions that are asked  -- obscuring their fees. Instead of making the fee for exceeding a credit limit  of $10, for example, they could use an incomprehensible formula -- perhaps an  extra 0.02% of the amount by which the overcharge exceeds the average of 12  months' purchases divided by 27.  </P> <P> Consumers, too, have a simple solution to all credit card charges. They can use  fewer cards and buy only what they can pay for at the end of a month or two.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> GRADCO RESTRUCTURING WILL AFFECT EARNINGS  </P> <P> When Gradco Systems Inc., the Irvine supplier of paper-handling equipment for  office copiers, earlier this month disclosed details of a major restructuring  that included closing its Santa Ana factory, it did not mention that it would  be taking a major charge against earnings as part of the realignment.  </P> <P> As it turns out, the charge will be nearly double the $5.6 million the company  earned in its best year ever.  </P> <P> One source said the charge will total $10 million. Gradco Chief Financial  Officer Steve Nabor, although he would not name a specific figure, confirmed  that it would be in that range.  </P> <P> Nabor said the charge, mentioned briefly as a possibility in a February  earnings announcement, will be disclosed when the company reports its fiscal  fourth quarter financial results in mid-May. No matter how large the final  figure, the earnings are not likely to be pretty: Gradco in February announced  an unexpected loss of $1.4 million for its third quarter on a sharp decline in  revenue.  </P> <P> The restructuring charge guarantees a large loss for the year, and shareholders  can only hope that Gradco's plan to shift its core paper-sorter business to the  Far East will produce better results next time around.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HEARINGS SET ON MOBIL PLAN FOR PIPELINE  </P> <P> An ambitious plan to build a 92-mile underground pipeline to carry heated crude  oil through the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys to the Mobil Oil  refinery in Torrance will be the subject of three public hearings this week on  the project's environmental impact report.  </P> <P> Mobil Oil Corp. plans to replace an aging pipeline, parts of it 55 years old,  with a 16-inch-diameter line capable of carrying 95,000 barrels of crude each  day from Lebec in Kern County to the refinery in Torrance.  </P> <P> Torrance officials say they are monitoring the project, particularly any  changes it would create in the refinery's operations.  </P> <P> The draft environmental impact report, released last month, said that despite  the pipeline's increased capacity, Mobil would continue to process about  120,000 barrels a day at the Torrance refinery.  </P> <P> The report said pipeline construction would create noise and cause unavoidable  disruptions of traffic at major intersections along the route.  </P> <P> But the report said the new line would be safer than the deteriorating line it  would replace, which ruptured two times within three weeks in 1988, spilling  more than 130,000 gallons of oil in Encino and Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> The first hearing will be held Monday at William S. Hart High School, 24825 N.  Newhall Ave., in Santa Clarita. Fulton Junior High School, at 7477 Kester Ave.  in Van Nuys, will be the site of the second hearing on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The third hearing will be held Thursday at Culver City High School, 4401 Elenda  St. All hearings are scheduled from 7 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Ken Cude, an engineer with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, said  Friday that the purpose of the hearings is to gather the public's comments on  the conclusions and recommendations contained in the environmental impact  report.  </P> <P> Torrance City Manager LeRoy Jackson said Torrance city planners will attend one  of the hearings this week. Mobil has withdrawn its application for the portion  of the pipeline within Torrance but is expected to refile the application,  Jackson said.  </P> <P> The pipeline would also pass through Inglewood, where city officials believe  the major impact would come during construction, said Norman Cravens, assistant  city manager. Inglewood planners and engineers are studying the project.  </P> <P> The environmental report is considered a draft until the comments collected at  the public hearings are studied and addressed in the final document. Cude said  city traffic engineers hope to forward the final report to the Los Angeles  Board of Transportation Commissioners by Dec. 13, when the panel could make a  final decision on the project.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Deborah Schoch contributed to this story.  </P></p>

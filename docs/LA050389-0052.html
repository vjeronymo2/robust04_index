			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: SAN DIEGO BRIEFLY . . .  </P> <P> Striking musicians ratified a proposed contract with Starlight Monday, which  the theater's executive committee is expected to be approved at a 3 p.m.  meeting today, management says. Seeking more job security, the musicians went  on strike April 17. The agreement, which runs through Jan. 31, 1990, offers a  4.5% pay raise to the players. It also calls for Starlight to employ 96  musicians at some point during the season, although Starlight employs only  about 20 musicians for each of its five musicals, said Joseph Pallazola,  president of Local 325, American Federations of Musicians. The pact, which  received less than unanimous approval by the musicians, was hammered out during  two days of meetings last week.  </P></p>

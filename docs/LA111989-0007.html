			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRUNES EXHUMED  </P> <P> Re Richard Cromelin's Nov. 5 Introducing column: In discussing the band Gavin  Friday and the Man Seezer, Cromelin implied that the Virgin Prunes group was no  longer in existence. Mary D'Nellan, a member of the Virgin Prunes, wrote to us  on Oct. 3: "We've been recording in Dublin all summer -- our new record is  coming out in Europe next week. . . . It's called "Nada" and we're all very  proud of it. . . ."  </P> <P> For a band about which so little information is available, a bit of  misinformation in a newspaper as widely read as The Times can be very harmful.  </P> <P> ARIEL C. ROSENTHAL  </P> <P> Claremont  </P> <P> JENNIFER H. SIMPSON  </P> <P> Upland  </P></p>

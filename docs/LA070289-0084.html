			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE OF HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA  </P> <P> Recently a man in the prime of his life died because he had no medical  insurance. Nine hospitals refused to admit him. This is a shocking indictment  of the pathological state of health care in America.  </P> <P> There are millions of such stories involving the unaffordability of health care  insurance, of elderly people and those with catastrophic illnesses unable to  pay for treatment, of unethical billing and waste in the hospital industry.  </P> <P> Private health care has failed and is in chaos in America as Blue Cross raises  its rates by 2% and others are in bankruptcy. We must have a national health  care program patterned after the Canadian system.  </P> <P> ELAINE DE BREE  </P> <P> Anaheim Hills  </P></p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / People (Names in the news): Belzberg likes to buy Brent Belzberg may lack the panache of the Vancouver corporate raiders who made his family famous in the 1980s. But the younger Belzberg seems to be building his business on more solid foundations, writes Bernard Simon. Belzberg, aged 43, is chief executive of Harrowston, an unglamorous Toronto-based outfit, which rose from the ashes of First City Financial, the Belzberg-controlled group which mounted daring but ultimately self-destructive raids on several North American and European companies in the mid-1980s. Revived with the help of a capital infusion from institutional investors, Harrowston is quietly buying up victims of North American corporate shake-ups. Its latest purchase is ICI's polyol division. Together with earlier acquisitions from ICI and EI DuPont, Belzberg has now stitched together a chemicals group with annual sales of some CDollars 250 million. He has also bought a meat retailing business. Brent is the nephew of Sam and Bill Belzberg, the once-feared brothers who were the driving force behind First City. Sam and Bill have wisely faded into obscurity on the west coast while their nephew tries to rebuild the family's reputation in Toronto.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Kashmiri militants thwarted on both sides INDIAN police yesterday used tear-gas in Srinagar, summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, to disperse several thousand Kashmiris who defied a curfew to support a pro-independence march from the Pakistani side of the disputed Himalayan region. Police said some 4,000 demonstrators stoned security forces trying to enforce the indefinite curfew, imposed on Monday before the march started. Pakistani troops this week thwarted volunteers of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) from crossing from the Pakistan-ruled part of Kashmir into the region controlled by India, the front's Indian wing was equally busy. In Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, Mr Amanullah Khan, the JKLF leader, said he had called off the march to avoid further loss of life. At least three people were killed in police shooting on Wednesday amid pitched battles between militants and Pakistani security forces. 'They told us frankly that anybody who today, tomorrow or the day after tries to cross their barrier would be shot,' Mr Khan said. Pakistan banned the march because it feared an incursion along the United Nations-monitored ceasefire line could lead to another conflict with India, which had ordered troops guarding the line to let no one across and mined likely crossing points. The line which the militants attempted to cross is known officially as 'line of actual control', drawn at positions held at the end of the 1971 India-Pakistan war over Bangladesh, which was also the third time since independence from Britain in 1947 that they had fought over Kashmir. The two armies still face each other across the line. It was set by the Simla agreement of 1972, which laid down the process of normalisation of relations between the two countries. The accord stipulated a step-by-step approach with Kashmir as the last step to be settled bilaterally and peacefully. However, the two countries have failed to take steps to encourage confidence-building measures despite repeated bilateral meetings. India refuses to take part in substantial bilateral discussions on Kashmir, accusing Pakistan of trying to internationalise the dispute. Indian leaders and all prominent political parties treat Kashmir as a closed issue, regarding the area east of the 'line of actual control' as an integral part of India whose accession to the union is an issue they are not willing to discuss. However, the current tension bears testimony to the fact that three years of effort by the authorities have failed to wean the population from militants. If anything, the liberation movement has gained strength in the valley, the heart of Kashmir, whose population is kept under control by armed troops. Pakistan strongly supports the 'freedom fighters' of Indian Kashmir but denies New Delhi's charges that it is directly arming and training the militants. Mr Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, said: 'We feel regret when we have to use force against freedom fighters. Pakistan holds the cause of Kashmiri people dear to its heart but we cannot let Amanullah Khan lead innocent people before the Indian firing squads.'</p>

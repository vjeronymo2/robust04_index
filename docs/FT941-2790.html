			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Dealers reported an uneventful session on the last full day of trading in the March contracts in both Footsie futures and stock index options, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 started trading at 3,247 and slow but steady buying saw it advance to the day's peak of 3,267 just before midday. News that the Bundesbank had left rates unchanged saw March come off the top and it drifted gently lower for the next few hours on light selling. A bout of heavy selling by independent traders in the last half-hour before the close brought a further retreat before March finished at its starting level of 3,247, a 10-point discount to cash, with volume of 15,640 at the official close. June finished at 3,252 with turnover reaching 8,781 lots. A trader pointed out that the cost of rolling over a long position had fallen from 10 to 7 points, showing a willingness to maintain a short position in March ahead of its expiry. This was said to signal a retreat in the market over the next few sessions. In the Liffe FT-SE Mid 250, volume in March was 473 lots, and the same contract on the OMLX saw 538 dealt. Business in Liffe traded options was dull, volume reaching 25,829 contracts.</p>

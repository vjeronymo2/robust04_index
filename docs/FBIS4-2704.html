			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by unidentified contributing commentator: </F> "Attach Importance to Strictness and Establish a New Image for  Civil Aviation"]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- A consistent demand of  the civil aviation industry by the party Central Committee and  the State Council is to persistently attach importance to  strictness -- carrying out strict management, setting strict  demands, and strictly enforcing discipline. The persistent  emphasis on strictness is determined by the characteristics,  important responsibility, important role, and important impact  of civil aviation.    We must fully affirm the remarkable achievements made by  civil aviation in recent years. However, civil aviation also  has such problems as a serious safety problem, a declining rate  of the normal carrying out of scheduled flights, and a poor  quality of service. These problems have caused the extremely  great concern of the party Central Committee, the State Council,  and the broad masses of the people. It is time that these  problem be dealt with. Their main causes are poor management,  slack discipline, and a sloppy work style. Poor management is  equal to no management.    Civil aviation work has a direct bearing on the image of the  party and the government, on the people's lives and safety, and  on the great undertakings of reform, opening up, and economic  construction. For this reason, the civil aviation industry must  adhere to high standards, set strict demands for itself, and  carry out strict, scientific, and modernized management.    To persistently attach importance to strictness, we must  emphasize centralization and unity and ensure that government  decrees are implemented by all concerned. Civil aviation should  deepen reform and change the operational mechanisms of its  enterprises. In operation and management, it should streamline  procedures, delegate powers to lower levels, and invigorate its  business. However, as for safety measures, air traffic control,  operational standards, and law and discipline enforcement, it  must uphold a high degree of centralization and unity and carry  out strict management, and it must not let each of its  subordinate units go its own way. The more a trade or  enterprise is developed and invigorated, the more it needs to  improve its management. The State Council has decided to  promote the status of the Civil Aviation Administration of China  to a ministerial-level organ. The fundamental purpose of doing  so is to improve the management of civil aviation. The civil  aviation administration should fully understand the profound  meaning and great significance of the decision and take it as an  opportunity to improve management and exercise government  authority.    To persistently attach importance to strictness, the leaders  should take the lead in being strict and perform actual deeds.  The efforts should start right away with the leaders and the  leading organs. To be strict with his subordinates, a superior  must first be strict with himself. In light of the problems  existing in the leadership of the civil aviation industry, the  party committee of the Civil Aviation Administration of China  has set three demands for the leading cadres at all levels. One  is to attach importance to strictness and to oppose the nice-guy  mentality. Next is to work hard, perform actual deeds, and  oppose formalism. The third is to consider the interest of the  whole and oppose selfish departmentalism. Leading cadres at all  levels must seriously fulfill the three demands. In the civil  aviation industry, strictness should be an important criterion  for personnel employment. Anyone who is weak and poor in  management and who has no desire to accomplish much is not  qualified to be a leader. Anyone who carries out strict and  successful management should continue to do so, and those who  practice poor management should improve the situation as soon as  possible.    To persistently attach importance to strictness, it is  necessary to establish a strict responsibility system. The  leaders, functional departments, and personnel in charge of  various businesses in all civil aviation units and departments  should carry out the tasks of safety, normal operation, and  service. A clear and definite system of responsibility for  safety, normal operation, and good service should be established  so that each attends to his duties.    To persistently attach importance to strictness, we should  give wide publicity to the need for strictness. We should make  strictness a general practice so that all civil aviation  employees fully understand the purpose, significance, and need  for being strict and working strictly according to the rules in  all departments, businesses, and jobs. Being strict should  become the order of the day and all workers and staff members  should conscientiously adhere to it. Anyone who upholds strict  standards and makes outstanding achievements should be highly  commended. Those who works sloppily should be sternly criticized  and educated. Law and discipline violators should be harshly  punished. In short, strictness should prevail from top to  bottom, with each level strictly supervising the next lower  level, and a new image for civil aviation should be established.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MANAGER'S VIEW  </P> <P> In regards to Barbara Marcus' Nov. 26 letter on noisy children at movie  theaters, having been a manager for a theater chain I would like to say I agree  there should exist some sort of policy that would prevent small children from  being allowed to watch certain films.  </P> <P> During my three years as a manager I encountered several parents who insisted  on disrupting screenings by allowing their children to run down the aisles or  scream and cry. I would politely ask these parents to control their children's  actions, only to hear that they paid for their admission and were entitled to  watch the film as they pleased.  </P> <P> I believe that theaters should not allow very young children and infants to  attend movies, except for, perhaps, films that are intended for young  audiences, such as the Disney classics.  </P> <P> Dr. Joseph Herman stated in his Dec. 10 letter that Marcus " . . . perhaps, as  a child, spent too many nights at home in a crib with a sitter instead of  enjoying the company of loving parents." Dr. Herman should be concerned about  the children who are raised in an unsupervised environment, rather than  theorizing about Marcus' childhood.  </P> <P> SCOTT KRAGER  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

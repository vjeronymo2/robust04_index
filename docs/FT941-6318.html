			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Croats and Moslems sign pact: Bosnian Serbs agree to open Tuzla airport for relief flights Bosnian Moslems and Croats reached agreement last night after four days of talks in Washington on plans for a loose federation of the two ethnic groups in the war-torn republic. The breakthrough came on the same day as Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, managed to persuade Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs who is on a visit to Moscow, to allow Tuzla airport to be placed under UN supervision, making it easier to transport aid. In Washington, the Bosnian Moslem-Croat federation was established in a framework deal, which included an outline agreement for a confederation between it and neighbouring Croatia. The accord, signed by Mr Mate Granic, the Croatian foreign minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, and Mr Kresimir Zubak, leader of the Bosnian Croats, creates a federation of cantons with a central government responsible for foreign affairs, national defence and commerce. The president and vice-president will be elected by a two-house legislature with the two ethnic groups alternating yearly in holding the positions. The cantons will have authority over police, education, culture, housing, public services and radio and television. All refugees and displaced people will be guaranteed the right to return to their homes or to be compensated. A deadline of March 15 was set for drafting a constitution for the new state and for completing work on the confederation. While the accord - which leaves details such as military issues still to be resolved - does not address the Serb-held areas of Bosnia, US officials hope it will put further pressure on the Serbs to make peace. The US has offered both carrot and stick to Croatia as an inducement to end the fighting between Croats and Moslems in central Bosnia. While threatening economic sanctions on Croatia, officials have also held out the hope of loans from international financial institutions. In Moscow, Mr Kozyrev hailed the agreement with Mr Karadzic as a 'big step' in a Russian peace initiative launched when President Boris Yeltsin persuaded the Serbs to heed the Nato ultimatum for pulling back heavy artillery from around Sarajevo. After the accord, Russia said: 'This position of the Bosnian Serbs is based on the fact that Russian observers will take part in monitoring the non-military use of (Tuzla) airport.' However, Mr Karadzic admitted the talks had been difficult. The momentum for peace is being reflected on the ground, although with varying degrees of success. Yesterday the International Red Cross secured the release of 400 prisoners in the western city of Mostar, which had been besieged by Croats for several months. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees also resumed aid convoys and humanitarian flights into the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. 'New primitives' drive Serb professionals abroad, Page 2</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL REPORT: SPRING INTO FALL;  </P> <P> SUIT SCOOP  </P> <P> Swimsuits are like ice cream this season. There are almost too many flavors  from which to choose.  </P> <P> The newest Hollywood glamour styles are inspired by the '40s. Athletic looks  are based on surfers' wet suits or competitive swimmers' styles. And the most  unusual are eclectic beach costumes mixing cyclist shorts or unitards with  bikinis, exotic sarongs, ethnic jewelry, elaborate straw hats and high-top  sneakers. The look is anything but store-bought. Like the perfect summer  sundae, you have to make it yourself.  </P></p>

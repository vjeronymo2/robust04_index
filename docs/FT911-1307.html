			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / The FT Interview: Pillar in a world of instability - Manfred Worner, the secretary-general of Nato, speaks to Robert Mauthner Manfred Worner, the 56-year-old Nato secretary-general, is a contented man. After nearly three years in a job requiring more diplomatic than military skills, he positively purrs with pleasure at the satisfaction derived from running a 16-nation alliance in search of a new mission. 'I am fascinated by it.' Far from regretting the days when Nato had the straightforward and well-defined task of defending the west against the aggressive designs of one main adversary, the Soviet Union, Mr Worner finds 'the new challenges' facing the alliance infinitely stimulating. 'When my friend and predecessor, Peter Carrington (Lord Carrington, the former British foreign secretary), passed this job on to me, he said, 'Look, after a few years you will be bored'.' A year later, when the Soviet Union and eastern Europe were on the brink of far-reaching political changes, Lord Carrington had changed his mind. 'If only I had known at the time, I would have stayed on,' he told his successor. In spite of the ending of the cold war, Mr Worner, who as German defence minister in the 1980s was responsible for the controversial deployment of Pershing and cruise missiles in his own country, has not entirely abandoned his erstwhile hardline image. He has no doubt that Nato continues to fulfil an essential defence role even after the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact. 'I think that developments during the last few months have really created a broad consensus that this alliance will be badly needed in the future, of course with changed tasks and with changed structures.' As justification for this view, he offers two examples: the unpredictability of the Soviet Union, given its unstable domestic political and economic situation, coupled with the fact that it still boasts a 'huge military machine'; and the new risks to western security underlined by the recent conflict in the Gulf. 'You see, the real world which we now see developing reflects a phase of history which is primarily dominated by instability.' What is required in such a state of flux is international organisations which can provide stability, he says, warming to his favourite subject. Mr Worner may not be able to claim he is the author of the concept of what he describes as 'interlocking institutions'. But it perfectly suits his purpose of justifying Nato's continued existence by fitting it into a wider international framework of complementary and partly overlapping organisations. Apart from Nato, these include the 34-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), the European Community, the Western European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations. Even as committed an enthusiast as Mr Worner has to admit implicitly that Nato has serious limitations as a security organisation. How, for instance, can one justify the exclusion from Nato of the fledgling democracies in eastern Europe, which have broken off military ties with the Soviet Union, when the organisation's stated objective is to create 'a Europe whole and free?' Why was Nato not more directly involved in the Gulf conflict, given that President Saddam Hussein's policies were widely perceived by alliance members as a serious threat to western interests? The spin the secretary-general puts on his replies to these questions is evidence that he is not entirely happy with the situation. 'They (the eastern Europeans) did not apply for membership,' he says. Strictly speaking that is true, but the reason they did not apply was that it was made clear to them that their applications would be turned down. President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia made it plain in his speech to the Nato Council in March that his country wanted to become a member of the organisation. 'We believe an alliance of countries united by the idea of freedom and democracy should not be forever closed to neighbouring countries that are pursuing the same goals,' Mr Havel said. Yet Mr Worner has a cogent answer to all this. 'We seriously want to build a new security structure which includes the Soviet Union. So what we try to avoid is a counter-productive situation, in which you create not only the impression, but the reality that the Soviet Union is excluded, isolated. 'If you extended the borders of Nato at this very moment to the borders of the Soviet Union, that, I think, would overburden the Soviet leadership, both the political and military.' Where Mr Worner's concept starts to become somewhat confused is when he talks about the relationship between all these 'interlocking institutions'. He appears to want it both ways: some kind of all-European security structure, while preserving Nato's identity and role. He rules out a single European security super-institution. The idea that both the Nato and former Warsaw Pact alliances could eventually merge within the CSCE is considered unrealistic because 34 western and eastern nations with very different interests could never reach a consensus. 'If a real crisis or a threat, or even a war starts, then you need a solid security guarantee, and that can only be given by an alliance like ours.' Even as a convinced 'European', he also adamantly opposes the proposal, dear to the French and to Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, that the EC should have its own independent defence policy. 'There should be no doubt that the (Atlantic) alliance is, and remains, a primary alliance and location for the security of Europe. And that clearly means that all decisions concerning the security of our European member nations must be dealt with in this Atlantic alliance. 'Moreover, if we accept the notion of a European defence identity, it must be done in a way which does not damage the transatlantic relationship, because European security in the foreseeable future is not possible without a military and political commitment of north America to the security of Europe.' Mr Worner nevertheless makes it clear that he strongly favours a 'European pillar' within Nato and that the Western European Union would be an appropriate institution to embody it. The proposal that WEU should act as a bridge between the European Community and Nato appeals to him, as long as its final decisions affecting western defence are always subject to the higher authority and interests of the Atlantic Alliance. Indeed, WEU is at least a partial answer to the other embarrassing dilemma facing the alliance: what to do about 'out-of-area' crises, such as the recent Gulf conflict, which are perceived to threaten western security, but do not fall within the European region covered by the Nato treaty. Mr Worner is in no doubt about the legal situation. Nato security guarantees extend only to the limited geographical area specified in the treaty. 'Of course, the treaty does not prohibit a Nato action out of area if all nations agree.' However, there is no such political consensus on this issue, he says. So what will be the likely future developments on this front? 'I think, as the Gulf war has clearly proved. . . .you can handle such contingencies on a case-by-case basis. Those nations which are prepared to act, act. The others support them.' Nato as a whole could provide logistical support and other assistance, as it did effectively during the Gulf war. At this point, the WEU rabbit is pulled out of the helmet. Some European units assigned to Nato could also be made available to WEU, and be used as a rapid reaction force in out-of-area contingencies where Nato is legally debarred from acting. This idea is gaining ground fast and is likely to be explored further in Nato's strategic and military review, due to be submitted to a Nato summit in the autumn. Mr Worner does not say so in so many words, but it would save Nato's face. For it can only survive effectively if it adapts its political and defence strategy to tomorrow's crises and wars, rather than yesterday's.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1934     Born in Stuttgart.

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Emerging over the long term - At a Glance EMERGING markets in Latin America, Asia and Europe have underperformed major markets over the past one and five years, but emerging markets funds have done better than developed markets funds, according to a report on global emerging markets by Fund Research. Emerging funds grew by an average of 214.3 per cent over five years, compared to 40.3 per cent for developed markets funds. Fund Research attributes this success to lower portfolio turnover ratios and the longer term views of managers in this sector. 'Emerging markets fund managers, almost without exception, adopt a consistent, long term approach in what they recognise are volatile markets,' Fund Research says.</p>

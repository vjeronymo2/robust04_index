			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik by Pavol </F> Minarik; place and date not given: "We Are Going To Search for  Friends Abroad, Not Invent Enemies"]    [Text] [Minarik] What are you going to do to prevent the  situation in Slovakia from becoming dangerous?    [Moravcik] We are going to continue the political style we  have decided to adopt. This means to search for constructive  solutions to the problems and to try to reach consensus with a  wide spectrum of political parties. The existence of all our  government is based on this principle. Some of the circles on  the domestic scene, however, would like to hear declarations  oriented toward the radicalization of the events. In my  opinion, there is only one way: not to react to nonsense.  Regarding foreign countries, we are going to search for friends  there. We are not going to invent enemies.    [Minarik] Slovakia is once again at a crossroads. What  direction is it going to follow?    [Moravcik] We said it, in no uncertain terms, in our policy  statement. We are going to try to integrate ourselves in  traditional European economic, political, and security  structures. Regarding the attitude toward the state, we want to  renew the trust of the people in state institutions and to  increase people's feeling of security. This will not be easy.  We have recorded an obvious increase in the crime rate. We are  not likely to be able to eliminate this trend, but we would like  to improve the number of solved cases. We are interested in an  efficient functioning of our administration, which is to serve  the people. We also want to stress the importance of individual  initiative not only in the economic sphere, but also in the  social one. This means that we are considering giving the  nonstate organizations, including various foundations, room for  activity in the social sphere. We are also going to push for a  bill on conflicts of interest.    [Minarik] Last week, parliament approved the policy  statement, but the new Cabinet does not have enough time left.  What should you concentrate on?    [Moravcik] In the economy, we have to concentrate on  budgetary discipline. We are going to try to solve, in a more  consistent manner, the insolvency of our enterprises, which is a  drawn-out problem of our economy. We believe privatization is  very important.    In its policy statement, the government has unequivocally  indicated that it has the political will to prepare the second  wave of coupon privatization, so that it might take place  immediately after the elections in the fall. We want  denationalization to become part of our overall economic  strategy.    [Minarik] Are you aware of the risks your government is  taking on?    [Moravcik] A government cabinet that has a limited time span  for its existence, such as our Cabinet, cannot ignore risks.  However, there are also some advantages. That is, the  government is forced to adopt very tough attitudes toward  fulfilling its tasks. I have the impression that we will be  able to solve certain long-term problems, particularly in the  economy. We will have to intervene in the tax system in a way  that will affect taxpayers. Certain spending from the budget  will have to be reduced, which also is a risk factor.    [Minarik] Are you not afraid that such steps will have a  negative impact on your further political career?    [Moravcik] That is irrelevant.    [Minarik] Former Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]  members who were in the government before are now acting as a  shadow cabinet. How do you view their activity and their  declaration that you are a government of broad corruption and  trained poodles?    [Moravcik] We are carefully watching everything the  opposition is saying about us, including the shadow cabinet. We  are going to try to find something positive, if possible, that  could help solve some of our problems. Anyway, from this  viewpoint, the opposition is always important because, if they  are efficient and constructive, they should point to certain  aspects that the government cannot see. Unfortunately, we have  not discovered stimuli in the declarations of Meciar's shadow  cabinet that would make us change our attitude.    [Minarik] How is the right-left government of the center  managing to govern? On what basis do you reach consensus?    [Moravcik] I will be sincere: In the course of the  discussions at the government meetings, it is difficult to tell  who is the left wing and who the right. The coalition has the  advantage that it can concentrate fully on solving problems.  There has never been a confrontation of the left- and  right-wing concepts. Of course, it is more difficult to reach  consensus when there are more entities involved. No stumbling  blocks have appeared yet, however.    [Minarik] What chances do you give to your Cabinet after the  elections in the fall?    [Moravcik] We are building on the fact that we are going to  convince the electorate that our viewpoint and our policy  represent an alternative for Slovakia, which alternative is  acceptable to the majority or them. Otherwise, we would hardly  be able to manage all our problems. I believe that this Cabinet  has a chance to function even after the elections.    [Minarik] Many people in Slovakia are balancing on the edge  of the sustenance level. They are ill-behaved voters because  they want an immediate solution.    [Moravcik] We want to make the transformation process as  socially acceptable as possible. This will be very demanding,  but we must do everything not to increase the number of people  living below the subsistence level. I admit, however, that this  is one of the most important problems this government has to  solve.    [Minarik] You are one of the people who knew Vladimir  Meciar well. Is his position in Slovak politics being demonized?    [Moravcik] Maybe it is. To tell the truth, I do not have  time to think about it too much. I believe that a positive  program can become an alternative [for Slovakia]. If a certain  part of society--we will try to make this part as large as  possible--realizes that there are several alternatives and  possibilities and that there are different political entities  that can efficiently execute their powers, is it possible that  the public will positively appreciate such personalities?    [Minarik] Your predecessors from Meciar's cabinet have not  properly handed over their offices to the members of your  government. We have even heard about empty shelves in certain  ministries. How have you solved this problem?    [Moravcik] Several weeks have elapsed since then. All this  is rather grotesque. No unsurmountable obstacles have arisen as  a consequence of this.    [Minarik] Why did the HZDS have difficulties governing in  Slovakia?    [Moravcik] I did not think about it in any specific way. If  we wanted to point to the core of the problem, we would speak  about something the public has already forgotten and what I  pointed to when I was expelled from the HZDS. They have adopted  two attitudes in politics. The first is exclusivity. Only the  HZDS is able to govern in Slovakia. The second is the  confrontational character of their politics. I believe that, if  the HZDS does not change its policy in both points, it may be  led to the fringe of the political scene and become an extremist  party.</p>

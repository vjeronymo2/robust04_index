			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Sport: Australia's shrinking violets - Rugby League; Britain and Australia meet today in the World Cup final. Kevin Brown, in Sydney, and John Hopkins assess the two sides TIMID Australian sportsmen are about as common as possums in Pontypool. So why are London and Sydney suddenly crowded with shrinking violets talking down Australia's chances in today's Rugby League World Cup final at Wembley? Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton set the tone before leaving for London, warning that Australia's 2-1 victory in the Ashes series earlier this year was no guide to form for the World Cup. 'Great Britain should be favourites. We haven't got much in our favour. If we don't win at Wembley, our Ashes success won't mean the same. In football, people have short memories,' Fulton moaned. It doesn't seem to matter who you talk to. Kangaroos captain Mal Meninga and experienced second rower Bob Lindner both warn that Australia will have their work cut out to beat Great Britain. Back in Australia, some of the experts are going even further. 'If I had to put up my money I'd back the Poms,' 1988 World Cup star Wayne Pearce told fans in Brisbane yesterday. More is at stake than just the World Cup. Australia have towered over international rugby league since 1970, the last time Great Britain won an Ashes series. But they have never led the all-time league table. This year's Ashes games left Australia and Great Britain with 52 wins each since the first Test in 1908. A Kangaroos victory would justify Australian claims that Sydney is now the centre of world rugby league. So are the wily Australians serious, or are they trying to disarm the despised Poms before sending out another team of fast-moving giants to take the trophy back to Sydney, its home since 1975? Fulton is clearly concerned about the long lay-off enjoyed by the players since the end of the domestic season in September. Easy tour matches against mediocre opposition like Sheffield, Huddersfield and Cumbria will have done little to restore match fitness. And taking a break does affect performance: the world club championship, played in the Australian off-season, has never been won by an Australian side, in spite of Australia's dominance at international level. Secondly, Australia's pre-eminence over the last 22 years has encouraged a focus on the domestic game, prompting many Australians to rate the local Winfield Cup competition ahead of international games. Some commentators fear the Kangaroos may not be hungry enough to win. But the real cause of Australian caution is recent results, which suggest that playing standards in other countries may be catching up, perhaps heralding the end of Australia's long period of dominance. The first crack in the facade appeared in 1991, when Australia unexpectedly lost 24-8. in Melbourne in the first of a three match series against New Zealand. More seriously, Australia were thrashed 33-10 by Great Britain in June in the second Ashes Test, again in Melbourne. For perhaps the first time two decades, the British made the Australians look ordinary. Significantly, the match was played in the kind of soft conditions the Australians are likely to face at Wembley. Australia won the series after victories in Sydney and Brisbane, but no-one who saw the Sydney Test will forget the electrifying sight of Martin Offiah twice getting away on the left wing, each time denied a try by the narrowest touch of boot on sideline. Offiah's chances of escaping today must be improved by the absence of the the injured Andrew Ettingshausen, the top class full back who forced him into touch on both occasions. But as successive British tourists have discovered, the structure of the modern game in Australia produces teams which are very hard to beat. The Winfield Cup has expanded and strengthened considerably since 1980, and now includes teams from Queensland, Canberra and provincial New South Wales as well as Sydney. The gradual enlargement of the competition has increased the pool of top players and coaches available to the national side, and helped the game maintain its dominance among Australia's four football codes, at least in the core rugby league states of New South Wales and Queensland. Ominously for British fans, the strengthening process is likely to accelerate in the next couple of years, when the competition will be expanded to include Auckland in New Zealand, adding all the emotions of international football to the weekly league programme. Like their British counterparts, Australian coaches put a lot of emphasis on commitment, physical fitness and tough tackling. But the dry sun-baked grounds also encourage speed and ball handling skills which are harder to develop in the freezing dampness of English winters. The Australians have benefitted over the last few years from the inspirational captaincy of two outstanding players who epitomise all these qualities: 'King' Wally Lewis from 1984 to 1990, and latterly Meninga, Australia's most capped player and record scorer with 250 points. Meninga's success in replacing the legendary Lewis has played a big part in keeping Australia at the top of the rugby league tree, but it places a huge responsibility on him in the final. If Meninga and Allan Langer fire on the Wembley turf Australia's weasel words over the last few days are likely to be quickly forgotten. If they do not, all the advance excuses are unlikely to protect Fulton and his men from a raucous reception back in Sydney.</p>

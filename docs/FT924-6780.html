			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Chrysler in Dollars 2bn deal with bank CHRYSLER, the US vehicle manufacturer, is to sell nearly all the consumer and inventory financing businesses and assets of its Chrysler First subsidiary to Nationsbank, the fourth largest banking company in the US. Chrysler said the net proceeds from the sale were expected to be more than Dollars 2bn and would approximate to carrying value. Nationsbank said the purchase price represented a premium of about Dollars 100m. Chrysler indicated some time ago it wanted to sell these businesses as part of a plan to reduce the indebtedness of its financial services business and to ensure that this had enough funds to support its core operation - financing the sale of vehicles. Nationsbank said the proposed deal would increase its consumer finance business eight-fold and make it the second largest US consumer finance company owned by a bank holding company. It will form a new consumer finance business as a result of the deal, to be called Nationscredit. Chrysler First, based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, services receivables of about Dollars 4bn and operates in 175 locations in 32 states. Nationsbank's financial services unit has some Dollars 500m in consumer finance receivables and 105 offices in 10 states. Chrysler First's consumer finance operations range from home mortgages to private label credit cards, while the inventory finance division provides financial services for private label manufacturers and distributors and high technology equipment dealers. The deal does not include Chrysler First's business credit operation, which deals in commercial property loans. Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of the most aggressively acquisitive super-regional banks in the US.</p>

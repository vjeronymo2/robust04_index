			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] As was reported earlier, President Askar Akayev  received Pakistan's Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Riaz Mohammad Khan  on 21 June. [passage omitted]    The Pakistani ambassador presented his credentials to the  president of Kyrgyzstan.    [Begin Akayev recording] Esteemed ambassador, I am pleased  to  receive your credentials on this important day and congratulate  you sincerely on the occasion of your appointment as ambassador  of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to Kyrgyzstan. You  represent the country with a centuries-old unique history and  rich culture, which gained its independence in 1947 and achieved  great success on this path. The founder of the state Mohammad  Ali Jinnah [the first governor general of Pakistan] saw Pakistan  as a democratic state and [word indistinct] where the ideas of  humanity and equality have been embodied in the [word  indistinct] state institutions. A great many of Pakistan's  leaders dedicated their lives to that, among whom we can name  Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and the current Prime Minister of Pakistan  Benazir Bhutto, and of course the president of Pakistan.  Today's event is an important stage for Kyrgyzstan and  Pakistan. Pakistan is one of our closest neighbors and we  cooperate within the framework of different international  organizations, including the Organization for Economic  Cooperation, the Islamic Conference Organization, and on a  bilateral basis. Representatives from different ministries and  departments of our countries have established their first but  very promising contacts. The fact of Pakistan granting us a  credit worth $10 million last year was an important stage in our  relations. It was channelled for the development of health care  of Kyrgyzstan.    Dear ambassador, by accrediting you as the first ambassador  of Pakistan to Kyrgyzstan, we give a new impetus to  Kyrgyzstan-Pakistan cooperation today, which I believe could  become mutually beneficial and fruitful in future and serve the  purpose of strengthening peace, stability and security in our  region. To sum up, I would like to assure you, Mr. Mohammad  Khan, that you can count on full support from me and the  Government of Kyrgyzstan in fulfilling your historic mission.  [end recording]</p>

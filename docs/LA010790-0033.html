			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHADOW OF A DOUBT  </P> <P> Maybe we jump to conclusions too quickly without carefully thinking about the  possible damage to the accused, if innocent.  </P> <P> But our intentions are to save the children and catch the guilty. It would not  be easy to take the standpoint I am taking now if it were my child that was  molested. I feel sorry for the accused, also for the parents of the child, and  for the child, who will be damaged for the rest of her life. And I am hateful  for the guilty who are still out there hurting more and more innocent victims.  </P> <P> CHELSEY CHAMPION  </P> <P> Encinitas  </P></p>

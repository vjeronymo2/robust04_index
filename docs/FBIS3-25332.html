			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] must win the  April election in South Africa to prevent the "Boers" and the  "Casspirs" [armored vehicles] from returning to Owambo to renew  their fight against the inhabitants. This "revelation" was made  this past week by Mr. Sam Nujoma at Okahao in the Omusati region  when he addressed inhabitants during the opening of the new  Rurtel telecommunications project. At the official launch of  the project he deviated from his speech and said that SWAPO  [South-West African People's Organization] is prepared "to cross  the Orange River with weapons to bury the minority government in  Pretoria." He then used the occasion as a platform to collect  donations for the ANC and to request Namibians to donate money,  goats, sheep, cattle, fowls, clothes, necklaces, earrings,  peanuts, and mahangu [expansion unknown] for the ANC, to ensure  the fall of the "settlers" [preceding word in English].    According to him Friday's [4 February] activities coincided  with the end of SWAPO's solidarity week with the "suppressed and  suffering" people of South Africa. The solidarity week was  announced in Windhoek by President Nujoma on the 27 January and  ended on Friday. Mr. Nujoma disqualified the SWAPO government  as an impartial observer of South Africa's transitional process.  "SWAPO cannot be neutral," he said. "We are right behind the  suppressed people of South Africa, under the ANC leadership."  According to Mr. Nujoma, SWAPO has achieved its goal. "It has  committed itself to fighting alongside other African  nationalists for the liberation of their respective countries."  He said that South Africa is presently being suppressed by  "settlers". "We will fight against them. We will even cross  the Orange River with weapons to fight the Boers. We can do it."    The president apparently reconsidered a few moments later  and  added: "It is not necessary anymore to cross the Orange River  with weapons to end apartheid. It is just expected of us to  give whatever we have to the ANC because elections will be held  on the 26, 27, and 28 April. We, mostly SWAPO members, have a  duty to perform and I want everyone present to give something.  If you do not have money, give a fowl, give a mahangu, give  peanuts. Ngandjeras do grow peanuts for a living. Women, go and  fetch all the peanuts in your grain elevators and give it to the  ANC. Give a goat, give a sheep, give cattle. I know that the  chief of the Ongandjera has already donated a cow. I know  people have been affected by the drought. Cattle have died and  goats also, but if you don't have anything else bring your  necklaces, earrings, watches, and rings. The fowl, the goat,  the sheep -- bring it directly here. The ANC representative  should not leave empty-handed. We want to see the Boers in  South Africa fall."    The ANC local representative sharing the platform with Mr.  Nujoma applauded.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Bush draws up plan for inner cities: President will veto any bill with compensatory tax increases PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday announced a six-point Dollars 3bn-plus (Pounds 1.6bn) programme to relieve conditions in America's inner cities, but said he would veto any bill that included a compensatory tax increase. Speaking before a meeting with congressional leaders, Mr Bush was unable to put a sum on the cost of his proposals, which appeared mostly an amalgam of long-standing administration policies. Some exist in pilot form, some may be implemented by bureaucratic fiat and some require new legislation, but none had been a priority before the Los Angeles riots two weeks ago. The six points are: Expanding the Weed and Seed programme, designed to increase law enforcement and targeted social efforts in high-crime areas. Expanding home ownership for those in public housing. The creation of federal enterprise zones. Encouraging greater choice in public education. Allowing those on welfare to have savings of up to Dollars 10,000, 10 times the current limit, before becoming ineligible for welfare support. Job training, specifically the expansion of a youth apprentice scheme. Later, White House officials, while conceding the imprecision of some of their hurriedly compiled sums, gave a rough cost breakdown. The enterprise zone bill, consisting of tax breaks for inner-city investors, might come to Dollars 1.5bn; home ownership provisions about Dollars 1bn, up from Dollars 361m in the current budget; Dollars 500m for the Weed and Seed programme, now only in pilot form; and nearly Dollars 700m for job training. Emergency assistance to Los Angeles already amounts to about Dollars 600m, while unemployment insurance claims are likely to top Dollars 2bn. These, however, are covered under existing laws. With an eye on the November election, Mr Bush emphasised his opposition to tax increases to finance additional spending. 'The idea that you have to raise taxes at this time, when the economy is starting to recover, I'm sorry, I will not support that,' he said. Congressional reaction was guarded. Mr George Mitchell, Senate majority leader, promised co-operation with the president, but 'I don't promise we will enact precisely everything he proposes'. Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House, said it would be worthwhile looking at transferring funds from the defence budget.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japanese Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii confirmed Friday some bright spots in consumption  to support his assessment of the increasing chances of an  economic recovery.    "The advent of demand for repurchases of durable consumer  goods is expected," Fujii said in a fiscal policy address  explaining economic issues and the fiscal 1994 budget package to  a plenary session of the House of Representatives.    He added that phrase to an otherwise similar economic  assessment to that made in his fiscal address to the House of  Councillors in mid-February.    The latest statistics, led by the Bank of Japan's quarterly  "Tankan" business sentiment survey, have pointed to recovering  consumption in such durable goods as refrigerators and washing  machines.    Fujii reiterated that the economy remains "tough in personal  consumption and capital investment."    But "the time is steadily ripening for a recovery," he  repeated, citing the new bright signs along with "progressing  inventory and capital stock adjustments amid support from public  investment and housing construction."    Fujii said the government has launched a record 15.25  trillion yen stimulus package, including 6 trillion yen in tax  cuts, to "swell those recovery buds and move the economy toward  full-fledged recovery as soon as possible in fiscal 1994 and  ensure a stable growth in and after fiscal 1995."    He reiterated his "confidence" that the package, along with  the recently enacted third fiscal 1993 supplementary budget and  the fiscal 1994 budget submitted to the lower house, would  "greatly contribute to a full-fledged recovery by clearing  uncertainties ahead and encouraging a pick-up in domestic demand  led by personal consumption."    On the monetary side, Fujii did not spell out any need for  further policy measures, saying he hopes the effects of past  policy measures will "spread further."    "Various interest rates have declined sharply...as a result  of the latest round of official discount rate cuts" to a record  low 1.75 percent, Fujii added.    Touching on the issue of full tax reforms for permanent  income tax cuts, he stressed the government would pursue an  agreement reached by the ruling coalition leaders to enact a  reform law by the end of year in line with a "balanced tax  system in income, assets and consumption."    Fujii reiterated he would take "timely and appropriate"  measures to stem speculative movements "as seen recently" and  keep stable currency rates reflecting economic fundamentals.    He stressed Japan's active contribution to global  development  and called for international policy cooperation through meetings  of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven  leading nations and a gathering later this month in Hawaii of  finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) forum.    But Fujii did not offer any new measures to curb Japan's  huge  trade surplus.    On the global economy, he said, "some signs of a recovery  can  be seen, but they are not yet indicating a strong growth."    Among the leading nations, "efforts are necessary for  economic restructuring with structural problems such as huge  fiscal deficits and high unemployment."</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Sport: Indulging in memoraborgia - Tennis FROM THE start it was Mission Impossible. Whoever he had played in the first round in Monte Carlo on Tuesday, Bjorn Borg would have lost. Yet I take no pleasure from having forecast the defeat of the former world champion at the hands of the 26-year-old Spaniard, Jordi Arrese, who has never been ranked higher than 28. After all, it was not difficult to see that a man of 34 who has not played a tennis match for eight years and is using a wooden tennis racket cannot expect to compete on level terms with a tournament-tough pro wielding a graphite frame. The fact that Bjorn, in his prime, was arguably the greatest match player ever counts for nothing. During Borg's eight-year absence the game's equipment has improved. So have the players. They are bigger, fitter and faster than tennis players have ever been. Thanks to modern technology men like Agassi, Sampras and Ivanisevic can hit the ball much harder than ever before. This makes for more excitement on slower courts but shortens the rallies and diminishes the spectacle on fast surfaces. The men's game has become more physical, less subtle, though the women's game has benefited by making winners easier and reducing tedious rallies. I can understand why Bjorn is attempting a come-back, and believe him when he says it has nothing to do with money. His complicated private life has certainly not brought much happiness. How natural, then, that he should seek that elusive commodity in the arena where he was once supreme. Revealingly, he said this week how great it felt to walk out to a tumultuous welcome and to perform again for his public. What Bjorn will discover, however, is that it is not much fun losing. He never had much practice at that. Yet if he were prepared to set his sights a bit lower he would discover a world of opportunity. Today's 35-and-over circuit is growing fast and although the prizemoney is relatively modest, men like Stan Smith, Bob Lutz, Ilie Nastase, Roger Taylor and John Lloyd enjoy themselves and provide wonderful entertainment. Whatever Bjorn decides to do, I, for one, hope that he opts for the junior veterans' tour next year. Anyway, his reappearance offers me the excuse to indulge in a little memoraborgia: Nice 1971 - Lennart Bergelin shouting his head off. This is a crisis. Unless the 14-year-old Borg can be dragged off the practice court to join the rest of the Swedish junior team in the bus, they will all miss their dinner. Wimbledon 1972 - Bjorn wins the junior event by recovering from 2-5 in the final set to beat Britain's Buster Mottram 7-5. In these columns I wrote: '. . . clearly the Swedish boy is a match player of some class but, from the way he hits the ball, he is unlikely to be of much account on grass.' At the time, everyone agreed] Wimbledon final 1976 - Wondering how Bjorn could serve as well as he was doing against Nastase when he was having to apply a cold spray to a damaged stomach muscle at each change of ends. His serve, not his groundstrokes, was the cornerstone of this first of five Wimbledon successes. Wimbledon final 1980 - Marvelling at the quality of Bjorn's serving in the final set of a memorable final against John McEnroe who had saved five match points in winning the 4th set tie-break 18-16. Borg wins Wimbledon for the last time: 1-6 7-5 6-3 6-7 8-6. It was a fitting climax to a glorious career. That is how I shall remember him.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for water heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next two most stringent standard levels, 7 and 6, are projected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> save 45.85 and 44.39 quads of energy, respectively. However, these levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also produce life-cycle cost increases for gas water heaters compared to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base case with payback of 11.2 and 10.1 years, which are more than two thirds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the average product lifetime. The first cost of electric water heaters at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these levels is quadrupled from the base case and manufacturer short-run  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return on equity is reduced from 0.4 percent to negative 18.1 and negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17.1 percent, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standards level 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 6 for water heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects these standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next most stringent standard level is standard level 5. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level is projected to save 34.98 quads of energy. However, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level also produces a life-cycle cost increase for gas water heaters compared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the base case, with a payback of 10.1 years, which is more than two thirds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the average product lifetime.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for water heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects this standard level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Appliance Energy Conservation Act_imposed 1990 standard for water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters with standard level 4. The Department concludes that standard level 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for water heaters saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible and economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 34.87 quads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environment by reducing the emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 5,336,000 tons and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5,890,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 2.77 and 2.72 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 2,845 million tons, or as much as 2.93 percent, over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forecast period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer payback of this standard level is 2.0 and 3.5 years for electric and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas water heaters, respectively. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all classes and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $1,025 and $31 for electric and gas water heaters, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the standard is expected to double the prototypical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's long-run return on equity from 0.4 to 0.8 percent even though  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the short-run return on equity is projected to drop to negative 3.5 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as stated previously, the Department believes that the requirement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat pumps for electric water heaters will cause other manufacturers, with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stronger financial characteristics of room air conditioner manufacturers, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be drawn into the mix of manufacturers offering electric water heating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. The Department believes that this mix of manufacturers would have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive return on equity compared to that projected for existing water heater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that establishing a standard for electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters that essentially requires the use of heat pumps is a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change for consumers and manufacturers. However, heat pump water heaters are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not a technology that has to be developed; the product already exists in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketplace. Additionally, the projected energy savings are very large and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the forecasted benefits appear to outweigh the burdens. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnitude of some of the changes, such as in first cost and product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing, could make questionable some of the assumptions contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the analysis and may warrant closer scrutiny. For example, as reported in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Support Document, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Model's computation of appliance turnover rate, i.e., the repair or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace decision, is based on industry data about historical annual shipments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and does not explicitly consider the effects of increased first cost. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increase in first cost could distort this model. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes, however, that water heaters are typically replaced because of tank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaks which, because of design features such as glass-lined tanks and foamed-in-place insulation, are essentially non-repairable. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that the impacts on the replacement rate, because of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial increase in first cost, is likely to be small. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> welcomes comment on this assumption and other areas where it might be thought  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the magnitude of the first cost increase or manufacturing changes might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warrant additional or revised modeling assumptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

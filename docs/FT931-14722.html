			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Wolters Kluwer acquires leading Swedish publisher WOLTERS Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, has acquired Liber, Sweden's second largest publishing house, from a group of Swedish institutional shareholders, in a move designed partly to serve as a springboard for expansion into other Scandinavian markets. The acquisition will be paid for in cash but no further financial details were disclosed yesterday. However, Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals group which owned 28 per cent of Liber, said it would make a capital gain of SKr350m (Dollars 48.3m) on its investment, while Nordic Capital, with 20 per cent, said its capital gain would be SKr200m. Other Swedish institutions sold stakes of 20 per cent or less. Liber, which generated 1992 sales of SKr1.3bn and employs a workforce of 850, is estimated to have up to 60 per cent of Sweden's textbook market. It is also active in legal and information publishing. The acquisition is the first by Wolters Kluwer in Scandinavia and gives it access to its eighth national market in Europe. The purchase will also mean that non-Dutch activities represent around 63 per cent of Wolters Kluwer's business, surpassing a target of 60 per cent which the company had originally hoped to achieve in 1994. Wolters Kluwer, which is also active in the US, had sales of Fl 2.3bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in 1992. Mr Cornelis Brakel, a member of Wolters Kluwer's board, described the Liber deal as a 'springboard for possible activities and acquisitions in Norway, Finland and Denmark'. He said that the Swedish company could teach other Wolters Kluwer companies about their expertise in educational publishing, while Liber itself would benefit from the Dutch group's legal and fiscal publishing experience in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany. Wolters Kluwer remained interested in further acquisitions, particularly in countries that will eventually join the European Community, he said. Wessanen, the Dutch foods group, is negotiating to buy Fastfood International (FFI), which has a Fl 165m turnover and employs 550. FFI makes and markets frozen foods, mainly for sale in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.</p>

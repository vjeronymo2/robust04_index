			<p>BFN     [Text] On the second day of a two-day seminar held to study  polices of global arrogance in Bosnia and Muslim countries, Mr.  Rowhani, the first deputy speaker of the Islamic Majles, in a  speech referring to the political games played by Europe and the  United States during recent developments in Bosnia, said:  Thanks to the plots hatched by these countries, Russia was  dragged into the arena, and in fact they played a political  trick on Russia.    He added: On the whole the West believes that the Serbs  should not only remain but should not be weakened either. And  the Muslims should remain in the region too, but as a weak and  scattered group that has to depend on daily assistance from  Europe and the United States in all fields.    Rowhani described cooperation among Islamic countries as  very  significant for the future of the region's Muslims. He went on:  The Islamic Republic of Iran, in accordance with instructions of  the esteemed leader and on the basis of its Islamic and  revolutionary obligation, is determined to provide every  assistance required and will continue its aid more than ever  before.    In conclusion, the participants issued a resolution asking  all governments of the Islamic world, and particularly the  Islamic Republic of Iran, to demonstrate the power of Islam once  again by imposing sanctions against those who support the Serbs  overtly and covertly. Also in this resolution the participants  at the seminar announced readiness for any cooperation --  including military, medical, and cultural cooperation -- so as  to safeguard the entity of the Islamic land of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

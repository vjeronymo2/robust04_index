			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: German equity culture German private investors are almost pathologically disinclined to invest in equities, so any step to reverse this is welcome. Reducing the nominal value of shares from DM50 to DM5 - a move now under active consideration by Allianz and Dresdner Bank - will help. Though it will not alter the fundamental attractions of German shares, it will slash their high market prices. Dealing will become less unwieldy as a result. Only 6 per cent of German households own shares, compared with more than 20 per cent in the UK or US. Share splits will not make share-owning popular overnight. Two factors point to changes ahead. First, the past year's poor performance of bonds may drive more investors into equities. Second, the forthcoming Deutsche Telekom privatisation will require the government to whip up enthusiasm for shares. Professional investors will not swallow the whole issue and the government may need to stimulate demand with tax breaks for equities. German companies could also do more to create value for shareholders. Allianz, though at the vanguard of the move to lower denomination shares, is behind on the shareholder value front. The DM20bn it has spent in the past four years on acquisitions have probably earned less than if the cash had been left in the money market. Even allowing for its deep discount rights issues, Allianz's shares are down nearly a quarter against the market over the period.</p>

Arbatova, M. Reeben, A. Koestner, Tallinn </F> Engineering University and Chemical and Biological Physics  Institute at Estonian Republic's Academy of Sciences, Tallinn;  UDC 577.122]    [Abstract] The unique ability of cyclodextrin  glycosyl-transferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) to form  cyclodextrins--carbohydrate macrocyclical compounds--from starch  and the high commercial and research value of cyclodextrins  prompted an attempt to produce and characterize antibodies to  the Bacillus macerans CGTase without known monoclonal  antibodies to this enzyme. It is noted that poly- and monoclonal  antibodies to CGTase may be used for detecting small quantities  of enzyme, even in complex mixtures, and for enzymatic inactive  studies of the CGTase molecular structure, comparative  immunology analyses of CGtases of various bacteria species, and  for specific enzyme immobilization on a solid carrier, making it  possible to screen a broad range of microorganisms which are  likely CGTase producers. To this end, a Bacillus  macerans BKMB-506 strain with the culturing liquid was  obtained from the national microorganism collection of the  Microorganism Biochemistry and Physiology Institute at the USSR  Academy of Sciences. The experimental procedure is outlined. The  production and cloning of the hybridoma-producing antibodies to  CGTase, the production of large quantities of MCAs and their  purification, the production of MCAs conjugated with horse  radish peroxidase, studies involving indirect, direct, and  sandwich enzymatic immunoassay analyses (IFA), the  classification of MCA subtypes, and immunoblotting of the 5B1  clone (one of 15 positive clones) are described in detail. The  purified enzyme was used to immunize BALB/c line mice; as a  result, MCAs and 15 different hybridoma which produce MCAs to  CGTase are successfully produced for the first time. The MCA and  polyserum interaction with alkalophilic B. macerans  CGTase is examined. The MCA to the 5B1 clone recognizes both  native and denatured B. macerans CGTase forms.  Moreover, the CGTase dimer molecule has two closely positioned  epitopes recognized by antigens to the 5B1 clone. Figures 3;  references 17: 3 Russian, 14 Western.</p>

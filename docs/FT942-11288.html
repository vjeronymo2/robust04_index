			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / People: Foreign policy expert joins Morgan Grenfell Sir Rodric Braithwaite, 61, the former foreign policy adviser to Britain's prime minister, has found a City job. He has been appointed a senior adviser to Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank owned by Deutsche Bank. Sir Rodric, right, who is also on the European advisory board of ICL, is one of the diplomatic service's most experienced figures, with 37 years notched up, including serving as ambassador in Moscow during the difficult years of 1988 to 1992. Although he has spent time in Rome, Brussels and Washington, it is Sir Rodric's Russian expertise which will be most useful to Morgan Grenfell; he is fluent in Russian. He is expected to spend about three days a week on bank business. The merchant bank has been a major player in Eastern Europe for many years. It was the first UK merchant bank to open an office in Moscow (in 1977) and has arranged over 90 per cent of the export credits to the former Soviet Union. More recently, it has completed the first limited recourse financing for an oil project in Russia, and is also advising British Gas and Agip on the Dollars 6bn Karachaganak gas field development in Kazakhstan. Whereas most merchant banks tend to recruit ex-diplomats as non-executive directors, Morgan Grenfell prefers to hire them as advisers. Last year, Morgan recruited Sir John Whitehead, a former ambassador to Tokyo. This latest appointment, of Sir Rodric, will bring the bank's total of special advisers to four.</p>

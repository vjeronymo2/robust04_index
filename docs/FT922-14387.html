			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report BASE METALS prices closed lower across the board yesterday. But trading was described as 'routine' and the falls were generally marginal. The exception was the tin market, which saw a continued reversal of the cash premium established in the middle of last week in response to near term supply worries. The cash position closed at Dollars 5,730 a tonne, down Dollars 30 from Friday, and its discount against three months metal widened to Dollars 7.50. Five days earlier it had held a Dollars 30 premium. The cash COPPER price closed at Pounds 1,285 a tonne, down Pounds 4.50 on the day, after being lifted early in the day by concern about the situation in Peru after President Fujimori's dissolution of the congress. Peru is an important exporter of copper, as well as ZINC, which was also boosted early on, only to slip back with the other metals. The cash price closed at Dollars 1,268 a tonne, down Dollars 5 on balance. At the London bullion market GOLD and PLATINUM prices drifted lower but SILVER was buoyed by the Peruvian news. Dealers said the platinum market was belatedly responding to a forecast of increased Russian shipments. Compiled from Reuters</p>

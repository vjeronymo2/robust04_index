			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Accounts bodies' merger supported The controversial Bishop proposals for the restructuring of the accountancy profession yesterday won support from surveys of two of the leading representative bodies. Research by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales showed that 73 per cent of its members were in favour of merging some of the six professional bodies. In order to achieve reorganisation, 58 per cent were willing to share the respected title of 'chartered accountant'. The strongest opposition came from recently qualified members under 35. The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants will publish a survey on Monday showing that 90 per cent of its members want to see a reduction in the number of bodies. A similar proportion want the negotiations under the committee chaired by Mr David Bishop to continue. Both surveys, while indicating support for ending the confusion and rivalry between the six bodies, point to some obstacles ahead. Mr Roger Lawson, president of the chartered institute, said the concerns of younger members needed to be considered. 'They are looking for further reassurance, particularly in the area of education and training, before they will willingly share the title of chartered accountant,' he said. The management accountants' survey shows that 74 per cent want to make sure the audit profession does not dominate management accounting in any new institute. And 59 per cent said they would wish to be called chartered management accountants after restructuring.</p>

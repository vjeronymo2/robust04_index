			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> POWAY WINS; OG PITCHER SETS NO-HIT RECORD  </P> <P> It was the bottom of the first -- which in itself was a bit twisted,  considering the visiting team was batting -- and Chula Vista Coach Dick Barcus  was yelling at his hitters not to swing at Poway pitcher Danny Miller's  breaking pitch.  </P> <P> "That's the only pitch he's going to get us out with. He's not going to get us  out with the fastball, so wait for it," Barcus barked.  </P> <P> Perhaps his players didn't listen. Because six innings later, Miller had struck  out 11 Spartans, four with that breaking pitch, a split-finger "fastball." He  had allowed only two hits. And Poway went on to win, 8-0, in a Hilltop-Moose  tournament game at Poway.  </P> <P> "He was just trying to get to me," said Miller (1-0). "I tried not to listen to  what he was saying."  </P> <P> Barcus seemingly wasn't offering the best advice, anyway. Guess that's why they  call it chatter. Miller was as impressive with his fastball as he was with his  split-finger pitch.  </P> <P> "I like to think my fastball is my authority pitch," Miller said. "But I like  to throw off-speed stuff to keep them off balance."  </P> <P> Miller has now struck out 19 batters in 14 innings and has allowed only five  hits and one run.  </P> <P> As far as offense goes, Poway (3-0-1) scored two in the first, both on  ground-ball outs, and did not get to Chula Vista starter Jason Cross again  until the sixth when they pushed across two more runs thanks to a two-run  single from Rob Plarski.  </P> <P> The Titans scored four more times in the seventh on just two hits as pitchers  Chris Montelongo and Art Castro combined to walk four batters and hit another.  </P> <P> As to why the visiting Spartans were batting second: The game was originally  scheduled for Chula Vista, but renovation work on the field there caused the  switch to Poway.

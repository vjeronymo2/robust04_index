			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Companies warm to Fids - The latest dividend fad Some shareholders may look back with nostalgia to the days when a dividend was a just dividend. After being treated to enhanced scrip dividends last year many are now being offered a new variety - foreign income dividends (Fids). This time the innovation has been rather better received. Fids were introduced by the government to help companies that derive a large proportion of profits from overseas. They can suffer an abnormally high overall tax rate if their mainstream corporation tax liability is insufficient to offset the advance corporation tax paid on dividends. Under the new scheme they can reclaim ACT paid on a Fid if they can show the dividend was funded out of foreign profits. Companies were initially cautious about the idea, partly because it is administratively complex, but also because the change benefits some shareholders more than others. A conventional dividend is paid with a 20 per cent tax credit which non-taxpayers, including pension funds, can reclaim. Those paying tax at 20 per cent or 25 per cent face no further liability while those on the top rate pay a further 20 per cent. A Fid carries the normal 20 per cent tax credit but tax-exempt shareholders can no longer obtain a repayment. For them, a Fid is worth 20 per cent less than the same sum paid as a conventional dividend. To compensate, companies introducing Fids are paying 25 per cent more than they would have as a conventional dividend leaving the non-taxpayer unaffected. For companies the higher payment is offset by a lower tax bill. The beneficiaries are tax-paying shareholders, whose income rises by 25 per cent. Although institutions that do not benefit are still lukewarm, Fids are now appearing in a flood. The first came from BAT Industries which announced in March that it would pay its final dividend for last year as a Fid. However Ladbroke, which announced in March it was looking at Fids, did not take advantage of the new rules for its interim dividend last week and said it had made no decision on the final. The first Fid interim came this week from Coats Viyella while Burmah Castrol, which is paying a conventional interim, announced that it would pay part of the final as a Fid. Yesterday, RTZ declared a Fid interim and said it would pay as much of its final as a Fid as would allow it to get back all its ACT. Mr Chris Bull, finance director, argues that even non-taxpaying shareholders should benefit from the Fid. 'We have been writing off about Pounds 35m a year of ACT which will now be available for distribution to shareholders. In theory this should enhance the value of the shares, although the funds will not be distributed to non-tax paying investors.' Fids, however, pose a ticklish problem for the City: how are dividend yields and cover to be calculated? For tax-paying shareholders, receiving a Fid gives them a higher income than from the equivalent conventional dividend. But for tax-exempt shareholders the yield is unchanged. The City needs to decide which type of investor should be regarded as the norm.</p>

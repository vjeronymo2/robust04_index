			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lagos, 14 Mar (AFP) -- The Campaign for Democracy  [CD], the organization composed of many Nigerian human rights  associations, wrote to the French, Nigerian, and Cameroonian  heads of state to stress the irrelevance of a war in the  resolution of the border dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon.  In the letters to the three presidents, Francois Mitterrand,  Paul Biya, and Sani Abacha -- with copies received by AFP today  -- the CD believes that a war over the Bakassi Peninsula would  only worsen the two African countries' social problems.    In the text sent to President Mitterrand, the CD criticizes  French intervention in the dispute "because of its potential for  provocation." "The present French intervention as part of the  treaty between Paris and Yaounde -- while the dispute could be  resolved bilaterally and regionally -- contradicts the ideals of  the United Nations and its bodies, especially the Security  Council, where your country has a permanent seat," the letter  indicates.    In the letters sent to the Cameroonian and Nigerian  presidents, the CD accuses the two leaders of using the border  issue "to divert" their fellow citizens' attention from the  socio-economic problems of their respective countries.    According to the CD, a diplomatic solution should be found  to  this crisis which has been affecting the relations between the  two countries for two and a half months now.</p>

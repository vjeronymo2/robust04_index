			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Further, the ProPAC CIPI omits interest rates. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumulative effect of declining interest rates for all debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments in recent years has driven the rate of change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HCFA interest rate component downward, a trend projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into future rate years. The declining interest rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component drags the HCFA CIPI below the ProPAC CIPI in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projection period. Other things being equal, the ProPAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index would result in overpayment through the Federal rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because anticipated actual capital-related expenses will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than ProPAC projects due to the effects of lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest rates on capital-related expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> IV. Case-Mix Adjustment and Adjustment for Forecast Error  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The case-mix index (CMI) is the measure of the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DRG weight for cases paid under the prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Because the DRG weight determines the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment for each case, any percentage increase in the CMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponds to an equal percentage increase in hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CMI can change for any of several reasons: because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the average resource use of Medicare patients changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``real'' case-mix change), because changes in hospital coding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of patient records result in higher weight DRG assignments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``coding effects''), and because the annual DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification and recalibration changes may not be budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutral (``reclassification effect''). In the update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> framework for the prospective payment system for operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs, we adjust the update upwards to allow for real case-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mix change, but remove the effects of coding changes on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMI. We also remove the effect on total payments of prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the DRG classifications and relative weights, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to retain budget neutrality for all CMI-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes other than patient severity. (For example, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted for the effects of the FY 1992 DRG reclassification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recalibration as part of our FY 1994 update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation.) The operating adjustment consists of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction for total observed case-mix change, an increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the portion of case-mix change that we determine is due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to real case-mix change rather than coding modifications,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and an adjustment for the effect of prior DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification and recalibration changes. We proposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt this CMI adjustment as well in the capital update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> framework.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We received no comments on the proposed CMI adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current operating update framework contains an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment for forecast error. The input price index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forecast is based on historical trends and relationships  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ascertainable at the time the update factor is established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the following year. In any given year there can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unanticipated price fluctuations that can result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences between the actual increase in prices faced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals and the forecast used in calculating the update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors. We continue to believe that the capital update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> framework should include a forecast error adjustment factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In setting a prospective payment rate under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> framework, we would make an adjustment for forecast error  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only if our estimate of the capital input price index rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of increase for any year is off by 0.25 percentage points or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more. There is a 2-year lag between the forecast and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement of the forecast error. Thus, for example, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would adjust for a forecast error made in FY 1996 through an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment to the FY 1998 update.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We received no comments on the proposed forecasting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> error adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> V. Policy Adjustment Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The capital input price index measures the pure price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes associated with changes in capital-related costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (prices x ``quantities''). The composition of capital-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs is maintained at base-year 1987 proportions in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital input price index. We would address appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in the amount and composition of capital stock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the policy adjustment factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current update framework for the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment system for operating costs includes factors designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to adjust the input price index rate of increase for policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations. Under the revised operating framework, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjust for service productivity (the efficiency with which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers produce individual services such as laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests and diagnostic procedures) and intensity (the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of services used to produce a discharge). The service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity factor for the operating update framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects a forward-looking adjustment for the changes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals can be expected to make in service-level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity during the year. A hospital retains any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity increases above the average.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intensity factor for the operating update framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects how hospital services are utilized to produce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final product, that is, the discharge. This component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounts for changes in the use of quality-enhancing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services, changes in within-DRG severity, and expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of practice patterns to remove cost-ineffective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. We originally proposed that the intensity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment factor in the revised operating framework be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted in the capital update framework. That factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains a part of our developing framework. Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised operating update framework, we calculate case-mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constant intensity as the change in total charges per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admission, adjusted for price level changes (the CPI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital component) and changes in real case mix. The use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of total charges in the calculation of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensity factor makes it a total intensity factor, that is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges for capital services are already built into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation of the factor. We can therefore incorporate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed intensity adjustment from the operating update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> framework into the capital update framework. In the absence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of reliable estimates of the proportions of the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual intensity increases that are due, respectively, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ineffective practice patterns and to the combination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality-enhancing new technologies and within-DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexity, we would assume, as in the revised operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> update framework, that one-half of the annual increase is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to each of these factors. The capital update framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would thus provide an add-on to the input price index rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of increase of one-half of the estimated annual increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensity to allow for within-DRG severity increases and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption of quality-enhancing technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

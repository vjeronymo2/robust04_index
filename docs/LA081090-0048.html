			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV/VIDEO  </P> <P> lawsuitsomething: MGM-UA Television Production Group sued CBS Wednesday in an  attempt to block the network from broadcasting a movie starring Kenneth Olin  during the season premiere week of an ABC series Olin stars in --  "thirtysomething."  </P> <P> The Superior Court lawsuit said CBS knew when it hired Olin to star in "The  Charles Stuart Murders" that Olin's contract with MGM-UA carries an exclusivity  restriction. The restriction bars Olin from making any guest appearances in  programs to be broadcast during the season's premiere week of "thirtysomething"  or opposite any first run broadcast of an episode of the series. CBS intends to  broadcast "The Charles Stuart Murders" Sept. 18 in a time slot opposite the  fall premiere of "thirtysomething."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi, today  said that the government was going to make a formal protest  against some friendly countries to Kenya for their persistent  interference in the country's internal affairs. The president  noted that, as a sovereign state, Kenya deserves respect from  these nations the way it respected them. Saying that these  countries were partisan, the president wondered why their  embassies had not disassociated themselves from the subversive  elements operating in the country in the name of democracy. The  president gave examples of the tribal clashes started by the  opposition and their assertion of terrorism as areas where these  countries never came up to condemn. President Moi noted that he  had implemented a lot of conditions by the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund, IMF, and wondered why these  countries have not appreciated all these efforts. President Moi  was speaking at Eldoret showground when he officially opened  this year's Uasin Gishu Agricultural Show.    At the same time, President Moi once again criticized a  section of the local press for their lack of patriotism and  thriving on lies and sensationalism. He disclosed that it was  now clear that these newspapers have a hidden agenda, and told  Kenyans to be on the lookout.    The president observed that the KANU [Kenya African National  Union] government has for a long time been the target of  intimidation and said should the country be pushed to civil war,  then Kenyans should know who pushed them that far. He  challenged those subversive elements in the country to come out  and state whether they do not want a united nation instead of  hiding behind the song of democracy.    Saying that violence breeds violence, President Moi told  those friendly countries to Kenya to take time off to understand  the way Kenyans live, instead of rushing to call for changes in  the country. President Moi reiterated that although he has been  tolerant for quite some time now, tolerance has a limit.  [passage omitted]    Once again, President Moi told civil servants, including the  police, that the government will not enter into any negotiations  over their loyalty to the government of the day. He told the  commissioner of police to make it clear to the police that they  had an obligation to serve the government in power loyally or  risk dismissal. He gave an example of the armed forces who,  despite being officers and soldiers drawn from all over the  country, lived harmoniously as a family. [passage omitted]</p>

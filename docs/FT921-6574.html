			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Letter: No evidence that Rolls-Royce Cars not up with latest technology Sir, I write to express concern that your editorial comment on Rolls-Royce Motor Cars ('Perilous niches', February 26) seems to have been written by someone with little knowledge about Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars or their design, development and manufacture. There is no evidence to support your thesis that the downturn for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is based on a failure to keep up with the latest technology. As recently as 14 months ago, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was announcing that its sales had been at a near record level of 3,333 in 1990 - hardly the dying throes of neglected technology] The current recession in the US and the UK has caused an equally steep fall in the sales of top-of-the-range versions of motor cars from Mercedes and BMW, despite their alleged higher technology. The design, development and production of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars at Crewe has involved for many years the use of computer-controlled machinery, very similar to that found in any German or Japanese car factory. In addition, visitors to Crewe from both German and Japanese manufacturers have actually compared their own working and project management practices unfavourably with those they observed at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. The whole of Rolls-Royce production is controlled by a computer-based manufacturing resource planning (MRPII) system, which was the first to be installed by a European motor car manufacturer. The automatic ride control, introduced by Rolls-Royce on all its models in 1989, was the first of its kind in the world - technology developed at Crewe. This computer-controlled system enables the car to react immediately to different road and driving conditions to give the best combination of ride and road-holding at all times. Rolls-Royce has, of course, had long-term technological collaboration agreements with a number of manufacturers, including BMW, and the technological transfer is two-way, with, for example, Rolls-Royce working for BMW as well as BMW for Rolls-Royce. As was made clear in the announcement of Vickers results this week, the research and development expenditure at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has been maintained during this difficult period. It was only in November last year that the technically orientated publication, Car Magazine, tested the Bentley Turbo R alongside the most expensive Jaguar, Mercedes and Lexus cars and came to the conclusion that the Bentley Turbo R was 'the best car in the world'. During 1991, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars launched two new models, including the Bentley Continental R, for which the first two years production have already been sold, mostly for export, and in total worth more than Pounds 100m. Of course Rolls-Royce Motor Cars occupies a particular and small niche, as indeed does the Financial Times. This does not, however, mean that either is in some way backward or produces 'instant antiques'. Sir Colin Chandler, managing director, Vickers plc, Millbank Tower, Millbank, London, SW1P 4RA.</p>

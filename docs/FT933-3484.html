			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Obituary: Trenchant analyst of energy - Andrew Holmes ANDREW HOLMES, editor of the FT's Power in Europe newsletter, has died aged 36, following a long battle against brain cancer. Born in Strathclyde, Andy Holmes joined the Financial Times group in 1982 after a period as a press officer in the Department of Energy. His deep knowledge of the energy sector and of government bureaucracy were two of his many assets as a journalist. He was an early editor of European Energy Report and in 1987 launched Power in Europe, which achieved prominence and influence during the debate over energy privatisation. Holmes was an especially trenchant analyst of the nuclear power sector, arguing at a time when it was unfashionable to do so that the coal industry was emerging as a casualty of government policy. A vigorous scoop-getter, he was named Energy Journalist of the Year in 1989 by the British Institute of Energy Economics, which said he had 'raised the level of debate' on privatisation. His views were expressed in a series of books, broadcasts and in evidence to the Commons energy committee. Beyond that, his loves were music, literature and football. His dry wit could be devastating, his humour and generosity exceptional. Andy Holmes is survived by his wife Claire, daughter Lottie, and son Jack.</p>

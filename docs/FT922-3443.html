			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Britain and EC close to deal for 48 hour working week: UK would get 10 years to implement directive THE UK and its EC partners are close to agreeing plans to limit the working week to 48 hours, breaking a two-year deadlock on one of the most controversial pieces of community legislation. The British government has fiercely resisted conceding a ceiling on working hours. According to senior European Commission officials all 12 would accept a 48-hour working week under the compromise, but Britain would be given an additional 7-year implementation grace period. European Commission officials say the deal has particular significance because of the crisis of confidence caused by the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty which has put in jeopardy the European Union project. If agreed, the working time deal would translate Maastricht's agreement to disagree on social policy into law for the first time. At Maastricht, the 11 put their more ambitious social policy aims into a protocol to the treaty, leaving the UK subject only to existing social provisions. These sorts of 'variable geometry' or 'Europe ala carte' deals - whereby member states can sign up to EC policies which suit them - are anathema to integrationists who see in them the fragmentation of the Community and dilution of its force. But after the Danish rejection, and with Ireland's June 18 referendum looming, events could move swiftly in favour of a variable speed Europe. According to senior European Commission officials, all 12 would accept a 48-hour working week under the compromise. But the UK would in effect get 10 years to implement it: the maximum three years for a directive to come into law plus a seven year transition. Crucially, the directive would allow those workers willing to work more than 48 hours to do so - the main UK demand. But those workers unwilling to exceed the prescribed limit would have the protection of the law. To enforce this, employers would have to keep records of of both categories of workers, and make these available to national health and safety authorities, whose job it would be to ensure there was no discrimination. This basis for compromise followed German representations designed to ensure the UK was not isolated in the Council of Ministers on June 24 in Luxembourg, just ahead of the June 26-27 Lisbon summit. It was Germany which prevented the issue going to a vote on April 30, to allow the newly-appointed Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK employment secretary, a 'grace period'. Following the Danish referendum result, however, negotiations gathered pace, Commission officials say, and now centre on today's meeting between Mrs Shephard and her French counterpart, Ms Martine Aubry, who is one of the authors of the EC's Social Charter. If agreement is reached, it would be sealed at a social affairs EC ministerial meeting on the eve of the Lisbon summit of EC heads of government, which will be dominated by the Maastricht treaty crisis. Some thorny problems remain, such as whether working time agreements should be negotiated at industry level, as the majority of member states want, or at plant level, as the UK insists.</p>

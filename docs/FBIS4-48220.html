			<p>BFN     [Summary from poor reception] "The Nigerian high  commissioner in Freetown has expressed concern" over a broadcast  which said that "Nigeria has evacuated 5,000 of its nationals  with another 2,000 awaiting evacuation." In a release issued in  Freetown, the high commissioner gave the assurance that the "BBC  broadcast in question, was completely inacurate." He said that  there are 50,000 Nigerians in Sierra Leone and that the  repatriation of a handful should not be a matter for radio  broadcast. He said there were "42 families of women and  children who were flown back to Nigeria on Tuesday" [10 May].  They were flown back as "foreigners who had lost their homes  and means of livelihood" as result of rebel activities in an  area. The high commissioner assured all that he "would do his  utmost to see to the welfare of his nationals."</p>

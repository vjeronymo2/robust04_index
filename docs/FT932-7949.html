			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Argentine strike in prospect ARGENTINA'S trade union congress has attacked the free market policies of President Carlos Menem and raised the prospect of a general strike, 'when and where it hurts the government the most,' Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. An assembly of 187 union delegates voted late on Wednesday to authorise Mr Naldo Brunelli, secretary-general of the general labour confederation (CGT), to decide when the strike would take place. Such a CGT stoppage would be its second national strike since Mr Menem took office in July 1989. The first was staged last November 9.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: IN FOOTBALL, THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME FOR THE POSTSEASON  </P> <P> When Bud Grant was coaching the Minnesota Vikings, chronic entrant in the  postseason football tournament, he was asked how he would feel losing the  home-field edge. Bud responded:  </P> <P> "All places I've been, the field measures 100 yards long by 53 1/3 yards wide.  Each side has featured 11 people at a time. And each has been allowed four  tries to make a first down. If I go somewhere and find any variations to the  foregoing, I will worry. Otherwise, I won't."  </P> <P> It is standard at this time of year, though, for most teams to worry enormously  about home field. Is the advantage real, or is it another phantom galloping  through the minds of coaches beset with a multitude of other worries?  </P> <P> You begin your exploration of the subject by citing the practices of those who  make odds in the neighborly state of Nevada.  </P> <P> To them, home field normally is worth three points. If, for instance, the 49ers  were to play the Giants in San Francisco and the oddsmaker saw the 49ers as a  point better, he would hang up a price of four points, allowing for home field.  </P> <P> An exception to the rule is Los Angeles, where home field is rated only two  points, mainly because of the composition of those inhabiting the seats. A  visiting team in Los Angeles picks up more friends than anyplace else.  </P> <P> Why would a partial crowd influence the price on a football game? Two reasons  are advanced.  </P> <P> First, noisemaking on its part when the visitors are trying to call signals  damages the visitors' offense. As many as 15% of a team's plays can be  audibilized. When those involved can't hear, this weapon is partly wiped out.  </P> <P> Secondly, oddsmakers don't feel officials are crooked, but they do feel,  however unconsciously, they can be intimidated by a home crowd.  </P> <P> Discussing home field one time with Dan Reeves, coach of Denver, we were told  that atmospheric conditions on the road always must be considered.  </P> <P> "A thrower must understand the wind," said Dan, "and the receivers have to know  where the sun is."  </P> <P> If, in late afternoon, a receiver doesn't find the sun in the west, he has a  problem shared by many.  </P> <P> When Seattle's Chuck Knox took his team to the playoffs one year, he was asked  if stadium conditions and hostile crowds troubled him.  </P> <P> "Not as much as planes, buses and hotels," answered Chuck. "When planes and  buses are late, your players get upset. They also get upset if service is slow  in the coffee shop."  </P> <P> You can see the case with which the delicate cerebral machinery of today's  entertainer can be tilted.  </P> <P> OK, the last time the Raiders go to the playoffs, in 1985, we ask the  celebrated strategist, Al Davis, how a visiting team can suffer playing on  alien grounds.  </P> <P> Al answers they suffer for lack of cheers.  </P> <P> "Football players need reaffirmation," he says. "It begins in college with  rallies, bonfires, booster functions. The roar of the crowd makes them feel  loved. They seem to draw strength from it."  </P> <P> He is asked: "Can they do anything in postseason to make it fair for both  entrants?"  </P> <P> "Yes," he replies. "They can play the games in Japan where it is the custom at  sporting events to applaud both sides."  </P> <P> Since the playoffs have become such a vital component of professional football,  many have argued that the games be played on neutral fields, principally on the  ground that too much is at stake for a team to have a bulge once the tournament  begins.  </P> <P> But the counterargument is that if home field in the playoffs isn't determined  by a team's record during regular season, teams clinching playoff spots before  the end of the season will dog it, depriving fans of their money's worth.  </P> <P> For the playoffs, the home-field neurosis isn't going to vanish, but if  visiting players need love, as Al Davis deduces, a way must be found to get  this commodity delivered.  </P></p>

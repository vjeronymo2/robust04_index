			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (10): Quest for lighter machines poses a bit of a size problem / A look at battery technology and power management WHEN THE transportable computer had the dimensions and weight of a large and full briefcase which was usually plugged into the mains, the size, weight and capacity of the batteries were relatively unimportant. However, as portable computers have shrunk and com puting-on-the-move has become more of a reality, considerably more attention has been focused on the power supply and particularly on how long batteries will last between charges. Indeed, battery technology has become one of the main limiting factors in the quest for lighter and smaller machines with desktop functionality that can operate for long periods without an umbilical power cord. Unfortunately, battery technology has lagged behind developments in almost every other sector of electronics. By some estimates, battery technology for portables has improved a paltry 5 per cent a year and in most portable devices the battery now accounts for a quarter of the weight, compared with a tenth a decade ago. As a result, battery makers are now scrambling to come up with lighter, more powerful and longer-lasting batteries. With the exception of hand-held computers, most portables have until recently relied on rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Generally, they provide enough power between charges to keep a notebook PC running only for between one and four hours, depending upon the application. More power could be delivered by larger batteries, but this would add weight. These NiCad batteries have other disadvantages, including the so-called 'memory-effect' which can mean that unless they are fully discharged before recharging they gradually lose capacity - or the ability to be fully recharged. Improvements in NiCad technology are reaching their limits, while some governments are moving towards banning them because the cadmium they contain is so toxic that they are difficult to dispose of safely. So researchers have switched their attention to new types of rechargeable batteries. Several alternatives have been tried, but most have either proved unstable or have shown little power-to-weight advantage over NiCad cells. Manufacturers want a cell that is electrically compatible with NiCads but lighter, thinner, longer-lasting, quicker to recharge and friendlier to the environment. So far, the most popular alternative has been nickel-metal hydride powerpacks. Initially developed in Japan by Sanyo, NiMH batteries can now be found in the latest portables. NiMH cells deliver the same 1.2 volts as NiCad cells but can store nearly twice as much power (watt-hours) and have the added advantage of being more environmentally friendly. Their total life span of about 1,000 charge/discharge cycles compares with 500 to 600 cycles for NiCad batteries. However, some manufacturers including Sony Energytec, an affiliate of the consumer-electronics giant, have attempted to leapfrog the competition with a new generation of rechargeable batteries based on a lithium ion cell. Many manufacturers make disposable lithium batteries - mostly in the form of little 'button' cells for electronic devices, but it has been a lot more difficult to build stable rechargeable cells. Although they are still considerably more expensive than NiCad batteries, current versions of lithium rechargeables pack up to four times the power of the best NiCads but weigh only half as much. But most manufacturers agree that two or three years are still needed to remove technical hitches and reduce the cost of lithium batteries to make them real rivals to NiCad and NiMH technology. Meanwhile, some companies are focusing their research on improving existing types of battery by giving them their own microprocessors - turning them into what Dr Ross Green, a senior consultant and researcher at the Hertfordshire-based Technology Partnership, calls 'intelligent battery packs'. By providing rechargeable batteries with a thumbnail-sized low-cost microprocessor containing a mathematical model of battery behaviour, Dr Green says it is possible to monitor and control the way the battery operates. Among the advantages he claims for the intelligent battery packs he has been working on are extended service life - because charging and discharge are carefully controlled - the ability to pack up to 15 per cent more charge into a battery and astonishingly fast recharge times - as short as three minutes. Another byproduct of the research is that intelligent batteries can provide detailed information to the user about their charge state - 'an accurate fuel gauge'. However, the relatively limited and slow progress in rechargeable battery technology, coupled in particular with the advent of power-hungry colour portables, has encouraged portable computer manufacturers to turn to other solutions to extend operating life of their machines. This is one factor behind the move by notebook computer manufacturers to replace disk drives and similar components with less power-hungry alternatives such as the PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) memory cards. An earlier development, pioneered by Toshiba, was software implemented power management systems which introduced auto-resume and pop-up battery power indicators. Software-based power management solutions can enhance battery life, but some risk introducing compatibility and reliability problems, and more fundamental solutions are required to achieve the substantial power savings which portable PC users now demand. More complex power management systems therefore depend upon a combination of hardware and software features. To provide this, chipmakers AMD and Intel have begun to deliver low power versions of their standard micro-processors with special built-in features to improve power management and extend battery life. Intel began by redesigning its 80386 chip set to include System Management Mode (SMM) circuitry producing the power-saving Intel 80386SL chipset, unveiled at the end of 1990. Last year, Intel followed up by releasing the 486SL, a low- voltage version of its most powerful PC processor. The 486SL's 'flexible voltage' feature means that although it can operate as a 5-volt device, the real savings are made at 3.3 volts with other low voltage components. In these circumstances power consumption is reduced 50 per cent from a 5-volt 386SL system. Intel claimed this should yield one to four hours of additional battery life. Low-powered chips running at 3.3 volts, instead of the usual 5 volts, have another big advantage - there is less waste heat to contend with. Indeed, some portable computer manufacturers held off from releasing 80486 notebooks because of concern about overheating and Intel has incorporated System Management Mode (SMM) circuitry into its soon-to-be-released Pentium chip. SMM is thought to account for about 10 per cent of the 3.2m transistors on the Pentium chip, switching idle bits of the computer in and out of 'sleep' mode at great speed and even turning off different parts of the microprocessor between key strokes. Perhaps by the time the first Pentium-based portables appear, other power management techniques and battery technology itself will have made equally significant leaps forward.</p>

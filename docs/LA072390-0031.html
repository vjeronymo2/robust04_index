			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREE-RING CIRCUS FROM SOUL II SOUL  </P> <P> The glib hipster Jazzie B -- producer, composer, arranger and rapper for the  black English group Soul II Soul, as well as its leader and guru -- was more  like a ringmaster on Friday, presiding over a three-ring musical circus at the  Universal Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> The stage was often so packed with musicians and dancers that you didn't know  who or what to focus on: strings, a three-man horn unit and a blaring,  startlingly precise rhythm section accompanied a quartet of backup singers who  in turn supported four female lead singers and the occasional chanting and  chattering of Jazzie B.  </P> <P> Soul II Soul played funky dance music in that chaotic, cluttered stage  environment, highlighted by colorful backdrops, clouds of smoke and flashing  lights -- a lively re-creation of the audio-visual assaults that characterized  '70s discos.  </P> <P> To put the audience in the mood for what was to come, the show opened with a  simulated dance-club segment and fashion show, with dancers/models strutting to  taped music.  </P> <P> For those who like loping dance music -- as most of the crowd that nearly  filled the theater presumably did -- Soul II Soul's show was pure ecstasy, a  hip-shaking, toe-tapping feast.  </P> <P> The rhythm section laid down such a strong, relentless beat that it was often  difficult to pay attention to the melodies and the vocals. There was enough  variety in this music to counter the common claim that dance music is shallow  and repetitive.  </P> <P> Soul II Soul's music is an ingeniously danceable mix of assorted elements, such  as James Brown-style funk, the orchestral disco sound of Barry White,  mainstream jazz and the R&amp;B vocal style popularized by Motown in the '60s.  </P> <P> When the group's first album, "Keep on Movin'," came out last year, featuring  singles such as the title song and "Back to Life," it was dazzlingly different  -- like nothing else on the market at the time.  </P> <P> It didn't matter that at times Jazzie B was on his soap box, spewing out  fortune-cookie philosophy. You simply tuned in the great grooves and tuned out  such mutterings as "A happy face, a thumping bass, for a loving race."  </P> <P> Jazzie B is a likeable eccentric who walks with a cane, wears shades and has  his dreadlocks done up in a rooster-like do.  </P> <P> On Friday, he was occasionally rapping and philosophizing, preaching  positivism, love, determination and dedication. He seemed to be trying to  enshroud the music with the mantle of nobility and importance -- trying to make  it seem like more than it really is. But audience didn't seem to let his  prattle get in the way of savoring those scintillating grooves.  </P> <P> As good as most of the show was, Soul II Soul isn't progressing. The material  on Soul II Soul's second album, "1990 -- a New Decade" -- is a disappointment.  </P> <P> Jazzie B and company seemed fresh out of fresh ideas. They recycled some of the  best parts of the first album, but did a lousy job of disguising the rehashed  material. Also, none of the lead singers seemed to be in a league with Caron  Wheeler, whose exceptionally soulful vocals were among the highlights of the  first album. Wheeler, who's gone solo, is absent from the new album -- and  sorely missed.  </P> <P> Though singers like Victoria Wilson-James and Marcia Lewis don't shine on that  second album, in concert all verged on outstanding -- giving the kind of  dynamic, powerful vocal performances that would have given the album a badly  needed boost.  </P></p>

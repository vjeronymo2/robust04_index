			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Vargas] </F>   [Text] Workers from the Coalition of Panama Canal  Commission (PCC) Labor Unions have asked the U.S. Congress to  allow them to participate in the debates to take place on the  amendments to the law that regulates the Panama Canal, which  were proposed by President Bill Clinton.    In a communique, the association of PCC workers signals that  it has put on alert all its international labor union  representatives in the United States to guarantee their  participation in the debates that will take place in Congress  regarding the proposal to modify the law that regulates the  interoceanic waterway.    President Bill Clinton sent to the U.S. Congress a series of  recommendations on changes to the law that regulates the Panama  Canal regarding administrative and financial concerns. The goal  is to allow a more efficient and harmonious transfer of the  interoceanic waterway on 31 December 1999, as provided for in  the treaties signed in 1977.    The communique adds that the unions that represent PCC  workers were not consulted nor was their opinion requested with  regard to the modification proposals.</p>

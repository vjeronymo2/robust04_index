			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE GRAND TOUR WITH CANALETTO;  </P> <P> CANALETTO BY KATHERINE BAETJER AND J.G. LINKS (METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,  HARRY N. ABRAMS, DISTRIBUTOR: $60; 387 PP., 167 COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS, 13  BLACK-AND-WHITE; 0-8109-3155-9)  </P> <P> The 18th Century was the age of the Grand Tour, and one product of the new  passion for travel was the proliferation of view paintings (vedute), which  recorded specific and recognizable sites. Among the foremost masters of the  genre was the prolific Venetian painter, Giovanni Antonio Canal, called  Canaletto (1697-1768), whose work caused his first patrons to marvel: "You can  see the sun shining in it."  </P> <P> The artist's reputation was established by his luminous views of Venice, though  he was equally proficient in creating imaginary, but plausible, landscapes. The  perfect congruence between his talents and contemporary taste was recognized  first by Owen McSwiney and then by Joseph Smith. These enterprising gentlemen  promoted Canaletto's paintings among British collectors, who cherished these  dazzling mementos of the most opulent city on the Grand Tour.  </P> <P> In 1746, the artist traveled to England where he remained for about 10 years.  He expanded his repertoire to include portraits of London and the estates of  the aristocrats who were his most consistent patrons. His sketchbooks allowed  him to paint Venetian scenes while in England and to paint British scenes when  he returned to his homeland.  </P> <P> Today, his pictures are generally appreciated not only for their intrinsic  charm but also as records of England before London cannibalized its  countryside, and as tantalizing visions that recall the splendors of Venice  prior to the depredations of pollution. But as this handsome book effectively  demonstrates, Canaletto's paintings transcend their utility as topographical  records. Their beauty reflects the vitality and geometric clarity of the  artist's imagination.  </P> <P> "Canaletto" is the catalogue for the exhibition organized by the author, a  curator at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, in collaboration with the  eminent British scholar, J. G. Links. Because Canaletto's oeuvre has been  authoritatively established in W. G. Constable's catalogue raisonne (revised by  Links in 1989), the authors were not concerned with questions of attribution or  with the need to distinguish his work from that of other view painters, as in  Vittorio Moschini's 1954 monograph. Rather, they address issues raised as early  as 1771, when Antonio Zanetti the Younger assessed the artist's accomplishment:  "Canaletto combined nature and artistic license with such skill that his works  appear to be absolutely accurate." But the Venetian connoisseur emphasized that  this is an illusion achieved by disciplined artistry.  </P> <P> Katherine Baetjer and Links bypass the beguiling subjects that make Canaletto's  paintings so deceptively accessible and explore the intellectually rigorous  structure and meticulous craftsmanship that underlie their capacity to  fascinate.  </P> <P> In support of this enterprise, the authors offer an impeccable selection of  acknowledged masterpieces. The 85 paintings and 42 drawings all are reproduced  in beautiful color plates, which make the volume a visual delight. Detailed  catalogue entries provide information on the patrons and provenance of each  object and on the history of the landmarks, noting especially the artist's  revisions of visible reality.  </P> <P> Five introductory essays discuss Canaletto's reputation and analyze the methods  by which he consistently engages our imagination. Links incorporates a lifetime  of study in a biographical sketch that reveals much about Canaletto's relations  with his patrons.  </P> <P> The essay by Michael Levey, former director of the National Gallery, London,  emphasizes the imaginative artistry underlying the "powerfully factual air" and  "pattern-making precision" that constitute the hallmarks of Canaletto's style.  Levey characterizes Canaletto as an idealizing rather than as a  representational painter, arguing that he consistently "asserted his artistic  right to modify" the facts of visual reality in the interest of creating a  picture while retaining "the general air of verisimilitude in the finished  work." Furthermore, the organization of actual and invented details is entirely  "subordinated to the major concern with coherent composition." Topographical  facts are manipulated as part of the comprehensive reordering that is essential  to the harmonious reality created within each picture.  </P> <P> The insights offered by Viola Pemberton-Pigott, senior restorer for the Royal  Collection, derive from her microscopic scrutiny of individual paintings. She  draws attention to the mechanical devices that Canaletto employed to achieve an  illusion of crystalline perfection and describes his technique of "sculpting"  in paint to enhance the naturalistic appearance of surfaces. Most surprising is  her observation that the brilliant luminosity and coloristic effects for which  Canaletto is famous are actually achieved with a very limited palette.  </P> <P> Surveying his career, the conservator confirms Levey's remarks regarding  Canaletto's Cezanne-like devotion to the mastery of composition. She concludes  that Canaletto "deliberately rejected the brand of realism that had  characterized his early painting. He passed from the meticulous observation of  every detail to exploring the scope of composition within color, pattern and  texture, and the extreme stylization of his later works became a further stage  of Canaletto's unflagging creativity."  </P> <P> Altogether this is a wonderful book. The texts complement the multitude of  illustrations, enhancing our appreciation for the sparkling pictures by  revealing the sophisticated artistry Canaletto carefully veiled.  </P> <P> My only quibble is that throughout there are references to prints by and after  Canaletto, and some effort should have been made to include relevant examples.  Otherwise, this substantial volume admirably serves the artist it celebrates.  </P></p>

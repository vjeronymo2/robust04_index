			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MESSAGES AND SIGNALS FROM THE WORLD OF RAP  </P> <P> Regarding the Feb. 4 rap articles and interviews:  </P> <P> I must say I was surprised to see real interviews done with members of the rap  group Public Enemy.  </P> <P> The media has never handled rap music the way it should have. The only time rap  was talked about was when violence broke out at concerts or when lyrics caused  controversy.  </P> <P> Nobody had done a special on the positive qualities that rap has to offer --  such as the stop-the-violence movement.  </P> <P> Public Enemy has given young blacks the pride that we have been denied through  the years.  </P> <P> CHERRONE M. JOHNSON  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

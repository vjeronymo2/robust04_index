			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (15): Leading the blind - The Lawyers MBO LAWYERS think of themselves as businessmen and women first and lawyers second. Often their key role is to supervise the deal. 'There's a huge amount of transaction management,' says Allen &amp; Overy's Mr Anthony Keal. 'Particularly in multi-jurisdictional MBOs.' According to Mr John Kitching from Lovell White Durrant, this is particularly true when acting for the finance providers: 'The institutions are looking for lawyers to project manage a transaction.' That means the legal advisers are not asked simply to handle the formal technicalities. 'The client would be disappointed if you just gave legal advice,' says Mr Geoffrey Green from Ashurst Morris Crisp. 'You're also asked to be a constructive problem solver and to give a much more rounded, judgmental view of the transaction.' It is an approach shared by others, including Mr Derham O'Nell at Clifford Chance: 'Lawyers are increasingly involved at the strategic level and are used as a commercial sounding board. For example, we're sometimes asked about the public relations effects of a deal.' Buy-outs are now fewer and smaller, so an outsider would assume that competition between leading law firms has heated up considerably. MBO lawyers are split on the issue, however. Mr James Davis from Freshfields thinks not. 'Although occasionally financiers will go to a new law firm as a trusted second string - particularly when there is a conflict of interest - they're more concerned with quality and value for money than nitpicking on price.' Mr Green from Ashurst Morris Crisp would agree with the insistence on quality but is certain that 'competition between lawyers is much fiercer than, say, a year ago'. It is a view shared by his counterparts in other firms. Mr Anthony Lewis from Cameron Markby Hewitt says: 'Increasingly, venture capitalists won't take all their work to just one law firm.' Stephen Barnard from Herbert Smith adds: 'Clients are now much more likely to move around and people are working harder to keep the client happier.' If the financiers are staying with their established lawyers for the larger deals, it may be that they are more cautious because of the economically tight conditions. Mr Jonathan Blake from S J Berwin believes that 'institutions like to deal with lawyers they feel comfortable with and who they know can handle the technical issues'. As Mr Peter Turnbull from Macfarlanes points out, 'if you're the person buying in the external legal services, you can't go wrong instructing a recognised name. Someone who does the job more cheaply won't do it better.' Perhaps the greatest benefit experienced practitioners can offer clients is the saving of time. Lawyers well versed in MBOs know which are the main points in the transaction and can save time, money and their clients' patience by not wrangling over minor details. However, the senior regional firms have not - as was once predicted - broken into the top ranks of MBO legal advisers. Many believe this is because the larger London firms have far greater resources and experience than their country cousins who are best at doing small deals more cheaply than their classier City brethren. Lovell's Mr Kitching disagrees. 'Law firms can break into this market. It's the relationships with the finance providers which count and in many cases the regional firms have built and continue to build those relationships.' So does it matter which of the top firms you go to? It is generally agreed that the leading firms can handle the technical issues equally competently. But as Mr David Ereira from Freshfields points out, 'there are distinct differences in terms of the approach and the culture. So it's a question of how the service is delivered by a particular firm'. That is all very well for the financiers who have long-established connections with a wide range of suitable law firms. But for the management team, this will almost certainly be their first and only MBO the choice of a lawyer is more difficult. 'The venture capitalists are keen to advise management on which firm to use as lack of expertise slows the whole process down,' says Mr Ian Sears from Clifford Chance. 'The management will have their accountants sitting beside them and the accountants will know the form and who's worth going to,' says Mr Lewis from Cameron Markby Hewitt. 'In the end, personal chemistry is often the reason why a management team chooses a particular law firm,' he adds. Legal fees are a critical issue. 'If the deal hits the buffers, then we would expect to share the financial burden with the banks by charging at a lower rate,' says Mr Keal from Allen &amp; Overy. The rigorous control of expenditure is confirmed by Mr Barnard from Herbert Smith: 'People are very tight on fees these days and you have to justify your charges every step of the way.' Often great pressure is put on a law firm to operate on a flexible fee basis. Rarely will a leading London practice agree to work on a strict 'no deal, no pay' arrangement but more flexible arrangements are possible. For instance, initial discussions and certain categories of preliminary work may well be carried out for no - or a heavily reduced - fee. Mr John Penson from Lovell White Durrant says: 'It is easier for me to adopt a more flexible approach to billing for an established client than for a complete newcomer. It also gives the client less incentive to shop around and demonstrates that we're being sensitive to the transaction.' In an economically depressed market, lawyers are clearly as aware as everyone else of the limitations of one-off deals.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING SOLICITORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Acting for:                            Equity/Debt leader        Manager      Total  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Clifford Chance                            79             27        106 Ashurst Morris Crisp                       38             13         51 Allen &amp; Overy                              34              9         43 3i legal                                   37              0         37 Lovell White Durrant                       22              7         29 Macfarlanes                                22              6         28 Herbert Smith                              17              9         26 Slaughter &amp; May                            10             13         23 Freshfields                                19              3         22 S.

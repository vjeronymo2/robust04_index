			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Clash of the cans - Pepsi-Cola is battling for Europe's taste-buds with a new sugar-free drink The cola wars are hotting up again and this time the main battleground is Europe. This week, Pepsi-Cola opened up a new front in the offensive by unveiling a secret weapon: Pepsi Max, a sugar-free cola designed to taste like the original product. The product, to be marketed initially in Britain and Italy, is the first developed by the company specifically for non-American consumers. If it succeeds, it is likely to be followed by others which acknowledge that tastes in the US are not always shared in the rest of the world. The primary target is a share of Coca-Cola's international sales. Three times larger than Pepsi's, they provide more than two thirds of Coke's turnover and three quarters of its operating profits. But Pepsi believes Max can also expand the total soft drinks market, particularly in Europe and Latin America where cola consumption is a fraction of US levels. 'This is more than just a line extension that will shift shares between brands. The aim is to create a new market segment,' says Don Holdsworth, vice-president of marketing at Pepsi-Cola International (PCI). 'We can make a huge leap forward and have a superb opportunity to open up markets where diet colas have never taken off.' His confidence is underpinned by the lengths to which Pepsi has gone to ensure success. In bringing Max to market, the company turned its traditional approach to innovation and marketing on its head. For the first time, it sought to discover at the outset what consumers really wanted and then created a product around it. 'In the past, we would bring in a product and see if people liked it,' says Holdsworth. 'In this case, everything was open from the beginning. We didn't start out with a product, a concept or an advertising campaign.' The story began 18 months ago when Pepsi set itself the challenge of wooing international soft drinks consumers who were health-conscious but disliked diet colas. Though a quarter of US soft drinks consumption, diet colas are less than 4 per cent of the market in the rest of the world. Since diet drinkers imbibe 13 per cent more on average than consumers of regular colas, that translates into a big loss of potential sales. Market research among non-US consumers who had tried, but rejected, diet colas revealed two main problems. One was the distinctive, slightly bitter, after-taste left by artificial sweeteners. The other was image. Many consumers, particularly in Latin countries, regarded diet products as effeminate or associated them with disorders such as diabetes and obesity. However, the research was frustratingly imprecise. It could not establish exactly what it was about the flavour consumers disliked - or what they would prefer - because they all used different words to describe tastes and flavours. To crack the problem, Pepsi set up panels of volunteers from its research centre and instructed them to define a common vocabulary to describe subtle variations in the taste and 'mouthfeel' of colas. After six months of carefully controlled tests and cross-checking with consumers, the panels broke down into four separate elements what the public meant by 'after-taste'. Armed with this information, Pepsi's chemists went to work. Using a new blend of basic ingredients, injecting a 'top note' flavour and adding ASK - a new sweetner not yet approved in the US - to the standard aspartame, they were able to devise a sugar-free formula with a muted after-taste which went down well in consumer trials. The next task was to find a suitable name and packaging format - again in close consultation with consumer 'focus groups' in the target markets. Out of a list of 13 possible names, which included 'Bold', 'Plus' and 'XT', the choice came down to 'Max' and 'Pepsi One'. The former was picked because it suggested maximum cola taste and carried across different languages. The search for the right packaging also began with a clean slate. Products bearing the Pepsi brand have used red and blue colours since the 1930s, since when there have only been four packaging re-designs. 'Until now, colour design was more heritage than anything else,' says Mark Blecher, manager of the Max project. He decided for the first time to test alternatives by asking consumers what different-coloured cans evoked. It turned out that everyone associated red cans with coke and red and blue with cola, but that adding other colours simply confused people. It was decided to stick with Pepsi's traditional livery, albeit re-styled for use with Max. The final - and in some ways trickiest - decision was on the advertising campaign. Prompted by market research which suggested that Max required an adventurous, masculine image, Pepsi commissioned two commercials featuring rock-climbers and sky-divers. The company's executives pronounced them a success. However, test audiences voted them boring. Pepsi went back to the editing room and jazzed them up. As an insurance policy, it also re-shot an existing commercial for Mountain Dew - a soft drink sold mainly in the US - substituting cans of Pepsi Max. In the end, this proved to be the one viewers liked best, though Pepsi may still use the other commercials in some markets. The company is keeping its options open about how fast it rolls Max out internationally and whether it will become a truly global brand. Much will depend on the results of test-marketing in Britain and Italy, chosen because of their widely different patterns of soft-drink consumption. However, Holdsworth insists that Max is destined to become a leading product line. 'We are not talking about 5 per cent of the market - if it only got that, something in the development process would have gone awry. It is a long-term brand, we expect it to be on the market permanently.' He is confident that, if Max succeeds, Pepsi will have the market to itself for some time. Coke's large share of international soft drinks sales, he argues, means it would stand to gain little volume if it launched a rival drink, and would risk cannibalising its product range.  -------------------------------------------- Share of total carbonated soft drink market  -------------------------------------------- 1991 (%)                  US       Outside                                     North                                    America  -------------------------------------------- Regular Pepsi           16.7        10.7 Diet Pepsi               6.3         0.5 Regular Coke            19.5        33.3 Diet Coke                9.2         2.5  --------------------------------------------</p>

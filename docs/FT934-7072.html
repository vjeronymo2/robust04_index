			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Investment growth low: Improved capital allowances attract only 15% of companies Fewer than 15 per cent of companies increased investment in machinery and plant this year in spite of the temporary introduction late last year of 40 per cent, first-year capital allowances, says an NOP survey. The results of the Lombard business investment survey, carried out for Lombard North Central, the leasing and hire purchase subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, come a week before the Budget which industry hopes will contain further measures to boost industrial investment. The recession has helped bring manufacturing investment to its lowest level, as a proportion of gross domestic product, for more than 30 years. However, the temporary rise in allowances from 25 per cent to 40 per cent, which expired last month, appears to have given only a modest fillip to capital spending. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has come under heavy pressure to renew the temporary extension and to enable all investment up to Pounds 200,000 to be eligible for relief. But there are doubts within the Treasury about the effectiveness of such initiatives. The Treasury has also regarded them in the past as a costly way of stimulating corporate investment. The Lombard survey of 450 companies shows that the allowances made most impact on smaller businesses. It also reveals that while only about 7 per cent of manufacturing companies took advantage of the improved allowances, a third of transport and distribution businesses used them. Although nearly half of the companies say capital expenditure programmes have been hit by the recession, more than 70 per cent of respondents believe the economy will improve over the next year and that they will raise investment activity in the first half of 1994. Their optimism is based primarily on a recent increase in orders and inquiries and on lower interest rates.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Big swings in Mexico and New Zealand Big global bourses fell last week, with equity traders living on their nerves, depressed by the continuing rise in US long bond rates and buffeted by intraday volatility. This time, Japanese equities were unable to avoid the general concern over world events; in fact, they were depressed additionally by rising tensions in the Korean peninsula and fell in line with the European and US blocs, as did the FT-Actuaries World Index with a drop of 2 per cent in local currency terms. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the week was a rise of more than 6 per cent in Mexico, in spite of the assassination on Wednesday of the governing party's presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio - and following initial falls of 10 per cent last Thursday in Mexican stocks in Europe. Mexico City, closed on Thursday as a mark of respect, fell to begin with on Friday but recovered to end with the IPC index down only 0.9 per cent on the day. Ms Justine Roberts of SG Warburg Securities says that this was an understandable response, and offers three good reasons why: first, a number of houses advising on international asset allocation saw a potential setback in Mexican equities as a buying opportunity; secondly, last Thursday Mexico completed negotiations to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, its acceptance having been seen as a sign of faith in Mexico; and thirdly, the left wing opposition is unlikely to gain from the loss of the ruling party's main candidate. 'The odds remain heavily in favour of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),' says a Warburg note, 'and the chances of economically imprudent left wingers gaining office remain as remote as ever.' The biggest fall of the week came in New Zealand, down 7.3 per cent, partly due to the weight of Telecom in the World Index component. Ms Pauline McAtamney at Ord Minnett says Telecom, with its high payout ratio, is viewed as a dividend stock and highly interest rate sensitive. Generally, she adds, the drop in global bond markets has hit New Zealand stocks since the beginning of February; and, more recently, New Zealand forestry shares have been following the North American counterparts down.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change    % change               % change in local currency*       sterling*  in US Dlrs*            -------------------------------------------------------------             1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of  Start of    Start of                                            1993      1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -3.29    -3.29   +35.76     +37.92     +35.11     +33.63 Belgium      -2.49    -1.43   +15.41     +30.23     +27.33     +25.93 Denmark      -3.11    -5.01   +38.36     +46.20     +41.06     +39.52 Finland      -3.03    -2.19   +81.65    +118.26    +107.26    +105.00 France       -3.43    -2.96   +11.74     +22.14     +19.35     +18.05 Germany      -1.21    +1.72   +25.29     +35.65     +33.18     +31.71 Ireland      -2.32    -1.85   +27.66     +55.62     +39.67     +38.14 Italy        +0.59    +2.71   +41.27     +58.35     +43.01     +41.44 Netherlands  -3.04    -3.30   +21.79     +33.88     +31.28     +29.84 Norway       -2.87    -4.62   +34.50     +51.40     +45.82     +44.22 Spain        -2.88    -3.22   +33.31     +47.72     +24.68     +23.32 Sweden       -4.04    -6.37   +35.76     +40.48     +27.26     +25.87 Switzerland  -0.36    -2.74   +34.26     +39.36     +45.58     +43.99 UK           -2.71    -4.37   +11.54     +13.01     +13.01     +11.77 EUROPE       -2.29    -2.71   +19.82     +26.41     +24.05     +22.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -0.67    +0.43   +24.81     +33.70     +39.74     +38.21 Hong Kong    +2.45    -5.73   +53.08     +72.57     +74.84     +72.92 Japan        -2.23    -0.20   +13.51     +22.93     +48.17     +46.54 Malaysia     -4.64   -15.84   +69.80     +78.86     +74.21     +72.31 New Zealand  -7.33    -4.26   +35.02     +39.04     +54.83     +53.14 Singapore    -1.67   -12.89   +34.02     +37.06     +44.08     +42.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       -0.81    +4.17   +20.24     +28.15     +19.83     +18.52 USA          -2.09    -1.01    +2.07      +5.42      +6.59      +5.42 Mexico       +6.05    -1.30   +48.88     +41.73     +33.28     +31.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa -1.12    +8.28   +51.72     +68.30     +75.49     +73.57  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -2.00    -1.32   +11.97     +18.08     +24.51     +23.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on March 25th 1994.

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: Dr Faustus Lights the Lights - The Edinburgh Festival How curious to find that Gertrude Stein, the American in Paris and pioneer of avant-garde wordplay, wrote Dr Faustus Lights the Lights with Britain in mind - as an operatic sequel to A Wedding Bouquet (the choral ballet, still extant in repertory today, which Lord Berners had created from her play They Must. Be Wedded. To Their Wife.) Now Robert Wilson, another American pioneer and leading creator of new-wave theatre since the 1960s, has collaborated on a new production with the German sound artist Hans Peter Kuhn. The result, brought by the Hebbel-Theater, Berlin, is arresting, bizarre, ironic, droll, absorbing, fascinating. At surface level, Stein's text is a post-Lewis Carroll-array of rhyming nonsense jokes. Because Marlowe had his Faustus fall for Helen of Troy, whereas Goethe's Faust falls for Marguerite, Stein's Faustus falls for a heroine who is called 'Marguerite Ida and Helena Annabel'. And because Faustus chooses to go to Hell, Stein deliberately confuses her story with that of Eurydice (who was killed by a viper) and Orpheus (who went to Hell to retrieve her), and makes Mr Viper a recurrent theme in her tale-no-tale of Doctor Faustus and Marguerite Ida and Helena Annabel. (At the start of Act Two, someone asks 'Would the viper have stung her if she had only had one name?'). Faustus, like Julia in A Wedding Bouquet, has a dog played by a girl. Beneath this entertaining absurdist facade, you can sense Stein the dissident feminist. She rewrites Faustus's story to make him a scientist; he has created electric light, he is hellbent on going to Hell, and, when he rejuvenates himself, he loses Marguerite Ida and Helena Annabel forever - because she no longer recognises him. The feeling of hero and heroine for each other is constantly ambivalent; and you feel Stein's resentment of the role traditionally played by Marguerite as Faustus's ideal and victim and saviour. Wilson's staging, at every stage elegant and incisive, goes for every bizarrerie and irony in Stein's text and compounds them with others. Three Faustuses; three Marguerite Idas; two Mephistos. A nine-foot-tall countrywoman played by a man on stilts beneath his skirts. Image after image strikes you with the same ironic visual force that keeps bubbling up in the text. Devils hover aloft; Faustuses lean out sideways from the proscenium arch. Light and dark are contrasted in one way after another; abstract forms and hues catch and intensify meanings in the text. At one point, Wilson catches all the ambiguities of the Faustus-Marguerite love-death victim-viper-killer nexus, by making one Faustus advance to plant his snarling mouth on one Marguerite's neck like some vampire snake, only to find that in so doing he impales himself on the blade that she impassively holds in her hand. Meanwhile, another Marguerite, wandering with a candle, at last unites its light with the electric light that has hung over Faustus. In an earlier treatment of the viper bite, as we hear all three Marguerites scream, a gash of red suddenly cleaves the black sky, like a rising red poker. Kuhn's music is in post-Satie vein, full of sub-vaudeville tunes and muted oompah rhythms that almost become tangos. The German cast speak their English with utter clarity, though with even more staccato emphasis than appropriate. The fact that Stein was turning language into music is made beautifully clear, and every metre is pointed deliciously - but Kuhn's music and the actors' delivery could profit from a bit more legato and dynamic variety. But if this staging falters in its handling of the fourth dimension (time), Stein's text keeps it lively. And it is always clear that the three dimensions of space (and light) are being handled by a master.</p>

During these talks the leaders of the opposition groups  explained their views on ways of restoring tranquillity and  security in that country and stressed the need for establishment  of democracy by involving all the forces of Tajikistan in  running the country's affairs.    These talks are taking place with approval of the present  government in Tajikistan, UN support, and cooperation of the  Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI]. The IRI, which is striving to  restore peace in combination with tranquillity and stability in  Tajikistan, stressed from the beginning that the military option  cannot solve this country's political and economic problems; and  the only way of resolving Tajikistan's difficulties is  establishment of national reconciliation government.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Jobs warning as Scholey retires from British Steel SIR ROBERT Scholey brought down the curtain yesterday on his 47-year career in the steel industry with a warning that British Steel could reduce its costs further and would emerge from the recession 'as sharp as a knife.' Speaking at his last annual meeting as chairman of the struggling UK steel maker, Sir Robert said: 'We shall shrink not in terms of tonnage produced but in terms of labour costs. The days when steel could be seen as a large employer of people are over.' His statement coincided with the announcement that British Steel had signed a definitive agreement with Avesta which will lead to the merger of the Swedish stainless steel producer and virtually all British Steel's stainless operations. Preliminary agreement on the deal, which creates a new force in the world stainless industry, was announced on June 29. Yesterday, Sir Robert said such strategic alliances were necessary in Europe, 'and most probably a requirement on a more global basis, and will, I believe, go a long way to resolving the current problems of the world steel industry.' His warning of further job cuts echoed the company's position when it announced - also on June 29 - its Pounds 55m pre-tax loss for 1991-92. The workforce was cut by 7,000 during the year to 44,800, and, with the closure of Ravenscraig in Scotland and concentration of hot rolled coil production in South Wales, is expected to dip below 42,000 by the end of the current financial year. Sir Robert regretted that his last AGM came at a time when trading conditions were so difficult. He will be replaced as chairman by Sir Alistair Frame. The outgoing chairman paid tribute to two British Steel directors who are also retiring, Mr Frank Fitzgerald and Sir Derek Birkin. See People</p>

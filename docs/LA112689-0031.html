			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 'REAL' TV WOMAN  </P> <P> There has been much criticism of the portrayal of women in the new crop of TV  shows this fall, but there is one show I want to commend.  </P> <P> That show is "Peaceable Kingdom." Somehow, in the midst of America's TV  wasteland, this show successfully portrays: a woman in a leadership position  who is competent at both management and parenting; realistic conflict among  adults; a message of ecological concern and value; real-life child-rearing  issues that interest kids of nearly all ages; no unrealistic or gratuitous  violence and sex, just reasonably healthy relationships and normal motivations.  </P> <P> Wher else on the major networks can we find so much to admire -- and enjoy --  in one hour?  </P> <P> PAUL M. DU BOIS  </P> <P> San Rafael, Calif.  </P> <P>  "Peaceable Kingdom," which stars Lindsay Wagner as a zoo director, has been  canceled. It will disappear Dec. 6.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'ELECTRIC MONDAY' AT UCLA IS ECLECTIC AND EFFECTIVE  </P> <P> For his "Electric Monday" program in Schoenberg Auditorium at UCLA, Roger  Bourland assembled a diverse group of pieces mixing live performance with  electronics. The effort proved long on whimsy and sonic color, generally more  soothing than stretching for both ear and mind.  </P> <P> The centerpiece was the West Coast premiere of Bourland's own Portable  Concerto, for viola and tape. A pair of bumptious moto semi-perpetuo movements  surrounding an effectively brooding aria of depth as well as surface sheen, it  is a pert and pretty, thoroughly tonal bit of chamber pop.  </P> <P> Evan Wilson of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the UCLA faculty played it with  vigorous, crisply accented abandon and generous lyric spirit. Balances favored  the synthesized tape and the amplification gave a gritty cast to Wilson's  sound, but the easy joys of the work were readily apparent.  </P> <P> "The Question Mark's Black Ink" by Bill Alves gave equally agreeable and  pertinent work to pianist Vicki Ray and percussionist Erik Forrester, in a  structurally and stylistically more diffuse and subtle idiom. It presents a  poised ensemble sound, the acoustic instruments shadowed by electronic ghosts,  in a sort of post-minimalist version of English change ringing.  </P> <P> The toughest piece on the agenda, in every sense, was William Kraft's  "Soliloquy: Encounters I," from 1975. Percussionist Kathryn Dayak handled its  formidable challenges with concentrated power and point -- albeit a pronounced  sense of sectional discontinuity -- proving particularly effective in the  bravura cadenza for muffled vibraphone.  </P> <P> Marilyn Donadt's "Who Needs a Gazebo?" combined her Nigerian drumming with  metrically goosed synthesized ostinatos as an accompaniment for five dancers  from Julie McLeod's Improv, Inc. of Santa Barbara. The dance was a fluid,  evocative ritual, playing with dangling tassles of Larry Sloan's spare set and  easily buoyed on Donadt's pulsating waves of sophisticated neo-primitivism.  </P> <P> Donadt's "YooHoo Chorus" and "Holy Cow" seemed like cryptic variations on the  same theme/joke. Musically both are electronic collages of vocal crys --  "yoo-hoo" and "holy cow," of course -- with mime-based movement elaborations  from Improv, Inc., playing with hats in the former and dark glasses in the  latter.  </P> <P> Larry Lipkis' "Prophecies" challenged the vocally raw and unblended UCLA  ElectriChoir with its neo-modal chant-like mysteries, though conductor  Stephanie Henry shaped the singing carefully. David Crane's explosive little  shop of electronic horrors, "Cimetiere," completed the program. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

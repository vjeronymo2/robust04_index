			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Tokyo expected to announce resumption of aid to Iran THE Japanese government is expected this week to announce the resumption of yen credits to Iran, ending a 17-year embargo and marking the second important foreign policy change since the US presidential election, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Provision of the fresh credits, apparently Y30bn (Pounds 152m) for a dam and hydroelectric power project, will follow the government's decision on Friday to end a 13-year ban on economic aid to Vietnam. The timing of the two decisions reflects Tokyo's belief that the period before Governor Bill Clinton's inauguration as president should be used to announce potentially controversial policy changes. Japanese companies have wanted the government to resume economic assistance to Iran, which they believe offers potential for lucrative contracts for infrastructure work and industrial equipment. Most Japanese car makers have sharply increased their exports to Iran this year, while Nissho Iwai, the trading house, has just won an Y8bn contract to supply oil exploration equipment. Mitsubishi Corp, another trading house, was part of an international consortium recently awarded rights to develop a natural gas field. Japan is aware that the new credits could prompt criticism from the US. The ban on assistance was maintained in sympathy with US concerns about missing military personnel in Vietnam.</p>

He  had flown to Orel together with Viktor Chernomyrdin. The reason  for the economic problems is that the Russian Government has  built up a debt of approximately 250 billion rubles with various  Moscow organizations and enterprises over the past year.    The supply of vital foodstuffs, goods, and services to  Muscovites is threatened with disruption.</p>

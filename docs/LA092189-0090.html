			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEMPLE CITY RETAINS ITS SIGN LAW BUT WON'T ENFORCE IT  </P> <P> Even though two civil rights law groups have criticized a Temple City ordinance  that requires that half of any business sign use Roman characters, the City  Council didn't blink on Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "I don't respond well to intimidation," said Councilman Ken Gillanders, who  supported the ordinance when it was adopted in 1985.  </P> <P> The council agreed not to rescind the ordinance but instructed the city staff  not to enforce it while modifications are being considered -- a move that  apparently mollified opponents of the sign law.  </P> <P> "As long as we can come to a compromise we can live with, no legal action would  be taken," said Kathryn Imahara, attorney for the Asian Pacific American Legal  Center of Southern California.  </P> <P> Imahara said, however, that suspending enforcement wouldn't be enough. "As far  as we're concerned, just lifting the enforcement still has a chilling effect  because the city can always turn around again and enforce it," she said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based legal center had joined forces with the American Civil  Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California to challenge the ordinance,  which they said is discriminatory.  </P> <P> The law groups are willing to help Temple City "pull together an ordinance that  meets the needs of the city and which withstands constitutional challenge,"  Imahara said.  </P> <P> Temple City's ordinance was adopted in part because law enforcement officials  said they might have trouble finding addresses while responding to emergencies.  Also, some residents hoped to prevent a proliferation of foreign-language  signs.  </P> <P> Bob Pitts, a 25-year resident of Temple City, said after Tuesday's meeting that  he supports the ordinance "because I want to be able to drive down the streets  and be able to recognize what kind of commercial vendors are there. It's not my  goal to learn the foreign languages."  </P> <P> The decision not to rescind the ordinance didn't dissuade attorneys for the two  civil rights groups from planning to challenge similar ordinances in San  Gabriel, Rosemead and Arcadia.  </P> <P> Letters asking those three cities to voluntarily rescind language requirements  in their sign ordinances will be sent soon, Imahara said.  </P> <P> A similar ordinance in Pomona was struck down in July by U.S. District Judge  Robert Takasugi, who said language requirements in that city violated  residents' constitutional rights to free speech and commercial speech and  discriminated on the basis of national origin. After that ruling, Temple City  suspended enforcement of its own ordinance.  </P> <P> Pomona city officials have chosen not to appeal Takasugi's ruling, making the  decision binding on Southern California communities that still have such  ordinances on their books, Imahara said.  </P> <P> In a Sept. 6 letter to Temple City officials, attorneys for the two groups  asked the council to voluntarily repeal its ordinance.  </P> <P> Mayor Patrick Froehle said the council is not saying it will never rescind the  ordinance. "We really don't have facts to make that judgment," he said.  </P> <P> Froehle suggested that city officials meet with attorneys for the law groups to  "at least see what a compromise ordinance would be."  </P></p>

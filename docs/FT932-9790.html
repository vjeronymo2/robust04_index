			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook and Itel reject agreed bid for TIP Europe TWO shareholders controlling 9 per cent of TIP Europe, the trailer rental company, have said they will not accept the recommended offer for the company from GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric of the US. The two are Tiphook, which holds 5.5 per cent and is TIP's main competitor, and Itel Corporation, a US distribution concern. The companies said GE's offer was 'wholly inadequate' and did not reflect TIP's long term earnings potential. The first closing date for the 42p a share cash offer is today, although no details are expected until tomorrow. Tiphook's move seemed designed to frustrate GE's plans to build a trailer rental business in Europe, or wrest a higher price for control of TIP. The announcement was described as a 'commercial spoiling tactic' by Mr Richard Gillingwater, managing director corporate finance at BZW, adviser to TIP. Itel said it was reacting to an 'undercurrent of sentiment' from other shareholders that the sale was poorly timed at the offer price. Itel felt TIP's earnings would recover in step with the European economies. The rejection of the offer is likely to give pause to institutions sizing up GE's bid. Institutions are having to weigh the options of taking cash now or waiting for a recovery in TIP's main markets. The offer price was at a steep premium to TIP's share price before the bid of 25 1/2 p, but well below the share's trading level in 1990, when they collapsed from 175p as recession hit. TIP also has a large number of individual shareholders; their view of GE's offer is difficult to assess. Tiphook is unlikely to make a counter offer for TIP because of monopoly considerations. According to analysts, other bidders are unlikely because of the high gearing involved in truck rental and because of the depressed market. TIP shares closed unchanged yesterday at 41 1/2p.</p>

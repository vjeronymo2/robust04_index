			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets watch Euro election results - Currency Markets Foreign exchange traders will start the week by trying to assess the impact of the European elections held yesterday and last Thursday. The countries they will be watching most closely are the UK and Spain where the ruling parties are weak and vulnerable to an electoral setback. Last Friday sterling shrugged off a dismal, but widely expected, set of by-election results for the Tory party. Another setback in the European poll, however, would inevitably reopen speculation about the political future of Mr John Major, the prime minister. He has vowed that he will not be driven out of office, but the political uncertainty preceding a leadership challenge in the autumn could weigh on sterling. Some observers argue that a change in Tory leadership could be well received by the market. Others maintain that the possibility of a Labour government is not in the market, and political developments which increase this prospect may well undermine sterling. Sterling watchers will also have a barrage of economic data on which to feed. The retail sales and average earnings figures will be closely watched. An expected rise in the latter will encourage the Bank of England to argue for a tightening of monetary policy. Markets will also keep a close eye on the Mansion House speech of Mr Kenneth Clark, the chancellor. The speech is traditionally a monetary policy set-piece and will be combed for any hints on the future passage of interest rates. In Spain the European elections coincide with regional elections in Andalucia, the stronghold of the socialist government. A setback there will arguably be as damaging as the predicted defeat at the hand of the conservative Popular party in the European poll. The risk is that if the Socialists do very badly, they will lose the backing of their Catalan allies, which would precipitate an election. This uncertainty would undermine Spanish financial markets and the peseta. The US also faces a heavy week of financial data which should give analysts a better picture of second quarter growth and the likelihood of another near-term tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. The May consumer price index is released on Tuesday, but other indicators include the Atlanta and Philadelphia Fed indices, retail sales, housing starts, industrial output and capacity utilisation for May. Analysts believe the data should be good for the bond market, which, if recent performance is anything to go by, will help the dollar.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Turkish premier promises end to fighting TURKEY'S prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, yesterday promised to find a peaceful solution to violent unrest in south-eastern Turkey in spite of a third day of fighting in the area and a vow by Kurdish groups to launch a campaign of civil insurrection. Mr Demirel's first comments on the crisis came amid reports of continuing clashes in Sirnak and Cizre in south-eastern Turkey, as security forces sought to restore order after the worst violence in the eight-year-old Kurdish troubles. More than 60 people were killed in weekend clashes between security forces and Kurdish demonstrators marking the start of the Kurdish new year in a string of towns from the Syrian border through to Van, near the border with Iran. In London, a Kurdish spokesman said the weekend violence left Turkey's Kurds with 'no alternative but to go to war' and said rebel groups were mounting a campaign of insurrection. Mr Akif Hassan, spokesman for the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan, a political affiliate of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which is outlawed in Turkey, said Kurds would 'mobilise in every town, city and in every part of life' in a 'mass popular uprising'. He claimed the government had forsaken any chance of a negotiated solution to the Kurdish issue and instead had sent 'two thirds of the Turkish army' into the region. 'Since peaceful means have been rejected,' he said, 'blood will be shed.' Mr Hassan claimed the weekend's fighting had left 88 Kurdish dead, including 29 in and around Cizre, 24 in Sirnak and 15 in the town of Nusaybin. Kurds in Brussels smashed windows at the Turkish embassy in Brussels yesterday, while more than 150 Kurds occupied a European Parliament building for over five hours. Turkey's official Anatolian news agency reported that demonstrators supporting the PKK opened fire yesterday on government and police buildings in Cizre. Army troop carriers were reported to have returned fire, but there was no immediate word on casualties. In Sirnak the interior ministry reported that security forces had cleared the streets amid unconfirmed reports from Kurdish groups in London that Turkish aircraft had bombed the town centre. This week's violence represents a severe blow to hopes of an early breakthrough in the troubles on the back of Mr Demirel's promise of Kurdish reform. The prime minister at the head of an uneasy coalition is now expected to face growing pressure from the army and conservatives in his own party to take a strong hand against the PKK. Widespread arrests were again reported throughout the region as shopkeepers refused to open, public transport came to a standstill, and children stayed away from school in sympathy with the demonstrators. In Istanbul, 17 people were arrested as police tightened security in anticipation of further PKK violence in Turkey's western cities. After sporadic clashes throughout the winter months, the government is now preparing to head off the spring offensive by the PKK, as it seeks to increase its influence in the south-east.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRIEDKIN'S 'GUARDIAN' OPENS AFI FEST TONIGHT;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL: THE AMBITIOUS GLOBAL PROGRAM WILL LAST TWO WEEKS AND OFFER MORE THAN  200 TITLES.  </P> <P> The 1990 American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival has  its gala opening tonight with the world premiere of William Friedkin's "The  Guardian" -- a supernatural shocker that returns the director of "The Exorcist"  to his old stomping and slashing ground, the horror-thriller genre. On May 3,  the festival closes with the premiere of the restored version of Stanley  Donen's "Funny Face."  </P> <P> The two American films, both showing at the Cineplex Century Plaza in Century  City, the festival's main venue, book-end a fat, two-week-long, 200-plus titles  program that probably represents the peak of the AFI festival's four-year  existence. This ambitious global program includes films from Western Europe,  Asia, Australia, Africa and Latin America; a "Hollywood Glasnost" special  section on Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries that unearths many long-banned  gems; and a strong program of independent black American films.  </P> <P> Also setting off the 1990 AFI Fest are the retrospectives planned for two great  rarely-seen European filmmakers -- Greek director Theo Angelopoulos and  Poland's Krzysztof Kieslowski.  </P> <P> The Times' film reviewing staff -- Sheila Benson, Kevin Thomas, Peter Rainer,  Chris Willman and myself -- covered most of the first week in last Sunday's  Calendar. Here's an update, with special recommendations on movies screened  since then.  </P> <P> Highly recommended: "Sitting Pretty on a Branch" (Czechoslovakia),  "Recollections of the Yellow House" (Portugal), "A Tribute to Charles and Ray  Eames" (U.S.), "Love Among the Ruins" (U.S.).  </P> <P> Recommended: "Samsara" (China), "Queen of the Stardust Ballroom" (U.S.).  </P> <P> In "Recollections of the Yellow House" (April 21), writer-director-star Joao  Cesar Montiero, a skeletal looking bird, a sorrowful bookworm-buzzard, takes  self-mockery and self-abasement far past Woody Allen. This film, which follows  Montiero's quasi-autobiographical mishaps as a down-and-out intellectual in a  bedbug-ridden Lisbon boarding house -- resembles Woody mixed with Dostoevski,  Knut Hamsun and Louis-Ferdinand Celine: three literary monarchs of the lower  depths whom Montiero occasionally quotes and often evokes. It's a painful  comedy that goes unusually dark and deep; it was a Silver Lion winner at the  last Venice Film Festival.  </P> <P> Of the tribute to Charles and Ray Eames (April 21, 22), Sheila Benson reminds  us that "the multi-talented Eameses represent a slice of time and place to  Southern Californians" and feels that "this selection of the Eameses' own work,  plus a marvelous, lively film on them by grandson Eames Demetrios, does them  complete justice."  </P> <P> According to Benson, "Sitting Pretty on a Branch" (April 26), a comic fairy  tale on the aftermath of World War II by Czechoslovakia's Juraj Jaku Bisko, is  a "magical film" and "a return to the great '60s period of Czechoslovakian  cinema."  </P> <P> Kevin Thomas considers writer James Costigan's "Love Among the Ruins" (April  24, AFI Mark Goodson), a 1976 made-for-TV courtroom comedy with Katharine  Hepburn as a haughty breach-of-promise defendant and Laurence Olivier as her  love-struck barrister, "director George Cukor's last great work . . . tinged  with as much pathos as hilarity." Thomas also recommends Sam O'Steen's  "Stardust Ballroom" (April 25), a "poignant 1975 made-for-TV love story," with  Maureen Stapleton and Charles Durning.  </P> <P> Director Huang Jianxin's "Samsara" (April 22) is a Chinese film, made before  the bloody May-June demonstrations, about a weak young man from the provinces  drifting through the Peking underworld and slowly tarnishing his life and love.  On one level, it's a familiar cautionary fable of big-city evil; its prime  interest comes from its iconoclastic, offbeat views of a Mainland China now  more closed to us.  </P> <P> Ted Lange's low-budget "Othello" (April 26), with the one-time "ooo-eee" king  of "The Love Boat" directing, adapting and playing the title role -- is a  threadbare, labored, slightly over-sexy production, notable for its innovative  black Iago (Hawthorne James). Thomas found Jean-Jacques Andrien's "Australia"  (April 26) -- which, naturally enough, comes from Belgium -- "a decidedly  pretentious title for a tedious, long-winded film" about homecomings and steamy  affairs. Chris Willman thinks Margareta Kasimova's U.S.S.R. film, "Today and  Always" (April 21), about a young actress bucking the provincial Muslim  patriarchy, is "an interesting curiosity, with no consistency of tone."  </P> <P> A long-time Duke Ellington fan, I liked "Sophisticated Lady" (April 21, AFI  Mark Goodson), a documentary about Adelaide Hall, a Cotton Club chorus girl who  popularized "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby" in the '20s and did the  growling, wordless lead vocal in Ellington's "Creole Love Call."  </P> <P> Willman found "Painting the Town: The Illusionistic Murals of Richard Haas"  (April 22, 24) a "feel-good documentary" about city muralist Haas, which may  suffer from "unrelenting positivism" but "stands up as a pretty good, breezy  look at a rare sort of upbeat American phenomenon."  </P> <P> Festival information: (213) 480-2323 or 856-7707.  </P></p>

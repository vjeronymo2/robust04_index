			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces </F> for the Liberation of Angola in Huambo on 3 June]    [Text] While efforts are under way in Lusaka to achieve  peace in Angola, the MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] is stepping up its nationwide  offensive. The aim is to hinder the peace process. Of the  various actions that have been carried out, the following are  the most relevant:    Huambo Province: On 3 June 1994, the city of Huambo was once  again bombed by two Su-22 formations at 1104 and at 1334. The  aircraft dropped 16 napalm and phosphorous bombs, destroying  several houses, and killing and wounding a large number of  civilians.    Lunda Province: On 3 June 1994, two Su-22 formations bombed  Canfunfo at 1105 and 1205, killing and wounding many people. In  all those raids, the Luanda air force hit mainly hospitals,  schools, and defenseless civilians.    Bie Province: On 2 and 3 June 1994, the MPLA-PT air force  dropped bombs over its own defensive positions in the city of  Bie [Cuito], killing and wounding many government troops and  civilians. Intense clashes have been taking place in the city  of Bie since 26 May 1994, when enemy forces once again violated  the unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] on 20 September 1993.    In view of all those provocations, UNITA has no option but  to  defend itself.    [Issued] Huambo, 3 June 1994    [Signed] Army General Arlindo Chenda Isaac Pena Ben-Ben</p>

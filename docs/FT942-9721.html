			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Clinton names Breyer for Supreme Court President Bill Clinton last night nominated Mr Stephen Breyer, the federal appeals judge from Boston, to fill the seat on the US Supreme Court left vacant by the retirement of Justice Harry Blackmun. Judge Breyer needs confirmation by the US Senate but all evidence this week was that opposition would be minimal and certainly less than promised for the other two finalists on the president's short list - Mr Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, and Judge Richard Arnold from Arkansas, a distinguished jurist and old friend of the president who has some persistent heath problems. Mr Clinton made the announcement yesterday evening after a week of much media-generated speculation. Judge Breyer was not present but will appear with Mr Clinton at a more formal ceremony next week. The judge, who is 55 and a graduate of Harvard University law school, was himself a finalist last summer for the last vacancy on the nine-member court eventually filled by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Mr Clinton is the first Democratic president to nominate a justice since 1967. Judge Breyer's judicial philosophy, like that of Justice Ginsburg, is moderate-to-liberal. Mr Clinton said yesterday he was 'one of the outstanding jurists of our age', with 'a remarkable ability to explain complex subjects in simple terms'. The likely practical effect of the two appointments is to kill any conservatives' hope that the judicial revolution promised by President Ronald Reagan would be carried through. The constitutional guarantee of a woman's right to abortion provided by the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling now seems safe. But the immediate changes in the balance of the court may be small, since the outgoing Justice Blackmun, appointed by President Richard Nixon in 1971, had evolved over the years into the court's most liberal member. Based on his judicial record, Judge Breyer will strengthen the bench's centre, now occupied by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter and Ginsburg. He has strong British connections. Not only did he attend Oxford University, but he is the brother-in-law of Viscount Blakenham, chairman of Pearson, parent company of the Financial Times.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Occhetto tries to break free from communist past: The leader of Italy's PDS must convince the world his party could form a credible government Mr Achille Occhetto, the 57-year-old leader of Italy's Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), has launched a charm offensive. Fresh from his party's success in the first round of local elections last Sunday, he is now trying to convince Italians, and the international community at large, that the PDS is no longer a prisoner of its communist past and that it could form the credible core of a future government. The lira lost ground early last week because speculators reacted with alarm to the prospect that former communists might dominate Italy's next government. Thus, the first stage of Mr Occhetto's offensive was his call early in the week to the financial markets for calm. This he followed by indicating his willingness to help the government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to ensure the passage of the 1994 budget legislation - vital for Italy's international credibility. He also submitted himself to a critical grilling from European Union ambassadors on his party's economic policy. As he talks about PDS strategy, in the same imposing offices that once housed the defunct Italian Communist party (PCI), Mr Occhetto seems to have dropped his often criticised ambiguity. He has sensed the whiff of power, and he is obliged to define what the PDS stands for. The budget will be a key test: the Ciampi government will resign if the legislation fails to pass. Mr Occhetto wants to avoid this at all costs. He would prefer the PDS to abstain and avoid associating with a discredited Christian Democrat-led majority. 'But', he says, 'if the old centrist majority disappears in parliament, we are prepared to assume our responsibility (and vote) to approve the budget on condition that parliament is dissolved immediately thereafter.' Although 2,500 amendments have been tabled in parliament, he believes the budget will pass in time, before the end of December. He argues for early dissolution, saying, 'This parliament has reached the limits of its credibility. There are too many people there who no longer represent the electorate to whom they are responsible.' However, Mr Occhetto has been closer to the Ciampi government than is often recognised. Three PDS ministers were chosen by the prime minister, but withdrawn by Mr Occhetto because the four-party coalition backing the government voted to retain parliamentary immunity privileges to avoid corruption enquiries. Mr Occhetto describes this vote as 'morally unacceptable'. However, the withdrawal of the ministers, only 10 hours after being sworn in, enabled him to head off a potential storm. He clearly feels better equipped to oppose internal criticism and is open in the way he 'appreciates' the present government's efforts to reduce Italy's huge public sector deficit. A PDS-based government, he says, would 'continue the restructuring of public finances and the reorganisation of the civil service'. The idea of a 'spendthrift' left, feeding a large public sector, was over. Funds needed to relaunch the economy would have to be found without increasing debt levels. He says much can be done by selling off the state's huge stock of property, worth L30,000bn (Pounds 12bn). A late convert to privatisation, Mr Occhetto says he will not oppose the plans already under way. However, the PDS would seek to give more direction to industrial policy and encourage more research. His main concern is job creation, and this is where a progressive government would place more emphasis. He endorses the idea of 'solidarity contracts' - in the form of job-sharing or a reduced working week - to get round the recession. This is a long way from the prevailing party ideology in 1988, when he was first elected head of the Communist party. It is also a remarkable evolution from the founding days of the PDS in February 1991. But he is not surprised: 'There had long been a social democrat strain in the PCI. . . that had similarities with Germany's SPD.' The party proudly wears its label of the Left and has been admitted to the Socialist International. Yet, when pressed to define the nature of the modern Italian left, Mr Occhetto is without a quick slogan; nor does he refer to the welfare state. Endorsement of the proposed 1994 budget would mean rolling back welfare benefits and pension privileges. A sore point, too, is the unresolved rivalry with former fellow members of the Communist party who split to form the hardline Reconstructed Communism with nearly 10 per cent of the old membership. He is selling himself as the leader of the first party to break with the past. He insists that the party has not been involved in systematic corruption and blames the Christian Democrats and Socialists as the worst offenders. But he is cynical about the real culprits being punished. 'In this country you catch the robbers, not the assassins,' he observes with wry humour. Although some 112 PDS affiliates have fallen foul of corruption investigations, this has yet to affect voter support. The PDS is attracting some 16 per cent of the vote nationwide. To obtain power, Mr Occhetto was astute enough to realise early the need for alliances: 'It has required great patience to get this idea across. We are a moderate force, the only one capable of drawing the disparate forces on the left together.' The PDS is the sole party with a national organisation, inherited from the Communist party. Through this, the PDS has established a series of local alliances with the Greens, Radicals, left-wing Catholics, former Socialists, even some Communists, and some dissident Christian Democrats. 'The country is not yet ready for an Anglo-Saxon division into two parties,' he says. 'The next elections will be fought between two big coalitions on the left and the right; the moderates in the centre (essentially the ruling four-party coalition) will divide between those ready to govern with the left and those ready to govern with the right.' He has got a head start by laying the ground for such a coalition on the left in local elections. He now has to mould this at the national level.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Norway's EC plans go ahead NORWEGIAN sentiment about Europe is little changed from 20 years ago when it rejected European Community membership - a poll published yesterday showed 50.1 per cent opposed to joining. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, intends none the less to lodge a fresh membership application before the end of 1992. She expects to be given a mandate to reapply during the Labour Party congress in November. With support of the main opposition Conservative and Progress Parties, Mrs Brundtland will have the necessary parliamentary backing.</p>

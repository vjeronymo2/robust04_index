			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Distinction Sir, The price of the FT is worth it for the articles by your excellent TV critic, Christopher Dunkley, alone. In 'Up with sex, down with violence' (November 24), he correctly shows the proper distinction and encourages those of us who would like to see more freedom of expression on TV for the things we enjoy (like sex) while deploring the depiction of aggressive and violent behaviour. Those in continental Europe seem to understand the difference - why not we British? David Bennington, 29 Morford Way, Eastcote, Ruislip, Middx HA4 8SL</p>

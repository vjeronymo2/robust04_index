			<p>BFN     [Text] Both the Japanese and Russian Governments, which  have been discussing measures to prevent Moscow from resuming  dumping of radioactive waste into the sea, have agreed to  dispose of radioactive waste by constructing small facilities  which float on the water. The design is currently being worked  out. Construction is expected to begin this summer and be  finished early next year. Since the Russian Government has  pledged "not to resume dumping into waters earlier than the  facilities are completed," radioactive waste dumping into the  Sea of Japan will be avoided for the time being if the plan  proceeds smoothly.    Russia has asked Japan to help construct such facilities.  The two governments have been coordinating details of the plan.    The facilities will be constructed in a harbor in the  suburbs  of Vladivostok, and they are capable of storing approximately  800 tons of radioactive waste. Three tanks -- for storing,  processing, and solidifying radioactive waste -- will be  installed on a ship, and the waste will be put in drums.  Construction costs are expected to reach $20 or $30 million and  will be covered by Japan's $100-million program for assisting  the denuclearization of the former Soviet Union. This plan is  regarded as an emergency measure to prevent dumping of  radioactive waste into the sea.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The keynote in the maiden speech of the  new chairman was the importance of the struggle against the left  wing. Our reporter Edit Schranz asked him about this.    [Begin recording] [Schranz] Lajos Fur, you are the chairman  of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]. In the speech you  delivered after your election, you said that the stakes at the  elections in May will be the same again -- that was how you put  it: Will there be democracy, or to be more precise, will  democracy remain? Because, you said, the left wing today wants  to regain power. Would you tell us what you meant by that? Or  rather, could we understand it to mean also that if the left  wing were to win in the '94 elections, then democracy could be  endangered in Hungary?    [Fur] Yes, that is precisely what it's about. I said here  too that they could hijack -- they could divert from its path --  the process that we began, which, with its circumspect policies,  I am convinced serves the country's real interests.    And with the left wing, unfortunately, ideological factors  always come to the forefront -- some kind of ideological things  -- and these ideological matters usually divert the truth from  the channel in which it usually flows naturally.    [Schranz] Just one question: Even during the MDF period,  accusations were been leveled at it that, from certain points of  view, it [word indistinct] in, or it brings in ideology into  this or that decision. What is your opinion?    [Fur] They were wrong, false accusations and slanders. [end  recording]</p>

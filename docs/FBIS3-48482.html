			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of International </F> Trade and Industry, by ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter Kenji Takeuchi;  place and date not given; first paragraph is introduction by  Kenji Takeuchi]    [Text] The political situation has become further  confused due to the disapproval of political reform bills by the  House of Councilors at its plenary session. The government and  ruling coalition parties failed to carry out their scenario that  "efforts will be concentrated on working out economic stimulus  measures and on dealing with the new Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks so as to tide over the Japan-U.S. summit talks  scheduled for 11 February." We asked Hiroshi Kumagai, minister  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], to  express his views on how to deal with the situation in his  capacity as the cabinet member responsible for economic policies  and trade negotiations, and also on an incident that took place  toward last year-end in which he and MITI officials were at odds  over personnel affairs.    [Takeuchi] What will happen to measures for stimulating the  economy?    [Kumagai] There is no choice but to put them off. If the  House of Councilors had approved the political reform bills, we  would have started dealing with the issue the same evening.  However, under this unstable political situation, there is  nothing we can do. If we should fail to achieve the political  reform as soon as possible, we will have troubles.  <H5>  Difficulty in Conducting Coordination Among Ruling Parties </H5>   [Takeuchi] Why is it that priority cannot be given to  working out economic stimulus measures, which is now an urgent  task?    [Kumagai] It will not do to use tricks in working out  measures this time. Nor can we expect any good effects. It  will be necessary to work out measures while taking into  consideration such issues as how to create the Japan of the next  age and how to reform the economic structure. At the same time,  we also have to settle other important issues. For example,  there are issues on the scale and allotment of tax cut; on how  to secure financial resources for this purpose; and on how to  distribute funds for public works projects. For this purpose,  political coordination must be conducted among various circles  with different interests. However, we cannot tackle those  issues without settling the issue of political reform while  relations among the ruling coalition parties remain tense. I  hope our people will understand that the situation is different  from the situation under the one-party rule of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP].    [Takeuchi] Do you mean that the people will have to "wait"?    [Kumagai] No, that's not what I mean. However, the final  decision on these measures can be made only when the issue of  the political framework has been decided. We have been studying  the economic stimulus measures at the working level and have  entered the stage of the political-level coordination now. That  is the very reason why we have kept stressing "the importance of  political reform."    [Takeuchi] The MITI bureau concerned and the Ministry of  Finance [MOF] have worked out an economic stimulus package  mainly consisting of "plans to win approval for implementing an  income tax cut and for consumption tax increase at the same time  and to implement an income tax cut in advance." Negotiations  are under way now to lay the groundwork for this purpose. I  understand that it has been criticized that "the bureaucrats are  trying to have their own way." What do you think of it?    [Kumagai] We give our full support to their efforts.  Officials concerned are making moves with the approval of both  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and myself. We can make no  compromise on a plan to win approval for the tax raise and tax  cut at the same time. Without this approval, we will end up in  issuing deficit-covering bonds without limit and lose public  trust in our policies. I myself have said that "support will be  given to the MOF to the very end." I think Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa shares the same understanding with me.    [Takeuchi] However, a negative stance on the package has  been voiced not only by the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ], but also by others, including the Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party].    [Kumagai] If compromise should be made at the present stage,  the package plans may easily be abolished one by one. It is  true that it is not easy to overcome opposition against the  package. The final decision will be made through deliberations  among the ruling coalition parties. However, we are determined  to carry out many debates.  <H5>  Negotiations To Be Concluded Before Summit Meeting </H5>   [Takeuchi] The Japan-U.S. framwork talks are deadlocked. In  particular, there is an impasse in the negotiations on  automobiles and auto parts, which are under the MITI's  jurisdiction. How will the present political turmoil affect the  negotiations?    [Kumagai] Since negotiations on macroeconomic policy,  including the issue of Japanese economic stimulation measures,  are an important component of the framework talks, this delay in  pump-priming measures is a serious problem. However, it is  wrong to say that "there has been no progress at all in  negotiations in specific sectors." From the beginning, Japan  has asserted that "automobiles is a private sector problem."  Moreover, the Hosokawa administration is trying to change the  relationship between the government and the private sector. We  have also stressed that the government does not intend to issue  orders to the private sector. I think the United States has  come to understand us more on this point. As the trade  imbalance actually exists, we also think that coexistence and  coprosperity under the principle of expanded equilibrium is  necessary. Nevertheless, we cannot accept numerical targets.    [Takeuchi] The United States has been criticizing the  bureaucracy.    [Kumagai] If the United States thinks that there are  differences in views between myself and the administrative  staff, then that is a misunderstanding. However, if they want  to talk with a cabinet minister, I am ready at all times. In  any case, we would like to conclude the negotiations before the  Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February. For the Hosokawa  administration, the framework talks have been inherited from the  LDP administration. The summit meeting should also not be  adversely affected by the talks. I hope the summit will dwell  on cooperation on a global scale, and signal the start of a new  Japan-U.S. relationship.  <H5>  Rule Violations Should Not Be Tolerated </H5>   [Takeuchi] While you seem to agree completely with your  administrative staff on policy, there was criticism against  "uncalled-for political interference in the bureaucratic  organization" in relation to the resignation of Masahisa Naito,  director general of the Industrial Policy Bureau.    [Kumagai] It was not my intention to raise the greater issue  of the relationship between the bureaucracy and politicians in  that affair. For me, it was simply a question of what to do  with a lingering problem. I would like to ask the critics in  return, "should the problem be left untouched?" There was a  clear violation of rules, and this has been exposed to the  public. If nothing was done about this, it would mean rules can  be ignored.    [Takeuchi] The critics say that "it is unfair that those who  circulated the mysterious document [exposing irregularities in  MITI personnel matters] were not punished."    [Kumagai] If you want to talk about the mysterious letter,  what happened after that was even more abominable. Letters and  phone calls bordering on blackmail abounded, and some  bureaucrats make up things to the mass media. It was like all  the dirty linen of the bureaucracy was at once being washed in  public.    [Takeuchi] Are you saying interference will still be  necessary in the future?    [Kumagai] No. Generally speaking, one has to refrain from  interfering in personnel matters. This time, the case was very  rare and very unusual. However, regardless of this issue, I  still think that it is questionable that bureaucrats are not  made to take responsibility for the outcome, although they are  the ones who make policy. Right now, we do not even have a  system of assessing policy results. If they say they cannot  take the responsibility, they should let the politicians make  policy decisions. If it is "policymaking without taking the  responsibility for the outcome," then it would be like an armed  force with no civilian control.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> STATE AMATEUR QUALIFYING EVENT SET  </P> <P> The road to Pebble Beach for the 79th California Amateur Championship will go  through Los Serranos Country Club in Chino -- as it has for the past 20 years  -- for golfers from Southern California.  </P> <P> A record 517 low-handicap golfers filed entries for the tournament from the  southern half of the state, a number that the Southern California Golf Assn.  had to pare to 400 to accommodate the two Los Serranos courses where qualifying  will be held May 15-16.  </P> <P> On the first day, half the field will play the 7,110-yard, par-74 South Course,  and the other 200 will play the 6,200-yard, par-71 North Course.  </P> <P> The fields will be cut to the low 50 and ties for the second round, with the  players switching courses. After 36 holes, the low 43 will receive invitations  to play June 25 at Cypress Point in the first round of the State Amateur.  Actually, there will be 50 from Southern California, but there are seven  exemptions. Another 50 from Northern California will complete the field.  </P> <P> Paul Stankowski, the Southern California Amateur champion from Oxnard, heads  the list of players who have exemptions. Others are Dave Stockton Jr. of  Mentone, runner-up in last year's State Amateur; Mark Johnson of Barstow, the  SCGA Mid-Amateur champion, and the others who reached the quarterfinals last  year -- Jack Spradlin Jr. of San Diego, Pat Duncan of Rancho Santa Fe and Craig  Steinberg of Van Nuys. Another spot will be held open for the NCAA champion, in  case he is from Southern California, as was Phil Mickelson of La Jolla last  year.  </P> <P> Bob Pastore, the SCGA senior champion from San Diego, also had an exemption but  declined.  </P> <P> The defending champion is Casey Boyns of Pacific Grove, a caddy at Pebble  Beach, who defeated Stockton, a USC student and son of former two-time PGA  champion Dave Stockton, 3 and 1.  </P> <P> Players will find a number of minor changes on the North Course at Los  Serranos, which is owned by former tennis star Jack Kramer. One they won't  find, however, is that No. 9 has been changed from a 217-yard par-3 to a  345-yard par-4.  </P> <P> Officials of the SCGA ruled Friday that qualifying rounds would be played with  the old hole, reasoning that the change would confuse players who had practiced  under the par-3, par-71 format.  </P> <P> The State Amateur will conclude on June 29 with a 36-hole championship final at  Pebble Beach.  </P> <P> The American Golf Club, a 50,000-member organization based in Santa Monica and  has the largest membership of any golf club in the country, is planning its own  national scrambles team championship.  </P> <P> Qualifying tournaments will be held at the more than 100 courses operated by  American Golf Corp. Included are Long Beach's five municipal courses, Brookside  in Pasadena, Camarillo Springs, Fullerton, Oceanside, Rancho San Joaquin in  Irvine, Vista Valencia and Los Angeles County courses at La Mirada, Los Verdes  and Mountain Meadows.  </P> <P> Once the four-player teams are established, 13 regional tournaments will be  held around the country. Southern Californians will play at Brookside,  Oceanside or El Dorado in Long Beach. The finals will be Nov. 17-19 at the  Painted Desert course in Las Vegas. Two teams will qualify from each regional  tournament.  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Chris Tidland, the Valencia High golfer who won the L.A. City junior title,  plans to enroll at Oklahoma State. . . . Clyde Thompson of Yorba Linda and Bob  Lowe of Anaheim won the SoCal Left-Handed Golfers Assn. lefty-righty tournament  at Green River. . . . The Bob Hope USO charity event is set for May 14 at the  Los Alamitos Naval Air Station course.  </P></p>

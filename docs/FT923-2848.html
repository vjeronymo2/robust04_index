			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Banker warns Paris Club on Russian debt WESTERN governments were yesterday warned by a senior banking official not to re-schedule Russia's foreign debts without first obtaining big improvements in the country's economic and financial policies. Mr Horst Schulmann, managing director of the Washington-based Institute of International Finance (IIF), said that if the Paris Club of western creditor nations were formally to reschedule Russia's overdue interest payments Russia could 'become the ward of tax payers' in the big industrialised countries. Speaking as senior government officials of the creditor countries met in Paris to discuss the debts of the former Soviet Union, Mr Schulmann said it was 'difficult to avoid the conclusion that policy makers in Russia do not know what they are doing. Indeed they may not know what is going on,' he added. Mr Schulmann, who leaves Washington shortly to become president of the German state central bank of Hesse and a member of the Bundesbank's decision-making central council, said Russia had generated enough foreign exchange so far this year and in 1991 to pay all the interest it owed on its foreign loans. But the IIF, which was set up by large international banks in the early 1980s to monitor sovereign debt problems, has calculated that Russia has paid less than Dollars 500m (Pounds 253m) in interest since January. He said Russian ministers had estimated that capital flight from Russia totalled Dollars 3bn so far in 1992. The real figure was likely to be double that amount, he said. Mr Schulmann said it would set a 'wrong signal' to reschedule Russia's debts in these circumstances because such an action would give an appearance of orderliness to a very disorderly situation. Instead, the industrial countries should continue to deal with Russia's overdue debt by rolling it over for three months at a time. He also said the International Monetary Fund should not give Russia a standby credit at present.</p>

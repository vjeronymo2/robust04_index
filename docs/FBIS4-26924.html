			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Opposition view from Howard Young," member of the Liberal </F> Party Central Committee and legislative councillor for the  tourism functional constituency: "Liberal Alternative Only  Viable Choice"]    [Text] Our draft, often quoted as the "Liberal Party 1994  package" is the result of a much wider cross-section of  Legislative Council members than those of the Liberal Party. It  stands a reasonable chance of passing the council as an  alternative to Governor Chris Patten's 1992 measures. There is  no other viable choice. Hong Kong people want to see compromise  and stability. Amid signs of a possible thaw in Sino-British  relations, we do not want to see the arguments of the past two  years rekindled again on Wednesday.    Our measures propose two things which are essential if we  are  to have a legislature which converges with the system after  1997. First, we must create nine new functional constituencies  to add to the existing 21 as per the Basic Law. Secondly, an  election committee must be set up to elect 10 Legislative  Council members, also similar to the system enshrined in the  Basic Law.    Before the promulgation of the Basic Law in 1990, the  British  and Chinese governments, through the subsequently revealed  exchange of diplomatic letters, saw great merit in making the  pre- and post-1997 Legislative Council dovetail with each other.  Certain understandings of good faith were in those letters.  Our package is trying to stick to the essence of those  understandings. Our draft follows the same principles adopted  when functional constituencies were introduced by the Hong Kong  Government. This is fundamentally different from Mr Patten's  '92 offering which gives new meaning to functional  constituencies by extending the electorate to everyone who works  in one of nine broad categories of industries. This type of  franchise extension is a form of direct election. Calling it  functional is not calling a spade a spade. We see no reason for  the nine new functional constituencies to be different in  concept from the existing 21. The present system is well known  and understood. It provides stability and balance without  jeopardising the ultimate goal of achieving full direct  elections in the long run, which incidentally is also written  into the Basic Law.    The nine new functional constituencies we propose are:  agriculture and fisheries; textiles and garments; sport, culture  and entertainment; transport; retail, import and export;  insurance; electronics and information technology; and two more  seats for labour. The first five were proposed by both sides  before the Sino- British talks collapsed. We are just picking  up where they left off. The expected electorate of these nine  is about 122,000, compared with only 107,000 spread over the  existing 21. The average size of new constituencies in our  package is 2 1/2 times the existing ones. And if the total  electorate is raised by giving each corporation six directors'  votes, which we would not object to, if my colleague James Tien  Pei-chun's amendment to maintain "one company one vote" is not  accepted, the electorate for these nine is 223,000 -- more than  twice the total of the current 21.    The election committee is something new for Hong Kong, but  it  is spelt out clearly in the Basic Law how it is to be composed  from 1997. Mr Patten's package proposes an election committee  comprising 346 district board members. Our amendment calls for  a committee with four equal parts, like the Basic Law, totalling  396 members, all elected separately by more than 30 different  sectors of voters. This is not just larger, but also more  representative than the '92 proposals. What's more, our scheme  is close to the Basic Law, while Mr Patten's is miles away.We  notice another non-Liberal Party member Frederick Fung Kin-kee  has also put forward an amendment to bring the election  committee more in line with the Basic Law. Our motives are the  same: convergence and a smooth transition.    Mr Patten has, since proposing his '92 draft, said it is up  to the Legislative Council to decide. Our party chairman Allen  Lee Peng-fei will meet the Governor tomorrow to re-emphasise our  call for the three government officials to abstain in  Wednesday's voting. There will be no constitutional place for  government officials in the council from 1995 onwards. Since we  are deciding the composition of our own Legislative Council for  1995 and the views are divided with so many amendments, it will  look bad for the British Government if those three votes turn  out to be the swinging votes in Wednesday's toss-up, because of  instructions from the last Governor from London. So we're  saying: leave us alone to make our own choice.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / A patient on the road to recovery: The US banking industry has taken drastic restructuring measures, but it is still ailing The battered US banking sector, having suffered over the past 18 months from crisis levels of commercial property loan losses and bad debts, is poised to remake itself. Like much of corporate America, the big banks are trying to restructure their way out of recession. Their tools are heavy bad debt provisioning, savage cuts in spending, the disposal of non-strategic assets to raise the cash needed to bolster capital ratios and, increasingly, the use of mergers to eliminate excess capacity and slash back-office and other administrative costs. The medicine is being taken, but the patient cannot yet be pronounced fully recovered. It would be more accurate to say that the cure will take a long time, and could still result in complications. The most notable risk for some institutions is the still-depressed US commercial real estate market. Mr Art Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, one of the New York banks that took early steps to address the real estate crisis, says last year was 'something of a catharsis for us'. He sees little or no growth in profits for the first six months of 1992, and admits he is not even sure there will be a recovery in the second half of the year. But Mr Ryan, along with many other bankers, stresses that the steps being taken should lead to a leaner and meaner US banking sector: 'Reports of the demise of US banking are greatly exaggerated.' As a sign of recovery, bankers point to the way in which they have strengthened a vital ratio: the proportion of their assets accounted for by common equity or its equivalent. Under the Basle agreement between central banks, this so-called Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio must be more than 4 per cent for all banks by the end of this year. At one stage, it looked as if some big US banks would have trouble reaching this level. The obvious way of strengthening capital - issuing more shares - was closed to them by the downgrading of many banks' credit ratings and investor concerns about property loans. There was only one, painful, solution: under pressure from federal regulators, dividends at many banks have been slashed or even eliminated. This, together with asset sales and cost cuts has helped to strengthen capital levels. For the leading 10 US banks, the average Tier 1 capital ratio is now nearly a percentage point above the 4 per cent level. A notable exception is Citicorp, America's biggest bank, which has a common equity-to-assets ratio below 4 per cent. In the view of Mr Tom Hanley, a senior banking analyst at First Boston investment bank in New York, the industry is 'just now going through the first wave of restructuring that will eventually bring it back to restored health'. But other observers are less sanguine. Mr Mark Gross, head of the New York office of IBCA, the UK bank credit rating agency, says: 'The US banking industry is still bumping along at the bottom in terms of profitability and problem assets.' Mr Gross cites IBCA's own analysis of the leading 44 US banks, which shows that total non-performing loans plus the depressed property held by banks after they foreclosed on loans jumped from Dollars 23.3bn in 1986 to Dollars 57.8bn in 1991. Total bad debt reserves covered 64 per cent of these problem loans and property holdings in 1986 (Dollars 14.9bn) while last year - in the middle of the crisis - they covered less than 58 per cent (Dollars 33.4bn). This illustrates that more provisions still need to be made. The main reason why it is too early to predict a rapid recovery is the persistent - and pervasive - nature of the commercial property crisis. Overbuilding in many big US cities during the late 1980s was supported by a lemming-like rush into property lending by many banks. When the banking slump finally arrived - on the heels of the crash of many savings and loans institutions - many bankers discovered they had badly misjudged the market and had loan portfolios too concentrated on property. According to Mr Sandon Goldberg, a property analyst at Salomon Brothers, US commercial real estate values have dropped by an average 30 per cent over the past three years. Many senior bankers and property developers say they do not expect much of a recovery in prices for the next two or three years. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, recently said he expects commercial real estate values to continue to drop across the US, a pattern that could bode ill for many banks. 'We have got no evidence that suggests commercial values are stabilising and even remotely showing signs of turning up,' he said. Top executives at Citicorp, Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan support this view. They say they expect their 1992 bad debt provisions to be at about the same levels as last year, largely because of the depressed property market. Mr John McGillicuddy, the former head of Manufacturers Hanover Trust who was named chairman of Chemical Banking after the merger between the two banks, says the banking industry will eventually claw back profitability. But he warns: 'We still have a significant pile of problems to deal with as we march through 1992, of which real estate is number one.' The challenge is more acute in certain regions. Perhaps the most seriously affected area is New England, where unemployment has leapt above the national average, and overbuilding in the 1980s was among the most severe in the US. Mr Richard Syron, president of the Federal Reserve of Boston and a member of Mr Greenspan's board of governors, says real estate in New England 'is close to bottoming', but it could be five years before the market returns to health. While banks in the north-east expect more heavy bad debt provisions, Midwestern banks, especially in states such as Ohio and Illinois, are more fortunate than either east or west coast institutions because the local property markets have held up better. Mr Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, says the west coast economy is either 'at the bottom or still deteriorating'. He notes this could affect banks throughout the region. Real estate, of course, is not the only factor affecting the industry. Another has been the harsh criticism over the so-called 'credit crunch', in which bankers are reported to have been unwilling to lend during the recession. This trend is now abating. But the other side of the coin is that US consumer confidence, although showing glimmers of improvement, remains weak, and as many companies seek to reduce debts and dispose of assets, loan demand is flat. One partial remedy for the banking system - much-needed legislative reform - looks unlikely in the near future. While most bankers want the right to open interstate branches and to expand into equity underwriting, insurance and other financial service areas prohibited under US laws, no one believes such reform stands much chance of passage in this presidential election year. Mr Syron calls the legislation 'essential, but dead for the time being'. There is some good news - such as recently reduced reserve requirements that will help strengthen bank capital ratios, and the lowering by the Federal Reserve last December of interest rates. This should lead to better net profit margins across the country because banks have been slow to lower the cost of borrowing to many customers. There are also hints that federal bank examiners may be slightly less tough on banks in coming months. Regulators were criticised last year for forcing too-severe bad debt provisions and write-offs at several banks, but Mr William Taylor, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the bank regulatory agency that handles bank failures, says the agency is simply 'working through the problems'. One way to measure the health of the US banking industry is to examine the state of the fund - used for rescues - operated by the FDIC. At the end of 1989 the FDIC had Dollars 13bn in its fund; by the end of 1990 the fund was down to Dollars 4bn. At present, as Mr Taylor puts it, 'we're broke'. He estimates that a new Dollars 30bn line of credit extended to the FDIC by the US Treasury will just about cover expected bank failures between now and the end of 1993. A more realistic method of fixing what ails the industry could be more mergers to reduce administrative costs. The most promising is the recent joining of New York's Manufacturers Hanover Trust with Chemical Banking, a move supposed to save Dollars 750m of annual costs within four years. Regulators such as Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, have predicted that by the end of this decade the number of US banks will be significantly lower as a result of consolidation in the industry. The trauma of the past 18 months has already led to three of the biggest mergers in US history - last year also saw the combination of Bank of America and Security Pacific in California and the joining of C&amp;S/Sovran and NCNB in the south-east. Although Citicorp remains the biggest US bank in asset terms, with Bank of America-Security Pacific just behind, the very map of America's top 10 banks is likely to change in coming years, with new names such as NationsBank, the name chosen for NCNB and C&amp;S/Sovran, moving up the league table. There will certainly be more mergers, but they are not a panacea: their relative success is linked to specific factors such as potential cost savings and the shape of regional markets. Looking ahead, it is likely that US banking will only finally turn the corner when the broader economy improves significantly. When asked to forecast prospects for US banking, Mr Taylor says he sees a light at the end of the tunnel. But he warns: 'I want to make sure it isn't a train coming at me.'</p>

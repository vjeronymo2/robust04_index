			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kone dips but sees gains over full year Kone, the Finnish lifts group which on Monday agreed to buy Montgomery Elevator of the US for Dollars 280m, saw underlying profits dip slightly in the first eight months. However, it expected full-year figures to be higher than in 1993. Group income after financing items amounted to FM167m (Dollars 31m), against FM192m a year earlier. The 1993 figure included a FM21m currency exchange gain. Kone said comparisons with last year were distorted by a 9 per cent strengthening in the Finnish markka and the sale of a number of non-core operations. Sales in the latest period were FM4.8bn, just under last year's level allowing for divestments and currency factors. Operating profits fell to FM205m from FM299m but the impact was offset by a sharp reduction in interest costs to FM53m from FM145m. Mr Gerhard Wendt, president, said the important European market remained sluggish, as improving areas were balanced by those in recession. New elevator orders and maintenance contracts were 4 per cent higher on an underlying basis at FM3.54bn. The group saw higher orders from the UK, Germany, Italy and Australia but there were declines in Sweden, Finland, France and Belgium. The group expected new orders for the full year to equal last year's FM5.71bn. The group has tried to lift operations in Asia and build up the maintenance side of its business. At the end of August it had 363,000 units under maintenance. Kone has sold its cranes unit, a wood unit, and MacGregor-Navire, a supplier of shipboard handling equipment, since the end of August 1993. These helped reduce the interest-bearing debt to FM400m at the end of August from more than FM1bn at the end of 1993 and strengthened the financial position.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu. P. Yakovlev, A. N. Baranov, A. N. Imenkov, </F> V. V. Sherstnev, Ye. V. Stepanov, Ya. Ya. Ponurovskiy; UDC  621.373.826.038.825.4]    [Abstract] Experimental results are described demonstrating  the feasibility of developing frequency tunable in the _l_=3.2-  3.4 m spectral range semiconductor injection InAsSb/InAsSbP  lasers. The laser structures were prepared using the method of  liquid phase epitaxy on a InAs substrate, oriented in the (100)  plane. The narrowband region contained  InAs[.sup]0.96[/]Sb[.sub]0.04[/], so that at the  temperature of 77K, the width of the prohibited zone was  E[.sup]g[/]=0.383 eV, and the reflection index was  n[.sup]0[/]=3.54. This type lasers were employed at  temperatures from 77 up to 160K for a high resolution molecular  spectroscopy. The most important spectroscopic properties of the  lasers were obtained from the absorption spectra of methane and  ethylene molecules. Figures 5, references 7: 4 Russian, 3  Western.</p>

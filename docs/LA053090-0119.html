			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> MASKED ROBBER GETS $22,000 AT RESTAURANT  </P> <P> A masked gunman escaped with more than $22,000 from Newport Landing, the entire  receipts from the busiest weekend ever for the Fun Zone restaurant, police said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> It was 2:30 a.m. Monday and manager Michael Pavlin had already stashed the  record $22,000 in cash and credit card receipts in his office safe. Bartenders  David Dwyre and Ben Swenson were tallying their tips. They had counted up $100  when a man dressed in black and wearing a ski mask burst into the office,  brandishing a handgun, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said.  </P> <P> The robber threw down two pairs of handcuffs and ordered Swenson to handcuff  Dwyre.  </P> <P> "I put one side on but the other side wouldn't snap," Swenson said Tuesday. "He  apparently took offense and punched me on my head."  </P> <P> After the robber handcuffed Dwyre, he forced Swenson to kneel, held the gun to  the back of his head, and slapped the second pair of handcuffs on the  bartender's wrists.  </P> <P> Swenson who has worked at the restaurant for the past 2 1/2 years, said: "I  kept thinking, 'I hope he doesn't shoot us. And if he shoots, I hope he shoots  me first. I don't want to wait for the third bullet.' "  </P> <P> Gonis said the robber forced Pavlin to open the safe. He then tied the manager  with duct tape, grabbed the money, including the bartenders' tips, and fled.  </P> <P> Pavlin wriggled out of the tape and called police, who had to use a bolt cutter  to free the other men.  </P> <P> Swenson said he believed that the bandit had hidden in the restaurant before  closing hours.  </P> <P> "It was pouring outside and he was dry when he came in the office," Swenson  said. "He had to be inside for a long time."  </P> <P> Gonis said it "appeared to be a well-planned job. (The robber) picked an  unusual time of the morning, and he brought in his own handcuffs and tape. He  knew what he was doing."  </P> <P> John Bullard, the restaurant's general manager, said it was the only armed  robbery in the Fun Zone in recent memory.  </P> <P> "I'm upset and mad," Bullard said. "But I thank God that no one got hurt."  DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

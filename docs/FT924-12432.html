			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Dan-Air in talks with BA over possible rescue BRITISH AIRWAYS and Dan-Air were in intense last-minute negotiations yesterday with increasing signs that BA will rescue the smaller airline. Airline industry analysts expect Dan-Air and BA to make an announcement as early as today or tomorrow. Although chances of a BA rescue of Dan-Air were put at only about 50 per cent at best last week, the negotiations appear to have made progress and an agreement now looks imminent. But airline industry executives remained cautious. 'We've been led up the garden path before,' one said, adding, however, that a decision was widely expected in the next 24 hours. BA and Dan-Air declined to comment yesterday on the negotiations to rescue the financially troubled Gatwick-based carrier owned by the Davies &amp; Newman group. A BA rescue is seen as the last chance for Dan-Air after talks with Mr Richard Branson collapsed two weeks ago. BA, which broke off talks with Dan-Air in September, was approached by Mr David James, the company doctor in charge of Dan-Air, about 10 days ago. BA is understood to have offered to acquire a minority stake in Dan-Air on condition it involved only the scheduled part of the airline's operations and not its charter business. BA also made it clear it would not be interested in a rescue if it entailed long regulatory problems with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) and the European Commission. There were signs last night that the UK government could favour a BA rescue because it would save jobs at Dan-Air and Gatwick airport. Dan-Air employs about 2,500 people. Any agreement is likely to spark protests by other UK carriers including British Midland and Mr Branson's Virgin Atlantic. However, as there appears to be no other way of salvaging Dan-Air, the government could consider it was in the national interest to allow BA to acquire a minority stake in the airline. Government approval, however, is likely to hinge on BA agreeing to allow Dan-Air to continue operating as a separate identifiable airline. 'They would probably have to maintain an arm's-length approach to Dan-Air, as they do with their UK regional services, to win government approval,' one UK aviation official said.</p>

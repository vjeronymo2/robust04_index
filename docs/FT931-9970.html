			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firm ahead of second tranche of refunding auction AFTER modest gains in the morning, US Treasury prices dropped sharply yesterday afternoon following a disappointing 10-year auction and a worrying rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/8 at 104 9/16 , yielding 7.243 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100, to yield 4.233 per cent. After Tuesday's successful three-year note sale, sentiment about the auction of Dollars 10.75bn in 10-year notes was generally positive during morning trading. At the start of the week, analysts had worried that the three-years would be the hardest sell, so having got what was believed would be the trickiest part of the refunding out of the way, the market bid up prices confident that the 10-year sale would go smoothly. However, prices slumped mid-afternoon in the wake of an auction that proved disappointing and a rise in the CRB index of 21 commodities, a keenly watched indicator of inflationary trends. ITALIAN government bonds fell a point as news emerged that Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, had resigned from the government. The BTP futures contract fell a point to 95.90 having settled at 96.89 on Tuesday. Mr Martelli, a socialist, is under investigation on corruption charges. He is the first minister to be brought down by the Milan corruption scandal which broke a year ago. Dealers said the bond market tumbled on fears that Mr Martelli's resignation might damage the coalition government. SPANISH government bonds ended firmer after Tuesday's profit-taking, with buying interest concentrated on the short end. Yields fell at yesterday's Treasury bill auction. As expected, the yield on one-year Treasury bills fell to 12.536 per cent from 13.041 per cent. THE German government bond market closed firmer, helped by good domestic buying yesterday. The Liffe bund futures contract rose from 93.18 at the opening to trade at around 93.35 by late afternoon. The results of the Bundesbank's keenly watched securities repurchase tender, announced yesterday, had little effect on the bund market. The Bundesbank accepted DM62.5bn of bids for 14-day and 28-day securities repurchase agreements, allocating net new liquidity of DM3.9bn. The lowest minimum rate at the repo fell 7 basis points to 8.50 per cent. Dealers said the rates at this week's repo - the first since last Thursday's cut in the Lombard and discount rates - were in line with expectations. BELGIAN government bonds saw another volatile day, with prices ending just above the day's lows in spite of a firmer franc. The franc started to firm against the D-Mark after the central bank raised a money market interest rate, the end-of-day rate, from 8.80 per cent to 9.30 per cent. The Belgian government bond market came under pressure earlier this week on worries about currency, the political situation and the government's large borrowing requirement. UK government bonds closed higher, with the futures market out-performing cash bonds. The Liffe gilt futures contract gained over half a point, rising from 100.27 to 101.15. In the cash market, the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 111.00 to 111 1/8 by late afternoon. Dealers said that the market remained concerned about the outlook for inflation given Tuesday's disappointing producer input prices. The market is waiting for Friday's retail price index data for January to see whether there are any signs that inflation has picked up. FURTHER strengthening of the yen against the US dollar helped to push up Japanese government bond prices yesterday, but light profit-taking eroded some of the day's gains leaving the market only slightly higher compared with its previous close. The June futures contract, which opened at 109.66, reached a new high of 109.76 as the yen strengthened to 120.68 to the dollar. However, dealers noted some profit-taking, and the futures contract closed at 109.53, up from Tuesday's close of 109.50. In the cash market, the yield on the No 145 traded in a range of 4.21 per cent to 4.26 per cent, before closing at 4.235 per cent, against Tuesday's close of 4.245 per cent. Japanese officials were said to be ready to let the yen strengthen to help curb Japan's rising trade surplus. The dollar fell from a high of Y123.93 in Tokyo on Tuesday to a low of Y120.68 yesterday on expectations that Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, would agree to allow the yen to rise when they meet for the first time in Washington on Saturday. STANDARD &amp; Poor's has confirmed the AAA rating of the Pounds 180m securitised issue from Truck Funding, the Leyland Daf finance vehicle, launched at the end of last year, writes Richard Waters. The deal was structured to cope with events such as the insolvency of the manufacturer, S&amp;P said. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which handled the issue, agreed to provide a non-recourse facility of up to Pounds 45m to cushion investors against cash flow problems on the bonds.</p>

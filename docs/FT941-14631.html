			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Third-party sales lift Alcan Australia Alcan Australia, a 73 per cent subsidiary of Alcan, revealed it had returned to the black during the second half of 1993, leaving it with a tiny ADollars 772,000 (USDollars 537,342) profit after tax for the full year. This compares with an after-tax loss of ADollars 15.5m in 1992, and was reached on sales up 10.5 per cent, at ADollars 636.5m. However, Alcan said much of this advance was due to sales of metal purchased from third parties. The underlying increase in revenue from Alcan products was around 3 per cent last year, with volumes rising by about 2 per cent. At the operating level, Alcan still showed a ADollars 7.1m loss for the year, with the second-half profit of ADollars 4.31m failing to outweigh the first-half deficit of ADollars 11.4m. At the net level, however, the second-half surplus of ADollars 3.73m was slightly more than the first half loss of ADollars 2.95m. Alcan, noting the market remained 'very competitive', said the improvement stemmed from increased productivity and associated cost reductions. The overall profitability, it added, came from downstream fabricating businesses  -especially the extrusion division. By contrast, 'decreasing tariffs and competition from imports have adversely affected pricing for sheet products and the profitability of the sheet division'. The figures include abnormal items of ADollars 6.8m, compared with ADollars 5.3m last time, partly covering redundancy costs and relocation expenses.</p>

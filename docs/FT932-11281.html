			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Management: A measure of success - Companies are enthusiastically embracing the concept of benchmarking What did South-West Airlines of the US learn from studying pit crew performance at the Indy 500? And why did the Granite Rock company look to automated teller machines (ATMs) for a model to improve their gravel loading techniques? The clue to both answers is benchmarking, a strategic management tool which is currently one of the hottest-selling management consultancy services in Europe and North America. Best defined as the continuous measuring of a company's products, services, processes and practices against those of its most successful competitors, or against companies recognised as industry leaders, benchmarking has been around for 15 years. But global competition and the tough markets of the 1990s have sparked a new interest in how it can help companies achieve superior performance. Benchmarking is increasingly found alongside total quality management and business process re-engineering - two other 'big ideas' being promoted as the key to greater efficiency - and is being widely applied in the public sector as part of the UK government's market-testing programme. A recent survey of the top 1,000 UK companies by Coopers and Lybrand and the Confederation of British Industry found that more than two thirds of the 105 respondents from the manufacturing, service and other sectors claimed to practise benchmarking and that 82 per cent of those who do believed it had been successful. (Eighty per cent of Fortune 500 companies 'benchmark' in one form or another.) Sixty eight per cent said they were planning to increase investment in benchmarking in the next five years. The challenge for today's benchmarking evangelists is that the idea has sometimes promised more in the past than it could deliver: companies which enthusiastically embraced the concept in recent years have too often been disappointed by the results. Consultants therefore tend to stress the depth of the commitment required and the importance of internal preparations before benchmarking begins. In a crude way Walter Chrysler, the US car maker, was benchmarking when he tore apart a new Oldsmobile model to determine what went into it, how much it cost and how it was made. But the birth of benchmarking as understood today is generally credited to Xerox, which by the 1980s was using it to confront and overcome the Far Eastern challenge to its dominance in the worldwide copier market. Other big US corporations such as Boeing and Motorola were quick to implement many of the same techniques. Xerox was among the first to appreciate that benchmarking need not be restricted to manufacturing - nor indeed to direct competitors. It is only recently, though, that the emphasis has moved away from preoccupation with performance measures to finding out what gives leading companies their competitive edge. 'In our opinion the subject has been dominated by the search for benchmarks such that 90 per cent of effort has been spent on the creation and analysis of metrics, and 10 per cent on change,' observes Victor Luck, head of commerce and industry consulting services at Coopers. 'It should be the other way round.' As with all fashionable management techniques, peer pressure and the fear of missing out may have something to do with it. Indications from the market place, though, are that this is not a passing fad. Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, for example, has already invested an estimated Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m) of cash and partners' time in its proprietary and centralised Global Best Practices Knowledge Base. The information - a resource for Andersen's people to use in helping clients rather than a service to be shared externally - is being compiled from external benchmarking studies, from Andersen's surveys (such as cost management in the automotive industry and meter reading in the utilities sector) and from partners' insights. Between 300-400 partners and managers are involved in compiling the database, which so far has benchmarking information on 18 detailed business processes, ranging from customer satisfaction and processing customer orders to obtaining materials and supplies. Most experts agree that while companies within the same group can be a useful starting point - and competitors are also an inevitable focus - benchmarking should not be limited to like organisations. As Xerox discovered, non-competitors may be more willing to share information on a quid pro quo basis. Moreover, the most relevant information is often not the actual numbers but the qualitative information about how things are done and in what order. The insights which South-West gained by studying pit crews on the Indy 500 circuit, helped the airline reduce the turnround time of its aircraft (from arrival at the gate to 'push back' for the next flight) from 30 minutes to 15 minutes. Granite Rock decided its loading process was a similar challenge to that faced by the banking industry - involving accurate accounting and a need for speed and convenience for the user. Granite Rock drivers now use ATM-like cards and the process is simpler, faster and more reliable. Benchmarking, however, has its limitations. Used solely to emulate rather than beat competitors, the advantages may be short lived. It can be difficult to obtain relevant details about competitors and doing so can be costly in time and money. It remains to be seen how deeply benchmarking becomes ingrained into western management thinking. After all, however much its disciples say benchmarking is about sharing and co-operation it may smack of imitation or even industrial espionage to others. That said, the likelihood is that benchmarking will leave something of lasting value even after the current enthusiasm has waned. Examples of benchmarking practice will appear on this page shortly.</p>

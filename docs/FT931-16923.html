			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Business leaders warn of effects of EMS unrest EUROPEAN currency instability could significantly reduce benefits of the single market, business leaders have warned. In an FT survey of European business opinion, chief executives say unrest in the European Monetary System has diminished prospects for economic and monetary union (Emu) taking place by the Maastricht target date of 1999. Most remain convinced, however, that a common European currency will be necessary to boost Europe's competitiveness. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, the UK chemicals group, said: 'If the Community wants to have a fully effective single market, Emu with a single currency is desirable.' But the Maastricht timetable will probably be delayed. Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, the French electrical and engineering group, said: 'Currency instability is hampering Emu prospects. If this is not cured in the near future, it will slow down the cross border rationalisation process.' The need for Emu to be based on greater European economic convergence is, however, underlined by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of Germany's Siemens electrical group. Asked what measures governments should take to improve the business outlook, several chief executives called for lower German interest rates and a successful outcome to the Gatt talks. Sir Owen Green, chairman of British industrial conglomerate BTR and a sceptic on Emu, said: 'The most important action for EC governments would be to achieve lower interest rates.' Many of the companies have already shaken up their operation to benefit from the single market. In the short term, chief executives expect the gains to be moderated by the current downturn across Europe. 'The single market coincides with recession,' said Mr Daniel Janssen, chairman of the Belgian chemicals group Solvay. 'We will see a lot of restructuring and closures. We will emerge from all this with greater productivity and lower prices, above all for services.' Mr Fabiano Fabiani, chairman of the Italian engineering company Finmeccanica, welcomes the single market's impact in opening up previously closed sectors in foreign countries. But he adds a note of caution: 'We will also face more competition.' Respondents voice scepticism about prospects in central and eastern Europe. Sir Denys Henderson said his company does not expect any single investment there to exceed Pounds 5m this year. Mr Sixto Jimenez of Spain's Viscofan said: 'I believe we will rapidly see economic normalisation in Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics and, maybe, Poland. The great unknown is Russia.'</p>

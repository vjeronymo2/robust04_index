			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Observer: Hacked down The latest victim of hubris, the pride that comes before a fall, is Britain's Liberal Democrat party. Boasting of its high place in national attention, its president Charles Kennedy cited as evidence that more top newspapers' political editors had gone to the party's Torquay conference than had opted to accompany John Major to Tokyo. That was on Monday. Alas, today, by the time party leader Paddy Ashdown rises to make his big speech, many if not most of the said high hacks will be gone elsewhere. So, moreover, will be one of the Lib Dems' grade-1 eggheads, Lord Holme - although he, at least, isn't being drawn away by rival political attractions. He is jetting out of Torquay to Prague for the opening of an English college for Czech students.</p>

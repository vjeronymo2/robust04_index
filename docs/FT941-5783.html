			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift scheme sanctioned The High Court has sanctioned the scheme under which Nu-Swift, the fire protection and property group, is being taken private. The company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Euro Fire Security, a private company owned by Mr Jacques Murray, its chairman. Under the scheme Euro Fire is offering 398p cash for each Nu-Swift share, valuing the issued capital at Pounds 147.2m. The scheme is expected to take effect today. Nu-Swift's shares will be cancelled, and the Stock Exchange will be asked to cancel permission to deal in the shares on the USM. The shares have not been traded since June, when news emerged of the plan to take the company private.</p>

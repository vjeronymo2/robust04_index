			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Dispute looms on union merger THE newly formed Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union may become the focus of a Trades Union Congress row over the recruitment of a non-TUC breakaway group of airline cabin staff. The row may jeopardise the readmittance to the TUC of the electricians' section of the new union, formed by the amalgamation of the EETPU electricians' and the AEU engineering unions. The EETPU was expelled by the TUC in 1988. The electricians' section has disclosed that, over the past few days, it has agreed to provide services 'on an agency basis in the first stage' to Cabin Crew '89. The 5,000-strong cabin crew group broke away from the TGWU general union in 1989. Initially - and controversially - Cabin Crew '89 was given financial support by Balpa, the airline officers' association. Cabin Crew '89, which consists mainly of British Airways staff, has now severed its links with Balpa and has turned to the white-collar section of the electricians' grouping within the AEEU. The electricians will provide support services at first. The EETPU section of the AEEU said yesterday that the arrangement had 'not been entered into to be provocative or controversial' but was between 'one non-TUC-affiliated trade union and another non-TUC-affiliated union'.</p>

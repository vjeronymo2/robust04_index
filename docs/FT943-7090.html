			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Doubts over rail strike figures Sir, If we are to believe the RMT's claim that 98 per cent of its members have remained loyal to the strike, there is a disturbing corollary. The fact that Railtrack still kept 40 per cent of the network open (presumably with no compromise on safety) suggests a frightening level of overmanning. Could Jimmy Knapp please check his figures.

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOEBE SNOW IS BACK, WITH A NEW PERSPECTIVE  </P> <P> With a generation of pop musicians well into their second and third decades of  dealing with the hazards of high public visibility, it's no surprise that  images of personal redemption and recovery are rapidly catching up with love  stories as sources of inspiration. Survival and renewal seem to have become the  buzzwords of the late '80s.  </P> <P> Take singer Phoebe Snow, who opens a three-night engagement at the Coach House  in San Juan Capistrano tonight. This week's performances come at the close of a  fatiguing six-month world tour undertaken to support her first album in eight  years.  </P> <P> Snow's return to the pop-music spotlight after such a lengthy hiatus is  testimony to her power to survive as well as to the slowly emerging and long  overdue belief in herself as a performer and as a person. It's been a long and  winding road and, as Snow says, "I've still got a long way to go."  </P> <P> The high-profile part of her career began in 1974 with the release of "Poetry  Man," a brilliantly creative effort that was also a commercial success. The  sudden good fortune had its dark side, however.  </P> <P> "It was pretty frightening," Snow, 37, recalled in a telephone conversation  recently. Virtually overnight, she was "overwhelmed" by a barrage of lawyers,  accountants, managers and producers. Nasty legal hassles prevented the release  of a second album until 1976, and Snow's recording career then began moving in  fits and starts as she worked for a series of producers.  </P> <P> In 1975, she gave birth to a daughter, Valerie, who was born with brain damage.  Snow has divided her time over the past 14 years between music and motherhood,  and there were many times that music had to take second place.  </P> <P> (Snow today maintains that all matters regarding her daughter are private. She  said only that "Valerie's doing fantastically well, and that's no exaggeration.  She's happy and healthy. She'll be 14 in December, and she's absolutely  beautiful. I hate being away from her.")  </P> <P> Snow's last recording before the current "Something Real," issued on  Elektra/Asylum in April, was 1981's "Rock Away." In the interim, her singing  was limited to commercials for items such as Louis Rich turkeys and Hallmark  cards and to a series of demo tapes she made in a home four-track studio.  </P> <P> "I had no idea what was going to become of those songs at the time," Snow said,  "but it's a good thing I did them. Practically everything on the new record was  demoed in that studio -- plus 14 others that weren't used that may wind up on  my next record."  </P> <P> The hiatus also gave Snow a period in which to pursue some deep introspection.  Snow says it was a time in which she began to find herself and, as with most  creative artists, her work was very much a part of it.  </P> <P> "When I began to look at my songs, I realized that everything was subjective; I  really saw me beating myself up, sometimes. And I don't believe I do that  anymore, thank God.  </P> <P> "I just don't want to come across as somebody who's always moaning, 'Oh, you  walked out on me and I want to die.' That's not where I'm at, not at all. Not  anymore."  </P> <P> The "jinx," Snow said, was broken on her new album with "a sort of silly,  happy, up-tempo song: 'Cardiac Arrest.' I actually wrote it about seven or  eight years ago, but it held up. And it proved to me -- when I heard the final  production -- that I can write this kind of song, and I'm going to write  similar songs in the future."  </P> <P> She had some reservations about another piece, "Touch Your Soul," however:  "That's the kind of song where I get into this whole thing in which I'm talking  to a guy, and I'm saying, basically: 'I saw you cheating on me with somebody  else. And even though I'm not interested in you, I might run into you again,  sometime. . . .'  </P> <P> "I really was wallowing in a lot of negativity with that one," she said. "I  know a lot of people really like that song, but for me, it reflects a mood and  an atmosphere that I don't want to have anything to do with anymore."  </P> <P> Snow has spent the last year, she said, working hard to break out of what she  sees as a spiral of co-dependent relationships. "I've spent this entire year,"  she said, "discovering that there is another way to have relationships that's  different from the way I used to have them.  </P> <P> "That's why, at the moment, I don't have a relationship -- and, by the way,  it's working out great. I'm really happy, I'm feeling centered, and I'm not at  all interested in getting involved -- at least not until I figure out how to do  it constructively."  </P> <P> That determination to take control also extends to her work. Less than fully  content with the album that signaled her return to prominence in the music  business, she is determined to avoid the same mistakes in her next recording.  </P> <P> "I was rusty when we made 'Something Real,' " Snow said. "I hadn't been in the  studio for eight years, and I was a little overwhelmed by the whole process of  getting acclimated. I think I just got swept up in the whole movement of the  thing, and even though I had a certain degree of artistic involvement and  control, it probably wasn't enough.  </P> <P> "I guarantee you that won't happen again," she said firmly, "because the  responsibility for my career is in my own hands. If I've learned anything, it's  that no matter where you work or what you do -- no matter what industry or what  job -- if you have a very positive and firm self-image, you'll make it. And  that's what I'm working on, right here and right now."  </P> <P>  Phoebe Snow will perform at 8 p.m. tonight through Thursday at the Coach  House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $27.50.  Information: (714) 496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

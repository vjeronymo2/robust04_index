			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Prices boost Brazilian tin miner PARANAPANEMA, the world's largest tin exporter and Brazil's largest private mining company, unveiled profits of Dollars 32.3m for the first nine months of this year but posted a loss of Dollars 30.6m for the entire year. The results were boosted by higher tin prices. Reliable figures for the first nine months of 1991 were not available due to government-mandated changes in inflation accounting procedures, said Mr Arislando Prado, director of market relations. In early September, the tin price peaked at about Dollars 7,200 per tonne, up from a norm of about Dollars 5,500 during the first half of the year. Prices have since fallen to around Dollars 5,800 a tonne. The construction business, responsible for about 20 per cent of receipts, remained in the red. Administrative costs, down 22 per cent since the beginning of a reorganisation scheme in May, also helped improve profit figures. Mr Prado said lay-offs were primarily due to the fusion of administrative structures of the mining and construction branches. Paranapanema's tin output should remain stable, at about the 17,000 tonnes produced last year, said Mr Prado. Papel Simao, a leading Brazilian exporter of paper products, posted profits of Dollars 1.9m for the first nine months. The year-end profit figure last year was Dollars 2.6m. The publicly traded company is controlled by Votorantim, Brazil's largest conglomerate, which bought 100 per cent of Papel Simao's voting stock, and 47.7 per cent of total capital, for Dollars 190m in September. Votorantim already owns Celpav, a competing pulp and paper producer, but there are no merger plans, said Mr Milton Correa Henrique, finance director for Papel Simao. Instead, the two subsidiaries are exploring potential avenues for co-operation, he said. Expecting a reversal of the current decline in the international pulp and paper market, Papel Simao is investing Dollars 130m to increase cellulose production in its Jacarei plant by 100 tonnes a day, from 550 tonnes. 'We expect the beginning of a new upswing,' explained Mr Raul Calfat, director-president. The project should be completed in December 1993, he added. The company also plans to invest Dollars 270m to expand paper production capacity, to be ready by the first half of 1995, said Mr Calfat.</p>

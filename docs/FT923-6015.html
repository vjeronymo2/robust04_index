			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Pension funds call for divorce reforms THE DIVORCE laws in England and Wales should be changed to require courts to divide pension rights between the couple, the industry's trade association said yesterday. The National Association of Pension Funds' recommendations, which would bring the law into line with Scotland, would mainly benefit women, with the aim of helping to ease poverty among divorced women in their old age. At present, pension rights on divorce are left to the courts' discretion. Alimony cases that ignore pension benefits often leave ex-wives to compete with a new wife for pension payments or to forgo it entirely. With one in three marriages ending in divorce, there have been increased calls for a change in the law to allow the division of a pension, which is usually the most valuable asset after the family home. Under Scottish law, 'matrimonial property' includes the proportion of pension and insurance rights that are accumulated during the marriage. The NAPF recommendations include: The split of rights should take place at the time of divorce and not be delayed until retirement. The amount to be divided should be determined by the present value of pension rights. The divorced partner should be allowed to use the pension rights only to provide a retirement pension and not to take cash instead. The NAPF was responding to proposals put forward by the Pensions Management Institute working group on pension and divorce, which was set up in February. That followed the 1990 Barber judgement from the European Court, which ruled that pensions are effectively deferred pay and that companies may not discriminate in pay offered to men and women.

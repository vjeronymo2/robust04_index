			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Renault's operating profit sags as sales mark time RENAULT, the French state-owned car and truck maker, yesterday unveiled profits more than double those of the previous year, although operating earnings fell sharply in difficult market conditions. Net profits at Renault, which has been allied with Volvo, the Swedish automotive group for the past two years, rose to FFr3.08bn (Dollars 550m) in 1991 from FFr1.21bn. This was due to a steep drop in exceptional charges and a fall in the interest bill, the benefits of earlier years' efforts at trimming the workforce and paying off the group's still heavy debts. Sales rose from FFr163.6bn to FFr165.9bn, but operating profits fell 25 per cent from FFr6.2bn to FFr4.6bn. That represented 1.9m cars and trucks sold, a fraction ahead of 1990, giving Renault 10 per cent of the European market, against 9.9 per cent previously. The fall in operating earnings was partly due to the freeze on demand caused by the Gulf war, but also reflected the impact of last autumn's strike at Renault's two main plants. Sales in France fell by 14.5 per cent, bringing Renault's market share down fractionally to 29.1 per cent, where it is still domestic leader. Its other two main European markets, Spain and Britain, also declined sharply. But Germany rose by 36 per cent and Renault doubled its sales there, so lifting its German market share by nearly two points to 5.4 per cent. Interest charges fell from FFr1.98bn to FFr1.19m, reflecting the reduction debt made possible by Renault's sale of FFr9bn of new equity to Volvo and the French government, and by last year's cash-flow. Net debts fell by 43 per cent to FFr15.5bn. The fall in exceptional charges reflects the previous year's write-offs for Renault's subsidiary in Argentina and its truck units's US business, Mack Trucks. There was also a one-off FFr969m gain, a payment from Chrysler relating to a rise in Jeep sales since it bought Renault's American interests in 1987. Volvo contributed a small loss of FFr12m to Renault's results, though the French group estimates that it has already saved FFr1bn on its development bill by deciding to use Volvo's larger - more than two-litre capacity - petrol engines.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> CIVIL RIGHTS CHOICE GAVE FALSE ANSWERS  </P> <P> William Lucas, nominated to be assistant attorney general for civil rights,  gave inaccurate answers on a sworn application to the New York bar, the Justice  Department acknowledged. Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade confirmed  that the Michigan Republican failed to state on the New York form in 1981 that  he had once failed the District of Columbia bar exam. His application to New  York was successful. Lucas, 61, simply stated that he was admitted to the  Michigan bar in 1971 when asked if he had ever taken another state bar  examination or applied to practice in another state. Lucas also answered in the  negative when he was asked if he had ever been a witness in a civil or criminal  court proceeding, when he had testified numerous times, Burstion-Wade  confirmed. The admission came to light as Lucas' two home state senators,  Democrats Carl Levin and Donald W. Riegle Jr., said they would break with usual  Senate practice and would not introduce him to the Senate Judiciary Committee  at the opening of confirmation hearings today.  </P></p>

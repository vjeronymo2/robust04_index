			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT THE $78 MILLION WILL BUY;  </P> <P> THIS TIME, DONALD BREN TREATED AS HERO  </P> <P> Once considered the bad guy in Laguna Beach, Irvine Co. chairman Donald L. Bren  was given a hero's welcome Monday evening as officials celebrated a landmark  agreement to save Laguna Canyon from development.  </P> <P> "There were many months there that I did not think we would come to an accord.  But the last few weeks I was heartened and we did, and I am very, very pleased  to be a party to buying Laguna Canyon," Bren said during a reception at Hotel  Laguna that drew an estimated 450 people.  </P> <P> For environmentalists who have been battling for more than a decade to block  the Irvine Co.'s proposed Laguna Laurel development on 2,150 acres of unspoiled  canyon land, Bren's attendance at the reception was ironic.  </P> <P> After years of protesting -- including marching through Laguna Canyon and  picketing Bren's Newport Beach home -- the environmentalists, city officials  and Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and Bren jointly celebrated the  preservation of open space.  </P> <P> The agreement, finalized Sunday, ended years of discord by allowing the city to  buy the last undeveloped coastal canyon in Southern California for $78 million  over five years.  </P> <P> "I believe the agreement is very, very fair. It's fair from all sides," Bren  said as he urged the crowd to approve Measure H, a $20-million bond measure on  the Nov. 6 ballot. If passed, it will go toward the purchase of the land.  </P> <P> The $50-per-person reception had been promoted as a fund-raiser for the Measure  H campaign, which had been running in slow motion pending the outcome of land  acquisition talks between the city and the Irvine Co. But the City Council's  unanimous approval of the agreement Sunday set the stage for the campaign and  brought life to Monday's festivities.  </P> <P> Supporters of the bond measure crowded into the hotel's first-floor dining  rooms and bar to hear the two sides exchange congratulations.  </P> <P> During an interview following his brief speech, Bren said he never intended to  sell the property -- independently appraised at $105 million -- below  fair-market value.  </P> <P> "But I believe that once we understood and we were educated by the Laguna  community and they understood us, we were able to reach an agreement," he said.  </P> <P> Bren also conceded that he was persuaded to meet the other side at the  negotiating table after a march through the canyon last November drew an  estimated 8,000 people.  </P> <P> "I was struck with that -- the number of people who turned out. I believe the  number and the sincerity of the people impressed me, and we moved forward with  our discussions and our negotiations," he said.  </P> <P> After his speech, Bren accepted a T-shirt from Laguna Greenbelt Inc. president  Elisabeth Brown and donned a button that read, "Don Bren says save the canyon."  </P> <P> Earlier, Mayor Lida Lenney predicted that voters would express their support  for the canyon's serene rolling hills and natural lakes by approving Measure H,  which needs a two-thirds vote to pass.  </P> <P> "Even though $78 million sounds like a lot of money, the $20 million that we  will get from that bond issue is not going to cost the individual homeowners in  Laguna Beach more than they are willing to spend," Lenney said. "I think that  what they will gain from that will be much more than what it will cost them."  </P> <P> If approved, the bond issue would mean a property tax increase of 6 1/2 cents  per $100 assessed valuation.  </P> <P> City officials had feared that without a viable financing plan to purchase the  canyon property, the bond issue would not receive voter approval.  </P></p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Tapie to resign at football club MR BERNARD TAPIE, the controversial French politician and businessman, yesterday announced that he plans soon to resign as chairman of Olympique-Marseille (O-M), the scandal-scarred football club. He broke the news in an interview with L'Equipe, the sports newspaper, adding that his position at O-M was incompatible with his political ambitions. Mr Tapie, who has a seat in parliament as an independent Socialist and had a short stint as urban affairs minister in the last Socialist government, plans to lead a group of left-wing radicals in next June's European elections. He is also expected to stand as mayor of Marseilles in the next general election. However, Mr Tapie, who took over O-M in 1986 and has since invested around FFr130m (Pounds 15m) in the club to turn it into France's top team, said he had not yet finalised plans for his departure. He told L'Equipe he had already 'made contact' with prospective investors in the Marseilles team. He had received inquiries from 'a big furniture manufacturer, an upmarket jeweller and a department store chain'. O-M is struggling to stabilise its finances following its ban from this season's European Cup, which it won last spring - the first French club to do so. It has since been sullied by the scandal over allegations that its officials tried to bribe players from another French team to rig one of last season's league games.</p>

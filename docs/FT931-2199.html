			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Yeltsin faces impeachment: Russian parliament says rule by decree is an 'assault on constitution' RUSSIAN deputies yesterday set in motion moves to impeach President Boris Yeltsin, after he declared he would go over their heads to ask the people whether he or parliament should rule Russia. But his most diehard opponents appeared to have shied away from more resolute or immediate steps to try to oust him from office. In a desperate gamble to retain strong powers to pursue radical reforms, Mr Yeltsin has called a popular vote for April 25, even though the Congress of People's Deputies has forbidden a formal referendum. Until then, he declared, he would rule by decree. In an angry emergency session of the Supreme Soviet, deputies condemned his actions as 'an assault to the constitutional foundations of Russian statehood' and asked the Constitutional Court to review his actions. If the court finds that Mr Yeltsin has violated the Soviet-era constitution, he could be impeached by the full parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies. But deputies ended their meeting without convening a session of Congress to consider Mr Yeltsin's impeachment. As a result, it appeared Mr Yeltsin may have emerged from the day's manoeuvring stronger than at first expected, though the ultimate outcome of the battle for power remained unclear. The deputies' resolution, adopted by 125 votes to 16, with four abstentions, also called for the prosecution of presidential officials involved in drafting Mr Yeltsin's appeal to the people, broadcast on The constitutional court's deliberations are expected this week. Like the Russian parliament, the court is dominated by conservatives. In an instant verdict, Mr Valery Zorkin, the court's chairman, described the president's move as an 'attempted coup'. But Mr Zorkin, who had already put his supposed impartiality in doubt by coming out against a referendum, was attacked by one fellow judge for prejudging court hearings. Mr Zorkin's remarks were a sign of a deepening split in Russia's leadership, with prominent figures anticipating a final showdown between the parliamentary and presidential camps. Vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, who says he favours strong presidency but is against radical economic reforms, swung firmly in favour of parliament. He has positioned himself as the man to pick up the pieces if things go badly wrong for Mr Yeltsin. Mr Yuri Skokov, conservative secretary of the National Security Council, also refused to endorse the presidential gamble. But the entire cabinet of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, parliament's choice for premier, came out in favour of the president's move. They issued a statement supporting 'the striving by the popularly elected president not to allow powerlessness, chaos, political confrontation, separatism, nationalism, and crime'. Ministers also vowed the government would guarantee 'constitutional legality', personal freedoms, and stable functioning of the economy, transport, and communications. This means they will try to focus on specific reforms set out in the government's economic programme, including a restrictive monetary and credit policy. The gamble being taken by the west in backing Mr Yeltsin was underlined in a separate parliamentary resolution condemning western leaders' comments over the weekend as 'crude interference' in Russia's internal affairs.

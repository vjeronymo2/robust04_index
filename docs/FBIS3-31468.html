			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Government of the Republic of </F> Macedonia" after the closure of the Greek border with Macedonia,  place and date not given: "Measures Contrary to the United  Nations and the CSCE"]    [Text] "The Government of the Republic of Macedonia  evaluates the newest resolution of the Government of the  Republic of Greece, by which the activities of the Consulate of  the Republic of Greece in Skopje and the trade of goods `from  and to Skopje from the port of Salonika' are stopped, as an  embargo against our country, as an act contrary to the  regulations of the UN Charter, the CSCE documents, and  International Law. By this act, the Greek side showed  disrespect for the decision of the EC European Council at the  Edinburgh Summit of 12 December 1992, according to which our  country must be allowed a regular oil supply. Such unilateral  and unacceptable measures applied by the Greek Government are of  special concern because they are contrary to the UN Security  Council resolution by which Macedonia and Greece are committed  to overcome their differences through negotiations, with the  mediation of the United Nations, and thus contribute to the  promotion of peace and stability in the region.    "The Republic of Macedonia had, and still has, a peaceful  position regarding all events on the territory of former  Yugoslavia, it is outside the war, and it has done its best to  construct a democratic society and a market economy, to settle  interethnic relations through dialogue and tolerance. As far as  the dispute with Greece is concerned, it has demonstrated  maximum flexibility and good will in solving the outstanding  questions. This Macedonian attitude is known to the whole  world. Macedonia succeeded in maintaining peace and stability  in the country, thus becoming a factor of peace and stability in  the region.    "Therefore, at a time when the international community is  involving great efforts for a peaceful and agreed solution of  the most complicated problem, the stopping of the war in Bosnia  included, it is a puzzle that Greece, a member of the United  Nations, the CSCE, NATO, the European Council, and now current  chairman of the European Union, undertakes such measures against  our independent and peaceful country, contrary to International  Law. The Greek Government is introducing them with the goal of  applying economic, political, and other pressures against our  country, using the fact that our country has no exit to the sea.    "The Government of the Republic of Macedonia wishes to  emphasize that great damage is being done to the lasting  interests of the two countries and peoples, as well as to future  mutual relations and cooperation, for which Greece is  responsible. Contrary to that, Macedonia remains firm in its  determination for good relations with all its neighbors,  including its southern neighbor, and it is ready to resume the  Macedonian-Greek dialogue.    "The Government of the Republic of Macedonia will cautiously  observe all the possible consequences of the Greek blockade,  which has in no way been caused by the Macedonian side, and it  will undertake all necessary measures and activities on the  international plan in that regard."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ali Moghnie in Sarajevo, incorporating interview </F> with "high-ranking Bosnian Muslim military commander" Rustum  Kadic --- date not given: "Muslims Ready To Launch Spring  Military Offensive"]    [Text] The Bosnian Muslims are preparing to launch an  attack against Dolina rijeke Lasva (the valley of the river  Lasva) between Zenica and Mostar in the spring to consolidate  their position around Sarajevo, according to a high-ranking  Bosnian Muslim military commander.    In an interview with The European, Rustum Kadic said the  attack would be directed against Novi Travnik (half of it  already controlled by the Muslims and the other half by the  Croats), Vitez (the Muslims control the old part of the city)  and Busovaca, Kiseljak, and Kresevo (all under Croat control).    But in the light of the mortar attack on Sarajevo's market  square, the plan may be revised. Air strikes on Serbian  positions around the town, or any Nato-induced withdrawal by the  Serbs, would offer the tempting option of an immediate push by  the Muslims to follow up and gain territory.    Such a move, which the UN would undoubtedly try to prevent,  could signal the start of the Muslims' spring offensive, which  has a series of objectives, according to Kadic. They want to  break the Serbian ring around Sarajevo by liberating Kiseljak,  near Vitez, and reduce their own commitment in the area to  redeploy forces on other fronts, Kadic said. They also want to  capture vital arms factories in Novi Travnik and Vitez, and aim  to supplant the Croats in controlling the relief aid routes.    If the Muslims gain control of Kiseljak, they will be able  to  cut the Croats' supply lines from the Serbs in the east. By  controlling Busovaca the Muslims would ease links along the  valley, currently dominated by Croat snipers who are inflicting  heavy casualties on the Muslims. According to Bosnian military  commanders, more than 1,000 Muslim fighters have died on that  road.    There is already heavy fighting between the Muslim-led  Bosnian army and Croat separatist forces in the Vitez area which  closed the main aid route into the Croat enclave.    "We can achieve our aims. However there is a risk of a large  number of casualties," Kadic said. "When we took back Kakanj  and Vares, the Croatian fighters took shelter in Kiseljak, which  became a fortress."    Muslim politicians in Sarajevo oppose the plan because of  potential losses. But Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic backs  the military commanders. The military headquarters of the  Bosnian Muslims has been transferred to Zenica from Sarajevo.</p>

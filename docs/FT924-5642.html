			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Revolution plotted in Japan's politics JAPAN'S most prolific management consultant, Mr Kenichi Ohmae, yesterday launched an attempt to revolutionise the country's political system within six years. He has founded a group with some 30 politicians to be known as Reform of Heisei, because, he says, the current political system works against the interests of Japan and the rest of the world. Mr Ohmae, chairman of the Japanese arm of management consultants McKinsey and Co, used three specially written books, flow charts and an array of acronyms to explain his plans to build up and lead a 1m-strong political movement. He conjured up the 19th century Meiji Restoration, foundation for Japan's modernisation, by calling for similarly sweeping reform in the 1990s. Heisei is the name of the current era of imperial rule. 'We have to clear the system away and start afresh. We wish to restore nothing from the past. We have to press the all-clear button,' Mr Ohmae said. His group aims to sweep away the Liberal Democratic party and the main opposition Socialist party. 'We believe the effectiveness of the two parties has come to an end. Having written off the existing parties, we find some members of the Diet (the Japanese parliament) prepared to change this country for its own good.' He had decided to found the group after talks with socialist and LDP leaders convinced him they were incapable of introducing radical change. The launch comes as Japanese party politics is in flux following the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal which has split the Takeshita faction, the LDP's largest. The Miyazawa government's popularity has fallen amid the scandal; today, Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, gives parliamentary evidence on the affair. Mr Ohmae has mapped out a plan for his group, to end in 1997 with a revolution in Japanese politics. The group plans to recruit 1m members, each paying Y10,000 (Pounds 53) to create a fund to support 50 candidates in next year's lower house elections. These 50, drawn from the established parties, will be assessed by a panel rather like a political credit rating agency, to determine if they are sufficiently committed to Mr Ohmae's policies to deserve its support. They will then form a party to build a third way between the LDP and the Socialists. It is committed to reform Japan's constitution to decentralise power from Tokyo to the regions, and will represent consumers, citizens and communities, not companies, unions and vested interests.</p>

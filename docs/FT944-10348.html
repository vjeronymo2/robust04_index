			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / S Korea to apply to OECD South Korea expects to apply for membership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development next month, the ministry of finance said yesterday. The application would follow Korea's acceptance as an observer on the OECD's financial market committee, which is expected to be granted by the end of November. Seoul plans to begin formal negotiations to become the OECD's 26th member during the second half of 1995, with a goal of having its membership approved by June 1996. But the negotiations are expected to be contentious, since the OECD is demanding that Korea accelerate its schedule for financial liberalisation, while Seoul argues that any such move would be detrimental to the economy. Seoul is planning to phase out state-supported industrial loans and deregulate interest rates, while opening up financial markets gradually to foreign investors and reduce controls on capital flows. But the full extent of these measures are not scheduled to occur until after 1996. North Korea yesterday gave a cool response to South Korea's recent decision to resume economic co-operation with Pyongyang. A commentary by the North Korean central news agency demanded that Seoul should apologise for suspending economic ties with Pyongyang over the nuclear dispute and repeal its national security law before co-operation could begin. But South Korean officials said the statement appeared to be a routine propaganda attack and did not amount to a total rejection of Seoul's offer. They noted that the commentary had not been issued by any government agency officially responsible for inter-Korean affairs.</p>

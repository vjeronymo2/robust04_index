			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Car bomb kills nine in S Africa: Mandela appeals for focus on election after attack near ANC offices South Africa's election campaign ended on an ominous note yesterday when a powerful car bomb in Johannesburg killed at least nine people, injured nearly 100 others and cast a shadow of violence over voting which begins tomorrow. Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress leader, acted quickly to try to head off the threat of revenge for the attack near the offices of the ANC and Pan Africanist Congress. The blast killed one ANC election candidate and damaged the organisation's offices. In a statesmanlike speech, which included a string of overtures to the white community, Mr Mandela appealed to his supporters to concentrate on the importance of tomorrow's elections to end nearly 350 years of white domination, and not on the killings in Johannesburg. 'Leave the task of maintaining law and order to the security forces,' he pleaded with a crowd of more than 100,000 supporters at his last campaign rally in the Natal city of Durban. In a separate incident, gunmen shot dead four ANC supporters and wounded 19, as they travelled to the rally in Durban, state radio said. President FW de Klerk, in a warning to the white far-right, condemned the car-bomb attack in Johannesburg and said it would not stop the country's first all-race elections. 'There is no possibility that radical minorities will be allowed to frustrate the will of the vast majority of the South African people.' However, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, closing his campaign, warned the blast was more evidence that the elections would be unfair: 'This is just another thing to point out there will not be free and fair elections in South Africa.' Police and bomb disposal experts said it was too early to say who staged the attack. But the location and the nature of the explosion suggested it was the work of the white right-wing, making a desperate last stand for apartheid and delivering a warning of the ferocity of their resistance to a non-white government. The bomb, estimated at between 80kg and 90kg of explosives, was the biggest in South Africa since an ANC bomb in Pretoria killed 17 people in 1983. If planted by white extremists, it marked a significant escalation of their violent opposition to political change. Hardline whites have set off several explosions in the past, mainly targeting small ANC rural offices, railway lines and electricity pylons. A suspected second car bomb in Johannesburg last night turned out to be a false alarm. Since the hardline whites were humiliated last month in the black homeland of Bophuthatswana, where they had gone to try to restore ousted President Lucas Mangope to power, the right has been curiously silent, raising hopes that it would not pose a serious threat to elections. Mr Mandela said the elections would usher in 'a new era of hope, justice, democracy and national reconciliation'. In an attempt to placate the right, the ANC on Saturday signed a deal with rightwing leader General Constand Viljoen which included agreement in principle to a 'volkstaat' or homeland for Afrikaners. Such a homeland will be created after the elections, if Gen Viljoen's Freedom Front party can show it has sufficient support for the concept. Votes will be counted separately in white areas to determine where a homeland would be located. Only handicapped, elderly and heavily pregnant voters will go the polls tomorrow.

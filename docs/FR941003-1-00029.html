			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interference rules authorize a party to file a preliminary motion to redefine an interference by designating a claim as corresponding (&sect;1.633(c)(3)) or not corresponding (&sect;1.633(c)(4)) to a count. Prior to Van Geuns, the Patent and Trademark Office interpreted the interference rules as requiring a party to file a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c)(4) to designate a claim as not corresponding to the count as a condition for arguing at final hearing that a claim designated as corresponding to the count is patentably distinct from another claim designated as corresponding to the count.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Brooks v. Street, 16 USPQ2d 1374, 1377 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1990); Flehmig v. Geisa, 13 USPQ2d 1052, 1054 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1989); Kwon v. Perkins, 6 USPQ2d 1747, 1750 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1988), aff'd on other grounds, 886 F.2d 325, 12 USPQ2d 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1989); see also Lamont v. Berguer, 7 USPQ2d 1580, 1582 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1988). However, in Van Geuns the Federal Circuit interpreted the rules differently, stating: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he position of the Commissioner that claims designated as corresponding to a court stand or fall with the patentability of the subject matter of the count is overboard. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 988 F.2d at 1185, 26 USPQ2d at 1060. The Court further stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [W]e conclude that a party to an interference, who has failed to timely contest the designation of claims as corresponding to a count, has not conceded that claims corresponding to a count are anticipated or made obvious [i.e., are unpatentable] by the prior art when the subject matter of account is determined to be unpatentable for obviousness. The PTO must determine, based on the actual prior art reference or references, whether claims not [designated as] corresponding exactly to the count are unpatentable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> *&blank;*&blank;* The interference rules do not specify whether a party may argue the patentability of claims separately to the EIC [examiner-in-chief, now administrative patent judge] and the board. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1186, 26 USPQ2d at 1060 (bracketed material added by the Commissioner). The proposed amendment to &sect;655(b) is designed to overcome the Federal Circuit's interpretation of the rules and to create a presumption that all claims designated as corresponding to a count are directed to the same patentable invention. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is proposed to amend paragraph (c) of &sect;1.655 by changing ``To prevent manifest injustice'' to ``In the interest of justice'' to be consistent with the language used in other interference rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1.656, it is proposed to redesignate paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) as paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(8), respectively, and to add new paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) requiring the brief to include (1) a statement of interest identifying every party represented by the attorney in the interference and the real party in interest if the party named in the caption is not the real party in interest and (2) a statement or related cases indicating whether the interference was previously before the Board for final hearing and identifying any related appeal or interference which is pending before, or which has been decided by, the Board, or which is pending before, or which has been decided by, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a district court in a proceeding under 35 U.S.C. 146. A related appeal or interference is one which will directly affect or be directly affected by or have a bearing on the Board's decision in the pending interference. Appeals are mentioned because related issues may be present before the board simultaneously in an ex parte appeal and an interference. It is also proposed to amend current paragraph (b)(3) (proposed to be redesignated as paragraph (b)(5)) to specify that statements of fact preferably should be presented in numbered paragraphs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current paragraph (b)(4) of &sect;1.656 (proposed to be redesignated as paragraph (b)(6)) requires that the opening brief of the junior party contain the contentions of the party with respect to the ``issues to be decided,'' which has been construed to include the matter of whether some of the senior party's evidence of conception was inadmissible hearsay. Suh v. Hoefle, 23 USPQ2d 1321, 1323 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1991). As support, the Board relied on Fisher v. Bouzard, 3 USPQ2d 1677 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 1987), and Moller v. Harding, 214 USPQ 730 (Bd. Pat. Int. 1982). Both of these cases concern interferences declared under the ``old'' interference rules (i.e., &sect;1.201  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of which &sect;1.254 specified that the opening brief of the junior party shall ``present a full, fair statement of the questions involved, including his position with respect to the priority evidence on behalf of other parties.'' Current &sect;1.656(b)(4) does not expressly require, and was not intended to imply, that the opening brief of the junior party must address the evidence of any other party with respect to the issue of priority or any other issue. In order to clarify that the opening brief of a junior party need not address the evidence of the other parties, it is proposed to amend current paragraph (b)(4) to require that the junior party's opening brief contain the contentions of the party ``with respect to the issues it is raising for consideration at final hearing.'' These issues would include the junior party's case-in-chief for priority with respect to an opponent or derivation by an opponent as well as matters raised in any denied or deferred motions of the junior party that are to be reviewed or considered at final hearing. Where the reply brief of the union party includes a new argument in response the case-in-chief of the senior party as presented in the senior party's opening brief, the senior party may move under &sect;1.635 for leave to file a reply to the junior party's reply brief, which motion must be accompanied by a copy of the senior party's reply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Since the beginning of this year, the province's  commercial reform has proceeded rapidly with a good result.  According to statistics, 7 enterprises have newly experimented  with the shareholding system, with the total number of  experimental enterprises reaching 40, of which, 23 have  experimented with the system of the limited liability stock  company, 9 have experimented with the system of the limited  liability corporation, and 8 have experimented with the system  of the shareholding cooperative corporation. Meanwhile, a total  of 813 enterprises have carried out the system of being owned by  the state but operated by the people, a total of 25 enterprise  groups have been organized, 305 corporations have been  established as single entities, and 607 enterprises have been  leased, sold, and merged to others or have gone bankrupt.    According to a survey, the province's commercial reform has  the following characteristics: First, the reform is diversified  in forms. Various localities have suited their measures to  local conditions rather than rigidly adhering to a certain form.  Second, the reform has proceeded rapidly. In some localities,  the number of enterprises carrying out the system of being owned  by the state but operated by the people and the enterprises  organized as corporations have approached or surpassed the  targets approved by the province for the fiscal year. Third,  the reform has yielded good results. Most of the enterprises  carrying out the shareholding system have effected substantial  increases in sales, profits, and tax payment. Most enterprises  implementing the system of being owned by the state but operated  by the people have effected a turn for the better in economic  efficiency, and more than half of such enterprises have made  their circulating assets withdrawn. At the same time, many good  exemplary enterprises have come to the fore.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1600 GMT on 10 June carries a 15-minute edition of its  regularly scheduled "Straight Talk" program, with Eloy  Concepcion, from TRABAJADORES newspaper, and host Osvaldo  Rodriguez, from BOHEMIA magazine.    Rodriguez opens the debate by stating that measures  increasing prices and deregulating sales of cigarettes and rum  have significantly influenced the market and buyers.    Concepcion states that consumers and speculators have not  hoarded these products since they went on deregulated sale. He  adds that many people feared the cigarettes were stale but this  is not the case. The warehouses had stockpiled cigarettes to  ensure that supply would meet demand. Concepcion adds that  speculators are holding back, given that the media has reported  the factories have the conditions to continue producing 50  million cigarettes a day.    Rodriguez states the fight has been won as long as the  cigarette industry is able to maintain the flow of production.  Concepcion states that he believes that after years of  gratuities, the first big lesson the people have learned is to  be aware of home and personal finances. He adds that the basic  quota of four boxes has gone from costing 20 cents each to  costing 2 pesos each, and the two additional boxes were 1.6  pesos each and now cost six pesos each. Concepcion adds that rum  has gone from 7.2 pesos to 13.75 pesos, and that next September  the cost of electricity will increase and transportation and  water services have already been increased in order to mend the  national finances. He adds: "We have to say it clearly. This  affects the people's pocket. The Cuban people will learn to  live on a budget, which is something we never thought about  because the state took care of us."    Concepcion goes on to say that the current tobacco harvest  has been outstanding, adding: "This year's tobacco crop is a  slap in the face to those who think that socialism is incapable  of organizing efficient agriculture."    Rodriguez states that the measures have benefited smokers  because the black market can no longer charge 30 pesos for a box  because consumers can now buy three boxes for 30 pesos. He adds  that undoubtedly the people will have to learn to live on a  budget and that near the cigarette factory in Ranchuelo, people  are illegally selling cigarettes stolen from that factory in the  streets and that the factory's workers, management, party cell,  and union representatives have to solve that problem.    Rodriguez closes by stating that stealing from the cigarette  factories is widespread, adding: "As long as this lack of  control prevails, we will not be able to sustain a stable  production."</p>

By  withholding specific inalienable rights, a country is  discredited as being a democracy. The main feature of democracy  is that the government always exercises power on behalf of and  in the interests of the people." Those statements were made by  Foreign Minister Kooijmans in a speech at the University of Lund  in Sweden on Thursday [17 March].    As a human rights specialist, Kooijmans took a stance, more  clearly than before, against some Asian countries such as  Indonesia, where he will be traveling with Prime Minister  Lubbers next month. Indonesia is one of those countries that  maintains that human rights are not universal. According to  them, the rights of the people must be seen against the  historical, social, and cultural background of the country or  region concerned.    According to Kooijmans, this actually means that "human  rights are not identical for all." A government could then deny  any accusation of torture or ill-treatment of its citizens by  saying that people always have been tortured or ill-treated.  Also, they could allege that torture is part of the local  culture and that it thus should be seen as a national  "particularity" which legalizes the "exception" to the rule  according to which torture is banned.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: Beyond the North Winds - Max Loppert hails Birmingham Touring Opera's new production of Rameau's 'Les Boreades' BIG OPERATIC excitements are being unleashed in Birmingham. In five packed years of existence City of Birmingham Touring Opera has established a sharp-profiled artistic identity with its chamber-operatic versions of Boheme, Flute, Falstaff and a two-part Ring-cycle abridgement, all by the company's artistic director, Graham Vick. Now the company credo is being tested to the limit with a Rameau opera - Les Boreades (1764), last in his series of tragedies-lyriques, re-named Beyond the North Winds in Amanda Holden's new translation. The adventurousness of the undertaking needs to be underlined: this is no boiled-down CBTO Boreades production but a full-strength affair, with a 21-person period-instrument orchestra, a chorus of 15 and a dance-troupe of 12. What is more, it proves to be - shaming fact] - the first full-length Rameau opera production by any professional British opera company. Up to now this composer has been given solely in concert performance, in the pioneering 'historical' revivals of the English Bach Festival, and in student stagings. The small Birmingham company ventures lightfootedly where Covent Garden, with its opera and ballet companies on call, has so far feared to tread. There is, of course, a reason for such reluctance on the part of the big companies: the demands of the tragedie-lyrique form for highly organised, intricately interlaced patterns of song, dance and visual spectacle. Rameau stage-works do not play themselves. Part of the boldness of this new production comes, as it were, with the CBTO territory: a company whose policy is to perform in out-of-the-way venues to audiences of multifarious makeup must find a way of re-creating Les Boreades in terms of widely appealing modern stagecraft. Vick and his production associates (designer Paul Brown, choreographer Ron Howell) have managed this with enormous imaginative daring and zest. The choice of Birmingham performing space is itself an element in the risk-taking - the Mayfair Suite, an unused, decaying reception hall in the city's central shopping mall, forms a wonderfully louche, provocative backdrop to these fantasticated high-caste rituals of the courtly French lyric theatre. The tale of the re-discovery of the last Rameau opera has been told on this page more than once. This latest episode in that tale is designed to demonstrate in a new way what an astonishing piece of music-theatre it is. In Les Boreades Rameau welded the minutiae of the tragedie-lyrique format into longer spans of 'cumulative' music-drama than he had created before, cutting across formal convention and dazzling the ear with melodic inventions and instrumental combinations which further that dramatic condensation process. The libretto (probably by Cahusac) offered him choice opportunities for confronting opposed worlds of Greek mythology, decadent Bactrian aristocrats versus noble followers of Apollo, and for posing an heroic rescue quest as the central burden - at times the hieratic rites of Mozart's Flute and the Romantic dramaturgy of Weber and Wagner seem only a step away. A square white platform, framed at the back with sliding panels and a raised eyrie for the orchestra, with a revolve at its centre, forms here the foundation of Vick's re-invented Ramellian music-drama. Tuxedos and ball-gowns out of 1950s movie musicals clothe the Bactrians, saffron scarves and linen baggies the Apollonians. The 'marvellous machines' of 18th-century theatrical practice are supplied by sleight of hand and skilful (even if on Wednesday prey to computer-board dysfunction) lighting. In sum, this is pocket spectacle, worked up with impudent wit and keen colour-contrast which nevertheless suggest an understanding of and sympathy for the original. As yet it does not gel all the way through. Alastair Macaulay will shortly be reviewing the dance elements; for myself, I found the modern dance language sensitively forged - while the earlier dance divertissements look cluttered and lacking in strong, spare dance imagery, the finale is beautifully clean and joyful. The disposition of orchestra and singers to widely separate levels, bravely handled by all participants, puts a damper on rhythmic flair, that key Rameau characteristic. Simon Halsey, the conductor, seems in any case to favour a rather jogtrot-ish approach to tempo choice; in these spaces the instrumental sound was too often dulled and out of tune. The main shortage, I would suggest, is of vocal virtuosity: the CBTO cast are all capable young singers, practised in a wide range of operatic styles, but note-for-note precision of placing is in short supply, and verbal clarity is even scarcer  -only Jonathan Best (Adamas and Boreas) and Peter Jeffes (Apollo) make anything at all of the Holden translation. All this said, the whole achievement is exhilarating. Debussy, a Rameau appassionato, ended an appreciation of a 1903 Castor et Pollux revival with an apology for doing so at such length - but 'moments of real joy in life are rare'. Since this Boreades provides an abundance of those moments, I now echo the Debussy apology. CBTOpera at the Mayfair Suite, Birmingham this Saturday; then on tour to Salisbury, Coventry, Nottingham and the Brighton Festival</p>

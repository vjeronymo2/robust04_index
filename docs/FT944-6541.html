			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Salvesen plans distribution growth Christian Salvesen has made no secret of its desire to build itself up as a business services group, getting rid of some of its disparate operations and spending proceeds on distribution and specialist plant hire. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said yesterday: 'We are concentrating the business on distribution and Aggreko,' and he described the sale of Salvesen Bricks and Vikoma as a sensible move towards cleaning up its corporate structure. In the short term, however, analysts expect this strategy to reduce earnings per share, as the management will be challenged to find an equally profitable home for the cash. The bricks division was expected to make operating profits of more than Pounds 7m in the year to March 1995, while attracting a sale price of not much above Pounds 50m. Salvesen is expected to channel the proceeds into expanding its industrial distribution business into Europe, probably through acquisitions. Mr Masters said yesterday that industrial distribution in Europe was like UK food retail distribution 10 years ago, and offered enormous potential. Following the successful integration of Swift, Salvesen is now looking to broaden its distribution interests in both Europe and the US. In April this year, the company paid FFr57m (Pounds 6.77m) for a French frozen good distributor. Further purchases are expected. COMMENT Given Salvesen's surprise revelation last February of difficulties in its plant hire business, combined with tough competition in UK distribution, these results were roughly in line with expectations. Disposals will help fund the group's expanding distribution business, but investors will still want to be persuaded that the Aggreko plant hire business is under control. Problems in Europe and in Light &amp; Sound Design, suggest that further reassurance will be required. On a profits forecast of about Pounds 81.5m, Salvesen's shares are trading on a p/e of 12.9, but this discount to the sec-tor rating looks set to remain.</p>

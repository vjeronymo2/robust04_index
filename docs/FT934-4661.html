			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Pound falters after Budget After its initially positive reaction to the chancellor's tough Budget on Tuesday, the pound fell back yesterday to close a touch lower on the day - even though UK shares enjoyed one of the biggest rallies of the year and gilts continued to rise on the back of the Budget, writes Rachel Johnson. Mr Kenneth Clarke's outline of a sharply diminishing public sector borrowing requirement over the next few years - which should bring a big decline in gilts supply in its train - was among the best pieces of news that gilts had had all year. But other factors were clearly contributing to take the post-Budget shine off the pound. Topmost were investor fears of further UK interest rate cuts, combined with the view that sterling's level was about right for the moment. Mr Roger Bootle, UK economist at Midland Montagu, the securities house, said it was a little disappointing that demand for sterling had evaporated so fast after the Budget, but the market clearly had its reasons. 'The pound's effective range is DM2.40 to DM2.60. As soon as sterling starts trading comfortably above DM2.54 there is too much downside.' Above that level the authorities start becoming concerned about UK competitiveness, he added. On the Bank of England's trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies, sterling opened at 81.7 and finished slightly weaker at 81.6, as dealers sold off after the small rise in the currency. Against the dollar the pound finished at Dollars 1.4805, down from Dollars 1.4845, and against the D-Mark it slipped to a close of DM2.5425 from a previous DM2.5475. The chancellor's fiscal tightening and unexpected cut in government spending underpinned the currency late on Tuesday and sparked a 66-point jump in the FT-SE 100-share index yesterday. On monetary conditions, Midland economists could not understand why the money markets were showing such caution about the future path of interest rates. For according to their reading of the fiscal projections, the chancellor's PSBR cuts were predicated on revenues from strong economic growth. With the recovery still as yet not firmly established, there was no question that lower interest rates would be needed as a further stimulus for growth. Before last week's cut in the base rate to 5.5 per cent, the markets thought the interest rate floor would be about 5 per cent. But some economists have been arguing that economic conditions dictate a 4 per cent floor for some time. The sterling contract for June was just three basis points higher at 94.95, while the December short sterling contract ended fractionally lower at around 94.62. Gains in short sterling futures were concentrated in the contracts expiring from late 1994 onwards - the December 1994 contract was up 10 basis points at 94.85 at one stage. The markets took their lead from Mr Clarke, who suggested on BBC radio that he would not cut again 'unless and until' he was satisfied the right conditions existed. The three-month interbank rate moved a tiny bit lower to around 5 3/8 per cent, reflecting the view that the chancellor would level the rate to 5 per cent over the next few months. The Bank of England predicted a shortage of Pounds 1.15bn (revised from an earlier Pounds 900m) during the day, which it relieved with total help of Pounds 831m. The Bank bought Pounds 141m of band one bank bills at the established rate of 5 3/8 per cent. The dollar was guided by a revision in the US gross domestic product figure to 2.7 per cent, after a previous 2.8 per cent, in the third quarter. Economists had expected the revision to produce a number closer to 3 per cent, but rationalised the figure by recalling the heavy disruption caused by flooding in the Midwest during the three months. Growth for the final quarter is expected to near 4 per cent. The November survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management in Detroit reported a drop of 2.1 points to 60.0. But economists said it reflected strength in production, new orders and employment. The dollar ended a shade firmer at DM1.7175 in London, and finished at DM1.7237 in New York. There was bad news on the world trade talks, which are due to be finished in exactly a fortnight's time. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said the European Union must have an outline accord on the Uruguay Round of the Gatt trade talks well before December 15; and said there had been no progress on four problem areas. The D-Mark's weaker tone - following on from remarks made by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the new Bundesbank president, which helped to depress the currency on Tuesday - continued yesterday. The chances of an early easing in the Lombard or discount rates disappeared following the announcement that the Bundesbank would hold no news conference after its regular fortnightly council meeting today. This heightened expectation that the Bundesbank would take advantage of slower growth in broad money and lower inflation to ease on December 16. The central bank's last rate cut, on October 22, however, took the markets by surprise. During the day, the Bundesbank withdrew DM15.1bn in this week's fixed rate 6.25 per cent repo. This left call money firm and not far below the 6 3/4 per cent Lombard rate.</p>

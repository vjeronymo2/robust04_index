			<p>BFN     [Text] The negotiations on a cease-fire in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be held at the French mission in Geneva  on Saturday and Sunday [4 and 5 June]. This was stated for SRNA  by Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the People's Assembly of the  Serbian Republic [of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. As he said, he  received this piece of information from Nikiforov, the Russian  member of the contact group for the former Yugoslavia.    Yasushi Akashi, special UN envoy for the former Yugoslavia,  who held talks with the delegation of the Serbian Republic, is  trying to persuade all the warring sides to take part in the  continuation of the peace talks, Momcilo Krajisnik said. He  stressed that the Muslim delegation is abusing the problem of  Gorazde for the umpteenth time in order to obstruct peace in the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The representatives of the Serbian Republic should hold  informal talks in Geneva with Charles Redman, U.S. envoy for the  former Yugoslavia.</p>

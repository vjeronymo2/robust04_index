			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / New homes sales down, trade deficit up, in US SALES of new homes in the US fell 5 per cent in July compared to June, raising new doubts about the health of the housing market, the Commerce Department said yesterday. In a separate report, it said a surge in imports had resulted in a US trade deficit of Dollars 34.4bn (Pounds 23.2bn) in the second quarter, the biggest shortfall in more than five years. The weakness of new home sales puzzled analysts, as it had followed a recent drop in mortgage rates to the lowest level in more than two decades and a report last week of a robust 5.4 per cent gain in sales of previously owned homes last month. Sales fell in all regions, not just the flooded parts of the Midwest. Figures for June were also revised down sharply to show a gain from May of only 3.3 per cent, rather than the 11 per cent initially reported. The unexpected weakness since May left sales running last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 629,000 - far below Wall Street projections of about 675,000. For the first seven months of the year, however, sales were still nearly 7 per cent higher than in the equivalent period last year. The trade deficit rose 17 per cent in the second quarter compared to the first, mainly because consumer and investment demand in the US is much stronger than in its recession-hit trading partners. Exports rose 1.4 per cent from the first quarter to Dollars 113.1bn; imports rose 4.7 per cent to a record Dollars 147.5bn. The annualised deficit in the first half was Dollars 127.4bn compared with Dollars 96.1bn for the equivalent period last year.</p>

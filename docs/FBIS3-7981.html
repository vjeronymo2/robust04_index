			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Interview granted by President Ion Iliescu for the </F> magazine FORUM published under the aegis of the Council of  Europe"; place and date not given: "Back to Our Natural  Political Habitat"]    [Text] [FORUM] Mr. President, what does Romania's  admission to the Council of Europe represent?    [Iliescu] Romania's integration in European democratic  structures was a priority objective of our foreign policy, which  was actually affirmed right at the beginning of the December  1989 revolution. This is in keeping with our fundamental  interests, a fact that has been attested to by the interest  shown by the entire Romanian political spectrum in our country's  admission to the Council of Europe.    From an historical point of view, this event marks Romania's  ultimate release from the ideological prison, which placed it in  "Eastern Europe," and its natural reintegration in the area of  European civilization and political beliefs to which it always  used to belong.    The political changes that have occurred in Romania since  1989 -- complex and difficult changes that, from many points of  view, were more radical than in the other Central and East  European countries, ranging from the adoption of the new  Constitution to the operation of the new institutional system of  our political, economic, and social activity -- have been  recognized as contributing directly to the general process of  change in Europe, in full accordance with the fundamental  democratic norms and beliefs that have been preserved and  promoted by this institution -- the Council of Europe -- that is  a symbol of the renewal of the old continent .    [FORUM] As a full member of the Council of Europe, what are  your priorities within this organization?    [Iliescu] Our priorities are the priorities of Europe. The  creation of a new system of relations on the continent, both  political and economic, and removing the consequences of past  barriers do not take place on their own. There is, however, a  tendency to preserve former gaps and to create new barriers to  European reintegration.    The Council of Europe is the institution that is able to  play  an essential role in overcoming outdated mentalities and  promoting fundamental human values that, at this point, are more  necessary than ever before.    It can make a decisive contribution toward identifying new  ways and means of communication and cooperation.    It can create a new basis for broaching our common problems,  ranging from economic ones to those concerning our continent's  security, which has deteriorated so much due to the persistence  of open armed conflicts and the intensification of ethnic or  religious conflicts. The reestablishment of the unity of  civilization and culture in Europe, where diversity constituted  a source of progress and cultural enrichment for all countries,  constitutes, probably, our most important common objective. The  Council of Europe is the institution that is best suited to  promote its implementation.    [FORUM] On joining the Council, you promised to ratify the  European Convention on Human Rights; these rights were seriously  violated in your country before 1989. What is the situation  regarding their reestablishment?    [Iliescu] Reestablishing fundamental human rights and  freedoms in Romania represents and has always represented --  right from the beginning of the December 1989 revolution -- a  major objective of the process of social change that is under  way. The drafting and approval by Parliament, and later by  means of a referendum, of the new Constitution marked a decisive  stage in implementing this objective. The Constitution does not  only express fundamental rights and freedoms directly, but it  also stipulates, in an equal way, the prevalence of  international laws in this area.    [FORUM] International public opinion is concerned about the  minorities in Romania -- Hungarians, of course, but also others,  for example, the Gypsies. What policy will be practiced to  eliminate this concern? In what way may the Council of Europe  be of help in this respect?    [Iliescu] We intend to promote the policy of truth. As I  have said before, Romania has no reason to develop complexes on  account of its policy toward ethnic minorities.    Romania's laws and practice exceed by far the generally  accepted standards in this respect; there are not many European  states where minorities enjoy the same rights that they enjoy in  Romania, especially the Hungarian minority: Representation in  Parliament, local councils, education, cultural establishments,  publications in their mother tongue, and so forth.  Unfortunately, however, this reality was often distorted to  such an extent as to cause the international public concern to  which you are referring.    I regret that these false criteria are coming especially  from  countries that do not guarantee any rights to the ethnic  minorities with whom they coexist, including Romanian ethnics.    We hope that our country's admission to the Council of  Europe will enable us to step out of the shadow of neglect by  the media into which we were pushed by both domestic and foreign  forces hostile to truth and democracy.    We hope that the traditional Romanian tolerance that has  developed and which today is characterized by the absence of any  ethnic discrimination in our society may be verified and made  known to European public opinion.    Minorities in Romania are suffering because of economic  difficulties, the strategic errors made by the recently removed  totalitarian regime, the difficulties generated by the  transition to a market economy, the effects of the observation  of the embargo against former Yugoslavia and Iraq, and the world  recession. They are suffering in the same way as most Romanians  are suffering.    This is why I think that the "concern" voiced by public  opinion for the fate of minorities in Romania has to be  channeled toward seeking ways and means to ensure more  appropriate economic cooperation -- including a decrease in  protectionism -- , investments, and the transfer of managerial  and technological know- how so as to be able to capitalize fully  on Romania's tremendous human and natural potential.    [FORUM] Almost four years ago, the Council of Europe  launched assistance programs for the democratization of Central  and Eastern European countries. What do you think of these  programs and what are your concrete expectations for Romania?    [Iliescu] The answer to this question is the same as that  given to the previous question. Foreign assistance cannot be  ignored, but our own efforts and determination have essentially  helped Romania pass through the main stages -- from the most  despondent dictatorship to a European type of democratization --  in a relatively short period of time. From the institutional  point of view, the democratization process is, in general terms,  finished, while, in terms of mentality, development follows the  nature of things, that is to say, more slowly. All experts view  our Constitution as being very modern and democratic. We have  pluralism, separation of state powers, and freedom of opinion,  speech, press, and association and, in the past three years, we  have had four electoral consultations with the people (after the  general elections, local elections and a referendum on the  Constitution) which were recognized as being free and correct  not only according to the law but also in practice; we have all  the elements needed to guarantee democratic political activity.  At this point, there is no economic threat. However, if the  current economic recovery were to be halted, any development  would be possible, despite the Romanian people's craving for  democracy for the sake of which they braved the bullets of the  dictatorship in December 1989.    One should not forget that Hitler installed totalitarianism  in Germany in a politically democratic society that was facing,  however, economic collapse. Therefore, the main way in which  Europe can assist democracy in Romania is -- I am going to say  this although I risk repeating myself -- through open economic  cooperation, opening markets for Romanian trade, and through  investments and transfer of managerial and technological  know-how.    [FORUM] After Bulgaria, your country is the second country  within the Council of Europe with a common border with the new  Yugoslav Federation against which the international community  has imposed restrictions. This physical contact offers you the  privileged position of an observer. How do you assess the  development of the current situation?    [Iliescu] Our relations with the Yugoslav Federation, with  the countries within former Yugoslavia, are, in actual fact,  special. Romania is a country that, throughout history, has not  had any disputes or confrontations with any of those countries.  We will continue to believe, as we have always affirmed, that,  in order to avoid an escalation of bloody violence, the  regulation of the situation in this area -- the current  situation in the Yugoslav Federation can be assessed only by  bearing in mind all the problems created by the dismemberment of  former Yugoslavia -- can be achieved only through political will  and dialogue. This should be the only direction in which events  should develop: A peaceful solution.    Whether this comes sooner or later, involving costs and  human  sacrifices, as well as lower or higher economic losses, depends,  first and foremost, on the wisdom of the sides involved in the  conflict, but also on the capability and concern of other forces  that are able to arouse the interest of the world community in  order to eliminate this dangerous source of conflict in the  heart of Europe. We are certainly interested in a rapid  solution to the differences and in the removal of the embargo  that has had an enormous effect upon our economy from every  point of view.</p>

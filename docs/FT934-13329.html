			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Engineers' body set to open in China THE INSTITUTION of Electrical Engineers is to become the first European engineering society to establish a branch in China when it opens a centre in Beijing next week. The move, announced yesterday, is an important step for the institution, which has more than 130,000 members and is Europe's largest professional engineering society. It is part of an increasing push by the bigger UK institutions into emerging markets, where their unique role as qualifying bodies makes them attractive to local engineers. The institution is establishing a 10-city network in eastern Europe and former Soviet Union countries, while the Institution of Mechanical Engineers is looking at possible co-operation with national societies in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. Professor Peter Lawrenson, the institution's immediate past president, said it was confident that the Beijing branch would be of value to the Chinese engineering profession and Chinese industry as a whole. Engineering institutions are not trade associations, but the institution said that visits to China by its UK members would represent a way for them to increase business by 'networking' with their Chinese counterparts. The institution has 20 members in China, but said that more than 400 engineers are waiting to join. Once Chinese membership has risen, staff would be taken on to work at the Beijing branch. The aim is to help the development of electrical, electronic and manufacturing in China by stimulating the transfer of technology through the institution's publications, conferences and its information services. Mr Ma Yuzhen, the Chinese ambassador to London, said: 'As the world's fastest growing economy, we want to increase our technological links with the UK.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Oleg Velichko and Gennadiy </F> Yezhov]    [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- The inflow of foreign  investments in the Russian economy will reach 10-15 billion  American dollars per annum by the year 2000, according to First  Deputy Economics Minister of Russia Yakov Urinson. He spoke at  a meeting of the Consultative Council on Foreign Investments  under the Russian Government which opened in Moscow's President  Hotel today.    The meeting is being attended by the leaders of 14 major  transnational corporations of the world.    "So far the annual growth rate of foreign investments has  been recorded at a low level, Yakov Urinson said. This year,  for example, the total amount of investments reached a mere one  billion dollars, less than in Estonia. Russia is behind such  countries as Poland, Hungary and some others as regards foreign  investments. As of June 1, 1994, only 14,000 enterprises with  foreign capital has have been recorded on the Russian state  register.    Nonetheless, its attempts to lure cautious Western investors  Russia scored tangible results in stabilising its economic  conditions, Urinson said. Economic restructuring is being  carried out along with demilitarising the Russian economy --  over the past two years and a half the military order was cut by  70 per cent, inflation does not exceed 10 per cent a month over  the past five months. More than 40 per cent of the Russian  labour force are employed in private enterprises, and the  rouble's buying capacity against the dollar has increased by 12  per cent over the past five months of this year.    Enterprises with foreign capital have created approximately  300,000 new jobs, productivity has increased by 1.5 to two times  on average as compared to similar domestic enterprises, Urinson  said.</p>

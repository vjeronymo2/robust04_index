			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Letter: Central to working parents Sir, My guess is that Labour's 5-point lead among women voters disclosed by Harris (February 17) is directly due to different attitudes to the urgent problem of childcare. Until the present government overcomes the antiquated and short-sighted views of the Treasury and some of its own party backwoodsmen on a national, affordable, good-quality system of childcare, rather than tinkering at the margins, it cannot rely on the votes of millions of working parents who consider this matter ever more central to their economic lives.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Elections may not bridge that gap: Robert Graham examines the divide between Italy's industrialised north and a south dependent on state aid The saga of the Gioia Tauro steelworks in southern Italy is a sorry tale about broken promises, ill-conceived ideas, wasted money and cynical politicians. It epitomises the failure of state-sponsored development to bridge the divide between a rich, industrious north and central Italy and the world that exists south of Rome. Gioia Tauro is also a timely reminder, as Italy goes to the polls on Sunday, that the political and economic problems of the south are likely to become more complex after the elections. Here the old political order has not been swept away, unemployment is three times greater than in the north and large areas are in the grip of organised crime - not least at Gioia Tauro, where the Calabrian mafia, the 'ndrangheta, moved in on the back of public works contracts for a steel complex. Twenty-five years ago Gioia Tauro was the most fertile coastal plain in the region, rich with citrus and graced by ancient olive trees. Against technical advice it was selected over 11 other potential sites as the location for Italy's fifth integrated steel works. Gioia Tauro lacked a port, good roads, easy access to rail links, had no tradition of industry and was in a zone with a high risk of earthquakes. These drawbacks were, however, outweighed by the needs of the ruling Christian Democrat and Socialist party bosses. The steel project was presented as the key to industrialising Calabria, the most backward southern region. The steelworks was never built. The 1973 oil shock cut world demand for steel and the project became redundant. But it was only aborted after the infrastructure had been laid. The plant was conceived on the grandest scale imaginable to inflate the contracting business. The centrepiece was the largest artificial port in the Mediterranean with 5km of wharves. The port is still unused 15 years after completion. With luck it might become a container terminal. Elsewhere on the site, fly-overs vanish into weeds. The nearby industrial zone is vacant save for one state-owned factory. Three hundred jobs were promised in a venture by the arms manufacturer, Oto-Breda, to produce a new Nato missile. By the time the plant was finished in the early 1980s, the missile had been superceded. Oto-Breda's owner, the state industrial holding, Efim, was placed in liquidation in 1992 and the plant is up for sale. For the past 12 years, successive governments have backed plans to make good some of this waste by allowing Enel, the state electricity authority, to build a power station. This was blocked by environmental objections. When this hurdle was overcome, the state had to contend with the Calabrian mafia. In 1990 magistrates froze all construction contracts on suspicion that the construction companies were 'nadrangheta fronts in an area where some 60 'ndrangheta families operate. The magistrates' investigations led in January to 39 arrest warrants on corruption charges related to the contract, including the Enel chairman. Violent protests, meanwhile, by the jobless in Gioia Tauro forced the Ciampi government last autumn to sanction a new start on the power station. This was seen locally as a move to buy stability in the run-up to the elections. Today, few believe the project will be completed because of environmental protests, plans for Enel's privatisation, and the difficulty of ensuring against mafia involvement. What has happened at Gioia Tauro is a microcosm of what has been repeated in different degrees across the south. With a third of Italy's population, it was treated as a vital reservoir of votes by the Christian Democrats during the postwar era to hold the Communist party at bay. It suited politicians to create a culture of dependence - or assistenzialismo. Transfers to the south from the central government have on average accounted for about 60 per cent of gross domestic product since the 1950s. Income support, direct and indirect from the state, makes up 49 per cent of the south's GDP. According to Bank of Italy data, four-fifths of Italy's total public deficit is attributable to the south - the centre and north shows a surplus. The south absorbs 53 per cent of all public spending. Initially, the south accepted this as needed assistance, but it became an institutional habit of dependence. If the state (controlled by the local political parties) did not provide jobs in the south, then it offered unemployment subsidies or fake disability pensions or easy early retirement deals. The state also agreed with the unions to maintain a national minimum wage, even though productivity was often 20 per cent lower in the south. Where this safety net failed, the illicit economy controlled by organised crime helped out with income from contraband cigarettes, drugs, extortion, racketeering, usury. Until Rome politics was shaken two years ago by corruption scandals it suited the ruling parties to be tolerant of organised crime: in Sicily, Calabria and the Naples area the mafia delivered votes. The business success stories in southern Italy have been in areas close to Rome or where the grip of organised crime is slight, as in Puglia. It is no accident that Fiat opted to site its flagship car plant near rural Melfi in Basilicata, central southern Italy: the area is free of mafia links. Fiat has also been able to break away from the traditional labour market rigidities and introduce new working practices. No state industry would dare contemplate this, and smaller private investors lack the muscle to force such deals through. But the Melfi project, producing the Punto model launched last year, would also have been impossible without the commitment of L1,400bn in state aid. This is probably the last such act of state generosity to a private group. Not only is Brussels on the war-path against subsidies, unions in the north do not see why new jobs should be funded in the south when they need to protect existing ones in Turin. The more general debate on bankrolling the south has become central to the political platform of the populist Northern League. The league's appeal has evolved in good measure from the way its leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, has articulated the frustrations of hard-working northerners, who pay taxes to a government in Rome that squanders the money on ill-monitored transfers to the south. Despite these genuine objections, it is hard to see agreement on introducing a fresh approach to the problems of the south. The league wants to cut assistenzialismo but has no base in the south. Its allies in this election campaign are media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement and the neo-fascist MSI; and Mr Berlusconi is relying on the MSI structure to deliver the votes. Both are promising more jobs and more public works projects in the south. The left's Progressive Alliance is also committed to the principle of national solidarity, with the better-off regions helping the poorer, and would not stop the flow of money to the south. As for the discredited ruling parties in the centre, which have either recycled their candidates or picked from similar figures whose careers have been based on patronage, they have no interest in turning off the tap. None of the parties looks as if it has the will and ability to combine spending cuts with creating the conditions necessary to introduce the market economy that operates in the rest of Italy. Budget constraints will play a considerable part in weaning the south off state hand-outs. But this will merely increase the income gap between the north and the south and push the 'Mezzogiorno' back to the peripheral role it played when the first republic began after the war.</p>

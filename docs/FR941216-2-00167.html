(``CNGF''), both located at CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222&hyph;3199, have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 12(c) and 13 of the act and Rules 42, 43, 45 and 87&hyph;90 thereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG and CNGF request authorization, through December 31, 1998, for CNGF to finance the purchase of certain gas utilizing equipment (``Gas Equipment'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  by creditworthy <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  customers who purchase or may be expected to purchase gas directly or indirectly from the local distribution companies (``LDCs''), gas marketing or gas pipeline subsidiaries of the CNG system. In addition, CNG seeks authorization to provide CNGF with up to an aggregate of $25 million in funds, on a revolving basis, through December 31, 1998, to enable CNGF to make Gas Equipment financing loans to such customers. CNGF may obtain funds from CNG through this day by (1) selling CNGF common stock. $10,000 par value, to CNG, and/or (2) obtaining open account advances from CNG and/or (3) obtaining long-term loans from CNG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Gas Equipment to be financed would fall into one or more of the following categories: (1) Standard Gas Appliances _ the type of standard gas appliances contemplated by Rule 48, including such gas equipment as ranges, dryers, waterheaters and furnaces: (2) New Technology Equipment _ gas equipment marketed to promote new or unfamiliar technology that uses gas as a fuel (which could include equipment using existing technology designed for a new application), such as gas heat pumps, gas air conditioning and gas turbines; (3) Alternate Fuel Equipment _ gas equipment that enables an end-user to use natural gas as an alternative to another fuel; such equipment would include both conversion equipment necessary to convert non-gas utilizing equipment to equipment that can use gas as a fuel (e.g., energy connective apparatus enabling a coal-burning boiler to use gas as a fuel) and gas utilizing equipment that is manufactured and sold as a complete indivisible unit (e.g., compact gas generators).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A customer would be deemed creditworthy if it had asset and equity strength indicating a degree of expected liquidity and good financial management.

All such advances will be payable on demand and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. Long-term loans to CNGF will be evidenced by long-term non-negotiable notes (which may be book entry) of CNGF maturing over a period of time to be determined by the officers of CNG, with the interest predicated on and substantially equal to CNG's cost of funds for comparable borrowings by CNG. In the event that CNG has not had recent comparable borrowings, the rates will be tied to the Solomon Brothers, Inc. Bond Market Roundup, or to a comparable rate index, on the date nearest to the time of takedown. All such loans may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

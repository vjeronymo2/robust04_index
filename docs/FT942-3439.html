			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Hungary may grow only 1% Hungary's central bank yesterday admitted that its latest interest rate increase could hold back economic recovery. Mr Almos Kovacs, deputy president of the National Bank of Hungary, forecast that GDP would grow by just 1 per cent in 1994. The central bank's internal projection had been for output to bounce back by 2-3 per cent this year after falling by 21 per cent between 1989 and 1993. Hungary, burdened by a gross foreign debt of Dollars 25.5bn, has been slower than Poland and the Czech Republic to emerge from the east Europe-wide recession. The NBH revised its economic outlook in the light of its decision last week to increase the base rate by three points to 25 per cent and raise 'repo' rates by two points. The monetary authorities acted to reduce a current account deficit which last year exceeded 10 per cent of GDP. The central bank called yesterday on the incoming Socialist-led government to play its part by cutting government spending. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the likely finance minister in the new adminstration, has committed himself to introducing a restrictive mini-budget later this summer.</p>

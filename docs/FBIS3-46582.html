The investigation into such payments  rocked Japanese society during the past year.    The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has narrowed  the  number of possible suspects to the handful of parliamentarians,  who had either been cabinet ministers or had exerted influence  on general contractors and Construction Ministry officials, the  sources said.    Prosecutors are looking into whether those politicians had  professional authority in connection with the receipt of the  money, an essential precondition for being able to arrest and  then indict them, the sources said.    Over the past decade of bribery scandals involving  politicians in Japan, prosecutors faced difficulty in proving  that they had official authority. In most cases, politicians  called the money they received "political donations," paid to  support their political activities.    In the past year, prosecutors arrested and subsequently  indicted two governors, three mayors and a number of executive  officials of general contractors for bribery in connection with  prefectural and municipal public works projects. Among the  businessmen arrested were Takashi Hashimoto, 57, then vice  president of Taisei Corp., Hiroyuki Koyama, 67, then vice  president of Shimizu Corp., and Shinji Kiyoyama, 67, then vice  president of Kajima Corp.    Hashimoto was charged with sending 20 million yen each to  then Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro Honma and then Sendai Mayor Toru  Ishii, Koyama with giving 10 million yen to then Ibaraki Gov.  Fujio Takeuchi, and Kiyoyama with supplying Takeuchi 20 million  yen. The delivery of the money was conducted between December  1992 and January 1993.    These governors, mayors and businessmen all resigned after  their arrest. Kiyoyama, Koyama and Hashimoto have told  prosecutors that they provided secret money to politicians.    Over the past several years, general contractors have  reportedly provided 5 million to 10 million yen each in secret  money to former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Shinseito  co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, former Posts and Telecommunication  Minister Hideo Watanabe and former Construction Minister Kishiro  Nakamura. These politicians were once highly regarded members  of the Liberal Democratic Party's construction lobby.    Takeshita, who was prime minister between November 1987 and  June 1989, is currently a conservative independent after he was  dropped from the LDP list of candidates in the July 18 general  election for the House of Representatives. He was at the center  of public criticism for allegedly winning support from an  underground boss to become LDP president in 1987, a position  that carried with it the post of prime minister at that time.    Ozawa currently is one of the most influential politicians  as  the chief political strategist for the coalition government of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. As the favorite disciple of  disgraced political power broker Shin Kanemaru, he served as an  LDP secretary general and acting head of the LDP's largest  faction headed by Kanemaru. But he parted from the LDP to form  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) in June.    Watanabe, who was posts and telecommunications minister  under  then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for one year starting in  November 1991, lost his seat in the July general election.    Nakamura joined the Miyazawa cabinet as construction  minister  in the December 1992 reshuffle.    A number of construction scandals have surfaced since  Kanemaru, a former LDP vice president, was arrested in March on  suspicion of evading more than 1 billion yen in income tax. The  arrest came five months after Kanemaru retired from politics.    The number of contractor executives and heads of prefectural  and municipal governments apprehended stands at 29.</p>

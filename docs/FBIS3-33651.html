He is probably the most respected man  in Gaza and very popular as a dissident within the PLO.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] The peace agreement leaves many things to be  desired, but its most important fault is that it does not  question Israeli claims on the occupied territories. Also, it  says nothing about the colonization process in Jerusalem and  elsewhere. The Israelis claimed right from the start that this  territory was Israeli territory. That is why they called the  1967 war a "war of liberation." That has remained like that:  They have never admitted that they were occupiers. And that  means that they have claims on the occupied territories. The  fact that this agreement does not cover this aspect, and does  not ask Israel to give up these claims, is its big fault. They  are actively colonizing Jerusalem, despite the agreement which  says that Jerusalem will come on the agenda in the final phase  of the negotiations.    In other words, Jerusalem has been virtually given up to the  Israeli side. Nothing was said about the settlements -- there  is a silent agreement on two different entities in the occupied  territories. Firstly the Israeli entity, which is the  "settlers," and secondly the Palestinian entity, with separate  administrative and legal systems.    This, too, will lead to major obstacles for us, on our way  to  our long-term goal, which is our own independent state.    [KNACK] Do you not believe that in a later phase of the  process the "settlers" would be sent back anyway?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] Now, in the interim period, they could at  the  very least have given positive signs that the final outcome was  still open for discussion. But all that Israel is doing at  present is further reducing the credibility of that agreement on  the ultimate solution. As I said back in Madrid, the  settlements are not compatible with peace. Even James Baker  agreed.    [KNACK] You and others have signed a text which was sent to  the PLO leadership in Tunis ...    ['Abd-al-Shafi] That was a memorandum on democratic  practice.  After the agreement became fact, we wanted at least to be able  to work democratically in managing our own affairs in the areas  which will be transferred. We are certainly against 'Arafat  remaining the only source of decisions. Therefore, we are  asking for a broad basis to the decision making process, we are  asking the Executive Committee to work as a collective  leadership, we want competence and quality to not be sacrificed  to political and personal considerations, things in that line ...    [KNACK] Here in Gaza, the people are worried about a  possible  dictatorial regime which 'Arafat might bring from Tunis ...    ['Abd-al-Shafi] Look, if we are going to manage our own  affairs, then it is no more than normal that we ask that type of  question. You should not read too much into that. An  administration which meets the people's needs must be  constructed along democratic lines: accountability,  transparency and so on. The people are worried, they want to be  certain that this is what it will actually become.    [KNACK] How do you see such a democracy? In the past you  refused to lead an opposition party in the name of Palestinian  unity.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] It is still too early to talk about that. I  do know that pluralism is one of the aspects of democracy. If  we organize our own society, in the context of freedom and  independence and the rest, then pluralism will certainly be a  part of it. But now we are thinking about that broad basis for  the decision making process and collective leadership. I hope  that the elections in July are orderly and produce an elected  leadership which itself will work democratically. But real  democracy is still a way off. You cannot just give or take  democracy, democracy is a process.    [KNACK] Do you think that the peace agreement can  nevertheless have positive results?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] I hope that we will manage our affairs  competently and thus prove that we are capable of doing so.  That is very important. That does not mean that we must forget  the things which are not covered in this agreement.    [KNACK] Do you believe that the leadership in Tunis can  democratize itself?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] Democracy can only be achieved in an  atmosphere of freedom and independence. What we are thinking  about now -- a collective leadership and the like -- is possible  because the Executive Committee is made up of representatives of  the different groups. If they introduce a spirit of democracy,  then it will become an example of democratic practice. That  would be meaningful in the present circumstances, and then the  practice of the Palestinian National Council and the Central  Committee could be democratized. That would be reflected in the  behavior of representatives of the leadership who are appointed  for the duration of the interim period. It is a process which  creates its own dynamic, but first it must start.    [KNACK] So won't it again be 'Arafat who decides to launch  democratization?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] No, it does not have to be that way. If the  group of delegates has the will to push this through, then it  can do so.</p>

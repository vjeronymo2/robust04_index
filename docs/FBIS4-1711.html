			<p>BFN     [Text] The CPC Committee of the Tibet Armed Police Corps  held an expanded meeting in Lhasa on the morning of 28 February.  Those attending the meeting included Zi Cheng, member of the  Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee Standing Committee, and  Zhou Qishun, vice chairman of the Tibet Regional Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC].    In his opening address, Major General Zhang Zhu, political  commissar of the Tibet Armed Police Corps, said: The guiding  ideology and main tasks of this meeting are, using Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as guidance and based on a series of General  Secretary Jiang Zemin's important instructions on building up  the armed police force, to diligently study and carry out the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, the expanded meeting of the CPC Committee of the  Armed Police Corps, the Fifth Expanded Plenary Meeting of the  Fourth Tibet Regional CPC Committee, the Tibet Regional Meeting  on Public Security and Judicial Work, and the meeting of  directors of public security departments (bureaus); to sum up  the Tibet Armed Police Corps' work of 1993; to lay down a plan  for its work for 1994; and to mobilize all officers and men to  study the situation and to work in a down-to-earth manner, in  order to accomplish all tasks entrusted by the higher  authorities, to strive to raise the Corps' troop building to a  new level, and to make greater contributions to preserving the  motherland's unification and to maintaining Tibet's stability.    Zhang Zhu pointed out: In the new situation, the  responsibilities of the armed police are even more arduous.  This year is a crucial one in which the country will deepen  reform and develop a socialist market economic system. In this  year, Tibet also will launch some major reform measures. These  measures will inevitably result in the adjustment of interests  and relationships between various sectors, and some new  destabilizing factors will emerge in the course of reform.  Therefore, maintaining stability is very important -- without a  stable social environment, Tibet's economic construction cannot  be carried out smoothly. The developing situation urgently  requires that we quicken the pace of construction, improve our  performance, and raise our work to a new level in the new year.    Those attending the meeting included members of the CPC  Committee of the Tibet Armed Police Corps; officials in charge  of military and political affairs of all detachments; leaders of  logistics, frontier affairs, and other sections of all  detachments; major leaders of units directly under the corps and  of all frontier checking stations; and leaders of the corps'  offices and other departments, totalling 110 persons.</p>

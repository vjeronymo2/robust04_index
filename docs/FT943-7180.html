			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Wellcome takes SmithKline to court over drug patents Wellcome, the UK drug company, is taking its rival SmithKline Beecham to court in the US, accusing it of infringing the patents on its best-selling drug Zovirax, a treatment for herpes and shingles. The suit claims that the SmithKline drug Famvir, launched last month in the US, produces inside the body a 'virtually identical' molecule to that covered by Wellcome patents. Wellcome wants an injunction against the sale of Famvir in the US and is claiming unspecified damages for loss of sales. SmithKline said the legal action was a surprise. It denied infringing any patents and said it would defend the actions. This is the first patent suit in recent years by Wellcome against a multinational drug company. It comes after a series of changes in top management at the company, including the promotion in May of Dr David Barry from the company's US operations to head of research, development and medical affairs. Patent suits are commonplace in the drugs industry, especially in the US. Winning even a few weeks' extra legal protection for a drug can mean tens of millions of dollars in increased earnings for the patent holder. About Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 960,000) worth of Zovirax is sold every day in the US. With total sales likely to be worth more than Dollars 1.3bn this year, Zovirax is the fifth-biggest brand of prescription drug in the world, according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers. The legal action is a distraction for SmithKline for which Famvir is one of its most promising new products. The UK company's new chief executive, Mr Jan Leschly, has already launched it into acquisitions and new markets. Ms Jo Walton, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said that if SmithKline lost the legal action it could be forced to pay a royalty to Wellcome. Withdrawal of the drug was unlikely. The action relates to the biochemistry of the two drugs. As well as alleging that Famvir and Zovirax break down inside the body to virtually identical active ingredients, Wellcome argues that the method by which Famvir is absorbed was previously patented. Famvir is available only in the US and the UK, where it was launched in January this year. A brief price skirmish between the two companies in the UK resulted in a price cut of 5 per cent for Zovirax. There was no such skirmish in the US and the two drugs have 'parity on costing', said SmithKline. Wellcome shares rose 11p to 720p and SmithKline Beecham's 'A' share lost 2p to 446p yesterday. Wellcome added legal action outside the US was unlikely. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Lech Walesa has not accepted Dariusz  Rosati's candidacy for the post of deputy prime minister and  finance minister, which was put forward to him by Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak. The meeting between the president and the prime  minister in the Belweder ended an hour ago.    [Reporter Piotr Jazwinski] The Belweder talks lasted less  than 30 minutes. The prime minister presented the president  with the motion to appoint Dariusz Rosati to the post of deputy  prime minister and finance minister and a request to accept it.  The president did not accept this candidacy because, as  [presidential spokesman] Minister Andrzej Drzycimski explained,  it created a double risk.    [Begin Andrzej Drzycimski recording] Mr. Dariusz Rosati may  not sufficiently know the Polish realities. After all, his  three years' absence from Poland does play an enormous role in  these processes and the changes we were implementing, and this  may make making difficult economic decision even more difficult.  Also, too much may depend on secondhand information.    And the second thing, the second risk that the president  raised was the Foreign Debt Servicing Fund [FOZZ] case. The  legal situation has not been completed yet. The investigation is  going on, although there are statements by the justice minister.  Nonetheless, the case is still being investigated, and there may  be unnecessary connections in such a difficult situation we find  ourselves in. [end recording]    Dariusz Rosati was on the FOZZ Supervisory Board. Minister  Drzycimski passed over in silence the question as to whether the  failure to accept Rosati's candidacy would start a war between  the Belweder and the Democratic Left Alliance. He added that  the question of the president's signature on the Budget Law was  still open. [video shows Walesa entering a hall and meeting  Pawlak, Drzycimski speaking to journalists]</p>

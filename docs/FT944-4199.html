			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Arts: Fascinating Aida's sugar-coated pill - Alastair Macaulay writes a letter to his niece Darling Rachel, Well, even if you weren't going to see Fascinating Aida, you'll sooner or later find yourself quoting them anyway; so you'd better go sooner. Not that I'm saying that you yet have any cause, while you're still only 20, to quote a song like 'Fell in Love with a Man in Love with Another Man' . . . But the pc song is bound to come in handy. 'We're politically correct, politically correct, All phallocentric language we reject. It's no use agreeing, We hate you just for being'. Try it some time over Christmas at your father? The great thing about Fascinating Aida, though, is not that you find yourself quoting their words. Kit and the Widow are quoteworthy too, for instance, but their music? The joke with those boys is that you've heard just about all the music before. With these three women - Adele Anderson, Issy van Randwick, and, most delectably, Dillie Keane - it's the music that lodges the words under your skin; the music, and their musicality in singing it. More particularly, the contrast between what they're saying (mainly breathtakingly tough) and how they're singing (mainly very sweet) develops an astonishing irony - like a sugar-coated pill. The way their swingle-jazz item, 'My Favourite Tool', also becomes a rap number too is, I think, musically brilliant, and it has the audience laughing long before they take in the words. But about half their songs are quiet waltzes, and it's typical of them that to the most tenderly Victorian of these they address, dolcissimo, 'Dear little two-headed baby . . . the very last word in genetic mutation . . . What joy to give birth at a hundred at eight . . .' As I quote the mere words, their cynicism sounds all too horrid; but when you hear the music, the honeyed lullaby-like hush of it adds the most bewildering charm to it. Still, their lyrics are a marvel of polish. Triple rhymes abound. (On being back with an old boyfriend: 'I'm deranged/ To think that you have changed/ I'd like to see your features rearranged.') Camilla Park-and-Ride is there, and Mrs Major, and Naomi Campbell, and Portillos. There's already a little song about the cancellation of extra VAT on fuel. Especially in the second half, I guffawed at a number of unquotable lines. But maybe their most wonderful feat is in putting together a whole clutch of soft blues numbers in Part One - numbers that cause a ripple of sympathy or approbation but scarcely one laugh. The mood darkens, and the tender plight of modern women is expressed in several different facets. 'Fell in Love with a Man in Love with Another Man' is actually the most beautifully haunting song of the evening. I sound like a groupie, but no. After years of hearing about them, and hearing cassettes of them, this is the first time I've actually been to see them. Which is worth it from the first moment Dilly Keane appears, with her dolorous face, big, hooded eyes, and the sagging corners of her dejected mouth. Adele Anderson looks like a suave society lady from the 1950s; and Issy van Randwick like what used to be called a calculating little minx. All of which heightens the comedy; and turns the knife in the wound. Come and stay if you're passing through London. Otherwise I'll see you at Christmas. Much love from your wicked uncle, Alastair Garrick Theatre, WC1 until January 21</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Outokumpu FM1.4bn issue goes ahead Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday went ahead with a FM1.4bn (Dollars 270m) share issue, following Nokia, the tele-communications company which this week completed a FM2.5bn issue, the biggest international offering by a Finnish company. Outokumpu fixed the price for the offered units of one A share and one warrant at FM82.50. The company is issuing 13.5m units, while the Finnish state, until now the majority shareholder, is selling 4.5m. Subscribers have the right to trade six warrants for one A share at a price of FM92 before June 28 1996. The pricing compared with a closing price for Outokumpu A shares of FM83 on Wednes-day. Outokumpu said a further 3.3m units had been granted to the underwriters as an over-allotment option. If these are taken up, the issue will raise a total of FM1.3bn for Outokumpu and FM480m for the state. Strong demand from both overseas and Finnish investors will have come as a relief to Outokumpu, as there had been some nervousness that the weakness of worldwide stock markets and a heavy flow of issues from Finland in recent months would dampen enthusiasm. The proceeds are to be used to strengthen Outokumpu's balance sheet and to reduce debt. If the over-allotment option is fully taken up, the state's holding in Outokumpu, which strengthened profits strongly in the first four months, will fall from 50.1 per cent to 38.2 per cent, the latest in a series of similar moves to reduce state ownership in Finnish industry. The Outokumpu issue followed a successful issue by Nokia, the star of the Finnish stock exchange which last week became the first Finnish company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Nokia's original offer of 5m shares was eventually raised to 6m, raising a total of FM2.5bn to help fund its fast-growing mobile telephones business.</p>

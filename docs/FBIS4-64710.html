			<p>BFN     [Text] The Turkish Grand National Assembly has approved  the authorization bill which empowers the Council of Ministers  to issue law-decrees to adopt measures for privatization.    The authorization bill, which was approved during last  night's Assembly session under Vefa Tanir, transforms the Public  Corporations High Council into the Privatization High Council  and the Public Corporations Administration Chairmanship into the  Privatization Administration Chairmanship. Under the bill, the  authority to privatize is given to the Privatization High  Council, chaired by the prime minister and composed of three  ministers and the chairman of the Privatization Administration.    However, privatization decisions regarding commercial  institutions, which do not fall under this [word indistinct]  status but whose entire capital belongs to the state or to  public corporations, will be approved and effected by a Council  of Ministers decree. The bill expands the scope of  privatization and stipulates that a Privatization Fund be  established to collect the income resulting from privatization  moves.    Furthermore, the bill envisages that unemployment benefits  be  paid to persons, who are employed on a salary in the  institutions pegged for privatization, who are dismissed with  severance pay, and who are left unemployed as a result of the  privatization, reduction in size, liquidation, or closing down  of these institutions. Moreover, an account will be opened in  order to assist these persons in finding new jobs and retraining  them, and funds will be transferred to this account from  privatization revenues.    Under the bill, the duties allocated to the Public  Corporations Administration with the aim of encouraging the  workers to save and utilizing these savings as well as the  administration of the Public Corporations Fund is transferred to  the Treasury and Foreign Trade Undersecretariat. According to  the bill, the Council of Ministers will be able to use the  authority to issue law-decrees in connection with privatization  measures for three months.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Telfos disposes of three offshoots Telfos Holdings has taken its policy of concentrating on railway engineering activities a stage further by disposing of three subsidiaries involved in the manufacture of non-ferrous wire, metal spraying equipment and related services. The three offshoots - Charles Clifford, Metallisation and Metallisation Service - have been sold to an unnamed buyer for Pounds 2.1m cash. Telfos will use the proceeds to provide additional working capital. Over the 15 month period to March 31 1991, the three companies made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.1m. Telfos yesterday said it would not be paying a half-year dividend to preference share holders. Jenbacher, an Austrian engineer, made a Pounds 51m bid last November.</p>

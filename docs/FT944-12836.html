			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Goldman Sachs recommends early interest rates rise Interest rates should rise soon to hold down inflation, says a report published today by City stockbroker Goldman Sachs, Daniel Green writes. The report says that analysis of the firm's inflation indicators provides 'a strong case' for the rise if the government wants inflation to remain in its target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. The warning comes ahead of tomorrow's Bank of England third quarter inflation report and Wednesday's meeting between the chancellor of the Exchequer and the Bank's governor.</p>

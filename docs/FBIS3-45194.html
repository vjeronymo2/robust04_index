The Minister of  Public Health, Mr. Chen Minzhang, said that the key work in this  sector will lie in the prevention of accepting "red pockets" and  commission while at the same time curbing charging at one's own  will.    The correction of wrongdoing was put at the top of the  agenda  at the first national meeting held by the ministry this year.  The goal set for this year is to achieve a confidence rate of  90 percent by patients in terms of the treatment they receive in  hospitals. The goal for satisfaction at the medical skill shown  by medical personnel and the manner they render their services  is set at 80 percent by patients while the rate of settling  cases involved in malpractices is also set at 80 percent.    Mr. Chen stressed that hospitals of various kinds had to  adopt effective measures this year to halt the paying and  receiving of commission resulting from the transfer of patients  to another hospital. Medical personnel found to have received  commission for transferring patients to another hospital for  treatment will be seriously dealt with. Administration of the  financial system in a hospital must be put under strict control  in a bid to ban the practice of receiving commission by medical  personnel.    Mr. Chen added that regulations on the charging of fees had  to be observed. Hospitals in various places which set up their  own system of charging had to stop such practices at once while  other hospitals which charge a fee higher than the stated  standard fee had to correct their practice as soon as possible.  Adjustment of charging of fees must follow certain procedures  in accordance with stated regulations and approval by higher  authorities is absolutely necessary.    Work on tackling the acceptance of "red pockets", commission  and the practice of random charging proved a success to a  certain extent last year. Public health bureaus in Beijing,  Tianjin and Shanghai handed down disciplinary measures or  economic punishment to nearly 300 persons guilty of the  above-mentioned practices.    Incomplete statistics from 20 provinces show that cases  involving random charging by various hospitals were put at 500  and 170 of them whose fees were randomly charged were cancelled.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> X-CLAN RAPPERS PUT MESSAGE OVER GROOVES  </P> <P> They wore pounds of beads and leather fezzes; women shimmied behind them in  African-cloth bikinis. Sidemen twirled red-black-and-green Afrikan flags, as if  it were half-time at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> They led their audience in Zulu war chants, proselytized for a Brooklyn  political-action group called Blackwatch, and asked the musical question, "How  Black Is It?" (The answer came booming back, "Very, very black.") One of them  mopped his brow halfway through the set, and said, "Isn't it great to be sweaty  and black?"  </P> <P> They were the hot New York political rap group X-Clan, making their West Coast  debut at a packed Hollywood Live on Thursday. But the group's rappers Lumumba  Professor X and Grand Verbalizer Funkin' Lesson Brother J could have been  performing in an "In Living Color" parody of militant hip-hop if they weren't  so serious about what they were doing.  </P> <P> Between sermons they rapped to beats taken from George Clinton, rapped  professionally and remarkably solemnly, never for a moment sacrificing the  sanctity of their message for the sake of the groove. Topic A . . . and B and C  and D . . . was the semiotics of Blackness, from its roots in African  prehistory to lynchings that might have happened last week, smoothly put in  context. You could admire their act, but it wasn't easy to like. X-Clan appears  again at Hollywood Live tonight. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

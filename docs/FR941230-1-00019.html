			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amount of the payment would be increased by 20 percent in cases where (1) the bond may be redeemed in accordance with its terms or (2) the establishment of a defeasance escrow would not satisfy the requirements of &sect;1.141&hyph;13(b)(4) (relating to defeasance of nonqualified bonds) as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonqualified bonds would have the same meaning as in &sect;1.141&hyph;13(g)(1), except that in the case of a transfer for cash as defined in &sect;1.141&hyph;13(b)(1), the determination of the nonqualified bonds would be based on an amount equal to the disposition proceeds. Nonqualified bonds that continue to be treated as tax-exempt because of a permissible remedial action under &sect;1.141&hyph;13 (b), (c), or (d) (for example, because of a permissible redemption) would not be treated as nonqualified bonds for purposes of the closing agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To enter into the agreement, the issuer also would have to agree to (1) redeem the nonqualified bonds on the earliest date on which the bonds may be redeemed under their terms, (2) not make any payment under the closing agreement from bond proceeds as described in section 103(a) of the Code, and (3) comply with &sect;1.141&hyph;14 with respect to any refunding of the nonqualified bonds. In limited situations where it is foreseeable that the issuer, using its best efforts, will be unable to redeem the bonds at the earliest date, the Commissioner may permit the bonds to remain outstanding until a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, for cases in which the conditions of &sect;1.141&hyph;13(a) are not satisfied, the amount required to be paid under the closing agreement would be based on the highest marginal individual income tax rate at the time of the deliberate action and the interest paid or accrued on the nonqualified bonds from the issue date. If the noncompliance occurred or was expected to occur as of the issue date, the nonqualified bonds would include all the bonds of the issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> M. Section 1.141&hyph;14&blank;Refunding Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General rules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The industrial development bond regulations provide only limited guidance on the application of the private activity bond limitations to refunding issues. The proposed regulations provide guidance regarding the application of the private activity bond test to refunding issues, including guidance regarding whether an issue to refund a qualified bond is a qualified bond. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Private activity bond status <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The proposed regulations generally provide that refunding issues are retested to determine if those bonds are private activity bonds. These tests are applied based on the use of the proceeds of the refunded issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualified bond status <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The proposed regulations also generally provide that refunding issues are retested to determine if those bonds are qualified bonds. These tests are applied based on the use of the proceeds of the refunded issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> N. Section 1.141&hyph;15&blank;Anti-abuse Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations contain an anti-abuse rule to ensure that the regulations are applied consistently with the purposes of section 141. In the case of a transaction entered into for a principal purpose of transferring to a nongovernmental person significant benefits of tax-exempt financing in a manner that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 141, the Commissioner may take any action to reflect the substance of the transaction. The proposed regulations provide several examples illustrating the application of the anti-abuse rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> O. Section 1.145&hyph;1&blank;Qualified 501(c)(3) Bonds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide certain limited guidance for purposes of applying the provisions of section 145, relating to qualified private 501(c)(3) bonds. Thus, generally, as under section 141, compliance with section 145 is determined based on the issuer's reasonable expectations as of the issue date, although deliberate actions may cause the bonds to fail to be qualified bonds. The proposed regulations also provide that the remedial actions under proposed &sect;1.141&hyph;13 apply for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> P. Section 1.148&hyph;6&blank;Arbitrage Allocation and Accounting Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide additional guidance regarding when expenditures of proceeds must be allocated and accounted for under the arbitrage regulations. The proposed regulations provide that if an issuer fails to account for the expenditure of bond proceeds, the proceeds of the issue are accounted for under a specific tracing method. An issuer would be required to account for the allocation of proceeds to expenditures not later than 18 months after the later of the payment of the expenditure and the date the project financed by the issue is placed in service. In no event may the allocation occur after the first arbitrage rebate installment payment would be due for the issue. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

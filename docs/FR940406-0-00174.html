Product Restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an alternative to technological improvements, manufacturers could improve their CAFE by restricting their product offerings, e.g., limiting or deleting production of particular larger light truck models and larger displacement engines. Such product restrictions, if made necessary by selection of a CAFE standard that is above manufacturers' capabilities, could result in adverse economic impacts on the industry and the economy as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To develop an independent indicator of the potential impacts of a standard that could be met only by product restrictions, the agency estimated the loss of production associated with sufficient production restrictions by GM to raise its CAFE by 0.5 mpg. To estimate this effect, the agency eliminated production of GM's least fuel efficient models until the desired improvement in CAFE was achieved. NHTSA stated in the NPRM that this approach tends to yield the maximum possible negative impacts, because it does not include the possibility of consumers accepting a smaller truck or engine, or switching to vehicles over 8500 pounds GVWR. Also, it ignores the possibility of additional technological improvements to these truck fleets, or compliance through the use of credits earned in other model years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For MY 1996, the NHTSA analysis indicates that to increase its CAFE by 0.5 mpg by restricting sales, GM could suffer a sales loss of up to 151,000 units of its projected light truck production for that year. The potential job losses under this scenario in manufacturer and supplier industries could total roughly 25,000. For MY 1997, a similar increase in CAFE of 0.5 mpg could cause GM a sales loss of up to 142,000 units, with a concurrent potential loss to the industry of nearly 24,000 jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GM commented that it takes issue with NHTSA's statement that its analysis of job losses is necessarily an upper bound. That company stated that it could be that a manufacturer's product restrictions would not be done by eliminating the least fuel efficient vehicles first from its CAFE fleet, but a manufacturer could instead choose to restrict products based not only on their fuel efficiency but also their profit contributions. GM stated that this strategy could lead to larger lost sales and jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the considerations discussed above, NHTSA concludes that significant product restrictions should not be considered as part of manufacturers' capabilities to improve their MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Manufacturer-Specific CAFE Capabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed later in this notice, NHTSA takes ``industrywide considerations'' into account in setting fuel economy standards. In carrying this out, the agency has traditionally focused on the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of light truck sales. For MYs 1996&hyph;97, the agency has determined that GM is the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

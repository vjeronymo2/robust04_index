			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Accounts body heeds pleas over rule change The Accounting Standards Board has responded to urgent pleas from the insurance sector to defer aspects of one of its new financial reporting rules. The board, which decides how financial information is presented in the UK, has issued a draft document for public comment on Financial Reporting Standard 5. It is also to allow syndicates of Lloyd's, the insurance market, an additional two years to implement FRS 5 for existing financial reinsurance. The standard, published in April, was designed to make company transactions reflect their substance and not merely accord with legal form. Under the standard Lloyd's syndicates would have had to change the way they accounted for financial reinsurance contracts - such as time and distance policies - used by syndicates to manage their reserves more effectively. Adoption of the new standard would have caused a one-off loss to syndicates, the annual joint ventures of Names which underwrite business at the market. Lloyd's told the board that it planned two big developments - a reinsurance company, NewCo, and the application of discounting to syndicates' liabilities - and would welcome a deferment of FRS 5.</p>

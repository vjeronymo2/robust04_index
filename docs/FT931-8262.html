			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (8): When to take Pentium - How users will react to a new microchip A MUCH more powerful, PC microchip called Pentium is soon to be launched by Intel to follow its popular current-generation 486 microprocessor. For PC users or perspective buyers this raises questions about what they should do now. Should they stay with the PC they may already have, or buy the first Pentium-based PC available? Pentium (which could be considered a 586) leads a pack of new, higher-performance microprocessors that are emerging, such as the Alpha from Digital Equipment and the PowerPC from the Apple Computer-IBM-Motorola alliance. These process data 64 bits at a time compared to 32 bits with a 486. As each of these microprocessors is designed to provide big performance improvements, a user or perspective buyer needs to know how and when to best upgrade his existing hardware and software; the availability of new software; and whether his current software will run on Pentium-based PCs. Significantly, how will the new microprocessors affect PC costs? The best thing may be to stay with what a user already has for a while. 'Buy an economical 486SX which runs Windows right now,' recommends Mr Kim Brown, microsystems vice president at InfoCorp, a market research company in Santa Clara, California. If a user wants more performance later in the year, incorporate an Intel DX2 Overdrive microchip that doubles processor performance, Mr Brown suggests. DX2 Overdrive prices are too high at the moment but should become reasonable later on, he says. Then next year, as Pentium-based PC prices begin to fall, look carefully at existing applications and determine whether Pentium provides a viable and needed alternative, he adds. A buy-486-and-hold strategy makes sense to Ms Nancy Tanana, marketing manager at the PC business unit of Digital Equipment in Acton, Massachusetts. If the applications in use are fairly static and not highly graphical, such as spreadsheets or word processing, then a 486 will do the job for the next several years, she says. There are still a lot of 386-based systems being shipped to meet those kinds of needs as well, she observes. However, it obviously depends on which applications are in use. If file or network servers are being implemented, then a more powerful, next-generation processor is probably needed, Ms Tanana adds. Also holding back, Mr Scott Uhrich, senior analyst, at Municipal Bond Investors Assurance (MBIAC) in Armonk, New York, says he sees nothing on the way that would cause him to replace his 486 in the near future. He will wait for prices to fall. Availability of new microprocessors from system manufacturers is also a big issue for users. 'The new microprocessors will not have a significant impact this year,' declares Mr Mel Thomsen of Pathfinder Research, a market research company in San Jose, California. Nor, he says, will they compete much with 486s now in the marketplace on cost and performance tradeoffs, since 486-based PCs are so cheap. Pentium-based machines will probably begin to appear this autumn as servers or other high-end systems aimed at power users, according to Mr Tony Tong, product manager with Elitegroup Computer Systems (ECS), a PC board systems manufacturer in Fremont, California. But it will probably not be until 1994 that systems will appear in any volume, he says. Part of this is due to the time it will take Intel to bring up advanced new fabrication processes to produce Pentiums in volume, he says. When it is time to upgrade his PC, a user has several choices: buy a whole new PC; swap a new Pentium-based motherboard (printed circuit board on which the chips are mounted) for an existing 486 PC; plug in an add-in board containing a new higher performance processor; or replace a 486 chip with a higher performance microprocessor - assuming that the existing socket on the motherboard will accept the new microchip. Each approach has pros and cons. For Mr Chuck Davis, information resources director at Eagle Industries in Chicago, Illinois, swapping boards gives a level of complexity he does not need. Using boards would create problems with ordering, record keeping, installation and maintenance, he says. 'My orientation is toward the box, not the CPU or boards. We move boxes, not boards,' he says. Mr Uhrich of MBIAC would probably swap motherboards or use add-in cards containing new microprocessors to upgrade but that would depend on the cost implications. However, using add-in cards would not overcome the limitations of the other parts of existing PCs. To provide a system-level upgrade, Dell Computer in Austin, Texas, recently announced 18 new 486-based PCs with sockets that will accept a Pentium-class microprocessor from Intel, according to Mr Charles Sauer, vice-president for software and technology strategy. Dell is evaluating a Pentium add-in card for the new systems that would provide users with an upgrade path, he says. Chip vendors cloning Intel microprocessors also provide upgrade options. For example, Cyrix in Richardson, Texas, enables users to upgrade their 386DX sockets by plugging in a 486-compatible microchip that doubles the clock speed, according to Mr Glenn Burchers, microprocessor marketing manager. Cyrix also is developing Spike, a processor, due out in the second half of 1993, that is Intel-compatible for which he claims better-than-Pentium performance. But software can also limit PC performance, Mr Thomsen of Pathfinder points out. Software is the real wild card in the whole mix, he says. To exercise fully the performance of Pentium and Alpha class microprocessors, for example, Microsoft is developing Windows NT (New Technology) which is expected to be unveiled in May. Windows NT is designed to let a desktop run applications software developed specifically for the new microprocessors as well as existing applications software written for current Intel-based PCs, such as 486DX desktops that have MS-DOS operating systems. Presumably, x86 applications software could run on, say, an Alpha-based machine, as well as a Pentium one. This 'backwards-compatibility,' a stated goal of Microsoft and chip vendors, is designed to preserve the great investment and installed base of MS-DOS and Windows-based applications ' and might give users more flexibility in choosing new hardware. 'The beauty of the DOS-based PC is the Dollars 100bn software base,' declares Mr Dick Eckhardt, engineering vice president of Cyber Research in Branford, Connecticut. 'No one will buy a system that's not compatible with that software,' he says. However, Windows NT will only emulate software written for 486 and older PCs, so performance - though quicker than a 486 machine - won't be as fast as software written specifically for Windows NT, according to Mr Scott Thomas, of Toshiba's Semiconductor Group in Irvine, California. To run faster, the software would have to be cleaned up but this should not be too difficult, he adds. 'There's no merit in buying a 586 (Pentium-class) machine and running the software I've got,' Mr Thomsen points out (He uses a 33-MHz 386-based desktop, which works just fine, he says.) 'To optimise the performance of a 586, you need to recompile all the software to take advantage of all of the microprocessor's features.' What about PC pricing? Mr Peter Zandan, a market analyst at IntelliQuest in Austin, Texas, believes that Intel will pursue an aggressive pricing strategy for Pentium, echoing the 386 to 486 transition. This should be reflected fairly early on in PC pricing, he says. Users not only will expect it but will demand it, he adds.</p>

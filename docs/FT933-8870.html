			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Interest rates on rise in Canada THE Bank of Canada has abruptly reversed a steep decline in domestic interest rates to ease downward pressure on the Canadian dollar. The yield on three-month Treasury bills jumped to 4.65 per cent yesterday from 3.95 per cent earlier this week. The gap between Canadian and US short-term rates, which has steadily narrowed over the past three years, has nearly doubled this week to almost 1.4 percentage points. The Canadian dollar yesterday sank to 76.15 US cents, its lowest since 1987. It has lost more than a cent in two days. Pressure has increased as evidence of an unexpectedly slow economic recovery has led the central bank to encourage a faster decline in interest rates. It pegged its key bank rate at 3.2 per cent at the weekly setting last Tuesday, the lowest level in 29 years.</p>

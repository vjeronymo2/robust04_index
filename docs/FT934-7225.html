			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stockholm follows US chop for Ericsson TRANSATLANTIC relationships, and the attraction of them came in for a hammering in Sweden yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM dropped 2.6 per cent in heavy trading as US disappointment with Ericsson on Thursday night brought the B shares down SKr55, or 13.3 per cent to SKr358. Turnover was SKr3.29bn, up from SKr1.76bn, and SKr1.75bn of yesterday's business was done in Ericcson B alone. The telecommunications group forecast that profits would 'somewhat more than double' this year. Ericsson brought most shares down along with it but Investor, the Wallenberg holding company which takes in the Saab-Scania industrial interests, fell SKr6 to SKr147 on a slump in nine-month profits, while good Thursday progress reports from Skandia, and Volvo, saw the insurer, and the carmaker up SKr2 at SKr184, and SKr1 at SKr423. FRANKFURT extended Thursday afternoon's downtrend, the DAX index closing 5.23 lower at 2,077.37 on the session, still 3.1 per cent higher on the week, and trailing off in the post-bourse where it finished at an Ibis-indicated 2,072.13. Turnover rose from DM9bn to DM9.1bn. Mr Nigel Longley, an institutional adviser at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said that a number of 'end investors' - institutions, rather than traders - were scared away by yesterday's options expiry, which can make prices volatile. There was some profit-taking: Porsche, higher on the dollar earlier this week, lost DM20 to DM765 and Kaufhof, which had seen switching out of Karstadt, fell DM15 to DM543.50. In blue chips, BASF and Bayer looked ahead somewhat dolefully to next week's autumn press conferences, showing falls of DM5.70 to DM268.50, and DM5 to DM326.70 respectively in the London afternoon. There was more late action in the pharmaceutical group, Schering, which slid DM14.00 to DM1,051 on the session and continued downward until it hit DM1,038 at the end of after-market trading. Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research said yesterday that revenue estimates for the company's Betaseron multiple sclerosis treatment may not live up to expectations. AMSTERDAM kept a watchful eye on KLM after it was reported that the airline was to meet with the government last night. There were suggestions in the market that this might signal a break through in the Alcazar talks and the airline's shares hit a day's high of Fl 41.50 before falling back a little to close up 80 cents at FL 40.50. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.3 to 137.2, a week's gain of 1.3 per cent, as options related volatility affected trading in the afternoon. PARIS found little incentive and the CAC-40 index closed down 4.44 at 2,145.23, up 2.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was some FFr3.3bn. LVMH remained in the news, the shares up FFr30 at FFr3,800, as the group announced a re-organisation of its champagne division. News of a sharp decline in Ericsson was claimed to have depressed sentiment in Alcatel Alsthom, a competitor in the telecommunications sector, with the shares seeing a low of FFr746 before closing off FFr5 at FFr752. MILAN was subdued ahead of this weekend's local elections although activity was seen, particularly in the finance and banking sector. The Comit index lost 3.75 to 544.31, little changed on the week. Among the banks, news that Cassa di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza (Cariparma) was holding discussions on the possible purchase of Credito Commerciale from Monte dei Paschi di Siena excited interest. Credito Commerciale, which was suspended on Thursday ahead of the announcement, closed at L6,300, up L3,160. Cariparma said that it would offer L6,400 per share under the terms of the deal. MADRID closed lower, but turnover was a bigger feature than share prices on the day as it soared from Pta43.2bn to Pta58bn on the expiry of futures contracts. The general index fell 1.63 to 304.53, 1.5 per cent higher on the week. One share that mattered, Nissan Iberica, remained suspended as the carmaker's Japanese parent said that it was proposing to buy out the near-30 per cent minority in its lossmaking Spanish unit. The most active stock of the day was Iberdrola, at Pta885, up Pta13 after strength in the utilities sector earlier in the week. BRUSSELS fell back after recent record gains as some investors decided it was an opportunity to take profits ahead of the weekend. The BEl-20 index shed 3.03 to 1,405.8 in turnover of BFr2.8bn. Solvay lost BFr225 to BFr14,175. HELSINKI noted a sharp fall in Nokia as the effects of Ericsson's results spilled over into the market. The Hex index fell 17.0 to 1,555.9, down 1.6 per cent on the week, with Nokia down FM22 at FM299.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- November 19                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open      10.30**     11.00**    12.00**  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1362.34    1362.10     1361.64    1364.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1421.91    1422.26     1422.10    1424.92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00**    14.00**      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1364.65    1361.22     1360.18    1360.53 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1424.45    1422.63     1418.55    1420.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Nov 18    Nov 17    Nov 16    Nov 15    Nov 12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1367.52   1363.56   1353.29   1347.91   1339.42 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1427.61   1423.11   1416.29   1413.86   1402.18  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1362.34; 200 - 1421.91 Low/day: 100 - 1358.70 200 - 1417.97  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- **Indicative  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane and John Pitt.</p>

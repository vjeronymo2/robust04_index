			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa sees DM400m loss LUFTHANSA, the German national airline, expects a loss of around DM400m (Dollars 250m) for 1991. Two months ago, when reporting a pre-tax loss of DM159m for the first nine months, the company said it would offset its operating loss through aircraft sales and transfers from reserves. Yesterday, however, it said the market for second-hand airliners was so weak that it had 14 unsold aircraft. Lufthansa had also experienced a final quarter worse than hoped because of the continued weak state of the world economy. Full results will be announced in May. The airline, just over half of whose equity is state-owned, began the year poorly with a loss of DM475m in the first quarter, a period which suffered from the impact on business of the Gulf war. But it made a profit of DM145m in the second quarter and DM172m in the third. Lufthansa's 1991 loss comes despite higher traffic volumes and turnover.</p>

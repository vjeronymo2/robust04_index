			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / NHS deputy chief to take top post Continuity in the senior management of the National Health Service was signalled yesterday by the government's appointment of Mr Alan Langlands, deputy chief executive, to succeed Sir Duncan Nichol as chief executive. Mr Langlands, 41, a career NHS manager who joined as a graduate trainee, has a similar background to Sir Duncan. His previous posts include managing the Middlesex and University College hospitals in London. He was general manager of North West Thames regional health authority before becoming Sir Duncan's deputy in 1992. The appointment of Mr Langlands to the Pounds 88,190-a-year post will please senior NHS managers, who believed someone with a strong background in the service was needed. They had feared that the government might make an outside appointment. The chief executive and the Leeds-based staff of the management executive are responsible to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, for daily management of the service. Mrs Bottomley said the challenges facing Mr Langlands would include: improving performance and maintaining proper stewardship of resources; handling strategic change in London and other cities where hospital closures were proposed; and streamlining top NHS management. Mr Langlands will have to pick up some controversial issues when he takes over in April. A substantial hospital-closure programme is in prospect in London and other cities, and the planning of this has to be made compatible with the freedoms of purchasing authorities in the NHS internal market. Mr Langlands will also have to oversee the introduction of new codes on corporate governance following financial scandals in the West Midlands and Wessex regions. Legislation to abolish regional health authorities from 1996 is to be introduced next year. The regional line of command will then be through offices of Mr Langlands' management executive. Sir Duncan - the first career NHS manager to be chief executive - is leaving to head a new centre for international healthcare management at Manchester University.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Judges thrust into battle to defend Maastricht line: How the EEA treaty may test the Luxembourg court IT was a case of 'once bitten, twice shy', when Brussels yesterday decided to ask the EC's supreme court's opinion before daring to sign the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty which it re-negotiated last week with the European Free Trade Association (Efta). This may further delay the far-reaching EEA treaty, creating a 19-nation common economic zone. But the European Commission was clear that it did not want to risk a repeat of last December, when the European Court of Justice suddenly stymied 18 months of negotiation by objecting to the EEA treaty's judicial provisions, in particular a court with EC and Efta judges. The latest treaty version replaces the mixed court with a less ambitious arrangement. Referral of the draft treaty to the Court is a mark of its growing importance. This is further enhanced by the Maastricht treaty which not only allows it to fine recalcitrant governments for not complying with EC directives and its own edicts, but also seems certain to draw it into the highly political business of ruling on disputes over the treaty clause on 'subsidiarity' - the division of powers between EC institutions and the Twelve. But the 13 judges who make up the Court seem uncomfortable at being thrust increasingly into the political limelight. In a rare interview, Sir Gordon Slynn, who retires from the Court next month to join the House of Lords law lords, recently insisted on the Court's 'judicial, rather than political role' in ensuring the EC treaties are enforced properly. The Court, Sir Gordon believes, will not, or should not, get involved in essentially political disputes between member states and Brussels, in the way that the US Supreme Court settles states' rights issues. He finesses the problems of disputes over the subsidiarity clause by saying 'we probably would not decide on whether something is better done by member states (as opposed to the EC), but whether there was material to show that something was capable of being better done'. In other words, the Luxembourg benchers will, or should, avoid making the highly political value judgements which are for governments to decide. But the court proved itself bold last November, when in its ruling on the Francovich case it said that EC citizens could sue their governments for damages arising out of a government's failure to implement an EC directive. This ruling, which could give enormous backing to Brussels' efforts to chase up laggard governments, 'flows logically from earlier principles laid down by the Court', says Sir Gordon. 'But the Francovich case will have to be worked out in great detail over the years,' he cautions. He noted that this potentially revolutionary ruling said little or nothing about the amounts of damages, the link between an unimplemented EC directive and actual damage suffered by an individual, or whether a member state might argue justification in not putting an EC law into effect. Part of the Court's function is to give timely guidance to national supreme courts, like the Cour de Cassation in France or the UK's House of Lords, on points of EC law. It is a job on which it has often fallen down. A decade ago, the Court took six months to issue such 'preliminary rulings'; now it often takes 18 months. Sir Gordon welcomes the fact that the Maastricht treaty allows more run-of-the-mill cases, such as state aid and dumping disputes, to go to the lower Court of First Instance. He is also thankful to be leaving Luxembourg before having to deal with the legal tangles certain to be thrown up by the Maastricht protocol isolating the UK on social policy. But it now seems he may not have so lucky an escape on the EEA issue.</p>

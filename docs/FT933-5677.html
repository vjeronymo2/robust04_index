			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Poultry company in receivership MIDLAND Poultry Products, based in West Bromwich, West Midlands, yesterday laid off 100 staff and called in receivers after it failed to reach agreement over Pounds 290,000 in grant aid from the Black Country Development Corporation. The corporation said it was unable to approve the grant, aimed at helping the company offset costs of setting up a new plant, because the company could not provide guarantees of continued viability. Accountants Ernst &amp; Young, appointed receivers, said although the company had ceased operations they were confident of finding a buyer.</p>

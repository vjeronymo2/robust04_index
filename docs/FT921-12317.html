			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Reports of water pollution double REPORTS OF water pollution in England and Wales more than doubled in the 1980s, according to the National Rivers Authority, David Lascelles writes. The NRA's first compilation of annual statistics yesterday showed that there were 28,143 reports in 1990, up from 12,600 in 1981. The biggest increase came in the Northumbria region, where reports rose 57 per cent between 1988 and 1990. The largest category of reports concerned oil and sewage spills, with each accounting for just over 20 per cent of the total. Farm incidents accounted for 11 per cent and industrial incidents 10 per cent. The NRA pointed out that only a very small proportion of the reported incidents - 658 in 1990 - could be classed as 'major', involving extensive fish deaths or the temporary closure of a public water intake. Dr Jan Pentreath, the NRA chief scientist, said: 'It is important to note from the figures that the majority of reported incidents are of a minor nature and that many are not confirmed when investigating officers visit the scene. On such occasions no legal action can be taken.' During 1990 the NRA took 282 incidents to court and secured convictions in 272 of them. Dr Pentreath said prosecution was a 'cat-and-mouse game' because samples had to be collected at the time of the incident, before the pollution disappeared - and with it the evidence.</p>

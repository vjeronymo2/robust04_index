			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ROLLS PROFIT SOARS ON PLANE ENGINES  </P> <P> Rolls-Royce said today that its pretax profits rose 8% to $289 million in 1988  as booming orders for its aircraft engines offset other drains on earnings.  </P> <P> The British aero-engine firm had pretax profits of $268 million in 1987. Last  year's figures were at the higher range of analysts' expectations.  Rolls-Royce's earnings increased last year as orders for civil aircraft engines  rose to $3.8 billion from $2.6 billion in 1987, it said.  </P> <P> The strong orders offset other problems such as a weak dollar, which pressured  profit margins and took away some gains from greater efficiency and volume.  Also, the company posted an "exceptional item" of $49 million due to severance  payments after it cut 1,900 jobs.  </P></p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / University financing is criticised as outdated UNIVERSITIES came under attack yesterday from a former member of Mrs Thatcher's policy unit. Professor Sir Douglas Hague, chairman of the Economic and Social Science Research Council, criticised the financing of universities and their structure and culture as outdated in a study published by the Institute of Economic Affairs. He says in the report: 'Universities will have to be like businesses and learn to pay twice as much to half as many people.' Attacking excessive specialisation among academics, Sir Douglas says: 'Buttressed in their academic bunker . . . they presume greater mastery of limited fields, perhaps never recalling the old saw about knowing everything about nothing.' He recommends changes in the system including abolishing national university pay scales, a shift from grants to fees, and an increase in the number of institutions able to award degrees.

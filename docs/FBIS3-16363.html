President </F> Defends Citizens' Labor Rights"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin signed an edict 10 March which, in  the opinion of many observers, could fundamentally change the  situation regarding now-familiar wage payment delays.    The edict "On Responsibility for Violations of Citizens'  Labor Rights" instructs the Russian Federation Prosecutor's  Office to "carry out careful checks into every instance of the  violation of workers' legitimate rights" and to institute  proceedings against those responsible for holding up payments.    The courts have been instructed to pay particular attention,  when hearing cases of the violation of labor legislation, to the  need to eradicate such violations, including in respect of  delayed pay.    The government has been instructed to submit proposals to  the  State Duma within one month on amendments and additions to  existing criminal and administrative legislation, "envisaging  the strengthening and clarification of responsibility for the  violation of labor legislation and collective contracts and  agreements."    I do not think there is any need to explain what prompted  the  appearance of the president's edict, and the effect on society's  social and political health of the nonpayment of two-three  months' wages is also probably clear to everyone.    Of course, delays in paying wages are a natural  manifestation  of an even more dangerous disease. Nonpayments, like rust,  affect the entire economic mechanism. The failure to pay bills  has become not only not dangerous but even economically  advantageous. Inflation eats away at the creditor's funds,  reducing the borrower's debt. The banks rapidly recycle funds  received from enterprises, earning fabulous rates of interest.    But maybe enterprises really do not have the money to pay  each other? Unfortunately, this is by no means always the case.  According to Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko,  enterprises hold 22 trillion rubles [R] in accounts at  commercial banks. They also hold foreign exchange equivalent to  R26 trillion. Add to this around $18-22 billion held abroad,  and the sum is gigantic. And yet the government is getting just  one demand from all over -- give us money.    To a certain extent this ardor may be dampened by Viktor  Chernomyrdin's statement to the extended Council of Ministers.  He stressed that it is time for creditors themselves to learn  how to recover their debts through the courts without hoping for  another round of mutual debt offsetting. "Those who do not have  the money to pay their debts should go into bankruptcy and be  responsible with their own property for the damage they have  done," the premier said.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Old north-south division threatens Yemen's three-year unity The threat of civil war lingers in Yemen, despite apparently successful efforts this week to negotiate a settlement to the country's political crisis, now entering its sixth month. Military units of the former north and south Yemen maintained a watchful stance yesterday along the border which, before unification three years ago, had divided them. President Ali Abdullah Saleh and Vice President Ali Salem al-Biedh have agreed to meet to sign an agreement which is aimed at ending a crisis that began in late August. It was then that Mr Biedh, frustrated by the lack of co-operation from the president, left the capital Sanaa and returned to Aden, his political base in the former South Yemen. Mr Biedh had long complained about the lack of security in the country, the continued presence of military forces in cities, and the alleged mismanagement of the economy. In September, Mr Biedh, who heads the Yemen Socialist party, issued an 18-point programme for national reform and called for its implementation as a condition of his return to Samaa. Although General Saleh has since accepted the YSP programme, he has so far failed to implement it and Mr Biedh has remained in Aden. Faced with the impasse, leading politicians in late November formed a committee to resolve the dispute and this week finalised a document which, they believe, could end the problem. Incorporating all 18 points of the Socialist programme, the document has raised hopes of a solution to the crisis. Western diplomatic sources said yesterday that General Saleh was 'confident' that the agreement would bring a quick end to the impasse. And optimism appeared to be underscored yesterday as the Yemeni riyal strengthened by nearly 20 per cent in unofficial trading. But, according to Mr Biedh, implementation of the document is the crucial point in ending the crisis and he has little hope of that. 'We will arrive at results which are theoretical, but our real problem will be implementation,' he said, but added: 'We have no faith that there will be implementation.' Mr Biedh explained earlier this week that he and General Saleh had reached many agreements before but 'unfortunately, none have been implemented'. Gen Saleh has meanwhile admitted that reports of a southern aircraft bombing northern troops on Monday were false. He claimed instead that a jet had flown at low altitude over the Al-Malika encampment of northern soldiers in the town of Laudar, about 170 kilometres north east of Aden, and that the resulting sonic boom had been misinterpreted as an explosion. Journalists visiting the site on Wednesday confirmed that no bombing had occurred, but that last Friday some 300 northern troops had left their base in Laudar and had commandeered a strategically placed private house to control access to and from the town.</p>

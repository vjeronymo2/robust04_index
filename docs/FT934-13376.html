			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Russian banks at risk of closure DOZENS of Russian commercial banks could soon be closed or restructured as a result of a sweeping review by the central bank, Russia's new banking supervision chief said yesterday. Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, said 22 Moscow commercial banks, whose operations with the central bank were suspended two weeks ago, were just a small part of a nationwide problem. The central bank stopped refinancing them after they exceeded its five-day overdraft limit. 'That number of 22 may increase enormously after the analysis we are going to conduct,' Mr Tulin said, speaking a week after assuming the supervision job in addition to his responsibility for foreign exchange operations and domestic securities. Mr Tulin plans to focus on banks whose overdrafts with the central bank are due to 'serious financial problems', as opposed to fraud by their clients or Russia's inefficient payments system. Such banks would either be bailed out, offered to bigger institutions, or, for the first time in Russia's post-Communist history, closed down. 'The withdrawal of licences and liquidation are very new to us, so we'll have to cross a minefield of hidden problems on this road.' Mr Tulin plans to examine the first bank failure today. He describes the case as typical, with the bank's founders having borrowed Rbs4bn from the central bank, converted it into Dollars 4m, sent it to 'an exotic offshore location' and then disappeared. There are almost 2,000 banks in the sector, but 100 of them account for two-thirds of all banking business. Restructuring has so far been delayed as a result of lax monetary policy, which has been tighter since the suppression of the parliamentary rebellion, and by the difficulties of supervising a sector open to fraud and crime. A first step towards restructuring was taken from July 1, when a minimum capital requirement of Rbs100m came into force. But even after banks had been given six months' notice to comply, more than 40 per cent of all banks, still did not meet the minimum requirement.</p>

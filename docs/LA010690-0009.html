			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPARING FOREIGN AND U.S. AUTOS  </P> <P> I have been the sole owner of a 1985 Pontiac Grand Am.  </P> <P> In its service to me of over 53,000 miles I had but one problem, with the fuel  pump. Even the tires, battery and brakes lasted nearly 50,000 miles; still  going on the original hoses and belts. The paint job is phenomenal, still shiny  and new looking. In my 63 years I have had at least 6 U.S. cars, bought new,  some driven well over 100,000 miles with very few problems. If I didn't love my  present car so much I'd buy a new domestic car.  </P> <P> EARLE B. EMERY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Observer: Slow adders Much consternation among the 'Big 6' UK accounting firms yesterday over delays in the production of the annual fee income figures from one of their number, Ernst &amp; Young. Bitter rumours between all the firms abound each year over the undiluted quantity of creative accounting that goes into their preparation. This year they had agreed to release them simultaneously to the press and each other at 11am. All churned off the fax as planned except for Ernst &amp; Young's, which did not appear till nearly 1pm. The firm vigorously denied that it waited to see its nearest competitor before preparing a figure, even though its results were just a sliver ahead of Andersen. All necessary manipulation was done blind several weeks ago, it seems, just like its competitors.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: IBCA lowers ratings on Banco Central Hispano Banco Central Hispano, one of Spain's leading banks, yesterday saw the IBCA ratings for both its short term and long term debt downgraded. The London-based agency said it was adjusting its rating for the bank's short-term commercial paper from A1+ to A1 and for its long-term debt from AA- to A+. Bank officials said BCH was being 'excessively penalised' by the impact of the crisis at Banco Espanol de Credito, for which the Bank of Spain is mounting a rescue plan. However, they argued that the ratings change had already been discounted by the market following last week's announcement by Moody's that it was reviewing the bank for possible downgrade. The move could affect plans by BCH to issue Dollars 200m of subordinated debt.</p>

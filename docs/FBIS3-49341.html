			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The general assembly of the elected  representatives of the Hungarian minority of Southern Slovakia  began at 1300 hours today in Komarno. Szilvia Enkakarov reports  from the scene.    [Enkakarov] The organizers somewhat miscalculated the number  of participants of the general assembly when they predicted  1,400-1,500 people. A few minutes before 1300 hours, there were  massive queues in front of the sports hall's entrance, despite  the fact that the hall was already hopelessly full. Before the  beginning of the general assembly, some 3,000 people entered the  sports hall.    Among the guests are representatives of the government  office  headed by Ludovit Fliegel. Teodor Kriska and Roman Filister from  the presidential office are also attending. [passage omitted]    In his opening speech, Istvan Pasztor, mayor of Komarno and  chairman of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny  Ostrov, greeted those present and read out the letter of Ms.  Catherine Lalumiere addressed to the Komarno general assembly.  It emerged from the letter that observers of the Council of  Europe could not take part in the event because, in a few days'  time, on 17-18 January, a four-member expert committee will  visit Slovakia to learn about the Slovak Republic's plans for  administrative and regional division.    The agenda read out by Istvan Pasztor was adopted by the  participants. According to the agenda, the general assembly's  four main topics are the legal situation of local governments,  Slovakia's administrative and regional reorganization, the  constitutional status of the Hungarians of Slovakia, and the  report on the initiative for the association of the elected  representatives of Southern Slovakia. The mayors and  representatives present will be given the opportunity to express  their views in the debate. They can analyze the topics they are  most interested in, in three-minute-long speeches, said the  mayor of Komarno. The mayor concluded his speech with the  following thought, which received great applause: "Our aim is  not to pull the country apart but together to try to solve our  country's problems within the country's borders."    Speeches are being delivered at the moment. At the end of  the general assembly, a news conference will be held in the  Komarno town community center at 1700. My next report from the  scene will be at 1730.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / People: Sir Christopher adds to his collection Sir Christopher Harding, the former chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, will be able to indulge his passion for collecting egg cups in his new job as chairman of the Prince's Youth Business Trust. The Prince of Wales has asked Sir Christopher to take on the chairmanship of the PYBT which helps young unemployed people start their own businesses. To mark the appointment the PYBT has invited its young entrepreneurs to make an egg cup for the new chairman. So far over 30 have accepted the challenge. Sir Christopher, 54, takes over in June from Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, who has done the job for four years. Although the PYBT is one of at least ten philanthropic ventures sponsored by the Prince of Wales, it is felt to be the one closest to his heart. He has described it as the 'largest seed corn agency in the world'. It spends about Pounds 9m a year helping 3,000 young people with direct financial support. It also assists a further 25,000 by counselling and 7,000 in continuing care. It has a staff of 220 and 5,000 part-time volunteers. Sir Christopher hopes to double the number of young people the PYBT helps start up in business. Sir Christopher has been on the PYBT's advisory council since 1988. However, his decision to add yet another chairmanship to his increasingly busy schedule is slightly surprising given that only last week he said he would be reducing some of his other commitments following his appointment as chairman of Legal &amp; General. He is already non-executive chairman of BET and Newarthill and sits on the boards of Hanson, English China Clays, Slough Estates, GEC and joined the board of the Post Office last month.</p>

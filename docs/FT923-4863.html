			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Concern grows over Kabul ceasefire A PRECARIOUS peace was holding in Afghanistan yesterday amid concern that fresh fighting between mujahideen factions might break out if Uzbek militia forces in Kabul are not pulled out by tomorrow's deadline, agreed under a ceasefire last week. The militia have been at the centre of a dispute between the government of Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani and hardline guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Mr Hekmatyar has been demanding the removal of the militia from the capital, as a condition for peace. At least 2,000 people were killed last month when Hekmatyar troops pounded Kabul with rockets and gunfire. Another 100,000 fled the city in search of shelter and food. A ceasefire began at the weekend when the Afghan government agreed to the withdrawal of the militia. A new buffer force was to be placed between Mr Hekmatyar's forces and government troops to prevent fighting. However, there were no signs that the militia was preparing to leave or that the buffer force would be in position by tomorrow. Although there has been no serious fighting this week, there have been allegations from both sides of ceasefire violations. Iranian President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani begins a four-day visit to Pakistan on Sunday. Islamabad sees this as a chance to explore closer economic co-operation and discuss issues such as Afghanistan.</p>

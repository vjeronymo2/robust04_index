			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / DTI faces Expo 92 criticism THE Trade and Industry Department has come under heavy criticism from British companies who have run up debts because of what they allege is mismanagement of the British pavilion at Expo 92 last year in Seville, Spain. More than 50 companies supplied an assortment of products to Joanna Bickerton Associates, which has gone into liquidation owing nearly Pounds 500,000 after being contracted by the DTI to run the pavilion shop. The Expo was billed by the DTI as the world's largest fair and an opportunity to display the best of Britain's commercial and cultural achievements. But four months after the end of Expo, the DTI is embroiled in a controversy involving at least three possible lawsuits, while the future of the pavilion is in doubt. The total cost of construction and appearing at Expo was Pounds 25m, about Pounds 5m from commercial sponsorship, the rest from the government, mainly the DTI. Expo attack, Page 5</p>

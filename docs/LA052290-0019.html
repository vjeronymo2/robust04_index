			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TWA ENDING SERVICE AT BURBANK AIRPORT  </P> <P> Trans World Airlines announced Monday that it will halt service at Burbank  Airport on June 30, canceling its two daily flights to St. Louis and its  unusual flights between Burbank and Long Beach.  </P> <P> In its announcement, the airline gave no reason for the cancellation, but a  spokesman for the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority said that traffic  on the flights had dropped to 85,000 passengers last year from 114,000 in 1988.  Service began in November, 1985, and, through a quirk in scheduling, also  provided round-trip daily air service between Burbank and Long Beach.  </P></p>

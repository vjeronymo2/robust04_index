			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD'S ISOLATION OF CAMBODIA ONLY INVITES POL POT'S RETURN  </P> <P> Will the world see a second Khmer Rouge holocaust in Cambodia in the 1990s? The  Vietnamese have just stepped up their timetable to withdraw the forces that  saved Cambodia from Pol Pot. Wednesday, they announced that they would withdraw  their forces by this September whether or not there is sufficient agreement  among the contending forces to protect against the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> This action was foreshadowed in Hanoi in February when Nguyen Thi Binh, the  vice chairman of Vietnam's Committee on Foreign Affairs, said that Vietnam did  not "have the power to force all parties to an agreement" but planned to  withdraw anyway. Nguyen thought that the Vietnamese-backed government, the  People's Republic of Kampuchea, would by then be able to "stand firm." She  recognized, however, that if there was "no settlement and no ending of aid to  the Khmer Rouge and others, then the danger (of a return of the Khmer Rouge)  will really be there."  </P> <P> She concluded: "For our part, we have done all in our capacity to help the  Cambodians recover from the genocide. The international community has a  responsibility now. Only Vietnam has helped Cambodia so far. Other countries,  including the U.S., now have to help. We have done what we can. We have to help  ourselves now."  </P> <P> But what is the United States planning to do to help? If things are left to the  only congressional subcommittee -- Asian and Pacific affairs -- that holds  hearings on this subject, we would probably pump more weapons into the area.  </P> <P> Stephen Solarz, chairman of the subcommittee, said last month that he was  seriously considering pressing for lethal aid to Prince Sihanouk because ". . .  at the end of the day the non-communist resistance may be the last best hope  the Cambodians have of preventing a fate which could be worse than death."  </P> <P> But all military estimates show that the main bulwark to the return of the  Khmer Rouge is the Cambodian government itself and its militia. Moreover, David  Hawk of the Cambodia Documentation Center warned the congressman at the March 1  hearing, "just last week, Sihanouk was wanting arms to fight (the government of  Cambodia Premier) Hun Sen."  </P> <P> On March 15 Sihanouk showed up in a Beijing press conference with Khmer Rouge  leader Khieu Samphan, calling, jointly, for just such lethal aid and for a new  High Council for National Defense with the Khmer Rouge. So there is not, to put  it mildly, much certainty that this new lethal aid would be used against the  Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> George Santayana once defined a fanatic as one who redoubled his efforts as he  lost sight of his goals. U.S. policy now risks such a characterization.  </P> <P> The main emphasis of U.S. policy should be preventing the return of the Khmer  Rouge. But in the past, and still today, our real policy has been to join with  China and the member countries of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations in  forcing the Vietnamese forces out of Cambodia. Meanwhile our high-flown  declaratory policy was to engineer a four-way provisional government (including  the Khmer Rouge as one of the participants) that would bring democracy to  Cambodia. The first goal is being achieved at considerable risk of a second  holocaust. The second goal is a dangerous mirage.  </P> <P> After all, the Khmer Rouge is trying to obstruct or subvert any agreement.  Prince Sihanouk is congenitally incapable of compromise so long as there is any  alternative. And the People's Republic of Kampuchea has invested 10 years in  building up a government that controls the entire territory and knows full well  that the population cannot abide injecting the Khmer Rouge, as a group, into  even a provisional government.  </P> <P> Instead, Prince Sihanouk ought now to be encouraged to drop out of the Khmer  Rouge coalition. His embrace of the Khmer Rouge is destroying his credibility  in Cambodia and abroad anyway.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the international community should press the Chinese and the Thais  to stop helping the Khmer Rouge with their arms and sanctuaries; the Khmer  Rouge was, after all, resurrected simply and solely for the purpose of helping  drive the Vietnamese out of Cambodia.  </P> <P> The world can have high assurance against the return of the Khmer Rouge. But to  do so, all concerned would have to work with what already exists, the Hun Sen  government, by easing pressure on it.  </P> <P> Probably, the world can also have the incorporation of Prince Sihanouk into  such a government. In Phnom Penh in February, Hun Sen said he had twice offered  Prince Sihanouk the position of chief of state and was prepared, if Sihanouk  left the Pol Pot coalition, to try again. But the Khmer Rouge-Sihanouk  coalition would have to be broken up by giving the imperious and mercurial  Sihanouk no other choice than to deal with Hun Sen. He has to be told that with  or without him, the United States and others will simply recognize the People's  Republic of Kampuchea.  </P> <P> What we don't need are more arms. And what won't help is a policy of isolating  Cambodia -- as if the present government, rather than the Khmer Rouge, were the  real problem.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Meanwhile, sources in the  Chinese capital have confirmed that the leadership had earlier  this year given permission to ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang to  relocate to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan. But since Mr  Zhao's wife is suffering from a heart ailment, the couple is  expected to return to the capital on a regular basis.    The sources said this new dispensation did not necessarily  mean Mr Zhao's political opponents, including President Jiang  Zemin and Premier Li Peng, had relaxed control over the leader  of the party's liberal faction.</p>

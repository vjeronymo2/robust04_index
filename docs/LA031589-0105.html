			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> SEC Approves Stock Baskets: As expected, the Securities and Exchange Commission  approved new financial instruments called "stock baskets," which would mirror  price movements of large groups of stocks such as those in the Standard &amp;  Poor's 500 index. The basket proposals were made by the American and  Philadelphia stock exchanges and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. However,  disputes about whether the instruments should be treated as stocks, futures or  other investments are likely to delay their introduction for months.  </P></p>

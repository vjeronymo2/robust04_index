			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arturas Racas: "The Parliament Finally </F> Remembered the Press"]    [Text] The members of parliament yesterday granted  themselves the right "to use not more frequently than once a  month the state radio and television free of charge to air their  issues." This principle was imposed almost unanimously during  the debate on the final draft of the Parliament's statutes.    The opinions of the members of parliament differed somewhat  when they tried to resolve the questions of remunerations. There  was a lengthy debate on whether the members of parliament --  officials and ministers -- should get additional pay, but no  decision was adopted.    The members of parliament also resolved that only the  author's honorarium for works of art and their performance, also  for publications and books will qualify for payment for creative  activity (hourly remuneration for pedagogical,  scholarly-scientific work or consultation having been crossed  out from the list). Following the vote, deputy chairman of  parliament J. Bernatonis congratulated the members of parliament  for "having supported the ideals of socialism."    In the opinion of many members of parliament, there will be  one more vote concerning this article, because it does not  satisfy those who teach or work in the universities or similar  institutions.    Yesterday the parliament also took care of the publishing  houses and their editorial personnel that specialize in  periodicals. The parliament decided to allow them to privatize  the premises they are renting that belong to the sphere of state  regulation. When such premises are not being privatized,  municipal or district boards are obligated to provide them with  space of equal value.    Just before the adoption of this decision, the members of  parliament decided not to permit the privatization of the  premises that are rented by the state information agency. The  most vocal opposition to this was voiced by K. Snezko, a  representative of the LDDP (Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party)  faction, who had missed 78 meetings during two sessions and had  never participated in the discussions.    Most of the representatives of the parliamentary factions of  the Right also voted against the decision or abstained  themselves, because in their opinion it would help the LDDP to  strength its influence in the newspapers.    V. Zimnickas, who presented the report, was of a different  opinion. He asserted that "if we want to preserve an independent  press, we must help it."    In the afternoon meeting, the President's adviser on state  and legal questions R. Andrikis submitted to the members of  parliament a "Law on Declaring Property and Income of the  Inhabitants of the Republic of Lithuania," which is presented by  the President. According to Mr. Andrikis, the main principles of  this law are the linking of the declaration with taxes, the  universal character of declaration, and the secrecy of the  information on the declaration.    Answering R. Ozolas, who asked how the new law essentially  differed from the one that was earlier rejected by the  president, R. Andrikis asserted that there was one difference:  "the earlier law was a law on the listing of property."    After the members of parliament had approved the submission  of the new law on the declaration of property and taxes, the  head of the Conservative faction A. Kubilius congratulated J.  Bernatonis on his victory and publicly suggested that both of  them declare their own and their family members' property and  income. J. Bernatonis did not respond to this offer; when asked  by LIETUVOS RYTAS, why he did not answer the question, he  replied: "Because the members of the parliament did not have  their health checked before the elections."    Following the vote, social democrat N. Medvedevas said that  he was going to lie down in front of the rostrum and block the  new law until the experts have presented their conclusions on  this law's potential consequences for Lithuania.</p>

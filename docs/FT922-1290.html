			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Nineteen die as Serb mortars hit Sarajevo SERB MILITIA forces showered mortar bombs on central Sarajevo yesterday, killing 19 people, including at least three children, and wounding 87. According to Sarajevo Radio, three mortar bombs exploded in front of the National Bank in the city centre, where people were queueing to collect their pay. The streets were unusually crowded with people who had come out of shelters for the first time in days during what had been a lull in the fighting. Bodies were laid out in hospital corridors and trails of blood smeared ramps leading into emergency wards at three hospitals, witnesses said. The death toll rose from eight to 19 after nightfall as critically injured victims succumbed to their wounds, said Sarajevo Radio. Serb forces launched a similar attack on a bread queue last month, killing 16 people and maiming dozens more. Serb leaders from Bosnia yesterday denied responsibility for the attack. Mr Mirsad Becirovic, an editor of Sarajevo Radio, said three children were among those killed in the sudden mortar attack. 'They were playing on the streets. We can't keep our children always locked up in underground shelters. People had left their basements to get water, newspapers or their salaries from the bank.' Ms Shannon Boyd, a spokeswoman for United Nations peacekeeping forces, said the news was discouraging. 'We're in a rather painful holding pattern.' A UN plan to reopen the city airport for humanitarian flights collapsed at the weekend. In New York, UN officials expressed concern about ceasefire violations and over the wounding of three Canadian UN observers, one seriously. There was no suggestion of further action by the Security Council. General Lewis MacKenzie, UN commander in Sarajevo, said UN forces would not restart work on the airport until a ceasefire held for at least 48 hours. 'There are still obvious breaches of the ceasefire going on fairly regularly . . . Even by Bosnian standards we don't have a ceasefire.' He said the opening of the airport was only one step needed in the relief of Sarajevo. 'What is really needed is for the roads to be de-blockaded coming into Bosnia because we have got to have large convoys of trucks. You can imagine the amount of food that would be required,' he said. Some 300,000 inhabitants face starvation and chronic shortages of water and electricity. Bosnian officials accused the UN of giving in to Serbian pressure to halt work on the airport. They say Serbian forces, which control the airport, do not want to hand it over to the UN and allow food in to the mainly Moslem inhabitants of Sarajevo. Serb irregulars, backed by remnants of the Yugoslav federal army, have besieged Sarajevo for 77 days, demanding the surrender of at least half the city to Serbian forces.</p>

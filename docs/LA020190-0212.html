			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TERRAMASTER ON COMEBACK TRAIL;  </P> <P> REVOLUTIONARY SPEEDSTER HAS BEEN PACKED AWAY FOR 25 YEARS  </P> <P> One of the most imaginative, ahead-of-its-time off-road vehicles, designed and  built by a pair of Orange County men in the early '60s when the aging Jeep was  the only American-made, four-wheel-drive vehicle available, never made it into  production.  </P> <P> Instead, that revolutionary prototype, which outperformed Mustangs, Corvettes,  souped-up Thunderbirds and other high-performance cars in tests, languished  unused in a Fullerton garage for over a quarter-century.  </P> <P> Early last month, its creators -- entrepreneur/inventor Adolf Schoepe and  racing car builder Harley Klentz -- resurrected their brainchild and began  putting it back in running condition.  </P> <P> "Even after 25 years we're still confident it can compete with any of these  four-wheel-drives they're producing today, and even outperform them in some  areas," Klentz said.  </P> <P> Schoepe first got the idea for a revolutionary new four-wheel-drive when his  son Bob, then 10, became interested in off-roaders. Schoepe's entrepreneurial  instincts envisioned such a recreational vehicle as the logical successor to  the venerable Jeep.  </P> <P> "The Jeep was a 30-year-old design by then and it did what it was supposed to  do, but it was anything but comfortable," Schoepe explained. "I thought we  could design a new four-wheel-drive that would do everything the Jeep could do  and more, and give a much easier ride."  </P> <P> Because he wanted to build some sports car characteristics as well as comfort  into the new car, Schoepe sought an expert in competition car design. The  search led to Klentz, who had been designing parts of racing cars since before  he had a driver's license, including chassis for renowned kit-car builders Bill  Devin and Don Garlits, and cars that challenged land-speed records on the  Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.  </P> <P> Together, the two men spent a year kicking around suggestions on what their new  creation should have. "We played together and I mean played," Schoepe recalled.  "Whatever we decided to use, we just went ahead and found it or designed it."  </P> <P> Among other features, the finished Terramaster, as they called their new  four-wheel-drive, had a quick-change gearbox, Jaguar four-wheel inboard disc  brakes, independent suspension, a vertical kingpin with total  interchangeability, a center pivot on the wheel for easier steering,  interchangeable front and rear axles, and shocks with springs mounted around  them, then commonly used on motorcycles and sports cars but never before on a  four-wheel-drive.  </P> <P> At the time it was completed, highway safety tests for barrier crashes, tilts  and braking capacity were being conducted at an abandoned Air Force base near  San Bernardino. Klentz took the Terramaster there and tested it against the  other high-performance sports cars.  </P> <P> Nothing could compare with the braking ability of its four-wheel inboard disc  brakes -- half the distance of a Corvette with no slippage. Instead of the  wild-and-woolly ride in a Jeep over rough terrain, the Terramaster's suspension  enabled it to glide over a series of parking blocks with hardly a jolt. And it  had the acceleration and top-speed firepower of a sports car.  </P> <P> Production possibilities on a limited basis looked promising -- at first,  anyway.  </P> <P> Schoepe and Klentz figured they could build and sell the car for $5,000 to  $6,000, while a survey reported that off-road enthusiasts and others in  agriculture, forest service and similar pursuits would pay $10,000 for such a  vehicle. "Great," they said, "now when can we get it."  </P> <P> The initial plan was to build 100 to 200 units the first year. Schoepe began  lining up American parts manufacturers while Klentz went to Europe and located  places where some components could be produced at less cost than in this  country.  </P> <P> The project appeared ready to fly until consumer advocate Ralph Nader sued  General Motors for alleged safety violations in its Corvair. Product liability  insurance rates shot through the roof and prospects for producing the  Terramaster took a sudden turn for the worse.  </P> <P> Not even Lloyds of London, which insures almost anything for a price, would  touch the car. One American firm finally agreed -- for a minimum of $100,000  per year. That did it for Schoepe, who felt he already had enough money  invested in the Terramaster and didn't want to go any deeper.  </P> <P> The only possibility left was to have one of the big car makers produce the  vehicle. The plans were sent to American Motors, which studied them for months  before deciding that the Terramaster was a little too "drastic" for its product  line.  </P> <P> Not long afterward, Chevrolet came out with the Blazer and AMC bought the Jeep.  Klentz drove the Terramaster around for awhile, then the car disappeared behind  garage doors for 25 years.  </P> <P> "It was a good idea and there definitely was a market for such a vehicle, but  the timing wasn't quite right," said Schoepe, who knows something about timing.  </P> <P> Being there with the right product at the right time has been the key to his  remarkable business success, which is a classic story of the poor immigrant  making good in the great American tradition.  </P> <P> Schoepe arrived from Germany in 1927, seasick, penniless and unable to speak a  word of English, but with a skill that America needed at that time. He was a  master craftsman in metals just when the steel-making process had been  perfected and the infant American aircraft industry was beginning to build  airplanes with metal.  </P> <P> He had no trouble finding work. He built aircraft for Curtis Robin in St.  Louis, dirigibles for Goodyear in Akron, and the forerunner of the giant Boeing  airliners in Seattle; overhauled and rebuilt aircraft at San Diego Naval Air  Station; and taught metalwork to thousands of Rosie the Riveters for their  valuable home front role during World War II.  </P> <P> As the war was ending, Schoepe and a friend settled on a product they felt  would be in widespread demand when home building was resumed. They founded  Kwikset Lock Co. in Anaheim and made lock-and-key history. Another postwar  building boom after the Korean War made Kwikset the leading lock set  manufacturer in the country.  </P> <P> When the company prospered, Schoepe discovered an idea for a revolutionary  toilet tank repair valve. He sold his Kwikset stock and founded Fluidmaster  Inc., also in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Again, timing was critical. The cost of calling in a plumber had risen and  Schoepe saw a vast market for a simple do-it-yourself toilet tank repair valve.  </P> <P> He was right again.  </P> <P> Schoepe and merchandising wizard Fred Schmuck, who was in charge of marketing,  build Fluidmaster into the leading manufacturer in its field.  </P> <P> The dynamics that drive the 86-year-old Schoepe never seem to run down. He  continues to put in 10-hour days at Fluidmaster, and has plenty of energy to  join Klentz in bringing their 25-year-old experimental vehicle out of  retirement.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the two men also are working out preliminary plans for the design of  a futuristic internal combustion automotive engine. For that purpose, Klentz  recently spent several weeks in England and Germany, studying a concept in  aviation technology that was used effectively on aircraft before and during  World War II but never in automotive engine design.  </P> <P> While they offer few details, this project will address the problems of  pollution and fuel economy, both of which have haunted the automotive industry  for years.  </P> <P> "No need to worry about timing with that product," Schoepe says. "The engine  that will help solve those problems can't arrive soon enough."  </P></p>

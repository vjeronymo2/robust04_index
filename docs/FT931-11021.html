			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Base metals prices eased off their highs during late afternoon trading at the London Metal Exchange. COPPER ran into technical resistance and Chinese selling before ending after hours trading Dollars 6 up at Dollars 2,238 a tonne in the three months position. The sterling quotation was Pounds 8.75 down at Pounds 1,560.50 a tonne as the pound clawed back some of its lost ground. The three months ZINC price broke above the Dollars 1,130 level at one stage, triggering some stop-loss buying orders, before settling back in after hours trading to Dollars 1,129 a tonne, up Dollars 4.50 from Wednesday. COCOA futures finished near the day's lows with sentiment on charts becoming increasingly bearish. The May position ended Pounds 22 down at the London Futures and Options Exchange. There continued to be unconfirmed talk that Ivorian arrivals may have been higher than previously believed. Robusta COFFEE futures managed to partially recoup earlier losses during the afternoon session but the May position, which had dipped to Dollars 910 at one stage, still finished Dollars 16 down at Dollars 928 a tonne.

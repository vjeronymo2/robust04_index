			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: THE COMMON COLD REQUIRES SPECIAL DRESSING  </P> <P> As my doctor packed for a conference in Belgium she remembered the common cold.  Europe, after all, rides north of the United States; Brussels is on a line with  Calgary. And this was March.  </P> <P> She borrowed a heavy, hooded coat from her daughter and added woolen gloves,  boots and muffler.  </P> <P> After a few bland seasons in Southern California she had to remind herself of  vital cold-weather accessories.  </P> <P> March is a tricky month. It can be spritzy with daffodils and crocus, or leaden  gray with clouds that chill the earth. Or both. It is a shoulder season, and  wise travelers keep theirs covered.  </P> <P> The coldest I have ever been was not in Lapland one January nor in Antarctica  at Christmastime. In those cases I was prepared. The places where I was  miserable enough for frozen tears were London and Hamburg.  </P> <P> True, it was a winter of European gales. Also true, I had not packed for such  intense and numbing cold -- most of it outdoors.  </P> <P> In London one February night, after a performance of Verdi's "Requiem" at the  Royal Festival Hall, a friend and I decided to walk across the dark footbridge  over the Thames. The wind was fierce, but we figured that we could catch a taxi  more easily on the north bank, away from the concert crowd.  </P> <P> We had decided to take a cab, instead of the Waterloo tube, to go directly to  the door of the Mayfair restaurant, where we had late-dinner reservations.  </P> <P> That turned out to be foolish. Every cab that passed us had passengers. On the  far side of the bridge we turned toward the Strand and Trafalgar Square. The  wind whipped our faces and unwrapped my wraparound coat.  </P> <P> We paused at empty bus stops and squinted at the list of routes. It would be a  long, cold wait because of the hour and the lean Bank Holiday schedule.  Theaters, by then, were dark. We were in a black hole between tube stations.  </P> <P> I remembered a line from a London guidebook: "All buses cover the routes in  both directions -- a fact one may well forget in the heat of the moment."  </P> <P> Or in the cold of the night.  </P> <P> And so we kept trudging. There was no recrimination as to who's idea it was to  jump out of the queue back at the warmly lit concert hall. There was also  little mirth.  </P> <P> We ended up walking to the Mayfair. I never measured the distance. I do know  that the Greenhouse restaurant in Hays Mews was about to close when we arrived.  And that the proprietress had to untie the belt of my camel coat because my  fingers would not work. And that my red hands clashed with the linen napkin in  my lap. And that my face burned.  </P> <P> Hamburg, by the river Elbe, was a similar tale: a walk too far on a night too  cold in shoes too thin. There are times, often city times, when good sense  should prevail over one's innate sense of adventure.  </P> <P> To ward off deep chills I now travel with a cashmere muffler, wool gloves, long  underwear and an Icelandic wool cap that pulls over your ears and stays on in  the wind.  </P> <P> None of these items weighs much. Each has saved my skin.  </P> <P> I have a bureau drawer, however, which is proof that I have been caught short  on the road.  </P> <P> There are pebbly-tan wool gloves from a New Zealand farm outlet on South Island  and fuzzy-red mittens knitted by blanket maker Lena Rewell in Helsinki. There  is a pair of dove-gray and black gloves designed by Sonia Rykiel. Maybe it  wasn't cold in Paris, but I couldn't be sure.  </P> <P> The oddest pair is from the Falkland Islands Co. store in Port Stanley, the  last clothing emporium I would see on the way to the Antarctic peninsula.  </P> <P> I had packed Gore-Tex ski mittens for that bottom-of-the-world expedition but I  wanted another pair of wool liners. The only gloves being sold in Stanley that  December day did not have full fingers, just knuckle-length stubs of wool.  </P> <P> "You wear them for fishing," a clerk said when I asked. "Or for gardening or  any work outdoors."  </P> <P> When I shifted in my parka and protested that my fingers would freeze, she  smiled and shook her head:  </P> <P> "You must remember, dear, that this is summertime."  </P></p>

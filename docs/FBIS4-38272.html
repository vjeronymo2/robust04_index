			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY,  Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim answered a  question on prisoner exchange with the Israelis. He said that  in the past an international organization, the United Nations,  intervened and sent a personal envoy--Gian Domenico Pico--to  discuss the issue of POW's between the Lebanese and Israelis.  He added: This effort stopped long ago and we consider that  any neutral party acceptable to us, be it regional or  international, is suitable to discuss the release of POW's held  in Israel.    Qasim went on: We have said it before; we hold two prisoners  and are ready to swap them with prisoners and detainees held in  Israeli and South Lebanese Army jails but Israel is blocking  this move. He noted that Mustafa al-Dirani's abduction has  achieved nothing for Israel as regards airman Ron Arad.    Answering a question on Hizballah's view of the two  indictments against [leader of the dissolved Lebanese Forces  Party] Samir Ja'ja', he said: The measure was good and we call  for strengthening the domestic arena to rally all resources in  the face of Israel.    Assessing Hizballah's experiment in the Chamber of Deputies,  he said parliament is a propaganda and political podium that  contributes to supporting resistance and deals with problems in  areas near the Israeli border.    The Hizballah deputy secretary general said the party has  opened a dialogue with the Christians that is still in progress.  He added that every Lebanese has the right to live in Lebanon  and express his view quite freely. Should General Michel 'Awn,  Raymond Iddih, or former President Amin al-Jumayyil decide to  return to Lebanon, they would be returning to their homeland, he  said.</p>

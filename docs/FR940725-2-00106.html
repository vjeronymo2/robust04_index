Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 6.42 and 6.45 and Interpretations and Policies to Rule 6.42 concerning pricing and priorities on spread, straddle, and combination orders. The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBO states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is twofold: first, to revise the minimum increments permissible for bids and offers on spread, straddle, and combination orders and, second, to prescribe the priority principles to apply to such orders when priced net at a multiple of one sixteenth of a dollar. The CBOE believes that these changes will facilitate the orderly execution of spread, straddle, and combination orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first change, to Rule 6.42, clarifies the language of the rule and adds a new Interpretation and Policy .02. This new Interpretation reflects the determination of the CBOE's Floor Procedure Committee that quotes for spreads, straddles, and combination orders (``combined trades'') may be expressed in any fractional or decimal price, which will makes it easier for members to price combined trades in relation to the current market. The second change, to paragraph (d) of Rule 6.45, adjusts the priority principles applicable to combined trades. As revised, a CBOE member holding an order on a combined trade that is priced net at a multiple of 1/16 (i.e., 1/4, 3/8, 7/16, 1/2, etc.) has priority over bids and offers in the trading crowd if all legs of the combined trade would trade at a price that is at least equivalent to quotes in the crowd. Furthermore, the order will also take priority over bids and offers in the customer limit order book if, in addition to all legs of the combination at least matching quotes in the crowd, at least one leg of the combination trades at a price that is better than the corresponding bid or offer in the book. Bids or offers that are part of a combined trade and that are not priced at a net multiple of 1/16, while permissible, will not be entitled to priority under the exception contained in paragraph (d) to Rule 6.45. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also under the proposed rule change, special priority principles will apply to stock-option combination orders that are priced net at a multiple of 1/16. Under this change, a stock-option order, as defined in CBOE Rule 1.1(ii)(a), that consists of an order to buy or sell a given number of shares of an underlying stock and an opposite side of the market order to buy or sell an option covering the same number of shares will be considered to be a combined trade for purposes of priority over bids and offers in the crowd, but not over bids and offers in the book. A stock-option order, as defined in CBOE Rule 1.1(ii)(b), that consists of an order to buy or sell an underlying stock with the purchase and sale of an equal number of puts and calls, each having the same exercise price, expiration date and covering the same number of shares of the underlying stock, each being on the opposite side of the market from the order to buy or sell stock, and covering in the aggregate twice the number of shares represented by the stock order, will be considered to be a combined trade and will have priority over orders in the crowd and in the book. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an illustration, assume that Option A is quoted at 5 bid, 51/8 asked, and option B is quoted at 6 bid, 61/8 asked, and assume that all four quotes are represented in the book. In that instance, a spread involving the purchase (or sale) of option A and the sale (or purchase) of option B may trade at a net credit or debit of 1 (e.g., a net credit of 1 if option A is bought at 5 and option B sold at 6, or a net debit of 1 if option A is sold at 51/8 and option B is bought at 61/8. In this example, because the net price is a multiple of 1/16 and the execution of the spread involves taking the same side of the market as the book on only one side of the spread, the spread would receive priority even though it ``touches'' quotes in the book on both sides. (That is, in the spread consisting of the purchase of option A at 5 and the sale of option B at 6, only the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> purchase <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of option A occurs at the same price and on the same side of the market as the book, which is bid at 5; the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of option B at 6 is on the opposite side of the market in the book, which is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bid <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 6.) In the same example, it would not be permissible under Rule 6.45(d) to trade the spread at a net debit of 7/8 by selling the first option at 51/8 and buying the second at 6, because this trade would be executed at the same price and on the same side of the market as the book on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> both sides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the spread. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To qualify for priority treatment, combined orders must meet the existing requirements of Rule 6.45(d), i.e., one member must represent all legs of the combined trade, each leg must cover the same number of options, and the trade must be executed against one other member. In those circumstances, the CBOE believes, it is fair to give combined trades priority when priced net at a multiple of 1/16. Additionally, the CBOE represents that it has the systems capacity to disseminate transactions in decimals and also has a prefix field which will be used to identify, among other things, trades effected as part of a spread. Any transaction effected at non-standard prices would be disseminated in decimals and identified as being part of a spread by entering an ``S'' in the prefix field. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Amendment No. 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

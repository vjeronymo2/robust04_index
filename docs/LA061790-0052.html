			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW SAFE IS LAX?  </P> <P> I am pleased to learn that President Bush has approved legislation that would  help solve staffing problems for air traffic controllers.  </P> <P> A percentage of this funding is to come from higher user fees for passengers.  It will amaze me to hear the public complain about the intrusion on their  wallets, even though the need for such funding clearly exists. Air fares are a  bargain compared to what many of these air travelers are willing to pay to dine  at their favorite restaurant in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> GAYE REHDER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

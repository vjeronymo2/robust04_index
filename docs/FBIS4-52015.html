			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Kim Ho-sam: "Unjust and </F> Unreasonable Act"]    [Text] The insurance of durable peace on the Korean  peninsula has been raised as a vital issue which should not be  delayed any longer.    The DPRK Foreign Ministry on 28 April announced a statement  pertaining to this issue, and proposed to the U.S. side that  negotiations be held between the DPRK and the United States in  order to replace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace  agreement and to provide a new peace insurance system, replacing  the present Korean armistice organization which cannot play any  role in preventing a war.    This is a most reasonable proposal for preventing a new war  from occurring on the Korean peninsula on which the situation is  strained to an extreme pitch [kuktoro kinjangdoeo innun] and for  insuring durable peace. Therefore, fair public opinion of the  world actively welcomed this.    Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities, interfering in  our reasonable proposal, are attempting to disturb it.    According to a report, the South Korean authorities on 3 May  said that our proposal for DPRK-U.S. negotiations on replacing  the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement should be  discussed by the North and the South through direct talks after  the nuclear problem of the North is completely resolved. They  noted that they will reveal the government position at a meeting  of the unification and security policy adjustment council and  will inform the United Nations and the United States of the  position.    In an informal talk with reporters that day, the puppet  foreign minister, claiming that the issue of a peace agreement  is not the issue to be negotiated between our Republic and the  United States, said that even if this issue is discussed at a  third round of DPRK- U.S. talks, it will not be adopted as an  agenda item.    Such remarks by the South Korean authorities reveal their  insidious attempt to hinder negotiations between us and the  United States over the issue of insuring everlasting peace on  the Korean peninsula from being realized and to interfere in and  disturb the negotiations.    As everyone knows, the armistice status has lasted over 40  years in Korea. This is indeed an abnormal situation. During  this period, our Republic put forward various reasonable  proposals and initiatives with a view to preventing a new war by  all means from occurring in Korea, and made all efforts to  achieve them.    However, the United States, going counter to this,  systematically abrogated [chegyejoguro pagihaewatta] what were  agreed on in the Armistice Agreement. The United States brought  modern lethal weapons into South Korea in a concealed manner in  the past. However, it is now openly introducing new missiles in  broad daylight.    Because of this, the Korean Armistice Agreement has been  reduced to a scrap of paper incapable of insuring peace on the  Korean peninsula, and the Military Armistice Commission [MAC]  has become only a nominal organization practically with no  masters.    Under this very situation, our Republic proposed this time  for negotiations with the United States with a view to  establishing a new peace insurance system on the Korean  peninsula. However, the South Korean puppets are attempting to  interfere in this presumptuously.    This is a totally unreasonable act not only in view of  international laws but also from the standpoint of the very  parties that signed the Armistice Agreement. As everyone knows,  in view of international laws, the armistice means a temporary  suspension of combat action, not a total peace. Therefore, a  peace agreement should be concluded between the parties in  hostilities so that unstable peace be turned into total peace.    Only our Republic and the U.S. side are eligible to conclude  a peace agreement in our country. This is because the Korean  Armistice Agreement was signed between the two parties with the  Korean People's Army [KPA] and the Chinese People's Volunteers  [CPV] as one side and the UN Forces as the other. In addition,  who represented the side of the KPA and CPV at that time was our  Republic and who represented the UN Forces side was the United  States.    The very parties that concluded the Korean Armistice  Agreement are our Republic and the United States and those who  signed the Agreement are none other than our Republic and the  United States. Thus, it is not necessary even to mention that  the South Korean authorities have no justification whatsoever to  interfere in this.    Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are raving about  the issue of measures for a peace agreement on the Korean  peninsula, and so forth. This is indeed a laughable act going  counter to common sense.    Such an unreasonable act by the South Korean puppets again  proves that they are not interested in peace on the Korean  peninsula and reunification of the nation even to a slightest  degree but are pursuing only division and war by disturbing  DPRK-U.S. negotiations and talks.    The South Korean authorities should not run wild without  sensing where they can stand and where they can sit but act with  discretion. Their reckless act will only invoke denunciation and  mockery of fair public opinion of the world.</p>

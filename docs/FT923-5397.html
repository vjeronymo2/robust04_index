			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (4): Where they spend it - Dresden DRESDEN, the state capital of Saxony, is a city with a magnificent and turbulent past and a potentially glittering future. The present-day reality contains elements of both, as Dresdeners struggle bravely with the frustrations and hopes of recapturing the city's former prosperity and elegance. The past can be seen from the views of Dresden in its heyday painted by Canaletto. High over the baroque city, sited so dramatically on the River Elbe, soars the Frauenkirche (Church of our Lady), the beautiful domed protestant church. When Dresden was battered by Allied bombs early in 1945, the Frauenkirche collapsed, its baroque heritage seemed lost for ever, and Gerhart Hauptmann, the Nobel prize-winning author, was moved to utter the cry that has become part of the city's legend: 'Those who have forgotten how to cry will learn again through the destruction of Dresden.' The Frauenkirche is still in ruins, but strenuous efforts are being made to raise funds for its reconstruction. Other renovations are under way. The baroque Zwinger Palace, built in the reign of Augustus the Strong, Saxony's ruler in the early 18th century, is being smartened up. Most ambitious of all, the elector's palace is being wholly rebuilt. All of these buildings were severely damaged in 1945. Under four decades of communist rule, more old buildings were swept away, leaving Dresden, and its 522,000 people, with its fair share of bleak, nondescript apartment and office blocks as well as districts that have survived war and need refurbishing. Through all its hardships, the city's heart has continued to beat strongly. As Saxony - like the other east German states - has been recreated under German unity, so has its state capital regained its pride and identity. Dresdner Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, was quick to open up premises in the city of its origin. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the state premier who made his political name in west Germany, presides over the government in an imposing building overlooking the Elbe. In summer, open air cafes and restaurants are buzzing and the view from the restored Bruhl Terrace above the Elbe, with its broad riverside meadows, allows a glimpse of Dresden's past glories. For the inhabitants, however, there are more urgent - and mundane - considerations. The city's infrastructure is in a woeful state, housing is inadequate and social tensions have increased. The city council is having a hard time grappling with these problems, hampered by inexperience and lack of money. In time, the hurdles will be overcome. With a rich cultural history - Wagner grew up there and Kokoschka painted there - its breadth of academic and scientific institutions, and status as capital of a state striving to revive its former industrial prominence in Germany, Dresden promises again to become one of the most fascinating and exciting of European cities.</p>

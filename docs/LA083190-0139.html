			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TIMELESS RITUAL FROM JAVA;  </P> <P> CULTURE: ROYAL COURT DANCERS WILL PERFORM PROGRAMS RICH IN ISLAND HERITAGE  BEGINNING TODAY AT THE ARBORETUM.  </P> <P> Flanked by statues of giants, symbols of human passion, the massive Danapratapa  Gate of the Sultan's Palace (or Kraton) dominates a courtyard gleaming with  antique splendor.  </P> <P> On the left, tourists gawk at gilded sedan chairs and other artifacts of a  regime that seems an eternal part of Javanese culture -- but in fact came into  being 20 years before the American Revolution.  </P> <P> On the right, court dancers perform in a long, low pavilion (once a reception  hall) that's open on all sides and supported by black wooden pillars decorated  in gold.  </P> <P> Although the dancers appear isolated in the pavilion's wide, empty space,  richness envelops them -- starting with the magnificent batiks they wear.  </P> <P> Overhead: eight Waterford chandeliers and a sloping ceiling painted with golden  starbursts. Underfoot: elegant tiles in green and cream. Behind: the red and  gold instruments of a gamelan (percussion orchestra) famous for its unique  honeyed tone.  </P> <P> To be a court dancer today in Jogjakarta is to belong to this majestic,  intricately ordered environment -- but only on a part-time basis. Since the  1960s, there has been no permanent dance school or resident company in the  Sultan's Palace, merely invitational rehearsals there once a week.  </P> <P> Consequently, the five dozen court artists appearing in three different Los  Angeles Festival programs at the Los Angeles State and Couty Arboretum in  Arcadia beginning today are all essentially free-lancers: bound to the Kraton  both by contract and cultural tradition but also subsisting by other means.  </P> <P> For some, the Indonesian government art academies have replaced the court as a  central influence -- and, for the veterans in particular, the change in  conditions has proven to be a process of reduction.  </P> <P> In contrast to the current touring forces, distinguished musician R.M. Palen  Suwondo remembers palace performances in the 1920s and '30s that involved 400  to 500 dancers and musicians. "More people putting on the production than were  invited to watch it," he said. "You'd start in the morning, go until five in  the evening, break for two hours and then start again and go until five the  next morning -- for three days!" The sultan's family and guests came and went  during these marathons, as did the general populace (allowed to watch from  certain fenced-off areas).  </P> <P> In those glory days, Kraton dancers had highly specialized careers, recalled  the dancer Sunartomo, who appears prominently in the Wayang Wong (masked  dance-drama) performances on the American tour. "Teachers would look at your  physical shape and select a single role for you," he said. "You studied that  one character, nothing more."  </P> <P> "Or sometimes the sultan would see someone with no dance training and say,  'He'd be perfect for a particular character: Get him!' "  </P> <P> "Nowadays, of course, there is art outside the court. And if you're going to be  a dancer, you'll need to do more than just one character -- or you won't get  enough jobs."  </P> <P> Today, men no longer dance all the roles in Wayang Wong, and performances are  abridged or excerpted to about five hours. (The touring Wayang Wong has been  shortened even more.) In addition, dance forms that were formerly seen only by  the court have been adapted for wider viewing -- among them the austere 17th  Century womens' ritual Bedhaya, included on the program tonight.  </P> <P> Revered Jogjakarta choreographer R. Rio Sasminta Mardawa (a. k. a. Rama Sas)  emphasized that the metaphysical weight and power of Bedhaya demands the  dancers' "total concentration and freedom from outside thoughts."  </P> <P> "The first part of Bedhaya," he explained, "reflects the essence of nine women  trying to become one, going back and forth between their individuality and a  group identity. Ego and desire tempt people out of the group, away from  oneness, but when you finally see them down on the floor -- (arranged) 3-3-3,  in every direction -- you've reached the integration of all of them."  </P> <P> Before performing sacred forms of Bedhaya, he said, "dancers fast for three  days, taking only water with nothing in it and rice with nothing in it." After  this cleansing ritual, "they can eat on the day of the dance. But because this  (public, secular version of Bedhaya) is not a ritual, the dancers won't do  that. But even if they're not fasting, they must come cleansed and bring no  (mental) baggage with them."  </P> <P> If Bedhaya once represented a private Kraton heirloom -- performed only by  relatives of the sultan -- the form named Golek Menak illustrates the  continuing influence of the Jogjakarta court on Javanese cultural life. Newest  of traditional court idioms, Golek Menak was commissioned by Hamengku Buwono IX  in 1941 after a performance by wooden rod puppets (Wayang Golek).  </P> <P> The sultan's idea (as modified over the next four decades): dancing based on  both puppet motion and Indonesian martial arts, accompanied by vigorous West  Javanese-style drumming and depicting stories drawn from a beloved Islamic  epic, the Amir Hamzah romances.  </P> <P> Mardawa danced in the premiere performances of Golek Menak and explained that  the secret is for the dancers to think of themselves as made of wood. "A slight  inclination of the neck is possible in dance," he said, "but not in Menak. In  classical dancing, the hand is mobile, the fingers curl; in Menak, however, the  hand must be frozen . . . "  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he insisted, "the essence (of Menak) comes from classical  Jogjakarta court style: The smoothness, delicacy, flow, integration of  movements are the same."  </P> <P> Even for wooden court dancers in a contemporary Kraton, some things never  change.  </P></p>

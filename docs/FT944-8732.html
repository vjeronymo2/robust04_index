			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Observer: Mid-Ruff crisis Will Peter Ruff, the BBC's man in Moscow in the mid-1980s, come in from the cold? Ruff, who seems to have lost his way a bit since he quit the BBC three years ago - he popped up briefly at the Chemical Industries Association - is in the running to take over from Tim Collins, director of communications for the Conservative party. Collins wants to be an MP and is expected to have cleared his desk before the end of the year. The Tories seem to go through their spin-doctors faster than their party chairmen. The last BBC man in the job was Shaun Woodward, an ex-Panorama producer, who came and went with little impact. Ruff is clearly a strong candidate: covering a totalitarian state on its last legs sounds the right sort of preparation.</p>

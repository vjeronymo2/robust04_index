			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Union Carbide set to pull out of ferrochrome UNION CARBIDE Corporation of the US, one of Zimbabwe's two ferrochrome producing and exporting companies has taken the first step towards disinvestment with the appointment of an international management team to operate its ferrochrome plant. In an opaque statement, that makes no reference to disinvestment, Union Carbide Corporation of the US says the new management team will be headed by two Zimbabweans, Mr Patrick Quirke and Mr Don Bailey, both of whom are former employees of the RTZ group. Union Carbide has long been keen to divest itself of the ferrochrome operation, largely because it did not fit well with the group's core business of industrial gases and chemicals. It came close to selling the Zimbabwe subsidiary to RTZ of the UK last year but the deal fell through at the 11th hour largely because of the collapse of the ferrochrome market in the face of unprecedented Russian exports. Mr Bailey was a key figure on the RTZ side in these negotiations and he will now direct the ferrochrome operation in Zimbabwe, while also exploring prospects for developing one of three platinum prospects currently under investigation in the country. Union Carbide Zimbabwe owns the Mimosa platinum prospect, while BHP-Utah and Delta Gold of Australia are investigating the Hartley deposit and a consortium of Anglo America Corporation of Zimbabwe, Rio Tinto Zimbabwe and Robertson Mining also have a project under investigation. Mining industry executives say that the development is positive from both the ferrochrome and the platinum viewpoints. It has long been clear that Union Carbide in the US was not interested in investing in either the ferrochrome or platinum mines. The apparent hope is that the new management team will be able to strengthen the ferrochrome operation, which is struggling at present because of the depressed global market and sharply higher domestic costs, as well as developing Mimosa platinum mine. The country's other ferrochrome producer, Zimbabwe Alloys, owned by Anglo American says energy costs, which have risen dramatically in the last few years, now account for about half total costs. Last year, Union Carbide's Zimbabwe subsidiary, Zimasco, had total sales of some ZDollars 500m (USDollars 100m).</p>

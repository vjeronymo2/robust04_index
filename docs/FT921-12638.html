			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Options dispute complicates sale of Israeli newspaper ARTHUR ANDERSEN, admin-istrator to Mr Robert Maxwell's private companies, said yesterday that it was close to selling the companies' 84 per cent holding in Ma'ariv Modi'in, the Israeli media group. The sale of the business, which owns Ma'ariv, Israel's second biggest newspaper, is likely to raise between Dollars 20m and Dollars 25m (Pounds 11m to Pounds 13.8m). However, the disposal has been complicated by a dispute between Andersen and the Tel Aviv law firm which represented Mr Maxwell in Israel. The dispute was triggered by the discovery of a document giving details of a pledge allegedly made by Mr Maxwell in the month before he died to grant options covering 15 per cent of Ma'ariv's shares to three individuals, including Mr Ya'acov Ne'eman, a partner in Herzog Fox Ne'eman, Mr Maxwell's Israeli legal advisers. According to the document, Mr Maxwell promised to grant the options - together with an option of first refusal on other share sales - to Mr Aharon Dovrat, Mr Maxwell's representative on the company board, Mr Dov Judkovsky, the editor of Ma'ariv, and Mr Ya'acov Ne'eman. Mr Dovrat and Mr Judkovsky, an existing 5 per cent shareholder, are partners in one of four bids to purchase Ma'ariv. The options, if taken up, would have given them an advantage over the three other bidders, led by Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger Group, Mr Ya'acov Nimrodi, chairman of the Israel Land Development Company, and a group of US Jewish investors. Arthur Andersen had been concerned about the enforceability of the document but said yesterday: 'The persons who could claim options under the document have now withdrawn the claim.' So the auction of Ma'ariv can proceed. 'There was no question of these options being taken up because they were at a much more expensive price than that now being mentioned for the company,' said Mr Judkovsky. The relationship between Mr Katz's team and Herzog Fox Ne'eman has been under stress. The law firm, which is understood to be seeking payment of a large sum in outstanding fees left unpaid by Mr Maxwell, is angry at what it feels is the accusatory attitude of the administrator towards it. An investigation by the administrator of the firm's files at its offices over the past two weeks has led to bitter verbal and written exchanges between the two sides.</p>

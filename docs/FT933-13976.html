			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television The 1993 Promenade Concert season opens with a performance of Richard Strauss' one act opera 'Elektra', performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Singers under conductor Andrew Davis, relayed live from the Royal Albert Hall and broadcast simultaneously on BBC2 and Radio 3. Soprano Marilyn Zschau is Elektra, mezzo soprano Eva Randova is Clytemnestra, Willard White sings the part of Orestes, and William Cochran is Aegisthus (7.30). Herbal medicine is the subject of the new series Blooming Bellamy. Biologist David Bellamy shows that herbs used for centuries in preparing medicines can be found in such banal spots as the pavements of south London and on railway stations (7.30 BBC1). It is a good night for lovers of the kitsch and the odd in popular music. BBC2's series of Rock Docs offers a 1974 documentary 'On Tour With The Osmonds' and Channel 4 shows the Marc Bolan documentary 'The Legendary Years' (12.45, as part of its 'Dinomania' round-up, Bolan's band being called T Rex).</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANDY MAKERS EXPAND THEIR EASTER OFFERINGS  </P> <P> America's big chocolate makers are trying to sweeten their Easter profits, and  analysts say the expansion of special holiday products will increase sales for  everyone.  </P> <P> "There was a time when many of the major companies were not involved in  seasonal-type packaging," said Jan Kitt, associate publisher of The Confection  magazine, based in Orlando, Fla. Small producers of chocolate bunnies and candy  eggs provided most of the specialty Easter products.  </P> <P> While industry watchers don't have statistics on who controls what part of the  Easter market, they agree that times have changed. Chocolate giants such as  Hershey Foods Corp. and M&amp;M-Mars have entered the fray with seasonal  versions of their regular products, and manufacturers are giving more attention  to special holiday displays, Kitt said.  </P> <P> "More and more packages are geared to the holiday season," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easter Variations  </P> <P> The National Confectioners Assn. is projecting sales of $815 million of Easter  chocolate and candy sales this year, a 2% increase from 1988.  </P> <P> "Easter's been doing very well," said Dick O'Connell, president of the McLean,  Va.-based Chocolate Manufacturers Assn. "Part of it is we're going back to more  traditional thinking in terms of holidays. More attention is being paid to  chocolate bunnies and fancy Easter eggs and jelly beans -- all the things that  go with Easter."  </P> <P> Hershey and Mars, which together control most of the domestic chocolate market,  offer Easter variations of their popular year-round products. Hershey has been  marketing Kisses wrapped in Christmas and Easter colors for years, but its  recent acquisition of Cadbury's, which makes several chocolate Easter egg  products, should boost holiday sales, said spokesman Carl Andrews.  </P> <P> "The company found that there's quite a market for special packaging for  existing products," said analyst R. Bentley Offutt of Offutt Securities Inc.  </P></p>

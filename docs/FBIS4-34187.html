			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Walter Falceta Jr.] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo -- The PT [Workers Party] will not make  any political agreement with Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP)  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party - Amapa]. This was reported  early yesterday evening by PT President Rui Falcao (state deputy  for SP) [Sao Paulo]. A day earlier, PT presidential candidate  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said that he would accept Sarney's  support. Lula said that the PT could not refuse to talk with the  former president and that he will resume the north-south railway  construction begun by Sarney.    "There will be no agreement with Senator Sarney. The PT has  not and will not seek him. We cannot forbid, however, anyone  from demonstrating admiration for our candidate," Falcao said  after the weekly meeting of the PT national executive board.    Falcao, one of the leaders of the most radical PT wing, said  the party cannot make an agreement with Sarney because his  government was marked by recession and by the liberal  distribution of radio and television stations [in exchange for  political support]. Falcao believes that a political alliance  between Lula and Sarney is "unthinkable."    "The PT demonstrated what it thinks of Sarney when it  struggled with all its might to prevent him from remaining in  power for five years. No PT deputy voted for the extension of  his term in office," the PT president said.    The party is not disdaining Lula's idea of wanting Sarney's  support, Falcao said, adding that Lula and the PT agree on one  point: The objective is to win the votes of Sarney's followers.    Despite the meeting held on 8 June between Deputies Aloizio  Mercadante (PT-SP) and Jose Sarney Filho (PFL-MA) [Liberal Front  Party - Maranhao] to discuss an alliance between Lula and  Sarney, Falcao said there has never been an understanding on the  subject. He said the "informal talks" between Aloizio and Sarney  Filho were misinterpreted. According to Falcao, the PT's  strategy will be to maintain direct contacts with Sarney's  followers and convince them that Lula's government platform is  the best to get the country through the crisis.</p>

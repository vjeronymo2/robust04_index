			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been disclosed that Ichiro Ozawa, secretary  general of Shinseito, in his meeting with Kazuyoshi Toyoda,  chairman of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (JA  Zenchu), criticized "the food, agriculture, and farming village  policy (new agricultural policy)." A plan to nurture  large-scale farming is one of its pillars. At the same time,  Ozawa explained his view that self-sufficiency in the rice  supply should be maintained even if the people have to bear the  consequences of the disparity between Japanese and overseas  prices. Reportedly, Chairman Toyoda agreed with Ozawa and  "promised to have close cooperation with Shinseito in the  future." Since he is an influential figure in the ruling  coalition, it seems that Ozawa's criticism of the agricultural  policy will impact on management of future agricultural policies.    The meeting was held on 5 April [as published] under the  auspices of JA Zenchu in Iwate Prefecture, where Ozawa's  hometown is.    In the meeting, Ozawa touched on and criticized the new  agricultural policy that the Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries Ministry mapped out in 1992 to nurture large-scale  farmers. He said: "The policy will create a large landowner  system. Large-scale farming is impossible in Japan."    On liberalization of Japan's rice market, Ozawa said that:  "I was against the partial liberalization (of rice imports)  from the beginning." In this way, he insisted that we should  keep foreign rice out of the Japanese market by choosing  tariffication of rice rather than accepting minimum access."  Moreover, he explained his pet theme, saying that "rice supply  self-sufficiency should be maintained even if the people have to  pay five times more than (the international price) for rice."    In the past, the Zenchu mobilized agricultural cooperatives  and farmers across the nation to support the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP]. It was the LDP's largest supporting body.  Following the collapse of the 1955 regime of Japanese politics,  however, the Zenchu reviewed its stance of supporting only the  LDP. Prior to the Ozawa-Toyoda meeting, the Zenchu held social  gatherings by inviting senior executives of the ruling  coalition. The Zenchu was apparently "moving away from the  LDP." Takami Eto, Sadanori Nakayama, and other members of the  LDP's Agricultural and Forestry Department protested against the  Zenchu's move. There was trouble stirring between the LDP and  the Zenchu.    Contents of the meeting were scheduled to be published in  JAPANESE AGRICULTURAL NEWSPAPER, which is the Zenchu organ.  However, it was not realized because senior Zenchu officials had  decided that "our ties with the LDP will definitely become worse  if we excite the LDP more than it is now."    Ozawa's office printed the contents of the discussions at  the  meeting in newsletters and began on the seventh to distribute  them among Ozawa's supporters.</p>

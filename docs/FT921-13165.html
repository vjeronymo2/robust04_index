			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Germany limits CIS trade support THE German government yesterday agreed on a drastic restriction in export credit guarantees for trade with the republics of the ex-Soviet Union, setting a ceiling of DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) for the coming year - half the level of exports last year from east German enterprises alone. The decision was taken in the light of Germany's soaring trade exposure with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and a huge backlog of applications for export insurance totalling DM70bn. The exposure of Hermes, the German export insurance agency, to the former Soviet republics now stands at almost DM30bn, compared with DM11.6bn at the end of 1990. Exporters who have been given agreement in principle for insurance cover from Hermes will not have it renewed automatically if they fail to conclude their contracts in the coming weeks. Agreements in principle already given total DM23bn, while applications in the pipeline total a further DM70bn, according to the Finance Ministry. The Cabinet also decided not to continue the special insurance regime for east German exporters, which meant that insurance cover was given for 100 per cent of their contract value until the end of last year. The decisions are likely to have dire consequences for east German exporters although the chronic shortage of foreign currency in the CIS republics was already causing a sharp drop in finalised import contracts. The curbs in Hermes cover were demanded by Mr Theo Waigel, the Finance Minister, against the pleading of Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the Economics Minister. They will be reviewed in March, officials said. For the time being, all German exports will be judged on two criteria: whether they will help the foreign exchange earnings of the ex-Soviet republics, and whether they mean life-or-death for an east German enterprise, which would otherwise have to be closed or supported with state funds.</p>

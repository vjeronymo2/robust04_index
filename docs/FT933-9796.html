			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Flogas members back offer DIRECTORS of DCC said yesterday that the pre-condition regarding its partial cash offer to raise its stake in Flogas, the publicly-quoted Irish distributor of liquefied petroleum gas, had been satisfied. The pre-condition was that independent shareholders accounting for at least 20.2 per cent of Flogas accepted the offer by 3pm yesterday. The news prompted a 48p rise in Flogas shares to 288p. On Thursday DCC, the Dublin-based private industrial holding company founded and run by Mr Jim Flavin, bid 325p a share to lift its 29.9 per cent holding in Flogas to 60.1 per cent. It was reported yesterday that Powerimpact, the DCC subsidiary bidding for up to 7.37m Flogas shares, had received irrevocable commitments to accept the partial offer in respect of 5.16m shares, representing 21.1 per cent of the equity.</p>

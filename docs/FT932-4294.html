			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Australia finds way to ease student debt pain: Kevin Brown looks at a possible fee repayment model for other countries WHEN 21-year old Georgina Young graduates next year from Sydney's University of Technology (UTS), she will emerge into the workforce with a degree in communications and tuition debts of up to ADollars 10,000 (Pounds 4,440). Ms Young is one of a growing number of university students forced to pay part of the cost of degree courses under Australia's Higher Education Contributions Scheme (Hecs), introduced in 1989 but just beginning to bite. Australia's Labor government was criticised for introducing the scheme, which many supporters saw as a betrayal of the party's ideals - an earlier Labor administration abolished fees in 1974. But the Hecs pill was made easier to swallow by a unique income contingent repayment mechanism which means that graduates make no repayments until they begin earning higher than average incomes. A year after the first students with full Hecs liabilities graduated, academic studies suggest that the scheme has had a negligible impact on the size and composition of the university intake. At the same time it is providing a growing contribution to the government's ADollars 4bn university budget, which might otherwise have strained to keep pace with growth in enrolments of more than 10 per cent a year. The message has not been lost on other governments seeking an equitable way to make students contribute to university costs. The system has been watched closely in the UK, where a proposal by the London School of Economics to charge students additional tuition fees from September 1994 has brought the issue to the fore. The UK government's stated position is to leave universities with the autonomy to charge tuition fees if they wish to do so. However, the LSE has suggested that charging fees would be easier if a system of long-term student loans was made available. Canada and the Czech Republic have also inquired about the Australian scheme. Undergraduate students pay 20 per cent of the average cost of courses, currently equivalent to ADollars 2,328 a year. About 10 per cent of students (or their parents or employers) pay in advance. But the scheme also allows students to defer their liabilities at zero real interest until they have graduated and are earning more than the average wage, now ADollars 27,748. The debt is repaid through the tax system in instalments equivalent to 2 per cent of taxable income, rising to 3 per cent if income reaches ADollars 36,000, and 4 per cent for incomes above ADollars 44,146. There is no time limit on repayments, and although the liability is retained for life, graduates who never exceed the earnings threshold will never have to repay the debt. The scheme raised about ADollars 185m in 1991-92, of which about ADollars 100m was in advance payments. However, deferred payments quadrupled over 1990-91, and will continue to increase rapidly as more Hecs students enter the workforce. A report by Mr Bruce Chapman, director of the Centre for Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University, concluded that Hecs is fairer than the loan systems used in many other countries. This is because the repayment system ensures that graduates who reach higher income brackets quickly repay their liabilities earlier than those who remain in low income occupations or achieve higher incomes late in life. Officials say the government is considering extending the scheme to cover 25 per cent of course costs. It may also be extended to technical education if state governments agree. Would the scheme work abroad? Mr Chapman said it could, but it would have to be adapted to local conditions, including finding a way of replicating Australia's watertight taxation system, which makes it impossible for graduates to dodge their liabilities.

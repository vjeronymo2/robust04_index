			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> LAND SWORN IN AS MAYOR  </P> <P> Saying the city faces tough decisions in the coming year, Abbe Land was sworn  in as mayor Monday.  </P> <P> Land, who easily won reelection last year to a four-year term on the City  Council, replaces Councilwoman Helen Albert in the largely ceremonial role as  mayor. The position is rotated annually among the five council members.  </P> <P> Councilman Paul Koretz, the newest member of the council who was elected last  year, was appointed mayor pro tem.  </P> <P> Land cited parking, a city transit study, a proposed garbage collection system  and expected budgetary constraints as among the difficult issues the city faces  in the coming year.  </P> <P> "This year, our fifth year (of cityhood), promises to be one in which we have a  lot of decisions regarding a lot of different things that we've been working on  for the last five years," she said.  </P> <P> Land, who has enjoyed support from the politically influential Coalition for  Economic Survival, a renters' rights group, was first elected to the council in  1986 to fill the unexpired term of former Mayor Valerie Terrigno, who resigned  after being convicted of embezzlement.  </P></p>

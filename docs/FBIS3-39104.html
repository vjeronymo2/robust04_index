But she stressed ministers had yet to find any evidence of  this.    Lady Chalker told the Lords at question time: "Officials are  continuing to investigate the allegations published in THE  INDEPENDENT (on January 24).    "We have no evidence that British mercenaries are fighting  for Azerbaijan or that British arms have been supplied to that  country."    She said Britain continued to support an international arms  embargo and could not condone the supply of arms or mercenaries  to either side.    "If there is any evidence of illegal activity, which I  believe this to be, it should be passed to the police  authorities for further investigation.    "I also believe there is a moral duty on British companies,  and we sincerely hope no one will supply either arms or  mercenaries to either side of this conflict or of any other."</p>

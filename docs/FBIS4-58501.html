			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 5 May, (MAP) -- Abdellatif Filali,  Moroccan minister of state for foreign affairs, has expressed  his belief that the signing of the final agreement on the  implementation of Palestinian self-rule signed in Cairo  yesterday is a good start toward finding a final solution to the  Palestinian issue.    However he said, in a statement to the MOROCCAN NEWS AGENCY  before leaving Cairo, that the agreement in itself is  insufficient and that it must be followed by other steps until a  comprehensive peace is achieved and the rest of the occupied  Arab territories are liberated. He added that the world is  waiting for a comprehensive solution to all the problems of the  Middle East.    Mr. Filali also said he hopes that what was agreed in Cairo  yesterday will be implemented because the rapid implementation  of the agreement will facilitate the resolution of the other  outstanding problems.

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION BLAMED FOR RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Kathleen Doheny's column "Your Body: It's a Mean Season for Breathing"  describes an increase in coughs and upper respiratory problems this summer.  Apparently, no one has determined the cause of this increase.  </P> <P> What environmental conditions are different this summer, as compared to  previous summers? The first thing that comes to mind is the state's incessant  aerial spraying of malathion and sugary bait. Although we were assured at one  time that malathion would not hurt us, the state has so far exceeded its  liberal standards for safety by continuing the sprayings beyond original  deadlines.  </P> <P> Is there a correlation between the sprayings and the increase in respiratory  infections (which include pneumonia)? Is the aerial spraying one of the factors  contributing to these infections?  </P> <P> PAMELA FORD  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

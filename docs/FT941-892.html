			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Sunrise approaches after long darkness: A tentative, consumer-led economic recovery is at last in sight in Japan There is, for the first time in many months, a cheerful holiday mood at Tokyo's Narita airport. Japanese tourists wearing flowery Hawaiian shirts mingle with the sober business suited crowds, testimony to a sharp rise in foreign holiday bookings this spring, to more than twice last year's level. Most of those holidays are being sold cheap, so travel agents are not much richer. Yet Narita's colourful tourists are among the growing number of indications in recent weeks that Japan is near the end of an economic downturn which began in mid-1991, the longest in the post-war years. Government forecasters are understandably reluctant to predict the timing of the upturn, since some of them rejoiced at signs of recovery this time last year, which only turned out to be the heralds of a double-dip recession. Yet many private sector forecasters, especially foreign ones, are confident that the recession, as defined by more than two consecutive quarters of decline, touched bottom in the final quarter of 1993. Then gross domestic product fell by 2.2 per cent compared with the same period in the previous year, producing full year growth of a mere 0.1 per cent, the worst figure since 1974. The mean private sector forecast is for a gentle rebound to 0.3 per cent growth this year, propelled by a rise in consumer spending, which is at last responding to the government's four economic pump-priming packages worth a total of Y45,000bn (Dollars 422bn) over the past 16 months. If the forecasts are right, this will be the first time since the war that Japan will have had a recovery led by a rise in domestic consumption alone, rather than higher industrial production in response to export demand. This means the upturn will be shallower than previous ones, says the head of a leading Japanese securities company. Yet nobody doubts, as Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, told a seminar this week, that the conditions for recovery are at long last in place. 'This is at least the end of the decline,' adds Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute. Whether it is the beginning of the upturn, however, is an open question, he says. The most important green shoot to look for is industrial output, because it represents around a third of economic activity. Production fell, on an annualised basis, for a record 28 months in a row until the latest count in January. But month-on-month, January picked up slightly from December and the Bank of Japan says it expects a strong recovery in the first quarter of this year. Mr Kagehide Kaku, the central bank's chief economist, says that if this forecast rebound in output does occur, he expects a general recovery in the early summer. On the strength of all this, corporate Japan is beginning to feel less gloomy about the future. Business confidence sank to the lowest recorded in this recession last November - minus 22.1 on a scale representing the percentage balance of pessimists and optimists, according to a quarterly survey by the Bank of Japan, but picked up slightly to minus 13.1 last month. A sign that companies are at last getting busier is a break in a four-month fall in the ratio of job offers to applicants. The number of jobs on offer per 100 people rose from 65 in December to 67 in January. Average corporate profits, now in their fourth year of decline, appear to be following a similar trajectory. They fell 21.6 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 1993, but showed they might be pulling out of the curve, with a smaller 6.2 per cent decline in the fourth quarter. Consumer demand is more vigorous. A new feature, not present in last spring's phantom upturn, is a strong recovery in housing starts, apparent since last summer. Much of this was fuelled by cheap lending from the government's Housing Loans Corporation - which provides 80 per cent of Japanese mortgages - a sign that the government's pump-priming packages are starting to take effect. This has fed through into a rise in consumer spending - up 0.7 per cent from the third to the final quarters of last year - as new home owners have started to equip their dwellings. Existing home owners have also started to spend more, as they relax after having paid off some debts built up during the late 1980s spending spree. For the first time, household personal debt fell in the year to December 1992, by Y1,000bn to Y340,500bn, according to S G Warburg Securities in Tokyo. The fact that consumer spending rose faster than wages in the final quarter of last year may indicate that the cautious Japanese have sufficient confidence to chip into their high savings rate, argues Mr Robert Feldman, director of economic research at Salomon Brothers Asia. 'The economy has shifted from neutral into first or second gear,' he believes. Yet, in the medium term, there is unlikely to be a return to the good old days. There is plenty of evidence that Japan's economy will drive out of this recession weaker than before. Most forecasters expect GDP growth to stabilise at 2 to 3 per cent annually for the rest of the decade, below the 4 per cent average for the 1980s. The big feature in Japan's reduced ability to grow is the heavy surplus industrial capacity inherited from over-investment in the 1980s and worsened by Japanese industry's switch to cheaper production sites overseas in the 1990s. This has strained Japan's tradition of lifetime employment, but not enough to let it slim capacity and costs on the scale of its US and European corporate competitors and hence improve its profitability in line with theirs. New capital investment in Japanese industry is falling sharply, down 13.2 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of last year, for the ninth three-month period in a row, but unemployment has only crept up a fraction, from 2.1 per cent in 1991, the first year of the recession, to 2.5 per cent last year. The jobless rate would double if corporate Japan fired all its surplus workforce, according to an estimate by the Keidanren business organisation. In short, Japanese industry has cut into the fat, but not the bone. Companies have, of course, had to restrain wage growth to be able to afford this high level of employment. The current annual national wage round will settle on a 3 per cent rise, the worst in nominal terms since the second world war. This is not as bad for consumers as it looks since inflation is much lower than the official rate of 1.3 per cent, because the government does not count discount stores, the fastest growing retail sector, in its calculations. Many analysts believe prices might even be falling at 1 per cent a year, though a recent rise in utility bills could change that. Wage growth will, in any event, continue to be constrained by high costs, fears the Bank of Japan. 'We are still straddled with a heavy adjustment burden,' warns Mr Mieno, the bank's governor. Another problem, which was not present in previous recoveries, is the risk of a credit squeeze. Banks are reluctant to lend more to companies until they have reduced the mountain of non-performing loans they acquired by lending too much on the back of over-valued property in the late 1980s. On present rates of write off, they need three to seven years - depending on the bank - to reduce bad debts to a manageable size, the finance ministry estimates. Japan's top 21 banks admit they have up to Y13,700bn in bad loans, though this is widely thought to be an underestimate. But even this official figure represents a bigger burden on Japan's economy than, relatively speaking, were the US banking system's debts at the depth of the American banking crisis. Japanese banks' bad debts represent 2.9 per cent of gross national product, as against the 1.8 per cent of US GNP represented by US banks' non-performing loans in mid-1991, according to the Bank of Japan. On balance, Japan's recovery is likely to be too tentative to produce the early increase in demand which would satisfy US government pressure for a significant fall in the record current account surplus. That will keep up the pressure on the yen which, at last week's closing rate of Y105 to the dollar, forces many companies in Japan's export-dependent economy into a loss. However, the yen is unlikely to show the startling rise in value which it did last year, one of the main reasons why that apparent recovery came to nothing. 'There is no doubt that we are at the bottom,' says Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at S G Warburg in Tokyo. 'But it may turn out to be a corrugated bottom, followed by a joyless recovery.'</p>

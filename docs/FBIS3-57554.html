He was referring to numerous victims of the 900-day blockade  of the city which was called Leningrad at the time. Some  historians say that over a million of city residents died of  hunger and cold during the siege.    "On this day I could not but stay together with  Leningraders.  50 years have passed from the day when heroic efforts of  soldiers and Leningraders rebuffed fascists from the city and  thus ended the long blockade of Leningrad", the president said.    "No other city has lived through the same tragic events in  its history which befell on the residents of the city on the  Neva River. The Leningrad battle can be compared to the battle  for Moscow and under Stalingrad, with the Kursk battle.  However, the ordeal which Leningraders had survived cannot be  compared to anything", Yeltsin said.    "Glory to war veterans who won this victory and eternal  memory to those who were killed", the Russian president said and  added that he, the government and the whole of Russia will  always honour those who had given their lives to secure the  great victory.</p>

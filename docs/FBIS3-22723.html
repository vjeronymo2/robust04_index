[quotation marks as received]    The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps head said, "Political  wisdom asks us not to go for weapons which could cause  devastation for humanity."    "Of course, we are for traditional weapons and that too just  for self-defense...and that's all," he said.    The eight-year Iraqi imposed war is proof of the real nature  of our combatants who never violated the internationally  recognized norms concerning war Major Gen. Reza'i recalled.    He was referring to the Iraqi forces who left no stone  unturned violating the basic tradition of war using chemical  bombs against both civilians and military personnel. The Iraqi  forces also frequently bombed purely civilians areas during  their 1980-88 imposed war.    "That Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons...is just  baseless rumor," Reza'i refuted.    Western media repeatedly say Iran will or has already  provided the necessary facilities to Communist North Korea for  testing missiles with ranges up to 1,000 kilometers. What is  Reza'i's explanation?    "No, a firm no," Major Gen. Reza'i told the TEHRAN TIMES in  an exclusive interview at his office.    "By now the entire world should know that Iran is very  sensitive as far as our soil and military facilities are  concerned and we will never allow others to use it...no matter  how friendly `others' are," he said referring to the friendly  ties with North Korea.    "As long as I'm talking about the real nature of the Islamic  combatants and the officials of the Islamic Republic, it will  not be out of place to mention the Russian requests which Iran  turned down without a second thought," Reza'i, 41, said.    "Despite our animosity and enmity against the United States  we rejected repeated requests from Moscow to deliver to them the  F-14 fighter plane and the wire-guided anti-tank missile, TOW,"  he said.    He disclosed that even the U.S. through various channels  tried to obtain a Soviet-made T-72 tank which we seized from the  Ba'thist forces during the Iraqi-imposed war.    The United States once more received 'a firm no' from the  Islamic Republic despite a number of tempting offers from the  Pentagon, he said.    Maj. Gen. Reza'i, head the IRGC for the last 13 years, comes  from Masjed Soleyman, Khuzestan Province.    In answer to another question, Reza'i said the Kuridish  problem in Iraq is under our observation and our forces are  ready to counter any sort of terrorist activities launched from  there.    Referring to the agreement signed by Iran and Turkey he  said,  "It has eased the situation."    He denounced Iraq for sending terrorists and taking undue  advantage from the present situation in the region underlining  the fact that that itself was a violation of the 1988 ceasefire  and against the traditional practice of friendly neighbors.    Reza'i is married with five children and currently studying  economics at the post-graduate level. He has a glorious record  of revolutionary activities against the now defunct Shah's  regime.    Commenting on the Persian Gulf he said, "The geographical  situation of the waterway is such that the deep water is on  Iran's side which enables the Islamic forces to keep alien  warships under observation."    Without going into details he said there was a plot  engineered by Britain, Israel and the United States designed to  keep regional tensions high.    "I think," he said, "the plot proved to be a mouse trap for  the United States.    "It's my view that no country should think that they can  take  undue advantage from the differences between Iran and another  Persian Gulf country," he warned.    He pointed out that the Iraqi regime made the same mistake  in  1980 and "we all know the consequences of that."    "I tell my friends in the UAE to listen to my advice as Iran  wants to continue friendly relations with all the shaykhdoms  there," Reza'i said.    The IRGC played a vital role during the Iraqi-imposed war  and  received compliments from the Leader of the world's deprived,  the late Imam Khomeyni.    Commenting on the post-war era Reza'i said the IRGC is busy  with extensive construction projects in the country. He said  IRGC personnel, popularly known in Iran as 'Sepahis,' are  constructing a major dam, Karkheh, in Khuzestan Province. For  the last two years, the Sepahis have been building the dam which  is 3 kilometers long, 150 meters high with a capacity of 7  billion cubic meters of water.    So far Rls. 600 billion have been spent on the project and  it  is estimated that Rls. 1 trillion will be spent before it is  completed.    The IRGC personnel are also working on the 100-kilometer  Tehran- Saveh highway to provide a natural gas supply network  for the nation.</p>

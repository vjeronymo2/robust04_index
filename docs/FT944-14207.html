			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Hong Kong - Other Markets The market is set to drift into another week of listless trading, marked by thin turnover, writes Louise Lucas. Investors will once again take their cues from overseas, with economic data coming from China and the US continuing to spook sentiment in the colony. At home, hints of a resolution to the financing of the new airport could be sufficient to spur the market upwards. In the absence of corporate news, and with the reporting season now effectively wrapped up, many share price movements have been driven by little more than rumours, and these are expected to persist. Futures are also likely to continue to be a driving force, following the pattern set last week. Last Friday the turnover on October futures was some two and a half times that on the cash market.

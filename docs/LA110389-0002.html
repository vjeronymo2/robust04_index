			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BAYFRONT PLAN UP TO PORT DISTRICT  </P> <P> The Centre City Planning Committee on Thursday approved a set of design  principles to guide development along San Diego's downtown bayfront by imposing  constraints on the size of buildings while attempting to preserve views and  create a 10-acre park at the foot of Broadway.  </P> <P> The key to the plan's success is the San Diego Unified Port District, which  controls about 80% of the land in question.  </P> <P> At a meeting Thursday afternoon, the Board of Port Commissioners indicated that  it generally supports the major elements of the plan and expects to vote on the  matter at its Dec. 5 meeting.  </P> <P> The city of San Diego, which appointed the Centre City Planning Committee, is  seeking a "memorandum of understanding" with the Port District to implement the  bayfront development plan.  </P> <P> Key points of the plan, created by the Broadway Complex Coordinating Committee,  include adoption of building setbacks to preserve views; closing Broadway to  allow construction of a 10-acre public square on land owned by the Navy and the  Port District; payment to the Navy for use of the land and a link between  Balboa Park and the bay via 5th and 6th avenues.

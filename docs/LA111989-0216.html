			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOAT PILOT LEFT HELM, SAY CRASH INVESTIGATORS  </P> <P> The pilot of a sportfishing boat had gone below deck and left no one at the  helm just before a collision with a 564-foot tanker outside Los Angeles Harbor  late Thursday night, Coast Guard officials said Saturday.  </P> <P> Coast Guard Cmdr. Chris Desmond said 2nd Mate Tim Filson of the fishing boat  Shogun was primarily to blame for the crash with the tanker Sealift Antarctic.  He said Filson may have his operating license suspended.  </P> <P> The Coast Guard spokesman said Filson, 25, broke one of the "basic rules of  navigation" by failing to keep a proper lookout before the crash, which injured  seven people and spilled 2,000 gallons of jet fuel at the mouth of the harbor.  </P> <P> But Desmond, head of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in Long Beach, said  that both vessels were to blame and that Capt. Arthur Irish of the Antarctic  could also have his license suspended for failing to give way to the smaller  vessel. Desmond said the fishing boat had the right of way at the time of the  crash.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Borisevich under the "Nonpayments and </F> Family Budget" rubric: "Not Only Is There No Money To Live On,  There Is None for Funerals Either"]    [Text] All through the last few months, Vorkuta has been  living in a strike regime. The strike at the "Severnaya" pit  ends, another one begins at the "Komsomolskaya." "Yur-Shor"  miners come up to the surface, mine constructors refuse to leave  the coal face. A hunger strike ends in one place and begins in  another. The center of tension swings like a pendulum. But it  can be used like a compass to follow who has been given money  and who has not. Money is usually given after a strike --  especially a hunger strike.    Money. This is the leash with which the government keeps  Vorkuta in check, by relaxing or tightening it. But this is for  the time being. Only recently the miners were demanding only  money. Now, they are coming out with political slogans. In  time everything is possible, even including acts of sabotage.  Threats have already been made.    All pits are state-owned. The debtors are, therefore, well  known. The Russian Government is not allocating subsidies and  is not setting aside money for the social sphere. Consumers --  Cherepovets, Lipetsk, and Moscow -- are not paying for shipped  coal. There are also factors which are purely Vorkuta's  miscalculations: unprofitable barter, high cost price,  financial defects. Pits have no money -- there will not be any  in the budget either. Therefore, the picture is very confused.  Sorting it out is as difficult as working out what people who  have not received wages since last December are living on.    While strikes are "paying off" for the miners, after which  they are paid either an advance of 100,000-200,000 rubles [R]  each or else their full wage, the situation in the social sphere  is much worse. The coal sector has on its balance sheet  two-thirds of Vorkuta's housing, almost 70 kindergartens, and  other social facilities. All these economic activities require  R40 billion per month, which should be financed from the Russian  budget under a separate heading. Since the beginning of the  year not a penny has gone to Vorkuta under this heading. Mainly  women work in the social sphere. All well and good if some of  them have husbands who are miners. The rest are simply doomed.    Women's movement activists have recounted how they went  around visiting families on a holiday. One family had only  toast on the table, and when the women started treating the  children to candy the mother's nerves snapped and she became  hysterical.    Announced and unannounced hunger strikes, unemployment, the  abolition of benefits for medicines for children and pensioners  -- all this is Vorkuta today. All it needs is a small push and  an explosion will be inevitable.    A school principal relates: "The last time I received money  was in January. It was R25,000." "How are you surviving?" "At  first we ate our reserves, now we are eating only groats and we  have had to sell some things from our home."    Here is the testimony of A. Stepanov, chairman of the  Council  of Vorkuta Directors: "Not only is there no money to live on,  there is none for funerals either. We are all hostages."    The natural question arises: "How much high-energy Vorkuta  coal does Russia need? For what quantity of it will Russia  guarantee payment? Judging by the draft budget, the sector will  receive one-half of the funds it is demanding. This means that  the financial reorganization [sanatsiya] of pits is inevitable.  For example, the program to close the "Khalmer-Yu" pit in  Vorkuta has now been costed out. Its production capacity is  410,000 tonnes a year and it has around 2,000 employees.  Expenditure on closing the pit and social welfare for its  workers is in excess of R43 billion. This is only for one,  which is by no means the biggest pit.    Both the development of the Pechora coal basin and its  mothballing are equally heavy burdens for the budget. But  enough time has already been spent standing at the crossroads.</p>

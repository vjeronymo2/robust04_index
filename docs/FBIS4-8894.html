			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvornik, April 18 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem offensive  on Serb positions continued in all fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  as did the attacks from Gorazde despite the agreement on the  immediate ceasefire in this Moslem enclave which came into force  on Sunday at 5:00 P.M. local time.    Bosnian Serb military sources said on Monday that the  strongest Moslem actions were in the region of Doboj, Teslic,  Gradacac and Mts. Trebava and Ozren (northern Bosnia) and in the  region of Vlasic, Komar and Srbobran (central Bosnia).    Serb-held Doboj is under continual Moslem artillery shelling  which wounded three civilians during Sunday night.    The continuation of the Moslem offensive on the Bosnian Serb  republic (RS) is an attempt to provoke a Serb response, blame  them for the attacks and thus cause new NATO air strikes, the  Bosnian Serb military sources said.    They warned that the Serb troops would use their legitimate  right to self-defence and respond to all attacks by using all  means.    The sources recalled that the Serb side continually urges a  ceasefire in the entire Bosnian territory and the application of  political means, rather than war, to search for solutions, but  that the Moslem leadership persistently refuses this.    According to the Bosnian Serb military sources, fresh troops  of the regular Croatian Army are massing along the left bank of  the Sava river, towards Posavina (northern RS).    The Croatian artillery is shelling Serb positions, also  under  attack by the Moslems from the south, with the aim of severing  the corridor through Posavina which links the eastern and  western parts of RS.    In the region of Sarajevo, the Moslems are continuing  provocations and engineering work close to the Serb positions,  all before the very eyes of the U.N. troops, the Bosnian Serb  military sources said.    The sources describe as inadmissible the recent withdrawal  of  UNPROFOR from their positions in the Bjelasnica and Igman  mountains, near Sarajevo, which the Serbs handed over to the  peacekeepers last spring.    Since the Moslem troops siezed the U.N. positions after  their  pullout, it has become clear that in question is a joint  synchronized action, the Bosnian Serb sources pointed out.    They said that the U.N. Protection Force is not stopping the  Moslems from using a tunnel beneath the Sarajevo airport to  leave the city for Hrasnica and Mt. Igman.    The aim of these operations, in which the U.N. troops are  taking part, either directly or indirectly, is to try to link  the Moslem forces with the Gorazde region via Rogoj, central  Bosnia.</p>

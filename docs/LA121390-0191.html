			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEYOND DO-RE-MI;  </P> <P> LESSONS IN CONFIDENCE, GROWING UP AND HOLIDAY ENTERTAINMENT  </P> <P> Mark Henson graduated from high school 11 years ago, but he still hangs out  with a pretty young crowd.  </P> <P> A professional singer and voice instructor, the 28-year-old Henson directs the  Young Entertainers, a nonprofit, North Orange County song-and-dance troupe of  28 high school students. The youths, who receive free weekly vocal and movement  training from Henson and other professionals, will present their annual holiday  concert "Winter Winds" tonight through Saturday at Brea's Curtis Theatre.  </P> <P> Henson and his kids have literally grown up together. A 1980 graduate of  Fullerton's Troy High School, he said he was dissatisfied with the "dwindling"  music programs in his district and began looking for ways to give high  schoolers ongoing training and performance opportunities. In 1981, at the age  of 19, he enlisted the aid of former classmates and district music instructors  and founded what would ultimately become the Young Entertainers.  </P> <P> There were few public performances in those early years, but encouraged by high  marks at two high school choral competitions, the Fullerton College Jazz  Festival and San Diego's Tops in Pops event, the group continued to grow.  Public interest grew as well, said Henson, and the group now entertains  regularly at everything from civic festivals to corporate parties. The  Christmas show is the group's seventh annual at the Curtis Theatre; its members  also present a spring variety show there each year.  </P> <P> "Winter Winds" will feature 16 members of the troupe performing traditional and  contemporary holiday tunes ranging from "Carol of the Bells" to "Grandma Got  Run Over by a Reindeer." The finale includes a Christmas medley capped off by a  30-second song sampler -- snatches of eight popular tunes sung in quick  succession.  </P> <P> The chance for teen-agers to work together as entertainers and perform for the  public is "such an important part of the whole growing-up thing," Henson said.  "It builds relationships. All of these kids come from different economic and  family backgrounds, but they share a common love of performing." Participation  in the group is open to any county resident between the ages of 14 and 18. Each  week during the school year, the students meet with Henson and his three-member  staff at Placentia High School. Vocal coach Jo Monteleone and Henson help them  polish their singing skills while Kimberley Hahn, a regular choreographer of  Disneyland shows and parades, and Dede Madrigal, owner of a private dance  studio in Fullerton, lead them in movement exercises and dance routines. The  performers are also offered hands-on industry experience. Each year they cut a  demonstration tape in a professional recording studio, and they have taped  cable television specials and a promotional video for the Boy Scouts of  America's National Exploring Program.  </P> <P> The Young Entertainers pay nothing for their training. Instead, the group  covers most of its costs through ticket and program sales at its two annual  concerts, booking fees for private parties and small donations by local  businesses and individuals.  </P> <P> While many graduates of the group do go on to study the performing arts in  college or land jobs as entertainers, the program's real lessons go far beyond  do-re-mi, Henson said.  </P> <P> "Not all of these kids aspire to be professionals," he noted. "This is a  terrific forum for social development, in that they have to represent  themselves in a variety of situations and to a variety of people. It's a real  confidence-builder."  </P></p>

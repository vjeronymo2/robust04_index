			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Worries Over Tax Take"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, June 8 -- The fall in the tax take  in the first few months of the year is currently the most  worrying aspect of Italy's public finances as far as the  European Union [EU] is concerned, the head of the European  Commission's economic services Giovanni Ravasio said here today.    "The situation isn't easy to assess," he added on the eve of  a visit to Rome during which he will meet the Berlusconi  government's economics ministers as part of the multilateral  European surveillance being applied to the Italian accounts  under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty.    According to Ravasio, current thinking at Commission  headquarters is that the Italian taxation system must be put  into order, a topic that he said will be on the agenda during  the EU summit on the island of Corfu at the end of the month.    "When a system is too complicated, it's unlikely to be  efficient," he said, pointing out that far more taxes are levied  on the Italians than on their counterparts in other EU nations.  The complexity of the system also holds down the size of the  tax take, he asserted.    Ravasio pointed out that the International Monetary Fund had  also given Italy the same advice, adding that Treasury Minister  Lamberto Dini seems "very active" on this front too.    Ravasio's mission is not linked to granting Italy the third  ECU2 billion tranche of an EU loan granted to the Amato  government to help tide over the public finance crisis.    "The Italian Government has still taken no decision on the  issue, and no request has yet been received for the third  tranche," he said.    The EU finance ministers are given the job of monitoring the  European economies under the Maastrict Treaty to check whether  they are making progress towards their convergence targets.  Achieving them should culminate in turning the ECU into  Europe's single currency.    "The objective is to reach the end of 1996 with a majority  of  the countries ready to adopt a single currency in 1997," said  Ravasio. "The Commission's latest studies seem to show that this  is not impossible."</p>

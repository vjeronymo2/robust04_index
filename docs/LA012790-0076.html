			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 MEXICANS MAY SUE SHERIFF, JUDGE RULES  </P> <P> A Los Angeles federal judge ruled Friday that five Mexicans whose civil rights  were found to have been violated by San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies  may seek damages against Sheriff Floyd Tidwell.  </P> <P> Moreover, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima said Tidwell can be held  personally liable for the damages if the jury determines that he has  perpetuated a policy of misconduct among his deputies.  </P> <P> The claims of the men against Tidwell and the county will be pursued in the  second phase of a civil trial that is to begin March 1. Three of the men were  awarded $956,000 in the first phase of their multimillion-dollar police  brutality suit against the five deputies who allegedly brutally beat them in a  racially motivated incident in Victorville on June 30, 1988. The incident began  when deputies responded to a complaint of a loud, drunken party.  </P></p>

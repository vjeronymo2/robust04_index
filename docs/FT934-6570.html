			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Dublin will not drop Ulster claim, Unionist leader warns Mr James Molyneaux dealt a serious blow to the Major-Reynolds peace initiative last night, warning that efforts to persuade Dublin to drop its territorial claim over Northern Ireland were probably doomed. But the Ulster Unionist party leader coupled his remarks with a surprisingly upbeat assessment of the prospects for agreeing a form of devolved government for the province. Downing Street welcomed Mr Molyneaux's support for efforts to agree on government structures for Ulster and said his criticism of the Major-Reynolds initiative was 'understandable'. Its discussions with the Irish government would continue. Mr Molyneaux's strongly worded Commons statement, which cast a further pall over next month's planned Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin, came as Mr John Major signalled his determination to test the IRA's willingness to agree to end its use of violence for good. Mr Major also gave his first public acknowledgment of 'suggestions' that the IRA may be considering an end to violence. Intelligence reports seen by Mr Major, who will today meet Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, have supported the view that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, may be ready to call a halt to the violence. Under the gaze of Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, Mr Molyneaux said London and Dublin appeared to have made 'no progress whatever' in their talks on Dublin's territorial claim over the province. He said there was no reason to question the judgment of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that he would be defeated if he submitted the claim to a referendum in the republic. 'Nor should anyone assume that the approval of his electorate would be given in return for a British surrender to the demands of Mr Adams.' He went on: 'The disastrous juxtaposition of discussions on political progress with the price demanded by the IRA in return for a halt to murder means in effect that Her Majesty's government is being required to do a deal, not with Mr Reynolds, but with Mr Adams.' Dublin, he said, 'is merely the conduit'. Later, he appeared to call for London and Dublin to halt their talks, saying there was a connection between Mr Adams' plans and last week's leaked Dublin draft position paper. But Mr Molyneaux said he was confident a plan for a 'durable accountable democracy' could be accepted, just as it was 'widely agreed' during last year's failed talks involving the province's four non-violent political parties. The government's efforts to secure agreement on a devolved government for the province could supply 'the essential ingredient which will stabilise a dangerously volatile situation'.</p>

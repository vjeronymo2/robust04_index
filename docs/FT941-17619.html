			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Losses can go forward I have noted the Budget proposal to remove the indexation of capital losses, with immediate effect, but I have not spotted any mention of change to the carrying forward of previous losses. For the past two years I have, with the Revenue's agreement, carried forward losses for use against future gains and, to date, have not used them up against gains during the present tax year. May I continue to do this? Second, I have an enhanced scrip dividend and have read a number of different explanations as to how it should be declared to the Revenue. The Budget proposals affect only (a) actual or deemed disposals after November 29 and (b) deemed disposals before Budget day which result from negligible-value claims made after November 29. Your allowable losses which arose in earlier years are unaffected, as are any allowable losses which arose before Budget day in the present tax year. In view of your remark about 'the agreement of the Revenue,' perhaps we should point out there is no procedure for the agreement of allowable losses until after the end of the tax year in which potentially taxable gains arise against which the old losses are to be set. The courts have confirmed that any informal agreement of potentially allowable losses, in anticipation of the realisation of subsequent chargeable gains, is not binding on a tax inspector. You should, therefore, retain all the papers needed to prove the amounts of past years' allowable losses, at least until they have been deducted in future years' assessments. Regarding the enhanced scrip dividend: it should be declared twice on your tax return. First, it has to be declared as deemed income equal to 125 per cent of the market value. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, for example, you will be charged to income tax at the rate of 20 per cent on 125 per cent of the market value. Second, the dividend has to be declared in the capital gains section. The sale of the scrip is treated broadly as if it were a sale of a fully-paid rights issue (taken up at a cost equal to the market value) by virtue of section 141 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. This means that it must be related back to the shareholding from which it arose, and the calculation will depend upon whether, for example, some or all of your existing shares were acquired (or deemed to have been acquired) before April 6 1982. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares) and CGT16 (Indexation allowance: disposals after April 5 1988). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

Gen. Leonid Mayorov, has sent a  letter to Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs in which he  expressed his concern about the repeated attempts to evict  servicemen of the Russian Army from their flats and about the  ultimatum form of such actions. The commander wrote that this  behaviour was typical especially of the heads of the Vidzei  suburban territory and the Kurzem District of Riga. They had  sent notices about the necessity of leaving their flats to  several Russian officers and generals, including Anatoliy  Gaponov, deputy commander of the North-Western Group of troops,  and Anatoliy Vodopyanov, assistant commander.    The commander of the North-Western Group troops reminds the  prime minister that the flats of Russian servicemen belong to  the housing resources of the Russian Defence Ministry, and that  their further use is a subject of inter-state negotiations  between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Latvia. In  his letter the commander points out that unilateral actions,  more so the use of force, by local authorities may again  exacerbate the situation with regard to the temporary presence  of the Russian troops in Latvia.</p>

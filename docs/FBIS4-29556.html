			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Crafty Trick To Conceal Nuclear </F> Armament"]    [Text] The Japanese authorities are running amok with  reckless commotion over our nuclear developments. We know this  because they have turned up in the forefront of the U.S.  anti-Republic international cooperative system.    While spreading a groundless rumor that we have manufactured  nuclear weapons, the Japanese reactionaries are not only raving  that international pressure and sanctions should be imposed on  us but are also making absurd remarks that our nuclear  development poses a threat to Japan's security. This is indeed  ridiculous.    Moreover, the Japanese reactionaries are scheming to isolate  us at the van of others by putting forward gibberish about  international cooperative systems and so forth in international  conferences, including the United Nations.    By keeping in mind certain sanctions against our Republic,  the Japanese authorities are accelerating the formulation of  legislative measures in a bid to establish a war system, such as  the emergency law, and are even raving about a marine blockade.    This is an undisguised disclosure of the Japanese  reactionaries' will to join the war to invade Korea by following  the United States in an emergency.    The Japanese reactionaries, who are busily running wild  joining the maneuvers of the United States and the South Korean  puppets to crush our Republic, are spreading preposterous and  groundless rumors and false reports about our Republic. This  strengthens the oppression of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan and Koreans living in Japan. This is a grave  challenge to our Republic, an independent sovereign state, and  is the greatest infringement on human rights. In addition, this  is an act of illegal and unjust political suppression and is a  criminal act of excluding other nations.    Today the Japanese reactionaries are attempting to conceal  the development of their nuclear weapons by adhering to crafty  tactics on the pretext of our nonexistent nuclear development.    As has been exposed, Japan accelerated on a full scale the  nuclear weapons development beginning in the fifties. As a  result, Japan has secured all material and technological  foundations that enable it to manufacture nuclear weapons. With  Japan's nuclear armament being pushed ahead, worldwide vigilance  is becoming more keen and voices of denunciation are resounding  more highly.    All flowery words uttered today by the Japanese authorities  about the peaceful use of plutonium, the three principles for  denuclearization, and so forth, are false. The Japanese  reactionaries needed excuses for legalizing their nuclear  armament. Our nuclear development, fabricated by them, is one of  such excuses.    Today, the Japanese authorities, shamelessly enough, are  actively accelerating their nuclear armament under a deceitful  signboard by laying a blame on our side.    The recently-exposed incident of concealment of plutonium  capable of manufacturing nine nuclear bombs is an incident of  plutonium concealment carried out under tacit approval of the  International Atomic Energy Agency, which is applying double  standards in the nuclear issue, according to instructions of the  United States. This is an actual example of Japan's accelerating  its nuclear armament.    What is grave is the fact that no one knows how much  plutonium Japan, which was branded a flagrant offender, has  systematically concealed for scores of years during which it  kept operating nuclear facilities.    Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities, shamelessly enough,  made provoking remarks while laying the blame on us for our  so-called nuclear development issue, claiming that a resolute  attitude of international community is necessary, Japan's  cooperation for sanctions when a resolution is adopted in the  United Nations is quite natural, and so forth. This is a crafty  tactic to prevent plutonium, which Japan has systematically  concealed, from being exposed any more by diverting the people's  attention to us.    The Japanese authorities, who accelerated nuclear armament  by  laying the blame on us, have now been officially recognized by  the world as nuclear maniacs. Reality shows that nuclear threat  comes to us from Japan, not from us to Japan.    Today the Japanese reactionaries are openly spreading  remarks  that the use of nuclear weapons is not a violation of  international laws. This is indeed alarming. The Japanese  reactionaries' hostile act against our Republic has reached an  extreme pitch in collusion with the United States and the South  Korean puppets.    If one attempts to gain and increase one's popularity by  sacrificing others, such benefit and popularity will work as a  gimlet piercing one's own eye. The Japanese reactionaries should  precisely realize this. The more blame Japan lays on us, the  more clearly will our innocence be proven, and the more clearly  will Japan's dark and shameless intentions be exposed to the  world.    We have already clearly stated that if Japan joins in any  sanctions against us, whether by taking the lead or being  dragged in, we will regard this as a declaration of war. If  Japan turns up on the path of sanctions, at last while  accelerating nuclear armament defying our warnings, Japan can  never evade due punishment for this.    Japan should clearly realize the firm will and determination  of our people, who dislike empty words, and should immediately  stop its catastrophic maneuvers to become a big nuclear power  and reckless commotions over sanctions.</p>

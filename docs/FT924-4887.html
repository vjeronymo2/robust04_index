			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Accounting Just as the UK market is getting accustomed to adjusting reported profits for pension costs, a new item has started to muddy the figures. The new method of accounting for the cost of providing post-retirement medical care to US employees knocked Pounds 4m off Tate &amp; Lyle's full-year profits. It will also take a Pounds 52m bite out of the balance sheet. Tate is merely falling into line with the latest guidance from the UK accounting standards setters that such benefits should be treated in the same way as pension costs. That means an actuarial stab at the future cost of providing health care and smoothing the charge over the average working life of employees. In Tate &amp; Lyle's case the new method doubled the annual charge against profits. For companies with a bigger or older US workforce, the damage will be worse. If the actuarial sums are correct, of course, the cash cost should eventually catch up with the accounting charge. Estimating future medical costs makes pension arithmetic look like an exact science. Making assumptions about the rate at which retired employees fall ill, and the cost of medical treatment by the time they do, is little more than guess work. This could be a case, though, where a new method of bean-counting prompts overdue action. Tate is already looking for ways to reduce its post-retirement obligations. Some US companies are taking a more draconian approach. Unisys, for example, has said it will stop contributing at all from 1996 rather than take a Dollars 100m annual charge and a Dollars 700m write-off. If the accountants help bring about reform of the US health care system, so much the better.</p>

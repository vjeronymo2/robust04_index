			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Remy Cointreau Hermes International's forecast of a 21 per cent profit gain for 1993 and Remy Cointreau's 24 per cent increase in interim net profits suggests the French have kept their taste for the finer things in life, despite recession. But that does not reflect the whole picture. The premium drinks company has continued to face tough markets in northern Europe and Japan and showed a more modest 9 per cent improvement at the operating level. Remy has done well to win market share and has even started to reverse Cointreau's dispiriting 10-year sales decline. But it was good export gains in south-east Asia that chiefly enabled Remy to move forward. Remy's patience in creating a strong distribution network in China is reaping rewards and the company is now well-placed to push additional brands. The other good news is that the champagne cycle seems to have bottomed, with grape prices having fallen to FFr20.5 per kilo from FFr32 three years ago. Due to the lags in the cycle, champagne producers are still suffering from expensive grapes and cheap selling prices. But both cycles should now start unwinding themselves, leading to a fair margin recovery by 1997.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed have expressed a  strong desire to improve bilateral trade and economic  cooperation.    The two prime ministers said this in a recent exchange of  letters to mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of  diplomatic relations by China and Malaysia, Foreign Ministry  sources said today.    Premier Li said that the cooperation between China and  Malaysia had made rapid progress on the basis of the five  principles of coexistence since the establishment of diplomatic  ties on May 31, 1974.    Li said that Mahathir's three visits to China in recent  years  had served to promote bilateral understanding and mutual trust,  and that the good relations between the two countries would  benefit their peoples and be conducive to promoting regional  peace, stability and prosperity.    Meanwhile, Prime Minister Mahathir said in his letter that  the development of the good relations between Malaysia and China  was due to the Chinese leaders being pragmatic and favoring  openness.    He said that China's policy of good neighborliness had  allowed bilateral relations to develop rapidly. He also  expressed the belief that the two countries would widen their  cooperation not only in the fields of the economy, trade and  investment but also in tourism, cultural exchange and  people-to-people contact.    Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his Malaysian  counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi also exchanged letters marking  the 20th anniversary of the opening of formal relations.</p>

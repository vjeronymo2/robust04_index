			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / EC's plan for milk subsidy cut likely to turn sour THE European Commission, no stranger to controversy, is set to walk into a storm of hostility when it proposes next week to cut sharply an expensive subsidy on milk for 31m EC schoolchildren. There is still some dispute about the size of the proposed cut. But it is likely that Brussels will be lined up in popular demonology with the likes of former UK prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher - who as education secretary in the early 1970s earned the sobriquet of 'milk-snatcher' for cutting free school milk - especially as Britain's current Conservative government is unhappy about the measure. The cut will be debated by EC agriculture ministers on Tuesday. According to UK officials the Commission is proposing to halve the subsidy, risking the continuity of a scheme taken up by local authorities across Europe, particularly in the UK. Only the Dutch are happy to sanction the cut, with France prepared to consider it. Germany and the Mediterranean countries are determined the subsidy will not be touched. The UK is somewhere in the middle, wanting both savings for the EC budget and to avoid bad publicity. Last year the EC laid out Ecu236m (Pounds 180.77m) on the subsidy, according to figures from the Commission, which originally proposed to cut outlays back to Ecu109m by next year. Officials now say the cut will be significantly less, to Ecu176m. Across the EC, 143,000 schools get the subsidy for 31m children; in the UK 31,000 schools with some 8m children receive it. The subsidy was originally financed through the revenue from penalties levied on milk producers for exceeding the production quotas fixed by the EC. These levies were abolished by last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), under which Ecu4.4bn was spent on the dairy sector in 1992. With the CAP budget now strained to its near-Ecu36bn limit, the Commission and the EC are looking for cuts, especially as bills mount to buy off producer interests unhappy with the production, export and price cuts required by the CAP reform and as part of the Uruguay Round trade talks.</p>

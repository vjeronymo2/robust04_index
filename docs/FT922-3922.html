			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Letter: To lend more than 100 per cent of property value is dangerous Sir, Your leader, 'The next step in housing' (June 2), seemed to suggest that in order to tackle the 'negative equity' problem, mortgage lenders should be allowed to advance more than 100 per cent of a property's value to stimulate a recovery in the housing market. This is dangerous talk. Surely you are not suggesting that we should rely on building societies to lend their way out of the housing slump? Mortgage lenders are already suffering the effects of lending a high proportion - often 95 or 100 per cent - of the valuation on a prospective home. Indeed, it was this practice that led to the negative equity problem in the first place. If anything, mortgage lenders will now be forced into more prudent lending patterns because of intense financial pressure. Cuts in interest rates, and concessionary deals to allow those in mortgage arrears to pay lower rates, are putting pressure on the savings end of the operation. If the outflow of savings from building societies continues, and funds on the wholesale money markets prove more expensive as lenders see their credit ratings downgraded as a result of provision for bad debt, we will see a credit crunch rather than the expansion of lending you rashly suggest. Also on June 2 ('Lenders will defend record'), in your coverage of the meeting between the lenders and the government on mortgage rescue schemes, you pointed out that 275,000 households are currently in long term mortgage arrears. You then suggested that, since repossessions had been contained at about 75,000 last year, 200,000 of these people had therefore been 'saved' from repossession. Nothing could be further from the truth. Virtually no one has been saved through the complex rescue schemes devised with housing associations. Lenders are containing the problem by accepting lower repayments and by sitting on a lot of bad debt. When the upturn finally comes, these people will be the most vulnerable to repossession.

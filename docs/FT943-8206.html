			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rosebys ahead by 8% Rosebys, the household textiles and soft furnishings retailer, yesterday announced an 8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in its less favourable first half. On turnover ahead 11 per cent to Pounds 24m (Pounds 21.6m) and after a Pounds 75,000 charge as compensation for loss of office, pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 improved to Pounds 738,000, against Pounds 681,000. Mr Roy Waudby, chairman, said, however, that trading continued to reflect a 'patchy' economic recovery. Sales growth was attributable to new store openings in the last 12 months. The interim dividend is 1.5p (1.4p), from earnings of 2.4p (2.3p).</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Prevent costly mistakes - Expatriates EXPATRIATES are generally viewed as people who earn more and save more than their stay-at-home compatriots. And that is often true. But expatriates tend to work hard as well. Perhaps one result of this is that some fail to give sufficient time to their own finances. Whatever the reason, expatriate finance specialists regularly see evidence of the same mistakes being repeated. For a prosperous 1993 - and beyond - check that you are avoiding the following slips: Overlooking the different residence status of spouses. For example: wives often become UK tax residents by visiting the country when accommodation is available for their occupation (unless they have full-time jobs in which all the duties are performed overseas). Such a status could result in UK tax liability on overseas income and gains (including half shares of joint holdings). But it can give rise to opportunities too, for example the ability to invest in personal equity plans. Failing to appreciate that accepting a UK directorship can give rise to similar results, even in the case of those who are in full time work. However, liability to tax on an overseas salary is prevented by the operation of the 'foreign earnings deduction'. Aircrew, couriers and others who perform 'duties of substance' in the UK are similarly at risk. Assuming that UK interest paid to you without deduction of tax is tax exempt. Payment gross is an administrative procedure which does not apply in broken tax years, those of departure or return to the UK. Ceasing to pay UK National Insurance contributions on going overseas. In most cases, this is a mistake. Voluntary Class 3 contributions, costing Pounds 263 per annum, can give rise to an effectively index-linked pension of Pounds 2,815 per year plus, in the case of a married man, a further Pounds 1,962 pa for his non-contributing wife. Supposing that inheritance tax does not apply to assets earned and situated overseas? This treatment is only available to those who are not domiciled in the countries which make up the UK, as a result of having left Britain permanently. Overlooking local testamentary considerations when acquiring real estate abroad. Often it will be desirable to make a will in the country concerned. Even more importantly, you may find that local laws restrict your freedom to decide the disposition of assets on your death. Assuming that a UK property acquired after the date of your original departure from the UK, will qualify as your principal private residence for CGT purposes, purely because it is the only property you own. For there to be any possibility of such qualification, you or your spouse would need to live in it for, say, three months after acquisition and also to resume residence there when your period overseas has ended. Convincing yourself that 'no-one will know' is a suitable basis for tax planning. Skeletons in cupboards have a habit of rattling at awkward moments. Assuming that complex solutions are inevitably superior to straightforward ones. Before investing in insurance-linked arrangements, ask yourself whether a direct investment will suffice. Before effecting a trust, ask if it is essential. Both types of vehicle have important parts to play in the field of tax planning. But both are frequently unnecessary. Remember that 'complex' is usually synonymous with 'expensive'. Entering into long-term investment arrangements against a background of future uncertainty. How many people would answer in the affirmative the question, 'Is it a good idea to take on a ten year investment commitment when you have job security for only three years?' But expatriates frequently do it. Attaching undue weight to the taxation treatment of any investment plan. Taxation is important. But the most brilliant tax shelter ever devised can be of little value if the investment fails to perform. The watchwords should be, investment performance first, taxation treatment second. Overlooking the inflexibility inherent in the surrender penalties attaching to some investment arrangements. If initial charges are replaced by early surrender penalties, well and good. But such penalties sometimes last for five to seven years or longer. If, even with the lower initial charges, your investment fails to perform, you may find yourself effectively 'locked in'. Failing to plan your return to the UK in good time. Happily, after years of urging by expatriate commentators - myself among them - this is much less in evidence. However, cases still arise of expatriates who spend 25 years abroad but leave themselves only 25 days to organise their return. Donald Elkin is a Director of Wilfred T.

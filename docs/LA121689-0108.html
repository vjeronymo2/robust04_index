			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAAB PURCHASE GIVES GM ENTRY TO EUROPEAN MARKET  </P> <P> General Motors, outbid by Ford last month in a heated competition for Jaguar of  Britain, finally got its own piece of the upscale European market Friday, when  it agreed to buy working control of Saab's troubled automotive operations for  $600 million.  </P> <P> Saab-Scania of Sweden, facing mounting losses in its car business and desperate  to link up with a global car maker in order to remain competitive in the 1990s,  agreed to turn over working control of its worldwide auto business to GM.  </P> <P> Saab-Scania and GM will establish a 50-50 joint venture to run Saab's auto  operations, with GM appointing the joint venture's chairman. Saab-Scania's  other businesses, including its aircraft, defense and truck businesses, will  remain independent of the joint venture.  </P> <P> GM, which is facing a shortage of car-making capacity in Europe because of the  booming car market there, said it will quickly begin to build some of its Opel  cars in Saab's under-utilized Swedish assembly plants. GM's European operations  may also work with Saab in the future to jointly develop new luxury cars for  the European market.  </P> <P> But GM officials said Saab's cars will continue to be sold in the United States  under the Saab nameplate. GM has no plans to distribute any Saab cars through  its dealerships here.  </P> <P> The Saab-GM deal is just the latest sign of a worldwide consolidation in the  auto industry, which has prompted a wave of acquisitions of small European  companies by Detroit's Big Three.  </P> <P> Now, Ford owns Jaguar and Aston Martin, Chrysler has Lamborghini, and GM, in  addition to its new stake in Saab, owns Lotus.  </P> <P> The Saab agreement apparently came together quickly in the last few days, with  GM anxious to gain a presence in the European luxury market and Saab officials  frantic to gain access to a company with deep pockets and a large technological  base.  </P> <P> "Only by launching far-reaching cooperation on an international basis is it  possible for Saab-Scania to further develop its operations," Saab-Scania  President George Karnsund conceded. "Soaring costs for research and development  and ever-increasing international competition make it difficult for small  volume makers to survive on their own." So, after being spurned by Ford earlier  this fall, Saab turned to GM.  </P> <P> GM officials said Saab first approached GM about some form of cooperative  relationship three months ago, but others knowledgeable about the agreement  said the deal was hammered out in just the last 10 days, pushed in part by GM  Chairman Roger Smith's desire to garner some positive news coverage for GM,  which has been taking a beating in the press for its disastrously declining  American car sales.  </P> <P> "Roger Smith just wanted some good news," said one observer who was familiar  with the negotiations.  </P> <P> GM spokesman Ronald Theis acknowledged that intensive talks with Saab did not  begin until GM was thwarted in its bid for Jaguar in November. "Things moved  fast," Theis said. "Certainly the intensive negotiations started after Ford  bought Jaguar and Ford stopped talking to Saab."  </P> <P> But some analysts questioned whether GM should have invested in Saab, a company  with little to offer for the future. Saab has virtually nothing in the pipeline  in the way of new products for the 1990s, analysts say.  </P> <P> Also, the company is under strain from the heavy costs of modernizing its  operations. Saab blames the expense of adding new Swedish factories -- an  assembly plant in Malmo and an engine facility in Sodertalje -- for the  $188-million loss suffered by Saab's car operations during the first eight  months of 1989.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Saab's aging car lineup -- limited to just the Saab 900 and 9000  series -- is now losing its luster among young professionals, who had been  Saab's prime customers in the United States. Through mid-December, Saab has  sold just over 30,000 cars in the U.S. market in 1989; as recently as 1987, it  sold nearly 45,000 a year here.  </P> <P> Still, other analysts argued that the $600-million price tag made Saab a  relatively cheap investment for GM, especially compared to Ford's $2.5-billion  purchase of Jaguar.  </P></p>

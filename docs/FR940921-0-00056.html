			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The logic of the Agency's tampering exemption for aftermarket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversions thus indicates that the Agency intended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption be conditioned on compliance with all title II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements applicable to the converted vehicle when operating on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either fuel. Certainly, even if the proposal did not specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make clear that it intended to require compliance with OBD as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition for a tampering exemption, that requirement is a logical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outgrowth of the discussion in the proposal. The comments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested parties reflect a recognition of EPA's authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require compliance with OBD as a condition of the tampering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption. These comments demonstrate the adequacy of notice. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Shell Oil Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> EPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 950 F.2nd 741, (Dec. 6, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

The Agency proposed that the useful life of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion be the same as that of the vehicle being converted, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested comment on whether the useful life of the conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be measured from the time of the conversion or from the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the original vehicle's manufacture. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR Part 85. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency received a variety of comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the proposed liability scheme. In general, commenters agreed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need for in-use liability for warranty and recall, but differed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on where or with whom this liability should be placed. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggested that the primary liability should be with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion system manufacturer, and that the installer should only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be held liable for the proper installation of the conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Other commenters agreed with EPA's proposed liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggesting both that this approach would protect the conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer in the event that one party went out of business, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it would allow manufacturers and installers to negotiate risk of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure between them. Comments received on the issue of liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the vehicle's original manufacturer for the proper functioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of original equipment also supported both sides of the issue, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some commenters suggesting that the original manufacturer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability should end at the time of conversion and others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting the Agency's proposed approach. Finally, all comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received on the issue of when the useful life begins were in favor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of reducing the useful life requirement of the conversion by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the original vehicle's useful life which had already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passed at the time of conversion. These commenters suggested that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because aftermarket conversions generally depend on the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle equipment to some extent for emissions performance, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be appropriate to require the conversion to continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting applicable emission standards after the original equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had exceeded its useful life. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that by holding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the entity which certifies the conversion system liable for the in- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use performance of the converted vehicle it has the greatest chance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of assuring quality conversions which will meet applicable emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards throughout their useful lives. If poor installation were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a defense to liability, then certifiers would have no interest in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insuring their installers are competent. Such an approach does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rely on who manufactures or installs the system, but on who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifies the system as meeting applicable standards. At the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of vehicle conversion the system certifier assumes liability for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the converted vehicle's in-use emissions performance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifier may elect to have outside agents conduct installations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the certifier will be solely responsible for the converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle's in-use emission performance. For this reason the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommends that those certifiers electing to have outside agents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct installations work to assure quality system installation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that it is appropriate to hold the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle manufacturer liable for the performance of any parts or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems which retain their original function following conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the failure of such a part or system could be traced to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion then the liability would lie with the conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifier. A good indication of where the liability lies in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations would be whether the failure of a part or system is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurring in non-converted configurations of the same vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency agrees with the comments that it is not appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to extend the useful life of a conversion past that of the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle, given that conversions generally rely on many original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle components for proper operation. Thus, the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life of any conversion will be reduced by the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mileage on the vehicle at the time of conversion ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life of a conversion will end at the same point that the useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life of the original vehicle ends).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

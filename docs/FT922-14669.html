			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Foot starts his last pilgrimage - Ballot Box Michael Foot, the grand old man of Labour politics, is to spend the next six days on a valedictory stump of Wales, the country that resurrected his political career in 1960 and subsequently virtually adopted him. Yesterday he retraced his steps to Monmouth where as a young man of 22 he first entered the hustings at the 1935 general election. From there, the 78-year-old former leader of the party travelled to Montgomery and today he is in Clwyd South-West. Further stops will take him on via Caernarfon, Ynys Mon (better known as Anglesey), Pembroke, Gower and Brecon and Radnor before, on polling day, he reaches his political home for the past 32 years in Blaenau-Gwent. The place used to be called Ebbw Vale. It was there that Foot wrote his biography of his friend and mentor Nye Bevan and it is from there that he will say goodbye to British politics.</p>

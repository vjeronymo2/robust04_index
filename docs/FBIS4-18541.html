			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["voy"-signed report: "Covered With Soil and Plants for </F> Camouflage"]    [Text] Vienna -- "On 15 February, North Korea promised in  writing that we could take samples and do tests in the radio  chemical laboratory to make sure that no plutonium was taken out  in the past 12 months. Without this promise, our inspectors  would not have gone to North Korea in March," David Kyd,  spokesman of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told  DER STANDARD on Tuesday [5 April]. These samples are absolutely  necessary since the seal has been broken and the checking  devices installed by the IAEA have expired.    On the issue of using satellite photos, Kyd said that after  the Gulf War, the IAEA Council of Governors adopted a written  resolution saying that the IAEA shall be given access to all  "additional information," which includes satellite photos,  intelligence reports, and information by nuclear experts. After  all, the experience with Iraq has shown that the declaration of  nuclear installations by individual states is not sufficient.  The Council of Governors' resolution applies to all states that  have signed an inspection agreement with the IAEA, and this  includes North Korea.    "South Africa did not oppose satellite photos," Kyd said.  "But North Korea is annoyed because the photos come from the  United States."    On the two mysterious installations in Yongbyon, Kyd said:  "Satellite photos have shown that these installations were  suddenly covered with soil and plants so they would be  camouflaged before our first inspection in 1992. If they really  are just military installations, then why are they not showing  them to us?"</p>

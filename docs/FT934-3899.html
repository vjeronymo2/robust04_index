			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Golden years are tarnished: Venezuela's election raises questions about Latin American reforms Three-quarters of Venezuela's 20m people are under 35, yet the country has just elected a president who first ran for the office in 1947, the year after US President Bill Clinton was born. Rafael Caldera is 78 next month and first made his mark on Venezuelan politics when Franklin Roosevelt was in the White House. In February, he is scheduled to take over a country that in the past two years has become one of the most politically volatile in Latin America. Last year there were two attempted military coups in the continent's biggest oil-exporting country; this year, there have been three presidents, because President Carlos Andres Perez - Caldera's great political rival - was ousted in a corruption scandal. The victory of the man who has led the 'cockroach coalition' of 17 parties through the election campaign, will be felt beyond Venezuela's borders. It is the first electoral triumph of a presidential candidate in a leading Latin American economy who is explicitly opposed to the market-oriented economic reforms which have characterised much of the region since the mid-1980s. In the view of some observers, Caldera's win threatens such policies - tight budget control, privatisation programmes, the free movement of capital and lowering of tariffs. 'This election, along with other developments, shows that economic reforms have not been consolidated in Latin America,' said Sebastian Edwards, chief Latin American economist at the World Bank. He cited other examples of the vulnerability of the reform impetus: President Alberto Fujimori's narrow referendum victory in Peru on October 31, and the marked popularity in Brazil of the left-wing politician 'Lula' - Luis Inacio de Silva - ahead of elections in Brazil next October. Economic liberalisation appears more deep-seated in Chile, where presidential elections on Saturday are not expected to yield big changes in policy; in Mexico, where next August's elections should result in a victory for the pro-reform government candidate; and, debatably, in Argentina, where the pro-market government of Carlos Menem has been consolidating its authority. But in most other countries there are questions about the durability of reforms. 'It's likely that Caldera will implement a number of measures that will signify a slowdown - if not a total reversal - of some of the economic reforms of the last few years,' said Edwards. 'I think this will provide some kind of signal to other politicians in the region.' Oil price weakness is likely to be the main constraint on Caldera if it persists into next year: oil accounts for two-thirds of Venezuela's exports and, in the face of one of the lowest tax collection rates in the world, is still a principal source of government revenue. Yet foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 12bn, equivalent to nine months of imports, may give him a cushion to follow his populist election promises. But first, he will have to resolve differences with the ostensibly independent central bank, headed by Ruth de Krivoy. One banker in Caracas declared this year that, if Caldera became president, 'Ruth de Krivoy is history'. Yet Caldera said yesterday that an independent central bank was 'absolutely indispensable'. If she insists on keeping monetary policy tight, high interest rates may choke off growth and imperil Caldera's hitherto hazy economic policy plans. While he has been fiercely critical of the reforms introduced by Perez, his advisers have been travelling around the world's financial centres, telling investors and bankers that many of them will stay in place. Caldera repeated at the weekend that he would abolish the value-added tax introduced by the current interim government to help close the budget deficit which is expected to equal about 9 or 10 per cent of gross domestic product this year. He promised to replace it by a tax that falls more heavily on the wealthy. He pledged to improve tax collection. He also vowed to rid the government of inefficiency and corruption, and to cut government spending by 10 per cent, without sacking employees or cutting their salaries. He has given the impression, if not stated explicitly, that he would not raise petrol prices which are among the lowest in the world, and would slow if not halt the privatisation process. To many market economists this has the makings of failure, but Caldera does not appear impressed by now-conventional economic wisdom. Yet if he decides economic orthodoxy is the only answer to depleted public finances, voters might feel once again that they have been double-crossed, as they did with Perez. Perez was elected on a populist platform in 1989, but on taking office saw economic reform as the only way to rescue a bankrupt state. The measures he introduced, including the abolition of food subsidies, triggered riots in February 1989 in which more than 300 people died. Caldera could be in the same tight corner. Mr Anibal Romero, an academic and political opponent, said yesterday: 'If Caldera does what he said he was going to do in the campaign, it's bad; and if he doesn't do it, it's also bad.' Caldera's minority support - he was elected with at most 35 per cent of the vote - could make it difficult to govern. Furthermore, while the make-up of Congress is still uncertain, some political observers fear the breaking of the old two-party system will result in a fractious and fragmented legislature in the Brazilian style. If this is so - and Caldera has said he hopes to build alliances - legislation of any kind will not be easy. Moreover, some of the problems Caldera will face are perhaps more grave than those faced by his predecessor. The decay of the institutions of state - including the military - has not been arrested by the reforms of the Perez years. Public services have deteriorated and, said Edwards of the World Bank, the quality of education is now among the lowest in Latin America. Caldera's main quality in tackling both economic and political issues is a reputation for integrity. If his opponents say he is a vengeful man, they also recognise his almost puritanical streak. He thus carries a moral authority absent from the administrations of Perez and Jaime Lusinchi, both enveloped in corruption allegations. This is one reason why Venezuela's youthful population voted for him on Saturday. Another, said Moises Naim, a former industry minister in the Perez government and now a visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, is nostalgia - he was in office between 1969 and 1974. Caldera - described in one newspaper yesterday as Venezuela's last caudillo  -offers a return to the golden years of the 1970s, when oil prices and Venezuelans' standard of living rose rapidly. But as the population may soon find out, trying to turning the clock back will not resolve the difficulties of the future.</p>

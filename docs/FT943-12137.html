			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Grandees on parade: Jurek Martin on first day of congressional hearings If the first morning of the Whitewater hearings in Congress produced few fireworks, it offered even so an absorbing public contrast between three men  -Mr Henry Gonzalez, Mr Jim Leach and Mr Lloyd Cutler, all in their respective ways Washington institutions. Mr Gonzalez, 78-year-old, balding, Democratic chairman of the House banking committee, is a cantankerous Texan, one of Washington's great manglers of the English language, but a ferocious investigator of malfeasance in financial institutions. Usually rumpled, yesterday he was dressed in an immaculate white summer suit. Mr Leach, 52, is a previously mild-mannered, moderate Republican from Iowa who has made Whitewater his passion. He, too, was dressed for the occasion in smart dark suit and tie; the old sweater and jacket that used to be the trademark of this anglophile former Rhodes Scholar had been left in the closet. Mr Cutler, the white-haired 76-year-old White House legal counsel, is the epitome of Washington superlawyers, an adviser to presidents beyond number, opera buff and bon vivant. He was dressed as usual, as if he were in court, exuding authority and calm. It was Mr Gonzalez, with the power of the gavel, who struck first. He bluntly ruled out of order any questioning of witnesses on the circumstances relating to the suicide last summer of Mr Vincent Foster, then White House deputy legal counsel. A Republican demurred but the chairman rammed through his edict by voice vote - all 31 Democrats concurring and all 19 Republicans opposing. He then laid down the rest of the rules, as specified by the custom of his committee, the diktat of both the House and the bipartisan leadership of Congress and by agreement with Mr Robert Fiske, the independent Whitewater counsel. These were five minutes per committee member for questions, though time could be yielded by one congressman to another; no straying from the committee's brief to confine itself only to the 'Washington end' of the affair; and any witness facing a question outside the remit would be told he was under no obligation to reply. 'As I have said repeatedly, ad nauseam, we're not here to prosecute anybody,' he pronounced. And just in case some poor soul had not received the message on the other side of the aisle, he castigated Republicans for daring to leak to the press material from Mr Fiske's investigations. Mr Leach sat quietly through this, but his turn came. He spoke at length - and it was but a fraction of a longer statement, with documentary materials attached, submitted for the record. He is a man who recently has tended to blow hot and cold on Whitewater, hot on moral outrage but much cooler to some of the wilder conspiracy charges bandied around by right-wing Republicans. Whitewater might not be Watergate, Mr Leach said, but, in partisan tones matching those of the chairman, it was the product of 'one-party government'. It was also 'about the arrogance of power' by a government 'run by a new political class which takes short cuts to power with end runs round the law.' He complained bitterly about what had been proscribed from the committee's hearings, yet agreed that they should not come to resemble a trial. Yet there were unanswered questions about contacts and criminal referrals that could not be ignored. Public ethics were not an 'incidental' matter but at the core of a functioning democracy. 'In terms of symbolism, both of the disjunction of private and public ethics and as a case study on how not to handle a scandal, Whitewater takes on more significance. . . accountability is in order but a constitutional crisis is not.' Mr Cutler would be very good if there were a such a crisis (he has over the years made a number of proposals for improving the constitution) but on this occasion his brief was calmly to present the facts as he had ascertained them during the course of his review. He offered the Whitewater hounds some already well chewed bones, speaking of 'meetings that should not have happened. . . subjects that should not have been discussed,' but no raw meat. Whatever had been said by whom, to whom, when and where did not result in any action by a regulatory agency connected even remotely with Whitewater that could possibly be interpreted as helpful to the president or anybody else. With that, Chairman Gonzalez metaphorically banged the gavel again and ordered all the committee off to hear King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Rabin of Israel address a joint session of Congress.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola to invest Dollars 150m in the Chinese hinterland COCA-Cola, the US soft-drinks group, is pumping a further Dollars 150m into China to extend its bottling capacity inland to take advantage of growing affluence in the hinterland. The projects - which will involve building plants or upgrading existing ones  -will be in 10 inland cities, including Xi'an, Wuhan and Shenyang. This will bring the company's total investment in China to about Dollars 250m by 1998. 'This time we've picked 10 inland cities because we think they've all got great potential. People in those cities are quickly becoming more affluent,' said Mr BC Lo, of Coca-Cola China, based in Hong Kong. Coca-Cola signed a memorandum of understanding last month with China's ministry of light industry to extend its activities deeper into the country. Coca-Cola is one of the largest foreign investors in China. Its 13 bottling plants, located mainly in coastal cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, as well as Beijing and Nanjing, produce 75m cases of soft drink annually.</p>

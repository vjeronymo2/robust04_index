			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Toyota UK parts for Japan TOYOTA, Japan's largest car maker, yesterday began the first regular shipments to Japan of components from its Pounds 140m UK engine plant in Deeside, North Wales. The 3,000 sets of crankshafts and cylinder blocks shipped each month will be worth a relatively small Pounds 5m a year. But they are of symbolic as well as practical importance to Toyota at a time of renewed tension over the level of Japanese imports to Europe's diminishing new car markets. The components will be used in 1.8 litre engines built at Toyota's Shimoyama engine plant and destined for Japan and other big markets. They are seen as a formal stamp of approval of quality at the UK plant. But the company also said the substantially lower costs of manufacturing in the UK made it worth importing the components to Japan. Although Toyota had always planned to export product to overseas markets from its engine plant in Wales, the recent sharp appreciation of the yen had speeded the process, the company said. Toyota said the exports to Japan were part of its policy to optimise capacity at its plants around the world. Toyota has been importing engines and engine components into Japan from its US manufacturing plant in volumes of about 100,000 per month since 1992. 'Deeside has the capacity. The quality and the price are right, so this makes good business sense,' said Mr Yukihisa Hirano, managing director of Toyota UK. Production began at Deeside a year ago before the start of car production at Toyota's Pounds 700m facility at Burnaston, Derbyshire, early this year. Car and engine output is scheduled to rise to 100,000 a year in 1994, and 200,000 a year in the late 1990s. At this output level Toyota expects its UK operations to be purchasing Pounds 700m worth of components annually from European suppliers.</p>

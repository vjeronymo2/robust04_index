			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Juan Carlos Rivera] </F>   [Text] The drill bit, or auger, chews into the rock and  plunges, again and again, into the entrails of the earth. Its  repetitious mechanical movement and the dull, muffled noise of  the drilling tires the eyes and wearies the ears. The metal  tower that rises 70 meters into the air, the height of an  18-story building, stands solemn and stable despite the  accompanying internal movement. The nearby cane fields waiting  to be cut give the Pina oil deposit, which is located in the  neighborhood of the Ciro Redondo Sugar Mill in Ciego de Avila, a  distinctive appearance.    This deposit is not among the largest, but it is regarded by  the experts as the most productive, and that which yields the  product of the best quality. It belongs to the Majagua Petroleum  Drilling and Extracting Unit (Central Basin) and was discovered  in 1990. As of that year, the national strategy called for  giving priority to exploratory studies at this site. There are  now 42 drilled wells in Pina, and 32 of them are being exploited.    Hope can also be dressed in black.    Three drilling teams and a testing brigade work eight-hour  shifts. They do rotary drilling for 10 days and testing and  extraction for another 12 days, and then they have 240 hours  free. Each crew is equipped with a complete trailer complex  providing a dining room, kitchen, bathroom, three dormitories,  recreation hall, and a family physician's consulting room. In  this way, proper material conditions at the site are guaranteed.    I talked with Pedro Leal Cruz, the official in charge at the  deposit, about why Pina is so important in terms of the nation's  oil expectations. He told me that the quality of the so-called  "black gold" depends basically on the API [American Petroleum  Institute] ratings (the international index of density)  determined and the sulfur content. The hydrocarbon produced in  this locality is very light, with an API rating of 32. It  contains very little sulfur. Thus, this is petroleum that is  rich in special oils and of optimal value, comparable to the  best produced elsewhere in the world.    The accompanying gas (70 to 100 cubic meters per cubic meter  of oil) is compressed and sent to various customers for use as  fuel or in the cutting of metals. This kind of petroleum is the  easiest to extract and transport.    "Now we are using it in basic oils. We have light petroleum  products here that can be used directly even in the engines of  drilling equipment and automotive vehicles (in a mixture of 50  percent crude oil and 50 percent diesel oil)," Leal says. He has  been in this business for 33 years, working in jobs including  assistant, drilling tower worker, and well chief.    Where the productivity of the deposit is concerned, I was  told that the extraction plan for last year called for 40,300  tons. The total actually extracted was 47,962 tons, representing  plan fulfillment of 119 percent. The plan for the number of  zones to be tested, or oil-bearing sites to be explored, was  also overfulfilled by 100 percent. This year's plans call for  the extraction of 52,750 tons.    Estimates of the Pina reserves for the next five years have  already been completed, and the production forecasts are  excellent. Other work planned includes the construction of a  collection center and a loading facility. Both of these tasks  are now being completed. The collection center will have a tank  with a capacity of 1,000 cubic meters and an oil pipeline  leading to the railroad loading facility. This will make more  efficient and speedy transportation possible. Work is currently  being done in collaboration with foreign firms at some wells in  this deposit.  <H5>  The Smell of Sulfur </H5>   Regisfredo Aguilera Remodid has traveled almost everywhere  in  the country in search of vocational advancement. A native of  Santiago de Cuba, he studied extraction technology in Havana. He  is living now in Guanito because of a love story he did not want  to recount, but which from every indication has the smell of  sulfur.    When we met him, he was working as the head of an extraction  crew--the principal operator--aided by three assistants. While  we were there he told us about the fulfillment of safety norms,  the zero accident record, and the new wage adjustments that  include compensation for the abnormal and hazardous working  conditions. He talked about the housing arrangements, the  remoteness of the site, and the nocturnal nature of the work. He  also indicated his readiness to continue in the oil extraction  business, despite the oil and grime on his overalls and the  shortage of available soap.    "We need this oil to survive," he confessed with the  sincerest of smiles. He introduced me to the other members of  his crew, who, like the rest of the 180 technicians, assistants,  chemists, and engineers at the deposit, are committed to  retaining first place in 1994 in the Black Gold Competition.    Next we talked with Jesus Aguila, the secretary of the  Chemical-Mining-Energy Workers' Union in Ciego de Avila, about  the stability of the work force employed by the Majagua Basic  Unit of the oil enterprise (covering Pina, Cristales,  Jatibonico, and Jarahueca, in order of extractive capacity). He  said that during certain periods, many workers left, but that  situation is now in the past. The work is rather well-paid, and  the majority of the workers feel much more needed in this era of  shortages.    The new structure of the self-financed unit has led to a  certain surplus in the labor force. Because of this, many  workers are being retrained or are going to an employment firm  that relocates them in various tasks in the cycle. This is  possible because our country has several hundred wells under  exploitation, as well as collection centers, batteries of  storage tanks, small processing plants, and other infrastructure  facilities. There are also many kilometers of oil pipeline  dedicated to the task of guaranteeing the extraction and  distribution of the "miracle" hydrocarbon. The workers in Avila  plan to extract 67,000 tons of oil this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Joint communique issued by the Russian Federation and De </F> Beers Consolidate Mines issued on 18 May on the SAPA PR Wire  Service]    [Text] On 17th May, 1994 discussions were held in Moscow  between a Russian delegation headed by the acting minister of  finance, Sergey Dubinin and a delegation from De Beers  Centenary, headed by the chairman of the Central Selling  Organisation, Nicky Oppenheimer.    The new series of official discussions, of which this was  the  first, is aimed at considering modifications to the existing  marketing agreement between Russia and De Beers in response to  the political and socio-economic changes that have taken place  in Russia since it was signed. Further meetings on the subject  will take place in the near future. The parties remain  committed to the existing agreement, pending their agreeing on  any modification. They are also committed to the stability of  the international diamond market and to taking the necessary  steps to curtail Russian rough gem diamonds reaching the market  outside the current marketing arrangements.    During the discussions the parties re-iterated their joint  responsibility, as the world's two largest gem diamond  producers, to the international diamond market and to the  well-being of the world diamond community. The parties hope  that the new series of discussions will re-establish a solid  base for on-going co-operation into the future and thereby  ensure the further development of the international diamond  business, to their mutual benefit and to the benefit of the  entire diamond industry.</p>

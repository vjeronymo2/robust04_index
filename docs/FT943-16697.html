			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: Score a victory for the naive nations - Peter Aspden finds soccer's traditional giants under threat / World Cup '94 There was a magical moment during Argentina's impressive victory over Nigeria when the African team's back four may have wished they were watching the game on TV. It came when Argentina were given a free kick in an attacking position on the left, and the camera zoomed in on Claudio Caniggia's anxious features. 'Diego, Diego]', we saw him scream. 'Behind you, behind you]', we responded, hoping to rouse the Nigerians from their apparent slumber. It was too late. The world's most glamorous drug rehabilitation double act snapped into action and a switch back to the long-distance camera confirmed our worst fears: Caniggia was indeed utterly unmarked, the ball was indeed despatched to him with awesome accuracy by Maradona, and Argentina went ahead. It was a classic example of what pundits like to call a naive piece of defending. Naive defenders, like their close cousins, exuberant mid-fielders and free-ranging attackers, are in a commentators' category all of their own. What is remarkable is that they all seem to come from countries in football's 'developing world', and are usually patronised in this way as they are about to give a 'traditional' footballing nation a right stuffing. Thus immediately after Saeed Owairan had scored his magnificent solo goal for Saudi Arabia against Belgium, the ITV commentary team worried that the Saudis would get 'over-excited' about their lead and let Belgium back into the game. (They didn't) This - of course - in sharp contrast to the consummate 'professionalism' of the Irish team, who were commended by virtually every TV panellist for not being tempted to push too many men forward while grinding out their execrable draw against Norway. To his credit, the Wimbledon striker John Fashanu, commenting for the BBC (not, as stated last Saturday, for ITV), resisted John Motson's offer to castigate the Nigerian defence for its ingenuousness, preferring to concentrate on the Argentinians' excellence. But it was a testing match for the lover of stereotype, with the 'innocent' Africans out-fouling the 'cynical' South Americans by a staggering 24-1 in the first half. Even then, Motson could not refrain from a melodramatic: 'Are these fouls or are the Argentinians diving?' South Korea naively conceded three sloppy goals in their match with Germany, before naively realising that this German side were actually very poor and could quite easily be beaten. They didn't quite make it; but the notion that the football globe can be divided into sophisticated, knowing European and South American sides and a rest of the world struggling near the bottom of a long learning curve is looking increasingly absurd. Myths die hard, however. Brazil, for example, technically excellent as ever, are nowhere near justifying the praise heaped on them. Their midfield looks unimaginative and one-paced, and far too much is being asked of Romario, who might just struggle against the uncompromising centre-backs of the US on Monday. With Argentina's aspirations seemingly undone by a nasal spray and Italy looking as neurotic and angst-ridden as their 1982 side after the first round (who went on to win the tournament, it must be said), the time looks perfect for a new entrant into football's ultimate establishment, the club-of-six World Cup-winning nations. How about Romania, with Gheorghe Hagi's sliced mis-hits into the top corner? Or the over-excited Saudis and the spectacular Owairan? The heat-seeking Mexicans? It could be the year of the naive in the land of opportunity, and the countries which have traditionally dominated world football might just have to admit that - for now - they have run out of ideas.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mike Robertson] </F>   [Text] Dramatic shifts in voter support in South Africa's  three most important provinces have been highlighted by an  update of the SUNDAY TIMES Pulse of the People poll. With just  over three weeks to election day, the result of the poll among  850 respondents in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging], Western Cape and Natal provinces show a leaching  of support away from the ANC, a growth in National Party [NP]  support and a surprising surge in DP [Democratic Party] fortunes.    Although the ANC's dominance in the PWV and Natal is  unchallenged, the new poll indicates that the NP is poised to  take the Western Cape. The province is poised to be one of two  -- the Northern Cape is the other -- that will not fall to the  ANC.    But the poll, a revisit of the national survey commissioned  by the SUNDAY TIMES in November, also shows a considerable  number of white voters are undecided. This means voting  patterns could change even further in the next three crucial  weeks. The main points of the poll are:    The ANC has shed support in the PWV, Western Cape and Natal,  but is still comfortably ahead in voter-rich PWV. Because of  the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] election boycott, it is likely  to win majority support in KwaZulu/Natal. In the Western Cape  it has been overtaken by the NP.    The NP has made gains in all three provinces, and in  particular the Western Cape where coloured voters are flocking  to its side. At the time the poll was taken it had lured much  support away from right-wing parties.    The Democratic Party is winning back the support of white  voters who had ditched it in favour of Inkatha and the NP. In  the provincial elections in the PWV and Western Province, the DP  is benefiting from the introduction of the two-ballot system and  could qualify for provincial cabinet seats in both provinces.    Support among blacks in Natal for Inkatha has grown since  the  Zulu king entered the political arena. But is has lost  virtually all its support among non-blacks.    Had the IFP contested the election, sufficient numbers of  voters who intend voting DP and NP in national elections would  have switched support to the IFP in the provincial poll. By now  the IFP would have been running a neck-and-neck race with the  ANC for control of the province.    Support for the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and CP  [Conservative Party] was negligible in the three provinces at  the time of the poll. This support had gone to the NP, but  Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front could win it back in the  remaining weeks. The poll was conducted before the Freedom Front  registered and therefore does not reflect support for it.    Large numbers of white people (35 percent in the Western  Cape  and 15 percent in the PWV) who were willing and able to vote did  not know how they would cast their ballots or refused to say. A  high proportion of these would-be voters are likely to be  right-wing supporters.    In an election dominated by personalities, the influence of  the two major players -- President F W de Klerk and ANC leader  Nelson Mandela -- is clearly visible in the poll.    The NP's lead in the Western Cape can be attributed to Mr de  Klerk's enormous popularity among coloureds -- a third said they  were "totally in favour" of him. Only 4.2 percent of coloured  voters said this of Mr Mandela.    That the ANC is still in with a chance in the Western Cape  can be attributed to the fact that a massive 78 percent of black  voters said they were totally in favour of him. Only two  percent of blacks said this of Mr de Klerk.    Voters are equally polarised over election issues. Whites  regard violence, jobs, education, securing a free enterprise  economy and attracting foreign investment as the most important  issues. More than half of them believe the NP has the best  policies to tackle these issues.    In the PWV the number of whites who think the DP has the  best  policies to tackle these issues has doubled to about 25 percent  since November, explaining the steep rise in its support in the  province.    Almost 50 percent of black voters said creating jobs was the  most important election issue. This was followed, in order, by  houses, ending discrimination, education and violence. About  half of black voters in Natal, more than 80 percent in the PWV  and more than 90 percent in the Western Cape think the ANC has  the best policies to address these issues.    Coloured voters in the Western Cape list their chief  concerns  as violence, jobs, education, housing and inflation. More than  half think the NP has the best policies to tackle these issues.    In KwaZulu/Natal the Pulse of the People poll showed that  overall support for the ANC dropped from 40.9 percent in  November to 32.3 percent in March.    But because of the IFP boycott and the likelihood of a low  poll in the province, Markinor estimated the ANC would get the  backing of 50.4 percent of the province's willing and able  voters in the national elections on April 27-28.    About 20 percent of IFP supporters said they would ignore  boycott calls and cast their ballots. Some 70 percent of these  voters said they would support the NP in the national elections,  pushing its support up to 29.9 percent (21 percent) in the  province.    The DP has clawed back the support of whites and Indians  from  the IFP to increase its support among voters to 6.4 percent (3.5  percent). In the provincial elections it will also get the  backing of some Inkatha supporters, pushing its support even  higher to eight percent.    In the PWV, support for the ANC is down from 65.9 percent in  November to 56.5 percent in March. However, the main reason for  this is that the boundaries of the PWV province have been  altered since the first Pulse of the People poll in November.  As a result there are almost two million fewer black voters in  the province than there were in November.    Among black voters in the province, support for the ANC has  remained constant at about 80 percent. About 10 percent of  black voters have not decided how they will vote and five  percent will not vote.    It is among white voters in the PWV that there has been the  greatest swing. About 7.3 percent of whites said in November  that they would back Inkatha and 20 percent the CP/AVF. Now  support among whites for these parties is down to four percent  and 3.2 percent respectively.    The biggest beneficiary has been the NP which has seen its  support among whites grow from 40.7 percent to 55.7 percent for  the national elections. As a result its support is up to 23.2  percent.    The DP also gained, with its support among whites  increasing from 9.3 percent to 19.7 percent. Its support among  willing and able voters in the province for the national  election is up to 9.4 percent (3.2 percent). Neither party has  made inroads among blacks.    Nor can either party be entirely confident it will retain  this support. The DP is under threat from the Federal Party  while General Viljoen's Freedom Front is likely to draw support  of conservative whites away from the NP.    A high proportion of white voters -- some 16 percent -- said  they did not know how they would vote.    In the Western Cape the ANC's support had dropped from 42.9  percent in November to 31.3 percent in March. It has lost half  its white supporters and about a quarter of its coloured  supporters. However, it retains the backing of about 90 percent  of black voters.    The NP has lost some of its white supporters to the DP but  has made major inroads among coloureds. More than 55 percent of  coloureds now say they will vote NP, giving the party the  support of 37.8 percent of willing and able voters.    Given this voting trend, it can be confident of getting the  backing of significant numbers of the 35.6 percent of white  voters and 20.9 percent of coloured voters who said they had not  made up their minds or refused to tell pollsters how they would  vote.    The marginal improvement in support for the DP in the  national elections in the Western Cape (from 5.7 percent to 6.7  percent) is the result of the party making a modest inroad into  the coloured community.    However, in the Western Cape provincial elections, Markinor  estimates that the DP will win 10.5 percent support -- enough to  qualify it for membership of the provincial cabinet.    The reason for this increase is that people who said they  would vote for the NP in the national elections indicated they  would support the DP at a provincial level.    Although support for right-wing parties was down from 2.6  percent to 1.7 percent, General Viljoen stands to gain the votes  of some undecided white voters.</p>

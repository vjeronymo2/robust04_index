			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / French pledge on arms sales helps heal rift with Beijing France moved to repair its strained relations with China yesterday, announcing that it would authorise no further arms sales to Taiwan and that Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, would pay an official visit to Beijing within the next few months. In a joint statement issued by the French government and by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, the two countries said they sought a 'total normalisation of relations and the restoration of warm ties'. French officials said the return to close political links would add impetus to trade and investment and end discrimination against French companies seeking contracts in China. Relations between the two countries have been strained since the end of 1992 after a decision by France to sell 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft to Taiwan in a deal worth an estimated Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) China responded by closing the French consulate in Guangzhou, one of the strongest actions taken by Beijing against a western nation. Although the Mirage aircraft have not yet been delivered to Taiwan, the sale is set to go ahead. 'Commitments made in the past will be honoured,' said Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister. Similarly, a contract for six frigates concluded with Taiwan in September 1991 will be unaffected. The joint statement, however, reflected France's desire to reassure Beijing about its future relations with Taiwan. 'France has confirmed that it recognises the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, and Taiwan as an integral part of Chinese territory,' the statement said. 'In view of the concerns of the Chinese side, the French government has undertaken not to authorise any French company to participate in the arming of Taiwan.' Yesterday's announcements also reflect France's desire to participate in China's rapid economic expansion. Several French industrial groups, such as PSA Peugeot-Citroen, already have substantial investments there. Other companies, such as Aerospatiale, the aircraft manufacturer, are eager to break into the Chinese market. Such hopes will be encouraged by the strengthening of diplomatic ties. A statement on Xinhua said that Beijing would 'welcome participation by French companies in competition on the Chinese market on an equal footing'. No date was set for the visit of Mr Balladur, but officials said the prime minister would probably travel to Beijing in March.</p>

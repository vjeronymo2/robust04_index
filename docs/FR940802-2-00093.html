			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considering the written record only, and any responses timely submitted, the Director will determine if the disputing party's allegations with respect to eligibility: (1) contradict the allegations in the Statement of Claim relating to eligibility; (2) are supported by documentary evidence; and (3) are not contradicted by other allegations which, if true, would prevail over the contradictory allegations of the disputing responding party. If the Director makes affirmative determinations on all of these matters, the claim will be ineligible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, if in the scenario cited above, the claimant had stated that the transaction had occurred within five (5) years of filing, that would have been enough to make it eligible. If the respondent objected and in turn asserted as a statement of fact, in contradiction of the claimant's allegation, that the transaction had occurred nine (9) years before filing and attached a copy of the claimant's account statement in support of the allegation, the claimant would have to come forward with an allegation further disputing the account statement in order to prevent a determination that the claim is ineligible. An allegation that the account statement is fraudulent would be sufficient to overcome the disputing party's allegation, as would production of an account statement supporting the transaction date alleged by the claimant. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, the proposed rule establishes a presumption in favor of the eligibility of a claim which can only be overcome by an undisputed showing to the contrary. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  n. 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  n. 2/. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Subsection 15(f) requires the Director's determination be in writing and set forth the occurrence or event that is the basis for the eligibility determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finality and Effect of an Eligibility Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Subsections 15(d) and (e) resolve several issues relating to eligibility determinations. First, under proposed subsection 15(d) any determination by the Director will be final. This provision is intended to foreclose relitigation of eligibility before the arbitrators. Because the terms of the proposed rule provide that the Director will determine if a claim is eligible for submission to arbitration, the finality of the determination precludes an arbitrator from revisiting the issue under any circumstances. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD recognizes that new facts relevant to an eligibility determination could arise through an amendment to the claim pursuant to Section 39(b) of the Code, which requires the consent of the arbitrators before an amendment to the pleadings is permitted. because the NASD intends that the determination of eligibility will occur before a matter is submitted to the arbitrators, an amendment to the claim permitted by the arbitrators under Section 39(b) would not reopen the eligibility issue for the arbitrators or for anyone else to decide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, a determination that a claim is ineligible will not: (1) limit the right of any party to offer evidence concerning the event or occurrence which was the basis of the eligibility determination at any other stage of the proceeding on the claim for any purpose other than contesting the eligibility of the claim determined to be ineligible; (2) bar a claimant from bringing the substantive claim before a judicial forum, notwithstanding the fact that the parties have an arbitration agreement; or (3) affect the rights and remedies of the claimant with respect to such claim provided by applicable law. The eligibility rule never was intended to serve as an election of remedy provision that would eviscerate any surviving causes of action under applicable law after six years have elapsed. The intent of this proposed provision is to ensure that the effect of the eligibility determination is limited solely to the issue of access to the NASD's arbitration forum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, proposed Subsection (e)(iv) provides that if a claim is ineligible for arbitration, the limitation period on eligibility set forth in Subsection (a) shall continue to run as though the claim had never been filed. This is a relation back provision that is intended to prevent the filing of an ineligible claim from tolling the running of the eligibility provision while the NASD determines that the claim is ineligible. Thus, for example, if a claim is filed and the claimant fails to modify the claim pursuant to the Director's request under Subsection (b), or the claimant fails to overcome the respondent's notice of objection under Subsection (c), the Director may determine that the claim is ineligible. If the claimant later resubmits the claim pleading facts showing the claim would have been eligible when it was originally submitted, but the time period has subsequently run, the claim will not be eligible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Avoidance of Vexatious Litigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new Subsection 15(g) prohibits parties from seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate a claim which has been determined to be ineligible for arbitration by the NASD. This provision is intended to prevent collateral attacks and vexatious litigation over eligibility determinations. Its effect is to bar a respondent (or a claimant) from seeking a court order either to compel the NASD to accept the case for arbitration, or to compel a claimant (or respondent) into arbitration in another forum, after the Director has determined the claim to be ineligible. Thus, members would be prohibited from moving to compel arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (``AAA'') or another self regulatory organization (``SRO''), for instance, if AAA or the SRO is an alternative forum choice in arbitration agreements, after the NASD's Director of Arbitration has declared the claim to be ineligible for arbitration before the NASD. Under this provision members could be subject to disciplinary action for seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship of Eligibility to Statute of Limitations Defenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above with respect to tolling, the NASD intends that the proposed rule change will sharpen the distinction between eligibility and statutes of limitation. The Director's determination that a claim is eligible for arbitration has no effect on whether a relevant statute of limitations operates as a defense to a claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, a claim which is based on an event which occurred five years ago would be eligible for arbitration; however, if the claim were based on a private right of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the respondent could still plead the 1 year/3 year statute of limitations on such actions as a defense before the arbitrators. Similarly, if the claim were based on an event which occurred seven (7) years ago, and which was based on a breach of fiduciary duty for which tolling might apply under applicable state law, the fact that it was ineligible for arbitration would not affect the ability of the claimant to bring the claim for relief in court and to assert equitable tolling as a counterdefense to the respondent's statute of limitations defense. Thus, the Director's eligibility determination will not affect the substantive claim or defenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (2): Self help shines out - St Etienne expects to ride out hard times FROM THE air St Etienne looks like one big industrial site. The stephanois ('Etienne' is French for 'Stephen') are proud of that: even their vaunted museum of modern art has been deliberately made to look like a factory. All those shining new pieces you see on St Etienne's industrial checkerboard are not what the first-time visitor expects to see. In the 1960s-1980s St Etienne was synonymous with industrial decline. It is still the object of eye-rolling, cosmopolitan derision from the nearby citizens of Lyon. Yet most stephanois seem much more confident than the Lyonnais about their city's ability to weather today's economic hard times. Mr Bruno Roux, the city's economic development director, says this relative buoyancy stems from 'the feeling that as we have suffered a good half dozen crises since the 1960s and come through, we will do so again'. St Etienne lost 30,000 jobs when the mines closed, 25,000 jobs when the steel mills shut down, and 15,000 when its mainstream textile sector declined. Overall, the city lost some 80,000 traditional manufacturing jobs. But it has replaced all but about 20,000 of these by means of a very active industrial policy which has successfully encouraged a larger number of smaller companies to diversify. At 11 per cent, the city's unemployment rate is over France's 10.4 per cent national average, but the gap is tiny compared to the five point spread that existed in the mid-1980s. Although nearly one in every three employed stephanois works in industry, the city feels better able to ride out the present austerity. 'We do not even really have a property crisis like other cities do in the office sector, because we don't have offices,' Mr Francois Dubanchet, the bulky Christian Democrat mayor, says with almost blue-collar pride. But the city's drive to re-industrialise itself has been an expensive gamble. It has spent FFrs 1.5bn, with only about a third coming in national/EC aid from Paris and Brussels. Because French cities are forbidden (probably rightly) to subsidise companies directly, St Etienne has worked mainly through real estate. Much of its FFrs 2.8bn debt comes from reconverting old industrial properties, and selling or renting them cheaply to new companies wanting to invest or existing ones wanting to expand, sometimes even before having any idea of who might occupy the new buildings. On its 'Technopole' site, it has also made available low-rent offices for up to two years to companies just starting up. The mayor and his officials are convinced that their gamble has paid off. Mr Dubanchet says St Etienne's financial problems have more to do with some 500 functionaries unnecessarily hired by his communist predecessor. He adds that recipients of municipal aid (which can include temporary exemption from the taxe professionelle payroll tax) are now selected with greater care. But he says that only 2-3 per cent of the 400 companies which have received public aid have, in one way or another, failed. One windfall has come from the south. Some Italian companies, such as Ratti, which prints on silk, have long been present in the city. But the last two years have seen a small flood of new Italian investment. This includes Siccma, which makes office partitions and cupboards, Molemab, which makes abrasives, and Viero, which manufactures silk weaving machines. These investments account for one third of all Italian industrial investment in France during this period (excluding Mafia investment in the Cote d'Azur). Most of the reasons given for moving north arise more from frustration at home than the lure of St Etienne itself, says Mr Roux. Such frustrations include higher wage and electricity costs in northern Italy, environmental constraints on building new plants in crowded Lombardy and Piedmont, and complaints about tax money disappearing into the Mezzogiorno maw. But no one in St Etienne is complaining about this new Italian emigration. St Etienne is also trying to give its annual commercial fair more of an international flavour, says Mr Andre Locquet, its director (who also heads GST Alcatel, an exporter of telecommunications equipment from St Etienne to, for example, Prague). Besides inviting twinned cities such as Coventry in the UK or Hupperthal in Germany to participate, the fair organisers now plan regular exhibitions from neighbouring European countries, to dilute what is otherwise a purely national, not to say, regional event each September. Most of St Etienne's diversification is home-grown. Some traditional activities have returned; Houles has moved all its ribbon-making and embroidery business back from Paris. And gun-making continues - though on a more artisan scale than bankrupt Manufrance, whose Fauriel site is now being redeveloped into a multi-purpose civic centre. But luring top class management from Paris to St Etienne is a problem for a company such as Casino, France's second biggest retailer, with a FFrs 60bn turnover. It has outgrown its stephanois origins. Mr Antoine Guichard, grandson of its founder, the current president, makes no bones about the impossibility of running from St Etienne an international company with holdings in the US and a growing alliance with Argyll in the UK and Ahold in Holland. 'All board meetings take place in Paris, and we have to run two corporate jets, which cost a lot.' What about the TGV train? 'Only taken it once, when there was an air controllers' strike,' Mr Guichard replies dismissively. Casino's boss is far from being St Etienne's Citizen Kane, but there is a certain imbalance of power between the company and the city. Casino is chief sponsor of St Etienne's art museum, theatre,and football team (whose 'Geoffroy Guichard' stadium will host one of the 1998 World Cup games). But only 2,000 of Casino's 58,000 employees work in St. Etienne. One false move  -perhaps one tax increase too many - could prompt the giant retailer to shift its headquarters elsewhere.</p>

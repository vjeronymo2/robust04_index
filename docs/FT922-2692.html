			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: National Westminster National Westminster is quick to point out that it has several reasons for integrating the equity operations of County NatWest with its markets division. Among them are better co-ordinated marketing and back office efficiency gains. Additional business may be won as equity clients are introduced to the division's foreign exchange service. The implication is that the threat hanging over County NatWest has been lifted, even if its name will be less prominent than before. The positive tone is confirmed by the stress laid by the bank's top management on County's improving earnings record and the undoubted value of its research capacity. Nevertheless, yesterday's reorganisation still smacks more of fudge than reprieve. County has been given a chance, but one wonders what would happen if it continued to underperform. It will be harder for outsiders to tell what is really going on. The promised cross-subsidisation benefits are probably overstated. Now they are part of the strategy, it would be even harder for management to wield the axe on County's activities. One interpretation is thus that NatWest has not only backed away from really tough action. It has become less likely that it will ever take it, however inadequate the return.</p>

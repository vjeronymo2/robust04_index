			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Coopers highlights fiscal squeeze The two Budgets of 1993 will reduce UK economic growth by between 0.5 and 1 per cent a year for the next three years, say accountants and management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Philip Coggan writes. It says the combined effect will be a fiscal squeeze of about 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1994-95, rising to around 3 per cent in 1996-97. This is a greater impact than Sir Geoffrey Howe's 1981 Budget and represents 'the most severe fiscal squeeze in the UK since 1945'. Coopers &amp; Lybrand does not expect economic growth to average more than 2-2.5 per cent over the next three years. On that assumption, and on the belief that the government may find it difficult to reduce public spending and may indulge in a pre-election tax-cutting Budget, the report argues that the chancellor's aim of restoring the public sector finances to balance by the end of the 1990s may not be achievable.

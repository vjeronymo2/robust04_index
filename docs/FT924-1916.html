			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of discount rate cut lift Nikkei average REVIVED hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate spurred late afternoon buying, and the Nikkei average rose moderately on futures linked demand and purchases by pension funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 190.77 at 17,480.74 after a low of 17,220.56 and high of 17,554.86. The index remained sluggish through most of the day, but rose in the last few minutes of trading, recovering to 17,500, the 200-day moving average. But once again it failed to close over this technical resistance level as last-minute profit-taking depressed share prices. Volume rose slightly to 200m shares from 150m. Arbitrageurs and public funds were the only prominent participants. Advances led declines by 564 to 382, with 181 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 9.55 to 1,325.90, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.43 to 1,074.09. Market participants were encouraged by rumours of a cut in the discount rate after the afternoon release of weak machinery orders for October. Private machinery orders fell 28.6 per cent from the previous month, reflecting a continuing slump in the economy. The announcement by the Osaka stock exchange that the Ministry of Finance was considering the implementation of a circuit breaker mechanism for the Nikkei futures index, traded in Osaka, also aided sentiment. Hitachi Electronics, a broadcasting equipment maker affiliated to Hitachi, put on Y180 to Y1,380 on hopes of a US economic recovery and firm current year earnings. Sumitomo Chemical climbed Y19 to Y479 on reports that Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, its unlisted subsidiary, will double current year pre-tax profits on sales of its interferon drug. Yokohama Matsuzakaya, a department store, rose by its daily limit of Y80 to Y540 on rumours of a merger with another leading retailer. Oji Paper added Y7 at Y863 and Kanzaki Paper Y19 at Y653, also on merger rumours. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 31.98 to 18,894.40 in volume of 21.1m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y100 to Y11,100 on buying by investors encouraged by its firm earnings prospects. Roundup WITH the exception of Hong Kong the region's markets were weaker yesterday. HONG KONG rose in low turnover, with comments by President-elect Bill Clinton, that China might keep its Most Favoured Nation trading status with the US if it made progress in human rights, helping to boost sentiment. The Hang Seng index gained 48.08 at 5,315.81 in turnover of HKDollars 2bn. HSBC rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 55.50. SEOUL saw profit-taking as investors remained nervous ahead of this Friday's presidential elections. Interest remained in Kepco, the electricity generator, which rose Won300 to Won21,100. The composite index lost 1.02 to 650.21 in turnover of Won382.4bn. MANILA fell afresh following the overnight drop of Philippine Long Distance Telephone in New York. The composite index shed 19.07 to 1,183.49 as PLDT declined 40 pesos to 810 pesos. Combined turnover rose to 310m pesos from Monday's 197m. TAIWAN lost further ground ahead of Saturday's parliamentary elections, the weighted index slipping 8.50 to 3,688.26 in turnover of TDollars 7.2bn. KUALA LUMPUR eased, with some speculative stocks continuing to fall on profit-taking. The composite index lost 3.66 to 628.88. Multi-Purpose Holdings dipped a further 6 cents to MDollars 2.19 as there was still no news on its application for a gaming licence in south China. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index fell 12.00 to 1,442.10 in volume of 72.6m shares. AUSTRALIA weakened on profit-taking, with industrial issues suffering the day's worst falls. The All Ordinaries index closed 2.9 lower at 1,509.6 in turnover of ADollars 284.8m. Mining stocks helped to support the market, with Western Mining rising 7 cents to ADollars 4.38. NEW ZEALAND was led lower by a steep fall in Fletcher Challenge of 9 cents to NZDollars 2.26 as investors were unimpressed by news that it was to merge its Canadian forest operations. The NZSE-40 index shed 11.12 to 1,520.98. Telecom fell 4 cents to NZDollars 2.30 after stating that it would be cutting some of its tariffs.</p>

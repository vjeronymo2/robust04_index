			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: GPG ready to bid for Brown Shipley GUINNESS Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle for New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley, said last night it was considering a full cash bid for Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking business, which would top by 5p the 30p per share offer from Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise. GPG has built up a large shareholding in BSH since KBL made its offer, which valued BSH at Pounds 4.8m, last month. The KBL bid came after it emerged that the Luxembourg bank had potential claims of Pounds 2.4m over BSH arising from its purchase last year of Brown Shipley and Co, the merchant bank. GPG said it now held 29.98 per cent of BSH following a further purchase yesterday. It said it proposed to make a full bid, valuing BSH at Pounds 5.6m, subject to the condition that it received all information on BSH which KBL had received and that 'this information is satisfactory to GPG'. Mr William Dacombe, chairman of BSH, said his board, which has already recommended the KBL bid, would consider the GPG offer very seriously if and when it was made. He said the board's response would depend on KBL's reaction. KBL had extended the deadline for its original bid until today. Last week it said it had added acceptances of 1.4 per cent of BSH shares to its earlier holding of 29.8 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTI-GRAFFITI PROGRAM READY TO BE IMPLEMENTED  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles, stepping up the fight against graffiti on private  property, has kicked off a new program that allows city workers to clean the  offending markings and, if necessary, send a bill to property owners who do not  cooperate.  </P> <P> The City Council unanimously approved an ordinance in August declaring graffiti  illegal and authorizing work crews to enter private property, clean the  graffiti and place a lien on the property to recover costs if the property  owner does not give the city permission to remove it for free.  </P> <P> The new law took effect Oct. 5 and the departments of Public Works and Building  and Safety are ready to begin implementing the program -- boosted by $500,000  from the council -- and enforce the law, according to Councilman Joel Wachs.  </P> <P> "We are making a full-fledged commitment to eradicate something that is really  plaguing the city," Wachs said. "Graffiti really has a detrimental effect and  shows a total disregard for property rights."  </P> <P> Under the program the Department of Building and Safety's 150 inspectors will  be looking for violations throughout the city. Letters will be sent to property  owners telling them of the city's offer to remove the graffiti and informing  them of the consequences should they refuse to cover it over or allow the city  to do if for them.  </P> <P> The Public Works Department has awarded contracts to numerous community  organizations for the graffiti removal.  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Export growth lifts European Colour by 64% European Colour continued its pattern of more than doubling pre-tax profits with a 64 per cent rise from Pounds 521,000 to Pounds 856,000 for the six months to end September, making the fifth successive half year of organically generated growth. Turnover was up from Pounds 7.75m to Pounds 8.51m. Mr Henry Finchett, chairman of the chemical colour manufacturer, said much of the growth had come from 'concentrating upon Europe'. This had 'generated 29 per cent sales growth' and taken exports to more than a third of turnover. Earnings per share came out ahead at 1.9p (1.16p) and the interim dividend is increased to 0.575p (0.35p).</p>

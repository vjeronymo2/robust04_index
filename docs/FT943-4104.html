			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: World of Leather plans faster growth Improved trading during 1994 has encouraged World of Leather, the USM-quoted furniture retailer, to accelerate its growth plans. It is also returning to the dividend list with an interim payment of 0.75p. The company plans to take the present 29 stores to 45 within the next three years. To finance the expansion it is seeking a net Pounds 2.8m by way of a 1-for-2 rights issue of 4.02m shares at 75p. The issue is underwritten by Beeson Gregory, the company's broker. The company also announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 341,000 for the first half of 1994, compared with Pounds 71,000 last time and full year losses of Pounds 121,000. Turnover advanced by 10 per cent from Pounds 14m to Pounds 15.5m. Profits were helped by margins being maintained and by the lack of last time's exceptional charge of Pounds 134,000 relating to the settlement of a dispute with a contractor. The directors are not taking up all their entitlements, resulting in their aggregate holdings falling from 62 per cent to 42 per cent. The company is seeking to move up to a full listing. Earnings per share came out at 3.3p (0.9p).</p>

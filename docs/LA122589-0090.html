			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRED OFFICER FILES SUIT AGAINST GOLDMAN  </P> <P> Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. has been sued by one of its former vice presidents,  who alleges that he was fired for refusing to give confidential client  information to a separate partnership made up of Goldman principals.  </P> <P> Leo Haviland, who previously headed Goldman's Energy Futures &amp; Options  Group, filed suit in Manhattan federal court last Wednesday alleging Goldman  violated the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act.  </P> <P> A Goldman spokesman, who learned of the suit Friday, said: "The complaint is by  a disgruntled former employee who is unhappy about his termination. It is  completely without merit."  </P> <P> Haviland said he has been injured in the amount of at least $4 million.  Haviland traded in energy futures and options on behalf of large refining and  marketing firms, energy producers and oil trading firms, the suit says.  </P> <P> Haviland said Goldman had assured him that he would not have to disclose  confidential client data to J. Aron, a trading group made up of Goldman  partners. J. Aron buys and sells futures, options and commodities for itself  and then hopes to trade them at a profit.  </P> <P> He alleged that Goldman pressured him to reveal the information, but he  declined.  </P></p>

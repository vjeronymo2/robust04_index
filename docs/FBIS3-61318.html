[Niftaliyev] The importance of archives in the study of the  history of our republic and people is irreplaceable. How is the  Main Archive Administration meeting this commitment now?    [Musayev] History must be learned and studied. The great  majority of documents and materials to write history based on  the facts are kept in the archives. The archives are an  autobiography, a diary, a book of memories about every country,  society and their lives. For me, the archive is a living  organism, an existence.    These documents are concentrated in the state archives of  our  republic. The leadership of the archives, supervision of its  work and related matters is the direct job of the Main Archive  Administration of the Azerbaijan Republic Cabinet of Ministers.  This organization also supervises work conducted on documents  concerned with the republic's work and administrative archives,  and provides them with methodological help.    [Niftaliyev] How is archive work structured in our republic?    [Musayev] There is a vast archive network in our republic.  There are now seven state archives in our republic. These are  the Azerbaijan Republic Historical Archive, the Contemporary  History Archive, the Archives of Political Parties and Public  Movements, the Literature and Fine Arts Archive, the Scientific  Technical and Medical Documents Archive, the Cinema-Photo  Archive, and the Oral Archive. Branches of the Contemporary  History Archive are located in 15 cities of the republic. There  are also rayon state archives. In Nakhichevan, the autonomous  republic has a Central State Archive. In short, an archival  network which has collected together in itself abundant  documents and materials that make the history of our people come  alive in our republic. There are more than 3.5 million separate  documents in these archives. In the documents the rich history  of our people from the end of the eighteenth century to the  present are preserved. The scope of the work and the documents  in the archives continues to expand.    [Niftaliyev] What changes have there been in recent years,  and have there been any new archives created?    [Musayev] In connection with the dissolution of the  Azerbaijan Communist Party and the abolition of the Party  History Institute of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan CP  at the end of 1991, the party archives were subordinated to the  Main Archive Administration in accordance with the order of the  president of the Azerbaijan Republic dated 24 October 1991.  Through our efforts the Republic Cabinet of Ministers created  the Central State Archive of Parties and Public Movements on 18  December 1991. The major duty placed before this archive was not  only to preserve the documents of the Communist Party and  organize their use, but also to provide  scientific-methodological advice and help for the numerous  parties nd public movements to establish their own archives and  to preserve their documents.    [Niftaliyev] How are the Archive documents used?    [Musayev] The archive documents are used for various  purposes: in research work and practical work including the  education of the younger generation by means of radio,  television and the periodical press. The work of using the  archive documents is basically conducted in two directions. The  first of them is that the documents of the state archives  themselves are placed at the disposal of the broad reading  masses through the periodical press, document collections and  other means. Our archives have disseminated dozens of  large-scale document collections, and thousands of documents  have appeared in the pages of the journal AZERBAYJAN ARKHIVI.  Our colleagues are preparing a number of document collections  and publications of "white stains" in our history, and over the  period of 1918-1920 and later. In this series are "Protocols of  Meetings of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic," "Decrees of the Government of the Azerbaijan  Democratic Republic," "Work in the Sector of Building the Armed  Forces of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic," and others. While  some of these have been prepared and submitted to the publisher,  unfortunately the expense and the limitations of financial  possibilities have made it impossible to publish them. As for  the journal AZERBAYJAN ARKHIVI, which is the best channel for  bringing the documents to the readers, we have been unable to  publish it for several years.    [Niftaliyev] Are there still documents marked secret?    [Musayev] The democratic changes occurring in our society  have also had an influence on archive work and have led to the  erasure of the secret stamp on many documents. For example,  documents pertaining to the activities of the Azerbaijan  Democratic Republic had been locked away for many years. In the  last three or four years the most often-used documents are those  pertaining to the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.    As for those documents still marked secret, these have  always  been in the archive and always will be. Documents pertaining to  defense and state secrets are in this category. On the other  hand, the protection of human rights and the inviolability of  the person of a citizen of Azerbaijan under conditions of the  democratization of society are being guaranteed, and the  personal life, correspondence and other secrets of citizens of  Azerbaijan are protected by law. In this context, the secrecy  stamp is maintained.    [Niftaliyev] What are the difficulties in your work?    [Musayev] We have many difficulties. Without eliminating  them  it will be impossible to put our archive work on the level of  modern demands. The most important is the lack of a building  that corresponds to modern demands for the preservation of  documents. Twenty years ago the foundation was laid for the  construction of warehouses for the republic state archives. One  could say that completion of the construction of this building  could guarantee us with storage facilities for preserving all  the state archives in the capital of our republic. This  building, which could hold 1.5 million files, would have made it  possible for the Central State Archives in Baku to accept more  than one millon more files from various ministries,  administrations and organizations. However, over the last 20-25  years the archives have been unable to accept documents because  of lack of space. Most of the documents are in antiquated,  inadequate buildings. We were unable to create optimal  circumstances for their preservation. This is causing the  gradual loss and destruction of these documents.    One of our fundamental difficulties is the lack of  laboratories equipped with the modern technology for the  restoration and microfilming of documents.    [Niftaliyev] What are your relations with foreign archives?    [Musayev] Today the possibility has been established for the  republic Main Archive Administration to freely enter the  International Archive Council and establish bilateral relations  with the archival organs of several countries. However, our  financial situation makes it impossible to enter the  International Archive Council. We are now working to achieve  bilateral relations in this sector with the archives of certain  countries. The first ties we have established were with the  archives of the Republic of Turkey. In recent arrangements with  Turkey we have received document collections pertaining to the  history and bibliography of the Turkic world, as well as many  other materials on archival work in the country. The most  valuable for us under this arrangement is the receipt of the  first volume of archival documents pertaining to relations  between the Ottoman state and the Turkic khanates of Azerbaijan  between 1578 and 1914.    [Niftaliyev] What measures are planned to improve archive  work?    [Musayev] Primarily, the regulations of the Main Archive  Administration must be changed. We have already prepared new  regulations and submitted them to the Cabinet of Ministers. The  difference between these regulations and the first is that the  Main Archive Administration becomes completely independent.    We have also completed the draft of the law "On the Archive  Fund and Archives in the Azerbaijan Republic." This will be the  first legal document in our republic in the sector of archive  work.</p>

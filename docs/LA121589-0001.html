			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INS STUDIES PLAN LIMITING IMMIGRANTS' WORK AREAS  </P> <P> In an effort to keep immigrants seeking asylum from clustering in a few areas  of the country, the government is considering the legality of issuing work  visas limiting where they may be employed, the country's top immigration  official said Thursday.  </P> <P> The aim is to keep already overburdened cities, including many in California,  from acting as an "economic magnet" to immigrants whose asylum applications are  being processed, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene  McNary told reporters.  </P> <P> "We're exploring, at the present time, the legal authority to issue work  permits on a geographical basis, which is to say that if somebody gets a work  permit it may not be (valid) anywhere in the United States," he said. "It may  exclude Miami or San Diego or areas that are overwhelmed at the present time."  </P> <P> While McNary specifically mentioned San Diego, INS officials there say that  relatively few people -- normally fewer than 100 a month -- apply for asylum in  the area. That number jumped recently because of an influx of Guatemalans, but  the numbers have been declining recently, said Rudy Murillo, an INS spokesman  in San Diego. Most seekers of asylum, generally from Central America, pass  through the region en route to Los Angeles and other immigrant job centers,  Murillo said.  </P> <P> "We just don't get that many asylum applicants," he said.  </P> <P> McNary, who took office last month, said he has asked INS lawyers if the idea  would be legal and whether legislation would be necessary to implement it.  "They may find that it's impossible," he said. "But something should be  possible, even if legislation is necessary. It makes sense to me."  </P> <P> Local and state officials -- most notably in California, Florida and Texas,  where immigrant groups are more likely to settle -- have complained to federal  authorities that the expanding influx of immigrants in their communities has  placed an unfair burden on their citizens' ability to pay for social services  used by the immigrants. In the closing months of the Ronald Reagan  Administration, federal officials detained Nicaraguan and other immigrants  claiming asylum in an effort to dissuade others from following them to the  United States.  </P> <P> The new policy, if implemented, would affect only immigrants who are claiming  asylum based on persecution in their home countries, a process that may take a  year or more to resolve. Duke Austin, senior press spokesman at the INS, said  that about 100,000 people would be affected annually if the idea were  implemented. He said that INS officials haven't proposed any contingency plans  to implement the idea. "We just haven't gotten that far on this yet," he said.  </P> <P> While many immigration experts and officials of immigrant rights organizations  strongly objected to the detention policy, they were reluctant to offer an  opinion on McNary's proposal because it has not been formally announced. But  some said the idea seemed unlikely to be practical, noting enforcement  difficulties and the legality of limiting immigrants' freedom of travel.  </P> <P> Francisco Garcia, director of immigration rights programs for the Mexican  American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), said in Los Angeles that  he welcomed the idea of moving away from the detention policy, but found  problems with the idea of forcing immigrants to live in pre-selected places.  </P> <P> "We very firmly believe that anyone in the process of adjusting their status to  live in this country should be entitled to an automatic work authorization," he  said. "But we should let the market dictate where people should work and live.  I have grave concerns that this would prevent the free movement of people."  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said that, while she had not  seen the proposal and thus could not evaluate it specifically, she felt the  idea of directing the immigrants to areas where more work seemed to be  available for them "might be beneficial . . . . "  </P> <P> "I'm talking about areas where there are more jobs than people," she said.  </P> <P> Wade Henderson, an official with the American Civil Liberties Union in  Washington, said that McNary's idea deserves study. But Henderson said his fear  is that it would have "a troubling dimension. It could lead to potential  restrictions on the right to travel, which would be a violation of their civil  liberties."  </P> <P> Dick Higgins, executive director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, a  Washington-based public-interest law firm that seeks to reduce the levels of  U.S. immigration, said he doubted it would be possible to enforce such a  policy.  </P> <P> "On the practical level, I don't see how you could enforce residence," he said.  "If a person is sent to Omaha, how could you stop him from moving a week later  to Miami? I don't know."  </P> <P> Higgins said he saw merits in the idea because immigrants shouldn't be huddled  in one place, causing an unfair burden on a city's social services. "But we're  set up as a country not to enforce residence status," he said. "We don't have  an internal passport system like the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> In the 1970s, immigration officials encouraged agencies resettling a flood of  Vietnamese and Cambodians to find sponsors around the country willing to find  jobs and apartments for the refugees. The voluntary plan, which was intended to  distribute the impact of resettlement to all the states, often faltered as  refugees left their original sponsors to seek warm weather and a community of  their fellow countrymen.  </P> <P> McNary said that he had recently visited Miami and had seen that city coping  with a large illegal alien population from Central America. He said that the  medical, educational and other social services accept all the Nicaraguans.  </P> <P> "In Miami, if there is anything bigger than their brain, it's their heart," he  said. "They don't turn anyone away. Instead of saying, 'We don't want any more  Nicaraguans in Miami,' they say, 'We want them all to have work permits.' "  </P> <P> He said he met with Florida's two senators and community leaders who thought  the work permit idea could be worked out as a solution to the problem. "We want  to tell some people you can't just go to Miami or San Diego . . . you can work  in some other part of the United States," McNary said.  </P> <P> Responding to McNary's comments, Miami Mayor Xavier L. Suarez said in a  prepared statement that he appreciated the commissioner's willingness to help  his and other cities.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the deputy chairman of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] Central Committee, has confirmed that the  Yemeni people will successfully pass through this test of unity  and democracy, just as they did the test of the September and  October revolutions.    He explained during a news conference that the Yemeni people  are strong because of the cause they support, and that no matter  how much the secessionist al-Ahmar gang tries to fabricate  issues, militarize the crisis, and derail the homeland, the  political forces and national consensus will remain on the  correct path which we all chose on 20 February.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: Man is Yemen's foundation.  Hence, our strength lies with men and with those causes which  men support. Random missile and cannon fire do not amount to  any kind of strength, and they will not prevent the masses from  raising their heads proudly and refusing to yield to the wishes  and sicknesses of domineering gangs. We are stronger, our  people are stronger -- we shall not abandon the march on the  path that we chose -- the path of unity and democracy, the path  of stability.    The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council and  secretary general of the YSP pointed out in the course of his  speech that the party had sacrificed much on behalf of the  people. It had confronted the evil gangs so that they would not  plunge the country into conflict. He pointed out that these  concessions to the evil gangs have now been exhausted, and that  the YSP stands united with the people. He confirmed that the  situation is getting better.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid pondered what might be happening  in  Sanaa and many other areas, pointing out that the northern gangs  have cut off communications both inside and outside the country  so that people cannot communicate.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid stated that our legitimacy is  derived from the people, and that the legitimacy of the media,  which is being imposed on the people, is transient. He said  that this legitimacy will only last for a couple of days, and he  doubted the ability of some people to impose it for thirty days.    He emphasized the importance of cohesion to the internal  front and to the nationalist forces, and stressed commitment to  the processes of unity, democracy, multipartyism, and  nondiscrimination between the citizens, wherever they live in  any governorate. Whoever supports the pledge and accord  document, national cohesion, and peaceful, democratic struggle,  is with us in any governorate. The deputy chairman of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the YSP explained  that instructions have been given for opening a camp in Lahj  Governorate for whoever wants to join the ranks of unity and  democracy.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid denied reports being disseminated  by the hostile media on the strike against the Dhamar  electricity station. He pointed out that the Republican Guard  in Dhamar carried out this act. He emphasized that the forces  of unity and democracy did not and will not hit any vital  targets, since these belong to the people. But the forces of  unity and democracy will search for the gang and its palaces,  hideouts, and nests.</p>

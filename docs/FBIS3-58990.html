			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Pierre Servent: </F> "Lamassoure Tries To Reassure Baltic Leaders With Regard to  Menacing Statements by Russian Diplomats"]    [Text] Vilnius -- Alain Lamassoure, French minister  delegate for european affairs, has repeatedly told his Baltic  contacts: "The security of the Baltic states is an integral  part of European security." Mr. Lamassoure was to complete a  three-day tour of the region in Riga (Latvia) on Saturday 22  January, following his visits to Tallinn (Estonia) and Vilnius  (Lithuania).    The French minister, who had originally not planned to make  the tour until the spring, finally decided, after the Russian  elections and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's emergence, to bring the  visit forward to "try and reassure the Baltic states and convey  to them our solidarity at a time when they could be frightened  by what they are hearing from Moscow." The French minister was  able to gauge at first hand the concern of his interlocutors  (not to mention their youth: The Estonian prime minister is 35  years old, and his foreign minister is 27) in the light of  recent statements made by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev on the subject of the regions, which include the Baltic  states, and "which over the centuries have constituted the  sphere of influence of Russia." These statements -- even if  they have been denied -- added to those of the Russian  nationalists, who feel that they have the wind in their sails,  show glimpses of a rebirth in Russian imperialism which gives  the Baltic states constant cause for concern.  <H5>  Notion of `Close-by Foreign State' </H5>   In addition, many Baltic leaders consider that certain  Western powers, and in particular the United States, implicitly  show too much complacence with regard to Moscow's favorite  "close-by foreign state" notion. Estonian President Lennart  Meri told us on Friday 21 January: "If you accept this Russian  notion of the close-by foreign state, then one day it will be  extended to France itself...." He added that all indications  were that Catherine the Great's imperialist dream had not  deserted Moscow: "That is the tragedy of Russia, which has  always believed that it had a special mission for the world.  This vision is very popular today with the Russian generals."    He continued by saying that now there is a great threat of  Russia trying to make people forget its domestic problems "by  rallying the Russian people around a nationalist flag." At the  risk of using "language that is too romantic," Mr. Meri stressed  the fact that Europe's problem was not, currently, a question of  military strategy but more of a moral problem: "Does Europe  still have the will to remain European? Here we are in Europe's  front line, but for a front line to be solid we need to feel  that behind us we have a Europe that wants to remain faithful to  its guiding principles." In Vilnius, former President  Landsbergis also stressed to Mr. Lamassoure the need to "not  harbor any illusions about Russia." He warned of "the  Kozyrev-Zhirinovskiy doctrine" and spoke of his fear that one  day Europe would again be split into areas of Russian and  American influence.    The French minister for European affairs tried to reply to  these fears. He assured his interlocutors of France's desire to  establish closer ties between Europe and the Baltic states and  pointed out that France will play its part in ensuring that the  planned trade agreement between the European Union and each of  the Baltic states also has a political aspect, the content of  which would be similar to the agreements concluded concerning  the four countries in the Visegrad group (Hungary, Poland, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia), and Romania and Bulgaria.</p>

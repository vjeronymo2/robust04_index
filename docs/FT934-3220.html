			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (4): Merged banks branch out - Profile: ABN AMRO Global custody is a prime example of the synergy that was waiting to be exploited when the Netherlands's two biggest banks merged in 1990 to create ABN AMRO, Europe's sixth-largest banking group. Although both were active in global custody for years before their link-up, Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN) and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank (AMRO) had distinct and separate strengths. For example, AMRO brought to the merged group a two-way communications system for institutional investor clients who are not part of the Swift network. Today, the legacy of this contribution is reflected by the fact that ABN AMRO's system is still called 'AMROSS-pc'. ABN, by contrast, had a far more extensive network of international branches and offices, including a large presence in the US centred on Chicago and the La Salle group of banks. 'The merger brought us the benefits of synergy and a bigger base on which to build our global custody business,' says Mr Ruud van der Horst, executive vice-president of investment banking and global clients. Since the merger, ABN AMRO's global custody business has shown sharp rates of annual increase. Around the time of the merger in late 1990, assets in custody totalled Fl 194bn (Dollars 102bn). By the end of 1992, that figure had risen by 36 per cent to Fl 264bn. Part of this growth is simply a reflection of the rise in world stock markets, but part of the increase reflects the expansion of ABN AMRO's client base in global custody. The bank's bolstered position in custody is due to two factors, according to Mr Fred Berghout, senior vice-president of global securities services. On the one hand, the Netherlands has a disproportionately large group of institutional investors, reflecting the country's propensity for collective savings through pension funds, pension schemes and insurance companies. 'On the other hand, the strong Dutch guilder is attracting foreign investors into guilder investments,' he says. ABN AMRO plans to use this base to expand its global custody business, but Mr Berghout emphasises that the bank intends to pursue steady, gradual growth. The bank will not move into a geographic market until it can provide proper back-up. At the same time, its expansion of global custody will be integrated with growth of related services such as asset management, private banking and foreign exchange, a strategy which Mr Berghout describes as sending in the 'infantry' and 'cavalry' simultaneously. ABN AMRO is already well-established in Switzerland and France. Top priorities for further expansion are the world's leading capital markets, especially the US and Canada, the UK and Japan. Additional expansion in the US will be eased by the fact that ABN AMRO is among the largest and most successful foreign banks in the country, thanks to a series of acquisitions in and around Chicago since the late 1970s. In the UK, which accounts for 45 per cent of Europe's market for institutional investors, ABN AMRO's plans for growth are centred on Hoare Govett, the British stockbroker acquired from Security Pacific last year. Besides global custody, Hoare Govett is also central to ABN AMRO's European ambitions in the entire sphere of international equities, including trading, corporate finance and equities research. Mr van der Horst says ABN AMRO is still doing its 'homework' on the UK market, and a concerted push is not expected before 1995. The core of ABN AMRO's global custody clients are Dutch institutions such as pension funds. Many of the country's rich pension funds have said recently that they would like to step up their purchases of foreign shares, auguring well for ABN AMRO, which easily leads the global custody market in the Netherlands. The bank has sub-custodians in nearly 45 countries, of which nearly one third are ABN AMRO branches. Like other custodians, ABN AMRO is trying to step up the coverage of its network in emerging markets. Dutch pension funds, with a reputation for prudent management and risk avoidance, are not likely to become swift converts to the new-found enthusiasm in the investment world for the emerging markets of developing countries. 'Our expansion in the US is leading us to markets with higher settlement risks such as the more 'exotic' investment countries in Latin America and the Far East,' Mr Berghout says, noting that US investors are showing an interest in these regions. Though careful in their choice of investments, Dutch institutions are also becoming more critical of their own performance and seeking higher returns. This opens up opportunities for selling related services. Mr van der Horst says that until five or six years ago, securities lending was something which domestic institutions considered simply 'not done'. That perception is changing, though growth in securities lending among Dutch institutions is still well below that of US institutional investors.</p>

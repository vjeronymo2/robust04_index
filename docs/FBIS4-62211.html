			<p>BFN     [Text] In is believed in the presidential administration  that rumours about Sergey Shakhray's dismissal from his  ministerial post are to some extent well-founded. A  presidential administration official who asked not to be  identified explained the emerging reports by the fact that the  Russian Government had recently decided, with Sergey Shakhray's  active contribution, to finance three programs for the north,  which had seriously affected the financial interests of the  south of Russia. Another important factor was the unsuccessful  policy toward the Cossacks and Chechnya. In particular, no one  had authorized him to conduct talks with the Chechen opposition.</p>

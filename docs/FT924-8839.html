			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Fuel lift for Japanese ship lines JAPANESE shipping companies yesterday reported that lower fuel costs helped to support earnings during a difficult first half. Nippon Yusen, the largest line, reported a 6.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Y7bn (Dollars 57m). Nippon Yusen, part of the Mitsubishi group of companies, said operating profit during the six months to end September rose by 28.9 per cent to Y12.9bn and sales rose 8.7 per cent to Y299bn, but profits were hit by appraisal losses on securities holdings and the appreciation of the yen. Nippon Yusen said container services to the US increased, reflecting the rise in Japanese exports, but cargo movements to Europe slowed and 'competition intensified'. Asian business remained strong, and demand for tankers 'proceeded steadily'. 'Prospects for greater cargo movement during the rest of the year are not bright, as the general stagnation of the world economy and the uncertainty of the Japanese economy have combined to put the industry in a difficult situation,' NYK said. Mitsui OSK Lines, the second largest Japanese line, reported a 15.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y3.6bn and a 48.3 per cent fall in operating profit to Y4.8bn, in spite of a 2.4 per cent rise in sales to Y244bn. The company's profits were eroded by heavier interest payments and depreciation charges, while the market value of its short and long-term holdings of stocks fell in tandem with prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. For the full year, Mitsui expects sales 1.8 per cent higher at Y490bn, and a 5.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profit at Y7bn. It had previously forecast a pre-tax profit of Y10bn. Kawasaki Kisen reported a 63.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y559m after a 1.7 per cent fall in sales to Y187.6bn during the first half. The company blamed the international recession for the plunge in profit, but it also reflected sharply lower income on financial items. The shipping line said yen appreciation and slower demand from Europe would continue to hurt earnings over the full year, for which it forecasts a pre-tax profit of Y2.5bn, down from Y4bn, on sales of Y377bn, compared to Y384bn last year.</p>

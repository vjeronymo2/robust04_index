			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Economic worries take their toll - European equity turnover fell back in April The high levels of equity trading seen throughout Europe during the first three months of the year lost impetus in April as a raft of political and economic worries began to take their toll. Turnover in the eight leading European markets fell by 25.3 per cent in April, reversing a 22.8 per cent March rise. April's decline reflected a fall in market indices, with the FT-A Europe index losing 1.9 per cent over the month. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities says lower turnover was particularly noticeable in the second half of the month as investors took profits: 'In contrast to March when turnover swelled on a flat market, selling in April seems to have led to prices falling and volumes declining, in the absence of ready buyers.' He adds that while turnover was also lower overall on Seaq International, the London screen-based dealing system for foreign shares, the fall was less pronounced than on domestic exchanges. Seaq turnover as a percentage of the domestic market rose to record levels for both French shares, at 53.1 per cent compared with 44.2 per cent in March, and German shares, 15.4 per cent after March's 11.5 per cent. Mr Marcus Grubb of Salomon Brothers notes in his latest European equity strategy review that bourses had rallied strongly during the first three months, helped by strong US economic recovery and an appreciating dollar, and hopes of lower interest rates. At their peak in March and early April, the markets had risen by an average of 5 to 6 per cent since the start of the year and had outperformed bond markets. Since late-March, however, deepening economic recession in continental Europe, a slower pace of recovery in the US, fears of intervention in Bosnia and turmoil in the Confederation of Independent States had all weighed heavily on European equities, offsetting the benefits of the Bundesbank's easing of monetary policy. German domestic turnover saw the biggest fall of the month, 32.5 per cent from March's unusually high levels as worries about the economy grew. Spain came a close second, down 30.1 per cent as investors became uneasy about the peseta's outlook, and elections on June 6 which could produce a hung parliament. French turnover dipped by 26.2 per cent as bourse indices fell on concern about the new budget, while Switzerland contracted by 25.9 per cent as the market underperformed on the weak dollar and impatience over the delay in bringing down Swiss interest rates. Italy eased 0.8 per cent from March's four-year record. The market index rose 10.8 per cent as the political climate looked brighter and investors refused to be put off by the ever-widening corruption scandal.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse                Jan        Feb        Mar        Apr          US                      1993       1993       1993       1993     Dlrs bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium             62.75      57.35      70.30      58.18        1.78 France             106.66     127.98     159.17     117.45       21.95 Germany             91.67     133.88     168.06     113.50       71.47 Italy           25,143.20  28,045.20  31,337.60  31,098.40       20.84 Netherlands         14.60      16.80      21.80      16.80        9.41 Spain              653.20     664.91     856.96     598.87        5.13 Switzerland         22.30      17.60      18.90      14.00        9.76 UK                  42.86      43.58      51.82      38.79       60.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

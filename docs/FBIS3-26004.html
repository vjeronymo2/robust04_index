And certain news items even found their way into  Zhongnanhai,  causing the hearts of supreme CPC leaders to beat faster.    The latest astounding news was that Yang Shangkun was  attacked in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.    Yang flew to Shenzhen from Beijing 8 January. According to  the joint arrangements by the CPC Central Committee General  Office, the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and the Yang  Shangkun Office, Yang was to spend one week in Shenzhen.  Beginning 10 January, he was scheduled to visit two fairly  large foreign-funded joint-venture enterprises; meet with  scientific and technological personnel and financial experts in  Shenzhen as well as elderly Shenzhen citizens; visit the animal  park and the Splendid China miniature scenic spots; attend an  organization meeting of Shenzhen's veteran cadres; meet with  representatives from Shenzhen's armed police and public security  and judicial departments; attend a forum of representatives of  the teaching staff of Shenzhen's colleges and high schools; and  go sightseeing in the city. However, all these arrangements  were changed very quickly.    Yang was scheduled to stay at the Nanhai Hotel for one day  and the Shenzhen Bay Hotel for another but the plan was scrapped  later. The reason was that Yang was exposed to danger. At  midday on 10 January, a squad of special police was transferred  from Guangzhou to reinforce Yang's security team.  <H3>  Homemade Bombs Were Delivered to Yang and the Shenzhen City  CPC Committee </H3>   --On the morning of 9 January, a stolen car containing five  kg of explosives, petroleum, and detonators, was found 20 meters  from the Shenzhen Guest House. In the afternoon of the same  day, a black leather bag was discovered in the joint Shenzhen  City CPC Committee and Government reception room. In the bag  were two homemade bombs, on which was written: "One for Yang  Shangkun and the other for the city party committee" and signed  "Communists."    --On the evening of 9 January, the city party committee and  the city's public security bureau received an anonymous  telephone call threatening to destroy Yang's special car and  saying a time bomb had been planted in a certain place.    --At midday on 10 January, "reactionary" posters and  leaflets  were found in Shenzhen and Shekou which read: "Do not be misled  by the false appearances covering up the corrupt Shenzhen City  CPC Committee!"; "What is the difference between the Kuomintang  in 1949 and the Communist Party in the 1990's?"; "If Yang  Shangkun rids the people of a scourge, he is welcome; if he  shelters officials, he must quit!"; "Shenzhen is not the  people's paradise but a place where high officials and noble  lords gain fame and fortune."    It has been learned that leaflets were elegantly printed and  their contents were endorsed by Shenzhen residents. The local  government has ordered the public security bureau to crack the  case and regard it as a serious one. They want to prevent the  news about the case from spreading.  <H3>  A Demobilized Soldier Threw a Bottle of Liquid Fuel at  Yang's Car </H3>   On the morning of 9 January, Yang spent an hour taking a  walk  in the Four Seas Park. As he was getting in his car to leave an  emergency occurred took place within two meters of his car and a  person in his thirties was arrested by the special police.  According to a report, the Molotov cocktail thrower, called Xu,  was a local demobilized soldier-turned security chief of a  certain luxury hotel. He darted through the cordon and threw  the Molotov cocktail at Yang's limousine. When the bottle hit  the ground the liquid splashed toward the car but the flames  were immediately put out by the special police using the fire  extinguishers in the car.    In the evening of the same day, shots were heard outside the  Silver Lake Hotel where Yang was staying. The local public  security bureau disclosed that some people fired shots into the  air over the Yinhu Hotel and over the Shekou China Merchants  Steam Navigation Company Guest House for senior cadres, where  Yang was supposed to stay.    It is reported that the Shenzhen City CPC Committee Standing  Committee and leading cadres of the Shenzhen Public Security  Bureau were kept very busy by the incidents. When the CPC  hierarchy learned about the incidents, they were concerned for  Yang's safety. As a result, Yang's itinerary was amended and an  additional two special police vehicles were ordered to escort  him as of 10 January.  <H3>  Eight Units Asked for an Interview With Yang To Present  Petitions </H3>   On 11 January, representatives from eight local government  departments went to the city party committee secretary's office  to ask permission to see Yang and submit petitions. The  government departments reportedly included the local  procuratorate, court, and discipline inspection commissions.  Some government departments in other areas across the province  also sent representatives to Shenzhen to ask for an interview  with Yang and present petitions when they learned that Yang was  there. According to a source, the staffers of the city party  committee adopted a rude attitude towards the representatives  and the two parties had a row. The city committee standing  committee members on duty told the representatives to write  directly to the central authorities or to Yang to make  complaints. It is reported that most complaints concerned  corruption in the party and government departments including  manmade resistance and pressure encountered by judicial  departments in investigating and handling serious economic cases  as well as collusion between local and central departments in  practicing graft and taking bribes.    The Shenzhen Discipline Inspection Commission some days ago  told the provincial party committee that 80 percent of criminal  cases defied investigation and that 70 percent of discipline  inspection commission members had asked to be transferred to  other posts.    When commenting on the incidents in Shenzhen and Shekou, a  Beijing public security cadre conjectured in private that the  incidents were organized by some people who were angry with  corruption and bureaucracy in the party and government  departments. He added: "Of course, we cannot rule out the  possibility that the incidents were caused by personal grudges.  Yang was possibly only an `innocent victim.' The incidents  were more likely designed to serve as a warning to the  hierarchy: You must not always praise the special economic  zone; instead, you must try to find out the situation with the  party, the political situation, and public opinion."    The cadre said: Nobody should use violence, no matter what  kind of grudge they may have. "On the other hand, the central  authorities should make a self-examination and draw a lesson  from the incidents--they should allow the people the freedom to  vent their spleen instead of strengthening the dictatorship."</p>

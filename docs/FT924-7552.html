			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Observer: Reading tissue This year's most nauseating gift idea? A collection of 21 books bound to match their subjects. Nothing much wrong with All Quiet on the Western Front wrapped in German uniform cloth, brass buttons on the spine. Nor the wild boar used for Captain Baden-Powell's tome on Pig Sticking. The baby seal fur used to highlight a book on Antarctica is more questionable. Vilest of all? Sadly, no prize for guessing what the nervous binder was persuaded by his ghoulish client to apply to the covers of A Practical Synopsis of Cutaneous Diseases. Readers with Dollars 25,000 and a penchant for the macabre should contact Ursus Books.</p>

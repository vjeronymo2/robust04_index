			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Heron Fees for refinancing near-bankrupt Heron International have reached an astonishing Pounds 60m. Bondholders, who saw most of their investment wiped out in last year's failed restructuring and will face a further diminution if the latest plan is approved, must feel bitter. A particularly gripe - as with other refinancings such as Queens Moat Houses - is that some fees have gone to Heron's bank creditors. It seems inappropriate for one class of creditors to receive fees from a struggling company, so reducing what is available for the rest.</p>

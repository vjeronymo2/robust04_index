			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAILING / RICH ROBERTS;  </P> <P> RUDY CHOY LOSES A JINX AND FINALLY GETS HAWAIIAN RECORD  </P> <P> Frustrated time and again in his dream to set a sailing record from Los Angeles  to his native Hawaii, Rudy Choy figured he was jinxed -- until he finally  identified the jinx.  </P> <P> He concluded that it must have been his old friend Bud Tretter, who not only  helped him to prepare the Aikane X-5 catamaran for several attempts but sailed  along as navigator. Tretter, who runs the Marina Shipyard in Long Beach, is an  excellent sailor, but something always seemed to be going wrong.  </P> <P> Choy failed in three other bids for the record since 1987, and this summer  started three more attempts, with Tretter aboard, only to turn back with  breakdowns.  </P> <P> On July 2, they were still five miles from Catalina when the headboard pulled  out of the main sail.  </P> <P> The next day, they were ready to go again by late afternoon, but charging at 22  knots in a strong breeze out of the Los Angeles Harbor entrance to the starting  line off Point Fermin, the sail track peeled off the boom.  </P> <P> The next shot was on July 12.  </P> <P> "Everything was going great," Tretter said. "We were seven hours out and 125  miles down track, averaging about 17 knots, when the starboard chain plate on  the outboard side of the hull started lifting the deck and broke the shear  clamp. So, we bail out again."  </P> <P> It wasn't until Aug. 17 that they were able to try again. But Tretter couldn't  go because of a scheduled court appearance, so he set the starting line off  Point Fermin and through the week served as shore support for weather  information. The court appearance was later postponed, but Tretter had already  been left on the beach, gnashing his teeth.  </P> <P> Without him, Aikane X-5, the rising sun at its back, passed the Diamond Head  finish line at 8:41 the morning of Aug. 24, completing the run in 6 days 22  hours 41 minutes 12 seconds, beating the record of 7 days 7 hours 30 minutes  set by the 64-foot catamaran, Double Bullet, in 1983.  </P> <P> Tretter, having flown over, greeted Choy at the finish and the next day was  back on board for the weekly Friday night races out of the Hawaii Yacht Club.  But the Hawaiian sailing gods were watching.  </P> <P> Aikane X-5's mainsail blew out.  </P> <P> Rudy Choy is the pioneer of catamaran sailing. His co-skipper was son Barry,  and the rest of the crew included Mike Elias, who replaced Tretter as  navigator; mast man Gary Kraft, sail maker-helmsman John Conser, primary  helmsman Roy Seaman and VHS operator Neal Forn.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Tretter deserves partial credit for the record -- and not just  for staying off the boat. He helped Elias pick the best courses for Aikane X-5  to sail.  </P> <P> "We were in radio communication twice daily," Tretter said. "I would call our  weather people at Ocean Routes in Sunnyvale, and Mike would call me after that.  We'd hack over the weather and strategy for about an hour every morning and  every night and, boy, it worked.  </P> <P> "They sailed as close to a rhumb (direct) line course as I've ever seen. They  had a few wind shifts, and the wind started lightening the second day from the  finish. Otherwise, they would have beaten the record by 24 hours."  </P> <P> Tretter said: "It was a pretty uneventful trip."  </P> <P> Tretter said the winds blew a steady 15 knots, with gusts up to 22.  </P> <P> Aikane X-5 averaged about 14 knots for the 2,250 miles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sailing Notes  </P> <P> Tom Blackaller leads Randy Smyth, 152-151, going into the final round of the  Salem ProSail series for 40-foot catamarans at San Francisco Sept. 15-17.  Blackaller, with $51,500, won the first and third events at Wrightsville Beach,  N.C., and Newport, R.I., Smyth, with winnings of $49,000, the second at  Annapolis.  </P> <P> The World Championship of Match Racing runs at Royal Lymington Yacht Club in  England, which began Wednesday (Sept. 6) and runs through Sunday, features the  top five ranked skippers in the world and the next-best five that accepted  invitations. The lead group includes Rod Davis, Chris Dickson and Russell  Coutts of New Zealand; Peter Gilmour of Australia, and Eddie Owen of Wales.  They are competing for $102,000, including $25,500 to the winner.  </P> <P> The Chula Vista Yacht Club will announce the filing of its challenge to  Australia for the International Catamaran Challenge Trophy, the little  America's Cup, Friday.  </P> <P> The Long Beach Yacht Club's 13th biennial Long Beach-to-Cabo San Lucas race  will start Nov. 10 for IOR, IMS and PHRF handicap classes C and D, and Nov. 11  for the bigger boats. The 700-mile race will take about a week.  </P></p>

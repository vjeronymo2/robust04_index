In 1993, Jiangsu reported an export volume of more than 5.97  billion U.S. dollars, according to Ye Jian, director of the  provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation committee. It  registered imports of more than 2.7 billion U.S. dollars, an  increase of 72.96 percent.    Jiangsu opened a foreign trade port in 1974. Since then its  export volume has increased from 77 million U.S. dollars to more  than 5.9 billion U.S. dollars last year, an annual growth rate  of 25 percent, much higher than its overall economic development  speed.    Jiangsu province has been at the top of the list in China in  terms of its production scope since the mid-1980s.    At present it has more than 60,000 production enterprises,  which export more than 1,000 kinds of products overseas and  account for more than 80 percent of the industrial products to  be sold overseas.    To date, more than 80 foreign trade companies have been  established in the province. 232 production enterprises and 10  science research institutes and higher schools have obtained  import and export autonomy, ranking first in China.    In addition, foreign funded enterprises have become a major  source of the province's exports. In 1993, foreign funded  enterprises reported exports of more than 2.26 billion U.S.  dollars, about 37.8 percent of the total.    Now the province's products have been exported to more than  130 countries and regions, mainly in the Asia and Pacific region.    At the same time, its foreign trade ports and transportation  system have been developing rapidly. Its foreign trade ports  now have an annual handling capacity of about 100 million tons.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Letter: Damaging repercussions if oil and gas shut off to protect coal Sir, David Lascelles ('Coal on his Christmas list', November 30), although eloquent on the balance of argument between the most vocal protagonists - all state-owned or recently privatised - ignored the position of the oil and gas industry. Over the past 25 years the industry has considerably benefited the balance of trade, boosted the Treasury by Pounds 118bn and, in 1991, provided 21 per cent of total UK industrial investment. It currently involves more than 3,000 companies, employing some 300,000 people. As a result of the intense 'partisan lobbying' (Lex, November 30) taking place on behalf of Nuclear Electric, National Power, PowerGen, British Coal, British Gas and the regional electricity companies, all of which seek to maintain protected positions in one way or another, the current coal debate overlooks the importance of the offshore industry in the UK energy spectrum. Offshore oil and gas reserves are as important a national asset as coal reserves and must not be overlooked in the current energy review. It is not simply a case of shutting off (or forgetting about) gas to provide a market for coal as is being suggested by the coal lobby. Such a policy would result in substantial reserves of oil and gas remaining undeveloped, the deflection of international capital, a huge loss of investment, jobs and tax revenues, and a negative impact on balance of trade. Only competition will attract investment, increase jobs and reduce energy costs, not the extension of monopoly positions. Coal can compete with gas and British Coal should be grasping opportunities provided by lower exchange rates to expand its markets within the international coal industry rather than seeking protection by regulation in the UK. This contrasts with British Coal chairman Neil Clarke's vision of there being no alternative to closing mines other than closing down the offshore gas industry. Shutting down oil and gas projects would damage not only employment but also the willingness of the international oil industry to invest in UK energy reserves. In the 'white heat' of the current debate on the 'dash for gas', do not forget the individuals who work in the offshore gas industry and the benefits they have brought.

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (9): Thrown into the deep end - Industry FEW yardsticks measure Africa's marginalisation better than its share of global manufacturing activity. In 1980, manufacturing value added (MVA) in sub-Saharan Africa totalled Dollars 12bn - 0.4 per cent of the global total if South Africa is excluded, or Dollars 30.5bn (1.1 per cent) including South Africa. Ten years later, in 1990, the region's share had slipped to 0.9 per cent; though if South Africa is left out, it remained at 0.4 per cent. By 1980, it had become clear that misguided, if well-intentioned, attempts to promote industrialisation had saddled the continent with a battery of inefficient, internationally uncompetitive manufacturing firms, many owned by governments. Since then, structural adjustment measures - especially trade liberalisation, tariff reform, exchange rate devaluation, deregulation, positive real interest rates and privatisation - have changed the rules of the game. Industries that grew up behind tariff walls and import controls - many of which should never have been established - were thrown into the deep end of global competition. Macroeconomic stability aside, the most important single factor in industrial adjustment has been establishing - and sustaining - competitive exchange rates. Given the size of the domestic market and high inflation, substantial devaluation has been necessary to re-establish competitiveness in both domestic and export markets. Also crucial is the simplification of import regimes to ensure that manufacturers importing raw materials or parts do not face bureaucratic hurdles and heavy import taxes. Critics of structural adjustment claim that the reform package implies de-industrialisation, destroying domestic capacity and favouring imports. World Bank researchers insist that there is no evidence for this, pointing out that in nine countries where macropolicies improved, manufacturing output grew substantially faster than before adjustment. Ultimately, though, there is only so much policymakers can achieve. Thereafter, it is up to private initiative and investment, which is where the problem arises. Abundant raw materials and low-cost labour are no longer enough. Technical and managerial skills, scientific and marketing know-how, prompt deliveries and high-quality products are essential, achieved primarily by foreign investment by global companies. In 1990, for instance, Singapore's manufacturing output was almost half that of the entire African continent, due in large part to the presence of some 3,000 affiliates and subsidiaries of multinationals. Unido figures show African productivity levels at about one tenth of those of north American manufacturers - the comparative figure for Asia is 18 per cent. But because average wages in Africa are less than 9 per cent of the north American level, as against 16 per cent in Asia, sub-Saharan producers still have a competitive edge on cost grounds. However, this is not enough; the key role of human capital cannot be exaggerated. In the 20 years to 1990, Africa's productivity rate - relative to north America - fell from 16 per cent to 10.5 per cent, while Asia raised productivity to 18 per cent from 12 per cent. But the most important factor in productivity is the region's low levels of investment in physical plant and in human capital. Government policy will help but the turnround in African industry will depend on the return of the foreign investors. So long as they remain scarce, so too will Africa's industrial capacity.</p>

The tool  was made for the special purpose of machining micromachines.  Prototypes were made for a drawing-to-itself-tool for forming  micro-substances and for a cutting tool. Next, the research  group will develop a machining system that will permit  interchanging tools for micro machining as needed while viewing  the machined material under an electron microscope.    The newly developed ``hikitsuke'' tool succeeded in  attracting to itself copper wire 80 microns (one micron is  one-thousandth of one millimeter) in diameter and millimeters  long and also a silicon block with dimensions of 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.6  millimeters. Three methods of attracting objects are used: air  sucking force, liquid surface tension, and static electric force.    The air sucking force method combines a glass tube with an  inside diameter of 0.1 millimeter and a vacuum pump. It attaches  the object at the end of the glass tube using air sucking force.  The liquid surface tension method uses surface tension created  by sending a liquid (water was used in experiments) to the end  of the same glass pipe. The static electricity method attracts  by using static electricity created by supplying voltage in  between the tool and the platform on which the object rests.  Experiments succeeded in opening indentations the same as that  on dice on 300 micron angle salt crystals using a chisel-type  cutting tool. The chisel is used on super-hard metal alloys with  a blade tip 10 microns wide applied to the processed object and  with added sonic vibration.</p>

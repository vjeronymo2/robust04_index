			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Gun dealers in US face tighter curbs: Sharp rise in licence fee aims to eliminate 80% of 'traders' The US administration plans to follow up its initial success in winning restrictions on gun sales by pressing for tougher controls on gun dealers. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, yesterday outlined plans for a sharp increase in the fee charged by the government for a gun-dealing licence, with the aim of eliminating 80 per cent of those now licensed to trade in firearms. It has been so easy and so cheap to obtain a federal licence that many people go through the minimal paperwork required just so they can order guns from outside their home states and benefit from manufacturers' discounts. Most of the 244,000 dealers now licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a division of Mr Bentsen's Treasury department, operate from their homes. Many do not comply with state and local licensing requirements, but the bureau has been barred from refusing a licence for such non-compliance. Mr Bentsen said he would ask Congress to raise the licence fee to Dollars 600 (Pounds 405) a year from its current level of Dollars 10, which he described as not just ridiculous but 'all the way to reckless'. The annual fee is already due to rise in February to Dollars 66 for a new licence and Dollars 30 for a renewal, as a consequence of the Brady law - passed in December by Congress - which would impose a waiting period on handgun buyers. Higher fees 'should eliminate 200,000 dealers, leaving only the actual ones in place,' Mr Bentsen said. By reducing the number of dealers, the bureau could monitor remaining dealers more closely. Mr Bentsen also promised measures to improve the bureau's computerised records. Fear of crime and violence has become the most prevalent concern cited in US opinion polls, and this has given fresh momentum to efforts to control gun sales. Besides the Brady law, other measures are under discussion in Congress that would ban the sale of certain categories of assault weapon and ammunition. At the same time, sales of firearms, especially handguns, have soared. Many people who favour gun controls have bought weapons for their own protection, while others have sought to stock up to pre-empt any ban that Congress may pass. The idea of a national registry of guns has also been floated, although with an estimated 200m guns already in circulation in the US this would probably prove fruit-less.</p>

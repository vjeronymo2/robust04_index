			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: GM sells three more component plants General Motors continued its disposal of automotive component businesses with the sale of three plants to a newly-formed company in which it will hold a 20 per cent interest. The plants to be sold make starter motors and generators and employ 2,200 workers. Transportation Systems, a company whose investors include Citicorp Venture Capital and Mr Harold Sperlich, former Chrysler president, will take 80 per cent of the joint venture company set up to acquire the business. The disposal, the value of which was not disclosed, marks the latest step in GM's divestment of component businesses. It has now sold six of the 14 businesses that it last year said were for sale. The businesses that are being sold are part of GM's Delco Remy division, which the company said would continue to produce a wide range of components as part of the group. In September, GM agreed to sell an 80 per cent stake in its wiper systems and actuators business to a venture formed with ITT's automotive unit for Dollars 400m. That month it also said it would sell its rear-drive axle drive shaft and related forging operations to American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, a new company formed by former Chrysler executives.</p>

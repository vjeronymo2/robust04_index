			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] The political platforms of Forza  Italia, the National Alliance, and the Northern League--the  three parties which together won the national elections held  27-28 March--can provide some clues on what type of government  program the coalition is likely to propose. A review of those  platforms as presented in the press also indicates that several  fundamental differences in the ideologies of the three parties  may not only make the formation of a government difficult, but  also limit its longevity.  <H5>  Fiscal Policy </H5>   While all three parties agree that Italy's tremendous budget  deficit must be reduced, they differ on how this should be  accomplished. Forza Italia proposes establishing a public debt  reduction fund and a constitutional guarantee that public  expenditures will be covered in full. The National Alliance  proposes reducing the deficit gradually, by reducing the number  of government securities issued, with the exception of those  intended to finance public works. It also favors using Treasury  bonds to pay off the debts of public companies that are slated  to be dismantled. The Northern League believes the public debt  should be eliminated altogether, in this way reducing inflation  and allowing for a monetary policy that would promote  development. All three believe the personal income tax (IRPEF)  and corporate income tax (IRPEG) must be reduced, with Forza  Italia and the Northern League proposing a 30 percent ceiling on  the IRPEF for everyone, and Forza Italia also proposing that the  present 200 different taxes be reduced to 10. Both the Northern  League and Forza Italia advocate "fiscal federalism," giving the  power to collect all taxes to local agencies. Local agencies  would in turn give a certain percentage of the collected  revenues to the central government, or to the "macroregions"  favored by the League as components of their federalist plan.  However, the National Alliance proposes instead that a new  balance be established between taxes for the central government  and those for the local agencies, with the latter as a  substitute, not as an addition to the present local taxes. All  three parties propose a tax rate for each family based on the  number of dependents, and agree that personal savings and state  securities should not be taxed. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 22  March).  <H5>  Employment </H5>   Forza Italia belives that newly created jobs should not be  taxed and that a "cushion" should be created between employment  and unemployment in the form of apprenticeships. The Northern  League proposes reducing fiscal pressure on employers,  introducing salary limitations, and flexibility in work  schedules. The National Alliance is convinced unemployment  affects the South particularly and therefore asks for a new  employment policy for that area. It proposes public investments  in the manufacturing sector and a relaunch of private production  activity through a resumption of public works. (Milan CORRIERE  DELLA SERA, 26 March).  <H5>  Health Insurance </H5>   Forza Italia proposes that health services be privatized,  with the state providing coverage only for those persons who  cannot afford private insurance. In that case, public funds  would not be disbursed to hospitals, but directly to the  citizens in the form of nonnegotiable personal coupons to be  used to purchase private insurance. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA,  26 March). The League calls for abolishing mandatory  participation in the universal health plan and a free choice of  private insurance coverage, with a mixed public-private system  that would include free health care to the needy. (Rome IL  MESSAGGERO, 27 March). The National Alliance espouses an  overhaul of current health services to guarantee standardized  assistance throughout the country. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA,  26 March).  <H5>  Pensions </H5>   Both Forza Italia and the League have called for a gradual  move to a private pension system, with the state providing  pensions for only certain underprivileged categories (Forza  Italia), and the revision of disability pensions (League).  According to the National Alliance, everyone is entitled to a  minimum pension, with those who want and can afford it allowed  to choose a private pension plan "after they have met their  obligation to the less fortunate." (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA,  26 March).  <H5>  Institutional Reform </H5>   Forza Italia proposes the direct election of the president  of  the Republic, who would have the power to nominate the prime  minister and to dissolve both chambers of parliament, in the  latter case forcing his own resignation. According to this  proposal, the government would have to receive a vote of  confidence from parliament in order to avoid dismissal of the  government and dissolution of the chambers. The League has  agreed to reform the state without creating the three republics  it originally proposed. If the reform succeeds in diminishing  the distance economic and social separation between North and  South, a "light federalism" will be sufficient, but if a "strong  federalism" is required, this will be achieved peacefully.  (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). The federalism proposed  by the League is based on macroregions and the direct election  of the prime minister and president of the Republic, who would  be the guarantor of the national Constitution. (Rome IL  MESSAGGERO, 27 March). The National Alliance advocates a  presidential republic and a popular referendum to guarantee  democracy. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). The Alliance  also believes in a strong executive, the direct election of the  prime minister, and further reform of the electoral law. (Rome  IL MESSAGGERO, 27 March).  <H5>  Foreign Policy </H5>   Forza Italia believes the United Nations should be reformed,  and that Italy's participation should be evaluated based on  national interests. Italy should continue membership in NATO,  Forza Italia says, but Italian participation in this  organization should also be reviewed. It also believes in a  common European defense system and in maintaining a "highly  qualified" Italian military. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 15 March).  The League wants a unified Europe and believes NATO is the only  viable defense system for Europe until a common European defense  system is established (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March), but  calls for greater European presence in NATO. Italy's military  should include a mix of volunteers and draftees, says the  League, and conscientious objection should be recognized. The  League also calls for aid to East Europe and Third World  countries to encourage local development, and for prohibiting  the immigration of non-EU [European Union] citizens without work  contracts. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 15 March). The National  Alliance proposes a European seat in NATO and extending NATO  membership to East European countries. It proposes moving  towards European unification by annulling the peace treaty of  1947, while respecting the national diversity of its members.  The territories of Istria and Dalmatia, the Alliance declares,  must acquire multiethnic autonomy through new international  accords. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). According to  IL SOLE--24 ORE of 15 March, the National Alliance has a broad  foreign policy agenda that includes reattaching Istria and  Dalmatia to Italy, creating employment opportunities in Third  World countries to stem the tide of non-EU immigrants, rejecting  the Maastricht Treaty, establishing a European Confederation  that would promote European nationalism against the United  States and Russia, and creating a totally professional Italian  army.</p>

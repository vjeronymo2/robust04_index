			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANCASTER WATER BOARD OFFICIAL PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN ARSON CASE  </P> <P> An Antelope Valley water board member who was arrested following a fire that  heavily damaged his Lancaster home has pleaded not guilty to arson, authorities  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Glenn D. Martin, 66, a member of the Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency  board of directors, was arrested Monday on suspicion of arson of a residential  dwelling, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported.  </P> <P> Martin, who was released after his arraignment on $10,000 bail, is suspected of  setting a fire Thursday in his home in the 500 block of East Avenue J, Deputy  Ron Thomason said. Damage to the home was estimated at $90,000, and county fire  reports say that an "unauthorized junkyard" on the property hindered efforts to  extinguish the 3:45 p.m. fire and also endangered firefighters.  </P> <P> Martin, a 12-year member of the water agency board who was elected to a fourth  four-year term in November, has previously clashed with the city over the  storage of junk metal and other debris on his property, authorities said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Junk Illegally Stored  </P> <P> Last year, Martin, who associates said is retired from the U.S. Air Force and  once served as a fighter pilot during World War II, was convicted under the  city's nuisance law of illegally storing junk at his home, Thomason said.  </P> <P> The city then cleared the debris from his property. However, Martin appealed  the conviction and began collecting junk on his property again, Thomason said.  </P> <P> If Martin is convicted of the felony arson charge, he could face a penalty  ranging from probation to eight years in prison, authorities said. Under state  law, he would also be forced to resign from the water agency if convicted.  </P> <P> "I hope he is not convicted," said Mike Riddell, the water agency's attorney.  "It's a sad situation. He has devoted most of his life to public service and  now this happens."  </P> <P> Martin could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P></p>

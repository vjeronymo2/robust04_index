			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Fatah has declared a 24-hour  strike in the Gaza Strip in the wake of yesterday's incident in  Jabalyah, and threatens to organize three days of violent  clashes with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces].    Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation  to  the talks with the PLO, phoned his counterpart Nabil Sha'th  yesterday to explain that the killing of the six Fatah members  in Gaza had not been an operation initiated by the IDF. Shahaq  said it had been an encounter with an armed gang, and emphasized  that IDF soldiers can only shoot when confronted with armed  masked men.    Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe says that the  purpose of the phone call was to explain the circumstances of  the incident on the eve of the resumption of the talks in Cairo.  It has been asserted more than once in the talks with the PLO  to date that the IDF will take action against any armed man  likely to endanger our troops.    Meanwhile, it has been learned that some 70 percent of the  IDF installations in the Gaza Strip have been relocated to  alternative sites within the boundaries of the Green Line and to  Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. The IDF estimates that  from the moment the agreement with the PLO is signed it will  need three to five weeks to complete the withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho. Our correspondent has learned that Israel does not  object to having the first Palestinian policemen arrive in Gaza  next week even if there is still no agreement with the PLO.  However, the Palestinians make the arrival of the policemen  contingent on the signing of an agreement concerning Hebron.</p>

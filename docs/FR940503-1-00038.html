			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to provide the parties with incentives to cooperate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the discovery phase, there are both mandatory and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretionary sanctions for failure to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information exchange requirements. For example, if a party fails  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to timely provide the name and all supporting information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding any witness it intends to present at a hearing, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witness may not be presented. Similarly, if a party fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely produce a document it intends to introduce at such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing, that document may not be introduced to prove the truth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of what it asserts. Part 28 would be revised to provide that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Respondent fails to timely provide information regarding its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good faith efforts to comply with the Act, then that information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not be used by the Respondent at the hearing. The Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer may also impose additional appropriate sanctions on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party that fails to fully comply with these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conducting the hearing, the Presiding Officer may limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of witnesses and the scope and extent of both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct examination and cross-examination. Cross-examination is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to the scope of the direct examination. The Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer may take testimony in the form that is the most efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the circumstances. No matter what form of testimony is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted, however, the Presiding Officer will make adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision to ensure that each party retains its right of cross-examination if the witness is available to testify or is subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a subpoena.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearing is generally limited to resolving disputed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegations as to liability. Remedy issues are generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed in the parties' closing arguments, unless there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelling need for remedy testimony. Such need could arise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the underlying facts which are material to the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty assessment factors are disputed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As is typical in administrative proceedings, strict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adherence to the Federal Rules of Evidence is not required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 28. Testimony or documentation that is ``relevant, material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or of significant probative value'', including hearsay, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissible, as long as the witness presenting the information is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to cross-examination by any opposing party. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer has the discretion to take official notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain facts, exclusive either of facts relating to settlement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or relating to a person's challenge to a final State or Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed part 28 rules contemplate that each party will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have an opportunity to make an opening statement (with the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making its opening statement first); that the Agency will put on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its prima facie case; and that the Respondent thereafter will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have an opportunity to present its defense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants may present oral closing arguments at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion of the Presiding Officer, and such arguments may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address both liability and remedy issues. The participants may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit supporting documentation regarding remedy. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer does not allow oral closing arguments, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency anticipates that he would solicit the submission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written proposed recommended findings of fact and conclusions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law as to liability and remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under part 28, the Presiding Officer would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to: (1) Certify the administrative record as complete and as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being in compliance with the requirements of part 28; (2) make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the administrative record available to the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator; and (3) prepare and transmit a recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision to the Regional Administrator. The Presiding Officer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to prescribe a remedy would be limited to recommending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the withdrawal of the field citation or recommending the issuance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

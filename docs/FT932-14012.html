			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM urged to act over Timex row MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour party leader, yesterday called on the prime minister to intervene in the Timex strike by referring the conflict to Acas, the independent conciliation and arbitration service, 'without delay'. Mr Smith told the annual conference of the Scottish TUC in Glasgow: 'I call on Mr Major to exercise his responsibility as prime minister to help bring the dispute to an end.' He added: 'He does not need to prejudge the merits of anyone's case - all he needs to do is to put into action a process which could lead to a fair resolution and a just settlement. I hope he can, at the very least, manage to do that.' He said the Timex dispute concerned 340 workers who had been 'sacked for the audacity of challenging compulsory lay-offs and the imposition of poorer working conditions'. He criticised a system of industrial relations that allowed workers to 'lose their livelihood at the whim of a reactionary employer'. Mr Smith said workers needed 'the protection of labour laws which guard their right to work, their right to be represented and their right not to be dismissed unfairly and capriciously'. In a debate about Timex at the Scottish TUC Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU national officer, said a rally against the company on May 15 should 'shake Timex to its roots'. The row expected to erupt in the Labour party over proposals that it back proportional representation for Westminster elections was last night postponed, Ralph Atkins writes. Labour's National Executive Committee had been due to discuss next week the proposal for electoral reform drawn up by Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University, following a debate among the parliamentary party today. But after pressure from Labour MPs the party's leadership agreed that the PLP should instead debate Bosnia today and PR on May 12. The delay will come as temporary relief for some Labour MPs who fear a damaging split over the Plant report. Mr Smith will set out his views on the Plant report at the NEC meeting of May 19. Party officials were last night stressing that the delay would not stop a final decision being taken by the Labour conference in October.</p>

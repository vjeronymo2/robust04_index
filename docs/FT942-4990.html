			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Philip Morris acts against Australian ban on advertising Philip Morris, the US cigarettes, food, and brewing giant, yesterday launched a High Court action in Australia, seeking to overturn the country's ban on cigarette advertising on the grounds that it denies 'commercial freedom of speech'. This is thought to be one of the first attempts by a US cigarette manufacturer to litigate against 'anti-smoking' laws outside the US, and comes as the industry faces increasing pressure from regulators at home and in the international market. The company said it filed a statement of claim because the restrictions imposed by the 1992 Commonwealth Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act were 'so wide-ranging that they deny it the right to take part in debate on political, public and social issues and deny it the normal commercial freedom of speech. 'Important issues of freedom of speech are at stake because the restrictions deny us the right to communicate on political, public and commercial issues,' said Mr David Davies, vice-president at Philip Morris. The 1992 Act made tobacco advertising illegal in Australia from the middle of last year. It will also phase out cigarette sponsorship of sporting events by the mid-1990s unless exemptions are obtained. Existing sponsorship contracts were allowed to run their course. When the legislation was introduced, federal health officials claimed that about 18,000 Australians died each year from tobacco-related diseases and the drain on health services amounted to about ADollars 6.8bn (Pounds 3.3bn) a year. Some 28 per cent of Australians are estimated to be smokers. Philip Morris claimed yesterday its decision to proceed with a lawsuit came last month, after it tried to recall some promotional cigarette lighters, which were thought to be faulty. It said some Australian media groups claimed initially that they could not publish the recall advertisement for fear of breaching the federal law. After a brief delay, modi-fied advertisements were accepted. Philip Morris, which is under assault from the anti-smoking lobby in the US, employs about 4,000 people in Australia and says it pays more than ADollars 1bn in taxes and licence fees to state and federal governments.</p>

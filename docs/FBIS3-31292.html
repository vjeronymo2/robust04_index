UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Bill Aikman said  170  reinforcement troops from the UN Nordic battalion had arrived in  Visoko, 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of Sarajevo, and a  British battalion of some 150 soldiers equipped with about 15  armoured vehicles was on stand-by in the central Bosnian town of  Vitez. He said the reinforcements requested by Rose would  double the number of UN troops currently deployed in Sarajevo.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Wednesday in a  BBC radio interview that Britain would not object to any of its  troops being transferred to Sarajevo. "It's essentially a  matter for General Rose to decide if some some troops would be  more useful in Sarajevo," Hurd said.    The troops would oversee a ceasefire agreement reached last  week between Bosnian Serb and Moslem military leaders under the  threat of a NATO ultimatum for Serbs to remove their heavy  weaponry from around the Bosnian capital by midnight Sunday or  face air strikes.    But Russia's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Vitaliy  Churkhin, said in Zagreb late Tuesday that Russian troops would  not go to Sarajevo to support the NATO ultimatum, which was  issued over Moscow's protests. [passage omitted]    Aikman said that four sophisticated radar systems capable of  detecting a mortar were also being sent here this week by France  and Britain ahead of a NATO deadline for air strikes.    He said France and Britain are each supplying two radars  that  are expected to arrive in the Bosnian capital by Sunday, the  deadline for Bosnia's warring parties to surrender their heavy  weapons or face NATO air strikes.    In Paris, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe reiterated  Wednesday that France was determined to follow through with the  NATO ultimatum. He told a meeting of cabinet ministers that his  trip to Sarajevo over the weekend was aimed at stressing that  point to the belligerants, government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy  said.

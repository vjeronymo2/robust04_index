			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Sword of Damocles' must be removed Sir, How interesting to read Mr Derek Sach's call (Letters, June 20) to improve British banking through the abolition of the floating charge - the sword of Damocles which hangs over so many excellent businesses in the UK. Every meeting held by small business organisations is dominated by the lack of confidence in the UK's banking arrangement for the small and independent business sector. The perceived wisdom in the corridors of power in the Bank of England these days is that banking for small business is much improved, but sadly the real situation is the reverse 'out in the sticks'. Mr Sach's recommendations should be carefully considered not only by the the Department of Trade and Industry, but by the financial secretary to the Treasury - as a matter of urgency.

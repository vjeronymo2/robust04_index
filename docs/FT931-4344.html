			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester falls 29% to Pounds 130.6m CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society yesterday reported a 29 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 183.8m to Pounds 130.6m, for the 12 months to December 31 after making large provisions against loans inherited from the troubled Portsmouth Building Society in 1991. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's performance was heavily weighed down by its exposure to the southern housing market, although it continued to expand its share of the UK mortgage market with a growth in assets to Pounds 16.1bn (Pounds 14.8bn). Although operating profits rose by 34 per cent to Pounds 341.3m (Pounds 255.5m), the society nearly tripled its provisions for bad debts to Pounds 210.7m (Pounds 71.7m). This included Pounds 90m on loans made by the Portsmouth, and some commercial loans. The Portsmouth merger was one of the cases during 1991 in which larger societies took on small southern-based societies with poor mortgage books. The society said yesterday that it did not envisage that further provisioning would be required in the current year to cover inherited problems. It said its mortgage book remained strong by comparison with other societies. The post-tax return on mean assets fell to 0.56 per cent (0.95 per cent), while management expenses per Pounds 100 of mean total assets fell to 63p (68p). The society raised its net share of the mortgage market despite an overall fall in lending to Pounds 2.3bn (Pounds 3.6bn). It also had a net retail inflow of Pounds 474m (Pounds 709m) despite an overall net outflow for the industry of Pounds 295m during 1992. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, said the need for 'prudent provisioning in 1992 to cover one-off items should not detract from the fundamentally sound operating profits and quality mortgage book'.</p>

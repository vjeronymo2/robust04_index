Currently, only 64 per cent available satellite capacity is  in use.    In a presentation before a Pacific Economic Cooperation  Council (PECC) meeting, Wahyu Wi Jayadi, general manager of the  Medan Division of PT Indosat Indonesia, said that with such a  level of utilization, the tendency for each country or even  private company to have its own system will increase competition  among satellite capacity providers despite continued growth in  demand. New system planners must be wary.    Speaking on the topic "The Emerging Demand for Satellite  Communications in the Pacific Rim", Wijayadi said, "There is no  doubt that the demand for satellite transponders in the  Asia-Pacific region will grow considerably in the near future.  The demand is driven by several factors such as globalization,  a trend which is (influencing) more and more sectors; the (high  economic) growth in most Asia-Pacific countries and the climate  of deregulation in the telecommunications industry which has  become more concrete."    Another significant factor contributing to growing demand  for  satellite communication systems is the development of TV  broadcasting systems in the region, he added.    In line with the rapid economic growth in the region, the  International Telecommunications Union estimated that around  US$100 billion will be invested in regional telecommunications  development between 1992 and 2000.    The second factor is the pressing need to rectify the  mismatch between demand and supply for access to a simple dial  tone. Nearly 3 billion people in the Asia-Pacific region have  access to only a little more than 115 million lines, translating  to about one telephone line for every 26 people.    "Anticipating the future conditions of world economics, one  of the tools that every country races to develop is a satellite  communications system," he said.    Historically, most telecommunications operators in  Asia-Pacific have been government or state-owned companies with  a monopoly market structure. In order to catch up with  developments in technology and consumer expectations of better  quality service, governments have been forced to rethink these  monopolies and to restructure the regulatory framework of the  telecommunications sector in each country. The general  objectives of the public sector in deregulating  telecommunications are to improve the quality of services to the  public and businesses, to create a climate more responsive to  market demand, to encourage technological innovation in creating  new services, to achieve a competitive tariff structure, to  expand telecommunications businesses and find alternative  sources to finance these developments.    In a dramatic development for broadcasters, satellites are  being used to transmit television programmes. Several  broadcasters using the technology have established a significant  presence in the Asia-Pacific region--STAR TV, Prime Spot, MTV  Asia, BBC World Service and others. This trend will also  contribute to the growth in demand for satellite communications.    In the past, the telecommunications industry has not been  customer driven, suppliers traditionally decided what their  users would have and provided it to them as a service without  alternatives. The industry has largely operated on the  principle that supply creates demand. Market segmentation and  the tailoring of products and services for specific customers  have been precluded by regulations and by the complacency of  non-competitive,industries.    But Wijayadi predicted that customers will have increasing  influence as deregulation and technological development continue.    "End users of telecommunications must be viewed as  customers.  These consumers now have choices, and their applications driven  needs for sophisticated telecommunications capabilities will  exert pressure on vendors to respond to market demand."    A significant factor in the growing power of customers is  the  changing role of the telecommunications management function in  client organizations. These changes are outlined in the  accompanying table.    Satellite communications services in the Asia-Pacific region  are served by several satellite systems including Intelsat and  Inmarsat. There are four domestic Intelsat satellites in the  Indian Ocean region providing public communications services  such as telephone, telex facsimile and new Intelsat service such  as IBS, IDR, Vista.    "Satellite communications systems are entering an era of  increasing competition with more advanced technology. Global  competitions have the tendency to be more unpredictable, and so  it has become in the Asia-Pacific region," he noted.</p>

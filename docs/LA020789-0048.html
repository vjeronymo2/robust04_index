			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURPRISE WINNER IN DOWNHILL;  </P> <P> WEST GERMAN BEATS ZURBRIGGEN, GIRARDELLI AND REST OF THE BEST  </P> <P> And the new world champion in the men's downhill is . . .  </P> <P> Pirmin Zurbriggen? Guess again, he tied for 15th.  </P> <P> Marc Girardelli? Nope, Luxembourg's one-man ski team was 21st.  </P> <P> Peter Mueller? No, but you're getting warmer. The defending gold medalist from  1987 placed second and got the silver medal this time around.  </P> <P> Give up?  </P> <P> It was Hansjoerg Tauscher, so little known that his biography wasn't even  included in the sport's bible, "Ski Racing Redbook," for the 1988-89 season.  </P> <P> West Germany, the country that gave the world tennis stars Steffi Graf and  Boris Becker, now has a ski champion, too. He is 21, from Oberstdorf, and his  best finish in a World Cup downhill so far this season was a fifth place at  Laax, Switzerland, last month.  </P> <P> No matter what happens in future cup races, he's the reigning titleholder until  the next World Alpine Ski Championships at Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria, Jan.  21-Feb. 3, 1991.  </P> <P> Tauscher, starting No. 9, sailed down the 2 1/8-mile Beaver Creek course in 2  minutes 10.39 seconds Monday, edging Mueller, who was No. 11, by .19 of a  second.  </P> <P> Mueller, 31, who earned his fifth straight medal -- one gold and four silvers  -- in world championship and Olympic competition since 1984, led a Swiss sweep  of the four places behind Tauscher. Karl Alpiger earned the bronze by finishing  another .09 behind Mueller, and was followed by countrymen Daniel Mahrer and  William Besse.  </P> <P> If there was any prerace hint that this might be Tauscher's day, it could have  been the fact that he was racing on Volkl skis, the same make used by  Switzerland's Maria Walliser when she demolished the women's downhill field by  1 1/2 seconds Sunday.  </P> <P> Apparently, they are very effective on courses made soft by a fresh snowfall,  according to Mueller, who uses Blizzard skis.  </P> <P> But Tauscher said: "Yes, the ski plays a big role, as was shown today and  yesterday, but you still have to be able to ski the ski."  </P> <P> Mueller did not seem disappointed with his second place, saying, "Every  downhiller likes to win, but any medal is a good job, especially on this easy  course and under the changed conditions.  </P> <P> "The new snow in the last three days made it easy for anybody to win. We have  not had conditions like this in a major race for five or six years. There was  just not enough time to make the necessary adjustments in technique or (skis)."  </P> <P> Mueller was not surprised that his teammate Zurbriggen, the 1988 Olympic  downhill champion, and Girardelli, who won three of the last four World Cup  downhills, fared so poorly here.  </P> <P> "They have had the same difficulties under similar conditions before," he said.  </P> <P> Tauscher didn't worry about the new snow or anything else. He just skied as if  he owned the mountain.  </P> <P> "I had a good run, but it wasn't perfect," he said. "I never thought I could  beat the kings, Mueller and Zurbriggen. They have always been my heroes, along  with Markus Wasmeier (of West Germany), so this is a fantasy come true.  </P> <P> "I am not even able to realize yet what this gold medal will mean. It is going  to take weeks or months for me to feel it."  </P> <P> Asked if he was surprised by his victory, Tauscher said, "When I had that  finish in the top five at Laax, I knew that I might have a chance to win a race  sometime."  </P> <P> Tauscher, it turns out, came to skiing somewhat reluctantly.  </P> <P> "I was 2 years old the first time I skied and I didn't enjoy it a bit," he  said. "But later, after I started to school, I decided to try skiing again, and  this time I liked it. Then I began racing and moving up through the different  levels until I got to where I am now."  </P> <P> Which is the new official king of the downhill for the next two years.  </P> <P> Girardelli, trying for his second straight gold medal after winning the men's  combined last week, congratulated Tauscher but said, "I had no chance in this  race. On such a course, your equipment must be perfectly suited to the snow  conditions. If it's not, you can forget it."  </P> <P> Zurbriggen, who at least finished six places higher than Girardelli, said, "I  can't be too unhappy, since I have already won many titles. Tauscher had a  great race, but unfortunately, when you make one mistake on this course, you  have lost the race.  </P> <P> "My ribs (injured in a training spill last Wednesday) still bother me somewhat,  but I hope to win a medal yet."  </P> <P> Sharing 15th place with Zurbriggen, exactly 2 seconds behind the winner, were  Christophe Ple of France and -- surprise -- an American, Jeff Olson, 23, of  Bozeman, Mont.  </P> <P> Perhaps even more shocking, another U.S. racer finished ahead of Olson. Tommy  Moe, 11 days short of his 19th birthday, was 13th, 1.88 seconds out, after  starting No. 35.  </P> <P> The native of Missoula, Mont., who now lives in Palmer, Alaska, said he had  never been higher than 52nd in six World Cup downhills.  </P> <P> He agreed with Mueller that the course "was not really tough," but added,  "You've just got to nail every section."  </P> <P> Moe nailed enough of them to build up U.S. hopes for '91 and the Winter  Olympics the following year at Albertville, France.  </P> <P> Monday's race, delayed two days by the early-weekend storm, was held in subzero  temperatures but under sunny skies, with a crowd of about 2,000 shivering in  the finish area.  </P> <P> Today, Tamara McKinney of the United States, winner of the women's combined  gold medal last week, will again challenge Switzerland's Vreni Schneider in the  women's slalom at Beaver Creek.  </P> <P> Then the remaining events -- the two super-G races Wednesday, the men's giant  slalom Thursday, the women's giant slalom Saturday and the men's slalom Sunday  -- will be held on Vail Mountain.  </P> <P> Don't look now, but after the first four events, the Swiss, who won eight of 10  gold medals in the 1987 world championships on their home slopes in  Crans-Montana, have only one gold medal here -- the same as West Germany,  Luxembourg and the United States.  </P> <P> However, Schneider figures to break up that deadlock before sundown today.  </P></p>

The license authorizes possession and use of uranium for the manufacture of fuel assemblies for commercial nuclear power plants. The license also authorizes possession and use of plutonium in sealed sources and as mixed oxide in stored waste. The license was last renewed on September 10, 1987, and was due to expire September 30, 1992. The licensee submitted an application for renewal of the license on August 25, 1992. The license has continued in effect since then under the timely renewal provision of 10 CFR 70.33(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's regulations in 10 CFR Part 20 (Standards for Protection Against Radiation) prohibit the release of insoluble non-biological licensed materials to sanitary sewers. Specifically, 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1) provides that a licensee may discharge licensed material into sanitary sewer systems only if, among other things, the material is readily soluble in water. The purpose of this prohibition is to prevent accumulation and possible reconcentration of the materials in the sanitary sewer system, sewage treatment plants, and sewage sludge. While revised Part 20 was effective in June 1991, licensees were permitted to defer implementation of the rule until January 1, 1994. 56 Fed. Reg. 23360, May 21, 1991; 57 Fed. Reg. 38588, August 26, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 28, 1994, the NRC issued Information Notice (IN) 94&hyph;07, which discussed two approaches that could be used for determining a chemical compound's solubility in water. The IN emphasized that unless releases qualify as being ``readily soluble,'' 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1) would prohibit release to sanitary sewers absent the grant of an exemption to that regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPC is authorized by License SNM&hyph;1227, Safety Condition S&hyph;1, to operate a laundry facility for the cleaning of protective clothing and equipment contaminated with uranium compounds and to discharge liquid effluents to the Richland Municipal Sewerage System. These effluents are continuously monitored, and composite samples are analyzed for uranium and regulated chemicals. Results of the liquid effluent monitoring are reported to the NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 70.59. The results are also reported to the Washington State Department of Ecology, Water Quality Division and the Director, Water and Waste Utilities, of the City of Richland.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 14, 1994, SPC submitted an application for an exemption from 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1). SPC stated that based on 1993 data an evaluation of liquid effluents had demonstrated that the sewer discharge from its retention tanks, which receive the bulk of their input from the contaminated clothing laundry, contained small amounts of insoluble uranium. SPC reported that the average uranium concentration was 0.24 parts per million; the liquid discharge was approximately 4,000 gallons per day; the total uranium discharged to the sanitary sewer annually was 1.47 kilograms, or 0.0026 curies of uranium; and the insoluble uranium fraction measured by filtration is approximately 59 percent of the total discharged uranium, or 0.0015 curies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information contained in SPC's exemption request indicates that SPC may be in violation of 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1). SPC was required to comply with the provisions of 10 CFR 20.2003 by January 1, 1994, and yet has reported that 59 percent of the uranium discharges to the sanitary sewer from its retention tanks are insoluble. The filing of an exemption request did not and does not relieve SPC from the obligation to comply with NRC regulations. The NRC staff's review of the exemption request has not been completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPC is hereby notified that it must comply with the provisions of 10 CFR 20.2003 notwithstanding the fact that it has requested an exemption from that regulation. Only in the event that the exemption request is granted may SPC discharge any non-biological insoluble licensed material into sanitary sewerage. While the request is pending, SPC could be subject to enforcement action for violating NRC regulations prohibiting such discharges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of the information contained in SPC's exemption request, further information is needed. Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 161c, 161o, 182, and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.204, in order for the Commission to determine whether enforcement action should be taken to ensure compliance with NRC statutory and regulatory requirements, SPC is required to submit by July 6, 1994, to the Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555, with a copy to the Chief, Fuel Cycle Licensing Branch, the following information, in writing and under oath or affirmation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. a. State what actions SPC has taken to ensure compliance with 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1) since January 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Describe the circumstances, since January 1, 1994, under which non-biological insoluble licensed materials were discharged into sanitary sewerage, and the actions, if any, which were taken to prevent further discharges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. State what actions SPC will take to ensure future compliance with 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address. After receiving your response, the NRC will determine whether further action is necessary to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 24th day of June 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert M.

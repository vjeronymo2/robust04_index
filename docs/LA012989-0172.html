			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RED LIGHTS, FLASHING LIGHTS AND SIRENS  </P> <P> Since drinking and driving is legal (hot coffee that is!) plus smoking and  listening to stereo, sirens are often not heard. Assuming that the driver is  still looking at the road he can see red stop lights. How about mandatory,  automatic red lights that go on at all nearest intersections when sirens and/or  flashing red lights go on -- and mandatory use of sirens and/or flashing red  lights to prevent more carnage in police chases, which should be outlawed (a  very unlikely event).  </P> <P> PAT COIL  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

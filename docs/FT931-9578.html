			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Assemblee Nationale (Elections '93): Pensions dilemma gives politicians grey hairs - Alice Rawsthorn on ageing France's growing gap between contributions and benefits MRS Marie-Christine Revel works at a Paris stationery shop which is closing. A widow in her late 50s, Mrs Revel has little hope of finding another job. 'I'm not worried,' she said. 'Whatever happens I'll have my pension.' France's pension system is a point of national pride. People who retire after 60 having worked for 37.5 years are entitled to a state pension equivalent to 50 per cent of their average salary in their 10 highest-earning years, up to a maximum of FFr149,820 (Pounds 18,475) a year. This means that most of France's 7.8m pensioners live in comparative comfort, a 'fundamental right' that President Francois Mitterrand has vowed to protect. The system, introduced after the Second World War, is run by the state, which pays for pensions from the money received from those in work. But the French population is ageing. There are fewer working people supporting more pensioners. The problem is getting worse. And it is one of the trickiest political issues in the electoral campaign. So far a succession of French governments has chosen to ignore the pension problem. They have been deterred by the complexity of the issue and by the opposition of the trade unions and the president. The present Socialist administration has continued the tradition. An attempt last year by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, to supplement the state system with a private scheme was stymied by the unions. Mr Beregovoy was forced to compromise with modest proposals for personal equity plans. But the strains on the system are now so intense that the next government may not be able to delay. The system already operates at an annual deficit of FFr20bn with a ratio of 1.8 employees to each pensioner. By the year 2010, there will be just 1.4 employees for every pensioner. This means the deficit will widen unless pensions are cut or employees' contributions increase. So far the treatment of the pension issue in the election campaign has shown all the danger signs of fudge and compromise that have impeded past attempts at reform. Mr Beregovoy last month tried again to focus the Socialists' attention on the issue by trumpeting new proposals for reform. The prime minister watered down his earlier ideas about introducing private pensions into a less ambitious plan for a fund (financed by the FFr100m proceeds of the privatisation programme) to plug the pension deficit. But his tentative suggestion that the Socialists might consider encouraging people to work for 40, rather than 37.5 years, met with an immediate rebuff from President Mitterrand. He saw it as a threat to an earlier Socialist reform that reduced the retirement age to 60. Mr Beregovoy hastily denied that he had any intention of raising the retirement age. But the row over the Socialists' pension policy has rumbled on. The prime minister will begin to try to thrash out a final policy with the unions and employers on Monday. He is also expected to revive the tricky question of the minimum working period. The conservative coalition of the RPR and UDF, the firm favourite to win the election, has revelled in Mr Beregovoy's embarrassment. The right has at least hammered out a joint pension policy, but in many respects its plans are as vague as those of the Socialists. The conservatives have fought shy of raising the retirement age which, according to Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the RPR, would be 'psychologically impossible'. But they do plan to offer incentives for people to work longer by offering full pensions to those working for 40 years, with reduced payments for 37.5 years. They have also revived Mr Beregovoy's old ideas for private pension funds, which would be welcomed by the French financial community as a needed source of new investment for the stock market. But this would involve persuading the French electorate to invest in their own pensions as well as funding the current state system. Mr Edouard Balladur, tipped as a future conservative prime minister, has suggested softening the blow with tax cuts. 'Let's allow people to choose between spending and saving,' he said. But the RPR and UDF have yet to spell out how they plan to structure their private pension proposals. All they have said is that they will commission a study into the issue 'as soon as possible'. The French voters have heard that before. There have, after all, already been five official studies into France's pension problem since 1985.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           AGEING FRANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The System:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMPLOYEES:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 14m contributors providing FFr268.3bn a year (contribution of 16.35% of up to an annual maximum of FFr149,820 - 9.8% from the employer and 6.55% from the employee)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PENSIONERS:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.8m pensioners receiving FFr282.7bn a year (with 50% of average salary in 10 top earning years to a maximum of FFr149,820 if at least 60 years old, having worked for 37.5 years)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: L'Express  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> EASING OF U.S. OIL SANCTIONS IS EXPECTED  </P> <P> President Reagan is likely to act this week on a proposal to lift some  sanctions against American oil companies doing business in Libya to keep  Moammar Kadafi from "getting a windfall," an Administration official said  today.  </P> <P> The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said the easing of prohibitions on  the U.S. companies would be designed to prevent them from losing assets in  Kadafi's North African nation. A delicate agreement between the Libyan leader  and the companies expires June 30, and he then might seize their assets.  </P> <P> Any Reagan action would be limited and would not apply to the comprehensive  economic sanctions in trade and other areas that have been in effect since  1986, the Administration official stressed. Reagan recently signed an executive  order renewing the restrictions for a year.  </P> <P> "This is to prevent Kadafi from getting a windfall," the official said of the  oil proposal. "It's not that we're getting soft on Kadafi."  </P></p>

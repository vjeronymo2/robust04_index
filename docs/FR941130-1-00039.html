			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After comparing the other two programs, NIST's NV LAP and OSHA's NRTL, MSHA has selected the OSHA Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory program as the appropriate platform by which private sector, independent laboratories could provide prototype testing and evaluation of products for use in mines. The Agency has chosen the OSHA program over the NIST NV LAP program for several reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, in order for a laboratory to become recognized or accredited as an NRTL under OSHA's program, the laboratory must be independent; i.e., free from influence by manufacturers whose products it tests and evaluates, by vendors and suppliers, and by employers using approved products. This independence does not exist under NIST's NV LAP program to accredit calibration and testing laboratories because manufacturers' in-house laboratories are eligible to receive accreditation. Independence of the testing laboratory from the manufacturer is essential for MSHA and the public to have confidence in testing and evaluation conducted outside its Approval and Certification Center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the OSHA NRTL accreditation signifies that the independent laboratory has the capability (including proper testing equipment and facilities, trained staff, written testing procedures, and calibration and quality control programs) to perform testing and evaluation of products to determine compliance with specified design, construction, or test requirements. An NRTL does more than just test products. One key feature distinguishing an NRTL from a testing house, such as one accredited by NIST under NV LAP, is its ability to evaluate products during production to ensure that the products conform to technical standards. The term ``evaluation'' means the systematic examination of the extent to which a product fulfills specified requirements. Thus, an NRTL must be qualified both to test products to specific standards and to certify, after evaluation, that the products meet applicable requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, an important factor in MSHA's decision to use laboratories accredited by OSHA is the requirement that NRTLs maintain oversight of products they test, evaluate, and certify and which carry the NRTL's marking. One of the goals of MSHA's modified approval proposal is to provide greater assurance that products actually in service in underground mines are manufactured as approved. OSHA's program, which mandates organized product ``follow-up,'' would provide this assurance. This ``follow-up'' program serves three functions. It (1) implements control procedures for identifying listed or labeled products; (2) to the extent necessary, conducts production line inspections to ensure conformance with test and evaluation standards; and (3) to the extent necessary, initiates post-marketing field inspections to ensure that the product continues to meet the test standards and requirements. Laboratories accredited under the NV LAP program, because they only test and do not evaluate product compliance, are not required to conduct product auditing functions such as those an NRTL must perform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OSHA procedures for recognizing Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories are set forth in Appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.7. (See 53 FR 12123, April 12, 1988.) This appendix provides requirements and criteria which OSHA uses to evaluate and recognize an NRTL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Appendix A, each applicant for accreditation as an NRTL must list the specific test standards it intends to use. OSHA then evaluates the laboratory's capabilities based on the list and an on-site review by an assessment team. As a part of the accreditation process, the assessment team visits the applicant laboratory to verify its capabilities, including facilities, test equipment, calibration program, product handling procedures, product evaluation procedures, test procedures, technical reports, technical records, test standards, quality assurance program, internal audits, complaint resolution procedures, follow-up program for manufacturers, personnel programs, and other procedures for producing credible findings and objective, unbiased reports. Since the inception of the OSHA program in 1988, MSHA has assisted OSHA in assessing the capability of applicant laboratories to fulfill the requirements of the NRTL program. In this cooperative effort, MSHA personnel brought to the OSHA program broad experience in test procedures and conformity assessment of products to technical requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing a laboratory's application and capabilities, OSHA makes a preliminary decision to grant or deny the application. This decision is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for comment. After the comment period, which must be at least 60 days, the validity of any comments received is evaluated. These evaluations are used to help determine whether the applicant has met the criteria for accreditation. Upon approval, a final announcement is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  outlining the scope of the recognition and any conditions that apply to the newly-recognized NRTL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each recognition lasts for 5 years. During that time, OSHA exercises oversight to assess conformance of the NRTL with the terms of its accreditation. Unresolved issues or discrepancies could result in withdrawal of the NRTL recognition. At the present time, twelve laboratories are accredited by OSHA under its NRTL program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

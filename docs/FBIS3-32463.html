This  announcement was made by President Carlos Menem during the 27  January cabinet meeting at Government House.    The head of state informed his ministers that Scopa is  stepping down from his post to become SIDE Secretary Hugo  Anzorregui's aide as of 1 February.    The president reportedly told Scopa: "I am grateful to him  for continuing to work and cooperate in this government  department." As Media Secretary then reported, Scopa attended  the cabinet meeting in lieu of Anzorregui in his absence.  <H5>  National Security </H5>   The government on 27 January made clear that governors will  have to sit on "the National Security Council as permanent  members as they request joining the council."    This information was provided in a decree issued by the  Executive Branch and published in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE on 27  January. The decree clarifies the invitation made to governors  in Article 11 of the law on national security (24059).    The decree added that in the current National Security  Council "it is possible to notice that governors have not been  expressly incorporated in the council as members. It is totally  incompatible with the spirit and letter of the Constitution that  provincial governors -- or government ministers, if power is  delegated to them -- have not been requested to sit on the  National Security Council while provincial police chiefs are  already full members of it."</p>

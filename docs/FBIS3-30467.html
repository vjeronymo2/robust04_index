			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava Feb 2 (CTK) -- The primary task of the  Slovak foreign policy is to develop relations with the  neighbouring and European Union (EU) states, says a report  submitted by Premier Vladimir Meciar to the parliamentary  session today.    Slovakia has been recognised by 123 countries and diplomatic  relations have been established with 106 states. Among European  states, only Liechtenstein has not recognised Slovakia, due to  unclear property issues.    The mutual distrust and tense atmosphere in relations with  Hungary have not been overcome in spite of (Slovakia's)  accommodating steps. Hungary is to be blamed for the current  situation since it has questioned Slovakia at international  forums by stressing the problems concerning the ethnic Hungarian  minority (ethnic Hungarians number 560,000 people, 11 percent of  the 5-million Slovak population) and nourishing irredentist  tendencies of several representatives of the ethnic Hungarian  parties in Slovakia, the report states.    Turning to relations to Hungary, the report mentions the  need  to sign a bilateral treaty of friendship and cooperation and to  resolve dispute over the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric  project at the International Court in the Hague.    The report stresses the importance of the European agreement  on Slovakia's association with the EU and the provisional  agreement on trade and related issues between Slovakia and the  EU signed last year. Membership in the Council of Europe was  also a success, the report says.    It points out relatively poor dissemination of information  about Slovakia abroad. The interest of foreign media and  political representatives focuses on the expediently selected  issues such as the protection of the ethnic minorities' rights,  freedom of press, conversion of arms production and situation of  Romanies (Gypsies), the report complains.</p>

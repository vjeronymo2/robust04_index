			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Bonds: EBRD joins EdF in post-poll rush of issues THE European Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development and Electricite de France were two of the biggest names leading a rush of deals in various currencies yesterday. Issuers had held back from tapping the international bond market in the lull ahead of the US election. A prestigious borrower in any market, EBRD made its debut in the Euroyen sector with a Y35bn five-year issue. The yield spread tightened slightly to 32 basis points over comparable Japanese government bonds, from a launch spread of 34 basis points. The issue could be as important in strategic terms for Sakura Finance International, which lead-managed the deal along with Nomura International, as for the borrower. While the bond itself was widely agreed to be successful and well executed, Sakura came in for some sniping in the market for indulging in that traditional Japanese activity, taking a long-term strategic view which overrides other considerations. Put simply, it is thought to be loss-leading to develop its role as a player in the Euroyen market. The first post-election US dollar deals included another capped and collared floating rate note, for EdF. The Dollars 100m 10-year issue will pay Libor minus 25 basis points, subject to a minimum rate of 5 1/8 per cent and a maximum of 8 1/4 per cent. This was seen as aggressively priced but EdF is still a name in demand, even though it no longer carries an explicit state guarantee. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said it launched the deal in response to continuing demand for top quality collared floaters. Elsewhere, EdF is taking advantage of continuing strong international demand for the French franc with a FFr2bn five-year 8 1/4 per cent bond through J. P. Morgan. The Canadian dollar sector saw aggressive issues from two classic names in the three-year sector where demand is said to be particularly strong for current coupon paper and attractive swap opportunities. Always a good retail name, IBM is raising CDollars 150m over three years at 6 5/8 per cent through its European funding subsidiary. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is lead manager. Some bankers described pricing of DSL Bank's CDollars 125m three-year 6 1/2 per cent bond as looking very tight at launch, but others argued that triple-A German entities are seldom seen in this market.</p>

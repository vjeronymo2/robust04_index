			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: PARABLES WITH AN AUDIBLE PING!;  </P> <P> FAMILY SINS BY WILLIAM TREVOR (VIKING: $18.95; 251 PP.)  </P> <P> A secret is hidden not once, but every day. In William Trevor's stories, each  daily concealment is the thinnest of layers. Added one by one, they work up  over the years a texture as rich as flake-pastry. Besides the richness, they  also work up tension. And at some point, the tension snaps; a hidden shame,  longing or meanness is revealed with an almost audible ping!  </P> <P> Pings! are not much found in the short stories written in this country  nowadays. Our newer writers dismantle the spring even as they tighten it, and  the final release is a dampened-down Chirr!  </P> <P> There are good contemporary reasons for this, and unquestionably, the stories  of the Irishman Trevor can seem old-fashioned. In his new collection, not as  strong as "The Silence in the Garden" and "Fools of Fortune," which preceded  it, this faintly archaic note is especially noticeable.  </P> <P> No writer uses more cunning strategies or a more finely meshed prose. These  should be almost enough in themselves, but perhaps they involve more artfulness  than life. Trevor, in any case, seems to require a theme of some sweep -- the  passing of time and history over Irish lives -- for his skills to do themselves  justice, for his pings! to suggest the striking of a tower clock and not simply  the four minutes of an egg-timer.  </P> <P> Two of the egg-timer stories take a frequent Trevor theme, and delicately  elaborate it. The protagonist of "In Love With Ariadne," middle-aged and  established, still carries his longing for a girl he had met at the boarding  house where he lodged as a university student.  </P> <P> Shy and fragile, she had entered a convent as soon as he revealed his  attraction. Shame sent her there; her father had been caught making advances to  a child. On a snowy night years later -- we think of the snow in "The Dead" --  a bus passes, Trevor writes. "A lone figure stares out into the blurred night,  hating the good sense that draws him away from loitering gloomily outside a  convent."  </P> <P> Another youthful love set in unhospitable soil is recalled by an artist, now in  her 30s. She had gone as an au pair to a French family living in the Jura. Mme.  Langevin was kind and welcoming, but with a touch of steel. During the war,  left alone to run the estate, she had shot a German soldier. And when she  senses a spark between the girl and her husband, she quietly puts an end to his  custom of driving her, on her days off, to a neighboring village. For the  artist, now, an ocean of yearning surges in a teaspoon of memory. Not a drop  spills.  </P> <P> The transactions of love and of regret could not be better set out, nor could  every last detail of their setting: the pinched Dublin boarding house, the  French country estate. Yet both have the air of a geometric proof; the  characters have no real shape outside the shape of their transactions.  </P> <P> The same is true of the transactions of malice. In "The Third Party," a husband  meets in a bar with the man that his wife is leaving him for. All bluff  understanding and sportsmanship, the husband works a needling torment of his  rival, capped with a revelation that will take full revenge both on the other  man and on the faithless wife. In "Coffee With Oliver," we get an exquisite  portrait of a middle-aged scoundrel who lives in Italy on remittances from his  wife, and on his own careful meannesses.  </P> <P> The geometry is less naked in "August Saturday." A woman unexpectedly meets, at  a country-club gathering of her set -- old friends, all of them -- a man who  had been her lover one night, years before, after another such gathering. The  dinner, the bantering and reminiscing among the couples are a tapestry of  shared lives; the presence of the outsider and the memories he evokes are a red  thread through it.  </P> <P> All of these stories have a fine command of texture and pace; the polish of a  supreme attentiveness. Yet they are remote. They float in a curious idleness;  no necessity reaches out to us from them.  </P> <P> It is in the stories set among the impoverished homes and farms of rural  Ireland that Trevor's gifts find a more important use. In "Kathleen's Field,"  the daughter of a hardscrabble farmer goes to work as a maid for a local  shopkeeper so that her wages can pay for a well-sited field that will let her  struggling family survive. The shopkeeper abuses her sexually; she has no  choice but to put up with it. We feel the fearful wound to her spirit, not so  much in the abuse itself as in her helpless knowledge that other girls, who had  worked there and quit, will know the shame of her staying on.  </P> <P> The burden of unjust shame gives passion and life to the other rural stories.  In "A Husband's Return," Maura Brigid Colleary, her brother, Hiney, and their  mother live half-destroyed by it. Maura Brigid had married Lawless, a young  neighbor. Six months later he ran off with Bernadette, her sister and the  family favorite. And Bernadette died, pregnant.  </P> <P> Hiney lodges his pain in stolid labor, Mrs. Colleary in endurance, Maura Brigid  in longing for her vanished husband. The family lives by its myth: Lawless is a  scoundrel, Bernadette a poor victim. And when Lawless asks to come back, and  convinces Maura that it was her sister who was the seducer, she struggles to  get the myth changed.  </P> <P> But her family cannot put aside its image of Bernadette; it is all they have.  Maura Brigid must live on, not only husbandless but also bearing the story's  burden: She is the one who, by foolishly marrying a wicked man, brought death  to her saintly sister and disgrace upon them all.  </P> <P> For us, of course, it may be hard to think of shame as having the power to  become a story's heart's blood. It is a rural, not an urban agony; it burns in  poor and enclosed communities where honor is the only treasure. It is  remarkable that a modern and sophisticated writer is able to take such a notion  from the book of dead sayings, and make it live so ardently.  </P></p>

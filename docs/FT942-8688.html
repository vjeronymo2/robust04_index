			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Favourites of the fraudsters Illicit refunds. By pretending to channel food outside the EU while selling it inside the Union, fraudsters can both gain an export subsidy and capitalise on higher EU food prices. A favourite method is to forge customs documents saying food is going to eastern Europe while selling it, for instance, in Belgium. Meat carousels. Frozen meat can be shipped between several different countries to maximise refunds. One shipment of east European beef recently went from Italy to Malta, back to Italy and then to Austria, with the refunds gained twice. Mayonnaise madness. Similar scams work for processed foods such as mayonnaise or chocolate biscuits. By transporting the items several times in and out of the Union, traders may be able to over-claim on export refunds for the raw ingredients such as sugar. Switched labels. With different categories of food being given different export subsidies, traders may incorrectly describe specific foodstuffs to claim higher refunds. This has happened, for instance, with cheese labelled as Gouda when it was lower-quality cheese ineligible for a refund. Shrunken stores. Crooks can capitalise on the 'intervention' payments made to take foodstuffs off the European market. Fraudsters appear to have gained Ecu200m (Pounds 153m) by invoicing for invisible wheat supposedly put in Italy's intervention store. Crop capers. With many crops grown in Europe eligible for subsidies, farmers may inflate figures for the amount of land under cultivation with a particular crop. This practice is believed to have been rife in the Greek cotton industry. Animal antics. Farmers may be tempted to give higher numbers for their livestock than exist to claim larger subsidies. The Commission is attempting to counter this with a computerised database of European cows. Crooked roads. Substantial sums earmarked for infrastructure programmes may have been diverted to fraudsters through false invoicing or money being paid out for projects which never finished.</p>

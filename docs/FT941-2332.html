			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Fall in fish stocks spurs Dollars 30m Clinton aid The Clinton Administration is rushing Dollars 30m of emergency assistance to fishing communities in the north-east suffering from a collapse in fish stocks. The US Commerce Department said this was the first crisis in the fishing industry which warranted extensive federal assistance. Some 20,000 jobs are in jeopardy from the fall-off in stocks and new federal rules designed to rebuild them. Washington is still worried about jobs, which are being created at a slower rate than in past economic recoveries. Such funding as is available in these days of stringent budgetary restraint is given high profile treatment. The Commerce Department credited the assistance to President Clinton's trip to Boston last week when he directed Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary and Mr Leon Panetta, office of management and budget director, to develop an aid package for New England. The department had been working on the package for several weeks. Mr Brown was in Boston yesterday with members of New England's congressional delegation, Massachusetts governor Mr William Weld, a Republican, and members of fishing communities to make the announcement. The financing will be provided by two commerce department agencies as well as states, localities and the private sector. Commerce's Economic Development Administration, which will provide Dollars 18m of emergency assistance funds to go to communities for reinvestment projects and diversification. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will provide Dollars 12m for loan guarantees and grants to stimulate investment in alternative activities and establish a series of fishery assistance centres to serve as a clearing house for assistance to fishermen. The administration is also proposing a comprehensive initiative to build sustainable fisheries. It is designed 'to produce billions in overall economic gains and thousands of jobs annually by the end of the decade,' the commerce department said.</p>

The prime  minister believes his candidacy to be "professional, prepared,  competent, and responsible" within this government, Kwasniewski  said.    The president's objections connected to the FOZZ [Foreign  Debt Servicing Fund] affair are not substantive, and they are  meaningless when confronted with official reports received by  the prime minister from the prosecutor general and the head of  the State Protection Office, which state that "there are no  grounds why Rosati should not hold the highest government  posts," Kwasniewski said.    In his opinion, the president is once again "not showing  proper interest in stabilizing the situation in the country."  The argument that someone is working abroad and is involved  there with the process of transforming the economies of West  European countries just does not hold water, he added.    "Everything is now in the hands of the prime minister," said  Kwasniewski. He also assured his audience that Rosati would not  make any hasty decision.    Should the prime minister receive an official letter from  the  president, we will be dealing with a new situation, but this  will be a situation between the coalition and the president,  declared Kwasniewski.</p>

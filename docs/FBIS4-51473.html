			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Clinton Has Made a Wise Decision"]    [Text] China issued a statement to express its  welcome as U.S. President Clinton announced his decision on  the renewal of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status and  declared that all future MFN decisions involving China would be  delinked from human rights. This is a new turning point in the  U.S.' handling of its relations with China since the "4 June"  incident of 1989. Beijing gave a prompt response. The PRC  Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement yesterday  expressing its welcome for the decision, also pointing out that  Sino-American relations face a favorable historic opportunity  and that China will continue to adopt measures to develop  relations between the two countries.    Clinton's decision met the expectations of all quarters,  because facts have clearly shown that if the United States  continued to apply pressure on the pretext of human rights  issues, China would never accept it. If China took retaliatory  action, the attack on the United States would not be  insignificant. Apart from the United States, Hong Kong's import  and export trade would also suffer great setbacks, and even  Southeast Asian countries would be generally harmed.    A wise man never takes a decision which harms others but  does  not benefit himself, let alone injures himself. Recently, more  and more figures in U.S. financial and economic circles and  congressmen have successively issued warnings to Clinton urging  him not to act rashly in dealing with China's MFN. The focus of  the U.S. economic recovery is centered on the Asia-Pacific  region and depends on the vast market of 21st century China, a  country with a population of 1.2 billion. [sentence as  published] After China rejoins the GATT, large numbers of  American products will be exported to China. Under the principle  of fair competition, Sino-American trade will develop further.  This will also be beneficial to reducing the U.S. trade deficit.    The United States is hoping for the expansion of  China's vast market America's Boeing and the computer,  electronic component, telecommunications, and petrochemical  industries are placing high hopes on the expansion of China's  vast markets. If the vast market of 1.2 billion with unlimited  potential was lost because of the so-called "human rights"  issue, leading to a great increase in unemployment, it would  have been too late for the decision maker to repent.    The change in the situation is independent of man's will.  China's political and economic position in the present-day Asia-  Pacific region and in the world can no longer be wantonly  manipulated by foreign countries. It is incompatible with  reason to link human rights with MFN status. It could never  hold ground in the international community.    The fact is, in the past five years since the "4 June"  incident, China has opened its door wider to the outside world  and has done more to develop its economy and stabilize its  society. Public sentiment has become calm. The advanced  nations of the West, Southeast Asian countries, East European  countries, Russia, and other countries have been competing with  one another to develop economic and trade relations with China.  Some figures inside the American government have also realized  that it is impossible to continue to use human rights issues to  put pressure on China. Clinton's announcement of the delinkage  of MFN status renewal from the human rights issue is a wise  decision. Instead of him losing face, it is beneficial to  enhancing his prestige.    New development in relations between the two  countries Clinton's decision has also shown that relations  among nations cannot be separated from mutual benefits in  practice. If the current close economic relations between China  and the United States deteriorated because of their dispute over  human rights, and both sides suffered because of this, the  American people would never support it. On the contrary, if the  human rights issue, a hindrance to relations between the two  countries, is removed, the development of Sino-American  relations will embark on a new and easy path.    Recently, the international community has attached  importance  to the development of China's relations with the four central  Asian countries and the improvement in Sino-Ukrainian and  Sino-Russian relations. China and Russia are two big nations  after all. Of course, the development of China's relations with  the central Asian countries and Russia is not targeted at any  third country. However, the new cooperation between China and  Russia in economics, culture, and science and technology will be  further strengthened through Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin's visit to China and President Jiang Zemin's visit  to Russia in September. This is an undeniable trend.    Under such a new world situation, no one can tolerate human  rights elements undermining Sino-American relations and harming  U.S. interests. Is this not clear enough?</p>

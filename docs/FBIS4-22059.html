			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] La Paz, 30 Mar (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Sources linked to  intelligence offices in the Government Ministry and the Special  Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) reported today that a reactivation  of the subversive Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army [EGTK)  organization has been detected in the last few days in three  departments.    The sources told LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz that the subversive  group that was broken up in 1991 resumed its terrorist  activities in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Sucre by calling for armed  insurrection in various rural districts.    They said this subversive organization "plans to act with  greater force" in La Paz and Cochabamba Departments, and that  the signs of subversive activity "are the writing on walls seen  by state intelligence in the two departments' rural districts."    They indicated that the EGTK, in contrast to other guerrilla  organizations with similar characteristics such as the Nestor  Paz Zamora Command (CNPZ) or the Zarate Willka Armed Liberation  Forces (FAL-ZW), "still have ideological leaders because not all  of them were arrested by the intelligence organizations." The  sources added: "An example is the recent capture of Victor Poma  after three years. He was accused of terrorist activities and  actions against state security." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Investigation into sale of Greencore completed THE IRISH stock exchange said yesterday that it had completed its investigation into the controversial sale in April of the Irish government's remaining stake in Greencore, the sugar group, by Dublin's leading stockbroking firm Davy. It had reported its findings to the London Stock Exchange. Mr Leonard Abrahamson, president of the ISE, said it was now up to its Professional Standards Panel 'to determine whether there is a case to answer. If they do then they will make a submission to the disciplinary committee'. Six weeks ago, Mr Abrahamson said that the main findings of the ISE's investigation would be published. He said yesterday, though, 'until the process is complete it would not be appropriate to make anything public.' The investigation has already taken a month longer than originally anticipated. It has focused on several aspects of the placing including Davy's original share placement arrangements with SG Warburg, the London merchant bank, with whom Davy has said there was a profit-and-loss sharing agreement. The arrangement was then abandoned on the day of the placement. Warburg was to have taken up to 10m of the 25.4m shares on offer on a buyer-of-last-resort basis. At the last moment Davy changed the arrangement and placed the Warburg's block with parties associated with the Davy firm. In the week following the placement, trading in Greencore shares was suspended in London and Dublin for two days, after the Irish government said it had been informed by Davy that legal problems with the placement might have arisen. The ISE then took the unusual step of making a public statement saying that Greencore shares had been trading on the basis of 'misleading information' following the placing and that the conduct of Davy was to be investigated. A number of institutions then pulled out of the deal, but it was rescued by the Bank of Ireland which stepped in to buy 9.6m of the shares at a cost of IPounds 26m. Davy is a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland.</p>

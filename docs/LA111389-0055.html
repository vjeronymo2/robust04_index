			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAMIBIAN VOTE PUTS REBELS ON POLITICAL SPOT  </P> <P> For 23 years, the guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization  fought a bush war to wrest control of Namibia from South African colonizers and  plant the principles of Karl Marx deeply in the sandy soil of the sparsely  populated territory.  </P> <P> But today, as SWAPO sits on the verge of realizing its dream in Namibia's first  free and democratic elections, the rhetoric of war has given way to the  practicalities of politics.  </P> <P> SWAPO leaders still call each other "comrade," reiterate their devotion to  socialism and promise a redistribution of wealth from the mostly white  landholders to the black masses. But, having seen Africa littered with failed  Marxist policies, they have promised a mixed economy, freedom of speech, no  mass nationalization and protection for the property of whites who want to  stay.  </P> <P> "Our policy is to leave the sad history behind us, to adopt a much more  flexible approach and to write our future on a clean sheet of paper," says  SWAPO President Sam Nujoma, the bearded leader who has spent half his 60 years  in exile. His efforts will be watched closely in neighboring South Africa,  especially by whites who fear that a black government in Pretoria would usher  in communism and force them out.  </P> <P> SWAPO is heavily favored to win at least a majority in the five-day Namibian  elections, which ended Saturday. Initial results are expected to be announced  late today. Ten political parties have been vying for power in the  U.N.-supervised elections, and SWAPO needs a two-thirds majority to control the  72-seat constituent assembly and write a new constitution for Namibia.  </P> <P> No one knows for sure what SWAPO will do with the new power. Although Nujoma's  chief aides hold advanced degrees in political science from American and  European universities, they have no practical experience in government. Until  last June, in fact, SWAPO was only a liberation movement with a dream. Now it  is a political party with a constituency to keep happy and, perhaps soon, a  country to run.  </P> <P> The Marxist principles to which SWAPO held fast for so long have been dated by  recent ideological changes in the Soviet Union. And today, African countries  founded on Marxist principles, from Angola to Mozambique and Ghana to Tanzania,  are embracing free-market solutions to their economic troubles.  </P> <P> This may be the first and last multi-party election in Namibia. SWAPO has long  favored a one-party state, believing that the Western model of multi-party  democracy does not work in developing African countries. But Nujoma also has  said he would consult with all other parties in mapping the country's future.  </P> <P> "If SWAPO doesn't turn us into a Communist nation, we'll be OK," said Anton  Ferreira, a white Namibian who waited in line more than six hours to vote on  the first of five days of balloting last week.  </P> <P> A white woman standing nearby added: "If SWAPO wins, people are going to get  used to standing in lines like this."  </P> <P> Despite its talk of unity and conciliation, SWAPO's history of planting land  mines on white farmers' land and allegations that it tortured black Namibians  believed to be spies has made many here wary.  </P> <P> SWAPO's foreign affairs chief, Theo-Ben Gurirab, says the organization  regretted the torture. But others, including Nujoma himself, have not been  penitent.  </P> <P> "I'm not regretting anything," Nujoma said as voters went to the polls. "We  lost hundreds of our comrades in the war because of information those traitors  supplied to South African troops. Do you think we were stupid enough to let  them carry on?"  </P> <P> Nevertheless, SWAPO now says it wants to establish a bill of human rights for  Namibia. And Nujoma says the fighters of his People's Liberation Army, who  surrendered their arms to return to Namibia for the elections, will form the  basis of a small national army designed only for defense.  </P> <P> Few of the country's 80,000 whites, who account for less than 10% of the  population but own 65% of the land, relish the prospect of a SWAPO government.  But many agree with SWAPO that South Africa has siphoned off much of Namibia's  wealth over the years.  </P> <P> "We've been exploited by South Africa for 75 years, why not give Sam Nujoma a  chance," said J. P. D. Blaauw, a retired brigadier in the South African air  force. Blaauw, who lived in Namibia as a child, flew from South Africa last  week to vote and said he plans to move here permanently after independence.  </P> <P> SWAPO will face many of the same logistical problems that South Africa has  faced in trying to administer the territory, which is twice the size of  California, with a dozen ethnic groups and only 1.3 million people, 60% of them  illiterate. To help the South African administration stage the first one-man,  one-vote national elections in the vast, rugged landscape, the United Nations  had to bring in more than 7,000 peacekeeping troops, police monitors, election  supervisors and administrative workers.  </P> <P> An independent government in Namibia will have to accept, at least at first,  its economic links with South Africa, whose government it calls the "apartheid  colonialists." About 90% of its exports go to South Africa and three-fourths of  imports, mostly food, come from there.  </P> <P> Its primary port city, Walvis Bay, will remain a South African enclave even  after independence.  </P> <P> SWAPO has promised over the years to redistribute the country's resources and  exert more centralized control over the economy. The main target for land  redistribution is whites, especially foreign absentee landlords.  </P> <P> "There are white farmers here who own up to 20 farms. That is a crime," Hidipo  Hamutenya, SWAPO's chief spokesman, says. "They will be asked to choose the one  they like best and give the rest to the people."  </P> <P> But SWAPO leaders also have said that farmers using their land effectively and  producing food for the country will be left alone. And they say no land will be  confiscated without negotiation with the owners.  </P> <P> SWAPO is counting on the country's reserve of diamonds, uranium and other  minerals, which now make up 75% of foreign exchange earnings, to help it  improve the schools, health care and housing of black Namibians.  </P> <P> Although it once believed in nationalizing the mining industry, SWAPO now says  it intends to negotiate new contracts with the mining companies. It  specifically has said that the companies will be required to reinvest "a  substantial part" of their profits in Namibia.  </P> <P> The mining companies, which currently have a tax rate of 60%, doubt they can  afford to pay more. But they believe Namibia's mineral potential has been  largely untapped and that more mining companies will be lured here if trade  sanctions against Pretoria, which still extend to Namibia, are lifted.  </P> <P> SWAPO's biggest headache, though, may be dealing with the raised expectations  of the black masses, most of whom are landless and 30% jobless.  </P> <P> "We will educate the people that independence is not a panacea, that they will  have to work hard and produce," Hage Geingob, SWAPO's election director,  recently told the South African magazine Leadership. "It would be a serious  mistake to believe that independence is the time for people to make big claims  on the state."  </P></p>

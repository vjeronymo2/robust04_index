			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["cr"-signed report: "Specialists for Joint Ventures"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 16 Jun -- The Federal Government wants to  start a joint training initiative together with the People's  Republic of China. At the first German-Chinese conference for  medium-size companies in Bonn, where more than 200 German and  Chinese firms discussed possibilities of improved industrial  cooperation, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that Bonn's  offer aims at "making the successful German training system also  available to the Chinese partners."    Speaking to Beijing Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Shi  Guangsheng, Rexrodt expressed his interest in introducing the  dual system in fields where it could prove particularly  effective in connection with German joint ventures. The  combined training in schools and industry is to bring about  skilled workers for the joint ventures with Germany. The major  part of this program shall be funded by the German Financial  Cooperation Program with China. The proposal is expected to be  finalized when Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng visits Bonn at the  beginning of July.    Rexrodt said it is no coincidence that China is of  particular  importance for Germany in political, cultural, and economic  terms. For German industry China is the biggest market for  investment goods in East Asia and the biggest trading partner  among the developing countries worldwide. Last year, trade  between Germany and China amounted to 24 billion German marks.  At the same time, Rexrodt warned against further Chinese trade  balance surpluses in the billion marks range. This calls for  new ways of increasing companies' capital and financial powers.    The government in Bonn wants to expand cooperation with  China  as "a trustworthy, reliable, and economically important  partner." Medium-size companies are expected to play a major  role in this. Yet Rexrodt demanded that the Chinese Government  provides favorable framework conditions. Beijing could give  fresh impetus to the German economy via fiscal policy, Rexrodt  said.    Rexrodt's reference to an upcoming simplification of laws  and  regulations in Germany in the current legislative term was an  unmistakable hint to the Chinese. This would strengthen  medium-size companies. Rexrodt voiced satisfaction with the  growing globalization of medium-size German companies and  pointed out that the opening of markets in order to create new  fields of activity is an important task of politics. In this  context, Bonn advocates China joining the GATT and the future  World Trade Organization, which the Federal Government wants to  be based in Bonn.    To intensify German-Chinese cooperation among medium-size  firms, the Federal Government has raised funds for sending a  delegate of German industry to Shanghai. He will be  particularly concerned with making contacts with medium-size  firms from the growth regions of Shanghai/Pudong and the Yangtze  Delta. At the moment, medium-size companies already do nearly  half of all business with China. But the number of 400 German  projects in China can certainly be increased.    A precondition for a stronger capital transfer to China is  state guarantees for German foreign investment. That is why the  Hermes credit guarantees should be used by medium-size companies  in particular, Rexrodt said.</p>

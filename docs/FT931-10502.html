			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Management: Rebels turned diplomats / A look behind the fanfare accompanying today'slaunch of a new-style Silicon Valley start-up The ping-pong table and arcade-style video game at the centre of General Magic's Silicon Valley offices are reminiscent of the early days at Apple Computer, when Steve Jobs parked his motorbike in the lobby and the foyer was furnished with games and a grand piano. This young company, which has been a hot topic of computer industry rumour ever since it was formed three years ago, will for the first time discuss its technology today - software for 'personal communicators', pocket-sized devices that will enable users to send and receive electronic messages. So high are expectations for this fledgling that many in the industry believe it has inherited the innovative spirit of Apple Computer, where several of General Magic's managers played roles in the development of the popular Macintosh personal computer. Indeed, General Magic has much in common with the 1980s generation of Silicon Valley entrepreneurial ventures that created the personal computer and the software programs that have put computers on millions of desktops: the casual style, the young engineers who seem to thrive on working all night, and most importantly a passionate belief that this is a company that is going to 'change the world'. Yet General Magic is also strikingly different, notably because of the way it is developing a network of partnerships. Unlike the fiercely independent spin-offs of the 1970s and 1980s, General Magic is built on alliances with some of the world's largest high-technology manufacturers. 'Ten years ago, we were in our 20s, and the industry was very different. We never gave a thought to co-operation. We were going to take over the world. We felt so strongly that we were in control of our destiny,' recalls Joanna Hoffman, now vice president of marketing at General Magic, who was a principal member of Apple's Macintosh design team. 'Today, the industry is far more complex. There is a web of relationships in which companies co-operate and compete at the same time,' she says. General Magic's partners are Apple Computer, AT&amp;T and Motorola of the US, Sony and Matsushita of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands. All are General Magic investors, and all have licensed the company's technology for use in their own future communications products and services. Like most new ventures in Silicon Valley, General Magic is a spin-off. Its genesis was in Apple's Advanced Technology Group, where Marc Porat, now president and chief executive of General Magic, was attempting to develop ideas for products 'beyond the personal computer'. But in contrast to the legal recriminations that accompany the departure of would-be entrepreneurs from many companies, General Magic's founders received Apple's blessing and encouragement in the form of an equity investment and technology licensing agreement. From the beginning, General Magic set out to form alliances with 'world standards setters', companies that could each bring a wealth of experience to bear upon the challenge of creating a new industry. This common goal has 'transcended rivalries' among the partners, all of whom have invested in General Magic in return for technology licences, says Hoffman. 'All of the partners are treated as equals,' she insists. That said, General Magic remains coy about the size of its partners' investments and holdings in the company except to say that all have the same governance rights, with membership of the board of directors, and all have reached identical technology licensing agreements with General Magic. Hoffman admits that maintaining such a complex set of relationships with companies that have different cultures, and which in some cases are direct competitors, has not been easy. The original plan to invite alliance members to station their representatives in General Magic's offices was scrapped when the company found itself becoming 'an arena in which the contradictions of the co-operative yet competing relationships among alliance members were played out,' she says. 'We had to put a stop to it, and we did.' Visits by the engineering teams from different partners now seldom overlap. Certain areas of General Magic's offices were off limits to representatives of the alliance partners so that they would not see each other's prototype products. And General Magic's own employees, many of whom came from environments in which sharing of information is encouraged, had to learn to be more circumspect. In part this is a matter of tact, Hoffman explains. The bigger issue is that alliance partners do not want each other to know details of their product plans for General Magic software. One of the most noticeable differences between General Magic and earlier start-ups is its penchant for secrecy. Whereas most young companies, especially those in the software industry, are all too eager to boast about their products, even if they have yet to finish development, General Magic has gone to the opposite extreme. Although rumours have swirled around the company ever since it was formed, General Magic has managed to keep the identities of some of its partners and the details of its technology to itself. This is a remarkable feat in the gossip mill of Silicon Valley. 'It also creates a mystique,' Porat acknowledges with a smile. Indeed, media management seems to be one of the talents that General Magic has inherited from Apple where the new company's founders also learnt that public attention can be a distraction. 'We are preparing to do a lot of traffic control,' in the wake of today's announcements, Porat adds. The coyness, meanwhile, could not last indefinitely, as General Magic's partners found it increasingly difficult to keep their involvement under wraps and began to seek the involvement of third parties such as applications software developers, Porat explains. Porat is nevertheless anxious to limit expectations. General Magic has refused to participate in the publicity created by others in the industry who have promoted the potential of personal communications devices to create a vast new industry. 'I am a walking antidote to hyperbole and hysteria,' says Porat. 'The public is tired of promises that the high-tech industry does not live up to,' he adds. It may be a decade before General Magic's vision of intelligent personal communications becomes reality, he stresses. His colleagues who were involved in the development of Apple Macintosh remember the bitter disappointment that they felt when the first version of their product failed to live up to sales expectations. Ten years later, the Macintosh is the core of Apple's business and their contributions to the development of the personal computer industry have been widely acknowledged. Such patience is also rare in a new venture. However, General Magic has the unusual advantage of financial backers who are looking for long-term results rather than a quick financial return. A potential problem is that this could postpone opportunities for General Magic's employees to cash in their stock, thereby putting a damper on the enthusiasm that drives the venture. For the moment, General Magic is caught up in the excitement of its first public performance. It is trying to create a brave new world in which 'personal communicators' are as ubiquitous as the telephone. General Magic's ownership and management structure is certainly a formidable challenge. But perhaps the biggest question mark is whether it can define a new market. The trick that the company has yet to perfect is to bring such technology to the masses, 'those whose personal use of high-technology does not reach beyond the car, the television set and the telephone,' as Porat puts it. 'We want to make technology that people will welcome into their lives rather than being a source of stress,' says Bill Atkinson, General Magic chairman and co-founder.</p>

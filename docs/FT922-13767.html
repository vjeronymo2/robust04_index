			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: NEC forms chip alliance NEC, the Japanese electronics company, and MIPS Computer Systems, the US microprocessor manufacturer, have agreed to develop jointly a 64-bit Risc (reduced instruction set computing) chip for a wide range of uses, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Risc chips, which process information faster than conventional microprocessors because they have fewer instructions in a computer operation, are mostly used in workstations. Under the agreement, MIPS will design VRX chips according to NEC's specifications, and NEC will get exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights for the first year. NEC said it hopes to launch VRX products in the latter half of 1993. The new chip will be modelled on the MIPS R4000 central processing unit.</p>

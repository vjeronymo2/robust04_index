			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities slide on Japanese bank fears WORRIES about the possibility that one of the leading Japanese banks may have defaulted on a swaps deal, triggering a crisis in the Japanese banking system, caused a wholesale retreat by a London market which had only just regained its poise after a prolonged bout of election jitters. London was one of many leading European stock markets losing ground during the day. However, the equity market managed to regain a measure of stability ahead of today's general election, recouping around two thirds of losses incurred during the early part of the trading session. The international developments hit London hard as the market opened. Dealers cut their opening quotations in reaction to a fresh bout of turbulence on Wall Street and in Tokyo. The latter's recent plunge, which has seen the Nikkei average drop from about 22,000 to around 17,000, was seen as the catalyst for an overnight 62-point setback by Wall Street. The FT-SE Index was initially quoted down just over 30 points but immediately began a sustained rally. The trend was attributed to hints that the ruling Conservative party had begun an eleventh-hour rally in the polls. Rumours abounded that at least one of the opinion polls published this morning would show the Tories ahead of Labour. The Footsie came within a whisker of being up on the day - showing a 0.7 decline at 2,403.5 - but Wall Street came in sharply lower amid the Japanese banking stories and proceeded to demolish London's painstakingly rebuilt, but still fragile, confidence. The index ended the session a net 11 lower at 2,393.2. International markets have for some while been concerned about the slide in Tokyo. One leading economist said that further setbacks would cause serious weakening of the Japanese banks' capital ratios and force them to sell US shares, bonds and property. 'It follows that Wall Street would slide, taking London and other markets with it,' he added. In spite of such fears, traders in London took heart from the stability of sterling and persistent demand for gilt-edged. At the close, sterling was up against the dollar and D-Mark. The three-month interbank rate, an important guide to UK domestic interest rate trends, eased further to around the 10 1/2 per cent mark. The opinion poll rumours sparked a flurry of buying of the regional electricity companies (recs), but the demand was at the expense of water shares, which moved in the opposite direction, still spooked by worries of a windfall profits tax. Tuesday's strong support for Reuters evaporated after UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and BZW were said to have been keen sellers of the shares. Fisons, still regarded by many as a takeover candidate, attracted persistent buying, helped by a broker's presentation. BP, on the other hand, fell further after a leading US brokerage removed the stock from its buy list. Turnover in London held up relatively well at 472.9m shares, considering that most fund managers have already put the finishing touches to their pre-election portfolios.</p>

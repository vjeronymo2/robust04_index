The president's press service informs that Yeltsin's letter  touches on problems which so far haven't found a solution during  the Estonian-Russian negotiations, and expresses hope that a  mutually acceptable solution will be arrived at in the near  future.    This puts back on the agenda an Estonian-Russian summit  preparations for which were made last autumn, the president's  press service told BNS.</p>

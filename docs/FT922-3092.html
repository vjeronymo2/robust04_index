			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Bundesbank warned on 'abuse' of borrowing powers THE Bundesbank's chief economist yesterday warned the German government against 'abuse' of its public borrowing powers. Mr Otmar Issing said it already faced an interest repayments crunch in the mid-1990s,and if it did not bring debt under control, future living standards would suffer. Tax increases or cuts in social services would become unavoidable, the central bank official claimed. Total public debt, currently around 45 per cent of gross national product (GNP), would increase to at least 50 per cent by the end of 1996, he predicted. Other factors, such as the state railway's borrowings and those of the former east German authorities, could add another 4 per cent to the total burden. Interest charges would then account for up to 17 per cent of the federal budget, Mr Issing told a taxpayers' association meeting in Kiel. Continuing a long-running Bundesbank campaign to squash popular notions that the costs of unification should have no effect on west German pay packets and living standards, he said there was no real alternative to borrowing to support the east. But increasing debt to maintain services in the west would lead the country into a 'vicious circle'. The government, committed to an effective spending freeze, had no more room for financial manoeuvre, and there was no chance of squeezing out extra funds from tax increases at present. At 41 per cent of gross earnings, the overall burden of tax and social security contributions was already at record levels. Experience in the early 1980s had shown that attempts to raise funds by increasing taxation would not work. In an indirect attack on government plans to levy charges to pay for care of the elderly, Mr Issing said: 'We must leave the old ways of social policy and reconcile what is desirable with what is necessary.' Social services spending, already under pressure in Bonn - where the health minister recently proposed savings of up to DM11bn (Pounds 3.7bn) a year - will come under increasing scrutiny in future. At present, one-third of the population is over 60, the average pensionable age. Within 20 years the proportion will rise to 50 per cent, he added. State borrowing in order to fund public benefits and services gave the impression that they were free. 'And here we find the often too-powerful temptation which leads democratic systems to abuse public borrowing,' Mr Issing said. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank remains concerned at the increase in private credit. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the central bank, said in Bonn on Thursday that recent money supply growth of 8 to 9 per cent had 'heavily overstepped our targets' of a 5.5 per cent maximum. There were some positive aspects, including borrowing to invest in industry, but the trend undermined the effectiveness of the central bank's controls. This year's average 5.5 per cent round of pay increases and inflation at around 4.5 per cent were also discouraging, he said. There was no scope for a reduction in key interest rates 'in the near future', he added.</p>

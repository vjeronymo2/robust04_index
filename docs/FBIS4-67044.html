			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Colombian Foreign Ministry in </F> response to U.S. Senator John Kerry's protest note; place and  date not given--read by announcer]    [Text] The Colombian Government, although it disagrees  with the prosecutor general on some points, cannot accept  whatsover doubts being cast on its motives or its determined and  unchanging commitment to reach the common goal of fighting crime  in general and fighting drug trafficking in particular. In  addition, the Colombian Government, because it believes the  necessary climate of constructive understanding between the two  governments is not being served, flatly rejects the fact that a  political leader, in this instance Senator John Kerry, has used  his post and the post's inherent prerogatives, such as the  legislative branch's political control procedures, to grant  privileges to, listen to, and believe false charges by a  confessed criminal against Colombia, its institutions, the  private sector, and even the media. Such a position represents  an attack on Colombian society and its authorities because it  casts a shadow of suspicion and implies corruption, or at least  general complicity with drug traffickers, in a country which is  well-known to have made the greatest possible sacrifices and  which has achieved the greatest results in the struggle against  this scourge.    The Colombian Government expects that judicial cooperation  between the two countries can return to normal and that the  channels of dialogue, exchange of ideas, and joint work between  judicial authorities of the two countries can be kept open. To  achieve this, the best possible joint efforts should be made to  overcome any disagreements resulting from the difficulties  inherent in the handling of such a complex matter.    Finally, the Colombian Foreign Ministry wants to underscore  the importance of cooperation because the absence of this can  benefit only our common enemies--those interested in fanning the  fires of discord and (putting obstacles) in the path of justice.    [Signed] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Slide in pay rises 'bottoms out' THE FALL in pay rises appears to be bottoming out after hitting the lowest levels since its surveys began in 1976, the Reward Group of independent pay analysts said yesterday. Mr Steve Flather, managing director of Reward, said: 'There is evidence that we have reached the bottom for all main groups of employees.' The latest survey finds the settlement level for clerical and manual workers running at between 2.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent. However, taking into account 'pay drift', mainly seniority increments and performance pay, earnings increases for clerical workers were as high as 5.3 per cent in the 12 months to June 1993. In July the figure fell to 3.9 per cent. For a director's secretary over the past year it was 5.5 per cent; 3.1 per cent for a receptionist; 2.1 per cent for a clerk typist; and 5.8 per cent for manual and skilled crafts workers.

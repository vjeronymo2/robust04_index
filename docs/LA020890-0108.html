			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL DELAYS WATER CONSERVATION LAW  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council on Tuesday postponed adoption of a conservation  ordinance that would reduce water consumption during a drought and changes  water rates to reward low water users and increase cost on larger users.  </P> <P> The postponement came after a spokeswoman for the Forest Lawn Memorial Park  asked the council to incorporate language to exclude reclaimed water from the  ordinance.  </P> <P> The city of Glendale is building a pipeline from its sewage treatment plant to  the cemetery, which has agreed to purchase the treated water to irrigate its  sprawling, manicured lawns.  </P> <P> Under the new proposal, the typical residential customer would see a monthly  water bill rise by 72 cents to $45.80 for 2,000 cubic feet of water.  </P> <P> But those who use 1,000 cubic feet would see a bill reduced by $2.10 to $24.50,  Public Service Director W.E. Cameron said.  </P> <P> In times of drought, the council would be empowered to activate a five-step  plan that would call for saving up to 25% of the water each customer normally  uses. Any excess use would be penalized by a surcharge of twice the basic water  rate.  </P></p>

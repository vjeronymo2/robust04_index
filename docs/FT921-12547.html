			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Travel: Only an earthquake disturbed the peace - David Pilling visits Tobago, a backwater hoping to establish itself on the globetrotter's itinerary AS OUR JEEP shuddered around the twists and turns of Tobago's churned-up roads, a small earthquake struck. Tectonic plates collided, lights went out, and buildings shook in the capital, Scarborough. In a remote seismological centre, the Richter scale needle edged its way towards 4.5. The passengers of our jeep, however, remained blissfully unaware of this momentous event. Tobago's roads are so rutted and our vehicle was in so advanced a state of stuttering and clattering that the mere convulsions of the Earth's crust were not likely to affect us one way or the other. Tobagonian roads ought not to be this bad. Only a few miles away, on the twin island of Trinidad, is one of the world's largest sources of asphalt. Pitch Lake, the planet's only natural wonder resembling a parking lot, supplies asphalt to smooth the path of motorists in New York and Paris. Paradise to a hassled New Yorker may be two weeks in Tobago's beach-fringed serenity. But to a Tobagonian driver, heaven is a straight road in Brooklyn with no potholes. Not that bumpy roads should worry the would-be tourist. This is all part of Tobago's character and serves to confirm its reputation as one of the Caribbean's least commercially developed islands. Unlike most destinations in the region, Tobago has not changed much over the past 50 years. Beaches really are deserted and the tourist still finds himself regarded as an interesting novelty rather than a walking dispenser of hard currency. Sheltered economically by oil-rich Trinidad, Tobago has not wooed international tourists with the same gusto as its more financially fragile neighbours. With a population of a mere 40,000, it maintains the rural atmosphere of a bygone, gentler era. The first item of news I heard on local radio was that a watch with a black leather strap had been found in Scarborough; anyone claiming it was invited to contact the radio station. This, I concluded, was an island living in a different age. The fact that Tobagonian advertisements still promote Guinness as being good for you only served to confirm my impression. Although tiny - 26 miles by nine - Tobago is topographically so rugged, so choked in virgin forest and so sparsely populated that it appears much larger. Driving around the island it is easy to feel, as one plunges past verdant hillsides - so green and fecund they resemble mounds of freshly tossed salad - that one is exploring a country of far greater dimensions. Tobago has more in common ecologically with the South American mainland (just seven miles from Trinidad) than with most other Caribbean islands. Trinidad broke off the Venezuelan landmass thousands of years ago, and Tobago in turn snapped off its larger neighbour like a fragment of tooth, before drifting to the north-east. The islands consequently boast an extraordinary array of bird and plant life; for instance, there are 17 varieties of hummingbird, the smallest of which - the tufted coquette - is outsized by some types of Trinidadian bees. Such is the proximity of the twin-island state with Venezuela,that the islands' national bird, the scarlet ibis, divides its time between the two. A tourist official told me that the fighter-plane-shaped birds, as vibrant as neon lights, leave Trinidad's Caroni swamp in dignified silence (that being the British heritage) and flock back from Venezuela late at night in a Latin-like state of raucous revelry. Tobago itself resembles much of central Africa, its hillsides a matted green web of palms and trees, lianas and creaking bamboo. The air is heavy with ooze and sap; all around one hears bleating goats, chirruping birds and cicadas making such a din they sound like the clattering of a shopping cart over cobblestones. Tobago, unlike Trinidad, is almost entirely rural, the majority of its largely black population garnering some income from fishing or agriculture. The capital, Scarborough - population 4,000 - is more of a market than a town; the only event I saw carrying the least hint of frayed urban tempers was two men arguing over the price of fish. In one day we managed, at fairly leisurely pace, to circumnavigate the island, with the exception of one section of road which a Rastafarian goatherd assured us was too precarious even for our four-wheeled vehicle. The names of Tobago's hamlets, districts and towns - Auchensklock, Bacolet, Glamorgan, Mesopotamia, Prince's Bay and Trois Rivieres - conjure up the island's turbulent history which saw it change hands among colonial powers no fewer than 31 times in 100 years. Even the Latvians held sway for one brief period. Our circuit took us through scores of villages, usually small clusters of stilted wooden houses strewn higgledy-piggledy on the steep hillsides. Most boasted a general store, opening hours 'anytime'. Many had a blackboard nailed by the door with chalk scrawls advertising specials such as oxtail, shark steaks, cow heel and goat meat. One bore the curious announcement: 'Meat for dogs. Rice for dogs.' Many hamlets were so small that their stores doubled as watering holes and gossip shops. 'First and Last Cafe and Bar in Castara,' one banner warned. Tobago, evidently, was not the place for comparative shopping. We were tempted into many a local rum shop, most of them dark dens of alcoholism entered through grimy bead curtains. Their proprietors, evidently keen to instil an air of respectability, had often tacked up notices entreating the clientele: 'Discuss don't Cuss.' One had a neatly handwritten sign on the door of the lavatory beseeching customers: 'Please Don't Soil Me with Filt.' We ended up at the eastern end of the island, in Charlotteville, a tiny horseshoe fishing bay whose forested hills rolled into the sea of cat's-eye green. While we were there a wooden fishing boat - the No Problem - drifted to the sandy beach, an event marked by the doleful sound of a conch horn. As the kingfish were unloaded, weighed and gutted on a stone slab, streams of people emerged from the surrounding hills to make their purchases. The sea lapped onto the narrow sandy beach, and a couple of grey pelicans eyed the scraps of fish with nonchalance. The tranquility of Tobago, typified by Charlotteville, may not last long. The runway at Crown Point airport has recently been extended to allow jumbo jets to land. Tourists from America and Europe will now be able to fly directly to Tobago without the inconvenience of having to change aircraft in Trinidad. There are plans to build more hotels on the island, with several big international chains having shown interest. The government expresses its determination to pursue an environmentally sensitive form of tourism, by which it means it hopes to attract high-spending tourists in relatively low volume. However, once Tobago has established its place on the globetrotter's itinerary, it may be hard to control numbers. Next time the ground reverberates in Scarborough, it may not be an earthquake - just another jumbo jet rumbling overhead. David Pilling flew c/o BWIA International (London reservations: 071-839-9333) which operates non-stop flights to Tobago once a week from Heathrow (Apex fares from Pounds 689 return). Accommodation was arranged by the Mount Irvine Hotel and Golf Club, Tobago. For more information contact Trinidad &amp; Tobago tourist office (081-741-4466).</p>

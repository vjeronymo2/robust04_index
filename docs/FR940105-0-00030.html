			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Implementation Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NOPR, the Commission proposed an April 1, 1994 implementation date, finding this date would provide pipelines with sufficient time to program their computers to incorporate the changes required and would permit final testing of the system during the off-peak summer season. Many commenters support the April 1, 1994 implementation date, some suggesting no extension be given. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  Peoples Gas, et al., and UDC state this date should not result in delay in implementing the on-line EBBs already required by Order No. 636. Some commenters contend the April 1, 1994 date is sufficient for the items included in the NOPR, but would not give sufficient time for implementation of additional requirements resulting from the Working Groups' February 1, 1994 reports on those items which the Commission set for further consideration. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  Other commenters contend the April 1, 1994 date is too ambitious for all items and assert the Commission should not set an interim date, but should require full implementation by the fall of 1994. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  AER/MRT contends an April 1, 1994 implementation date for the ASC X12 requirement, in particular, is unreasonably ambitious. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Power Generators, Con Edison, WEV, Destec Energy, NGSA, NYMEX/EnerSoft, O&amp;R, Peoples Gas, et al., UDC, Process Gas Consumers Group (noting that capacity release transactions may be heaviest in the off-season), Transco (if development of ASC X12 not unduly delayed). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> INGAA, Natural. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AER/MRT, Columbia Gas, Enron, KGPL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will agree to delay the implementation date to June 1, 1994, to allow the Working Groups and the pipelines to make final revisions that will improve the functioning of the EBBs and the downloadable data sets. But, given this extension, the Commission expects the pipelines to have an operational set of standards fully implemented by June 1, 1994. At the same time, the June 1, 1994 date will permit capacity release transactions, which may be significant in the off-peak season, to benefit from the standards. The June 1, 1994 date applies to the implementation of EDI, but not to the implementation of common codes, as discussed later. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  The Commission clarifies that this date applies only to the items included in this rule, not to further items resulting from the February 1, 1994 reports. The June 1, 1994 date also does not delay pipelines' compliance with the EBB requirements of Order No. 636; pipelines must comply with these requirements by the date specified in their restructuring orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> text accompanying notes 36 and 51, infra. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The June 1 date is not an interim date, but the final date for compliance with these requirements. The reference in the NOPR to final testing during the off-peak season meant only that full scale operation would operate as the final check to uncover lacunae in operation not detected during routine small scale (or beta) testing of the system. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  As stated earlier, the Commission expects full implementation of the data sets and communication protocols by no later than the June 1, 1994 date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> By beginning full-scale operation during the summer, the standards will be in effect during the period when capacity release transactions may be significant, but, at the same time, any final problems with the system can be resolved when obtaining gas supplies is not as crucial as during the peak winter heating season. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Williston Basin asserts the February 1, 1994 date for the Working Group reports is premature since the industry will not have sufficient experience with capacity release by then to make additional modifications. The Commission is not persuaded to change the February 1 date for the Working Group reports. These reports are intended to cover the items on which the parties did not have the time to reach consensus in time for their July reports, but which the Commission found were susceptible to resolution given more time. As discussed earlier, the Commission is committed to updating these standards when necessary in light of experience. The timing of additional meetings or reports to consider further revisions are better made at a later point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Modifications to the Regulatory Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NGSA and Process Gas Consumers Group suggest the rule should be revised to require each pipeline to submit a compliance filing specifying in its tariff the details of how it will supply the services required by the rule. UDC suggests the imposition of reporting requirements to permit the Commission and the public to monitor the initial operation of EBBs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission perceives no need at this point for requiring compliance filings by pipelines or the submission of periodic reports. The requirements of the rule are straight-forward. The communication protocols require pipelines to provide users with scripts detailing the procedures for accessing (logging-on to) the pipelines' computer systems, and providing further detail through tariff filings seems unnecessary. Monitoring of the system can be better accomplished through Commission oversight of pipelines' compliance by accessing their EBBs and through the use of industry conferences than through tariff filings or inflexible periodic reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Process Gas Consumers Group suggests the deletion of the phrase ``on its Electronic Bulletin Board'' from the opening clause of the rule. It contends this phrase suggests the rule may not cover EDI access to data, may not apply to pipelines using third-party vendors to provide EBB services, and appears to require pipelines to provide information about accessing their EBB solely through their EBB, thereby creating a Catch-22 in which shippers can obtain information on how to access a pipeline's EBB only by knowing how to access the EBB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission will not delete the reference to Electronic Bulletin Boards because pipelines must provide the required information on their EBBs as well as through downloadable files. The Commission, however, will modify the regulation slightly to make even more explicit that both modes of communication must be provided. The Commission expects pipelines to provide users with instructions for accessing their EBBs or using EDI transfers without having the user first access the pipelines' EBB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Discussion of Items Included in the Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission proposed to set forth the information on capacity availability and the protocols governing the dissemination of that information in a separate document entitled Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols that would be available at the Commission. The Commission included this document in the NOPR and commenters raised issues with respect to the proposed provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Standardized Data Sets <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Operation of the Data Sets <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> El Paso requests clarification that a pipeline can leave fields in the data sets blank if the pipeline's tariff does not require the information to be provided. It cites, as an example, differences in pipelines' tariffs as to whether volumetric releases are subject to minimum quantity requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANR contends the definitions of the terms mandatory and optional, as used for some fields in the data sets, are confusing. It submits mandatory refers to data fields that every pipeline must support, while optional refers to data fields pipelines may offer at their discretion, unless their individual tariffs require that those fields be supported. If optional means that all pipelines must support the field, thereby permitting releasing shippers or bidders with the option of including information in the field, ANR asserts it would have to incur added expense to redesign its EBB to include these fields. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As an example of the difference in definition, an optional field is releaser contract number. Data Set I.1, line 6. Under ANR's definition, pipelines would have the discretion to include this field. Under the second interpretation, pipelines must provide the field so releasing shippers have the ability to include the information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

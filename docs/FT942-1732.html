			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Scientific press takes up detergent wars: Omo and Persil under analysis as Unilever and Procter differ over triazacyclononanes The soap war between detergents giants Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble has bubbled over into a new arena: the scientific press. Today's issue of the leading science journal Nature carries a highly technical analysis by 13 Unilever scientists of Persil Power and Omo Power, the detergent recently launched by Unilever across Europe. Procter has claimed the new powder, which was developed at a cost of several hundred million pounds, damages clothes. The paper gives a wealth of technical detail on the manganese-based catalyst  -known as the Accelerator - which allows the new powder to wash at much lower temperatures. However, it does not address the two main charges levelled by Procter: that the Accelerator harms fabric, and that the manganese builds up in clothes over repeated washings. The magic ingredient in the new powder turns out to be a complex of manganese metal with a series of organic chemicals known as triazacyclononanes. It acts by speeding up the bleaching process which removes stains. The traditional bleach in detergents is hydrogen peroxide, which is slow to act at temperatures below 600C. According to Unilever's researchers, powder containing the Accelerator is two to three times more effective at removing tea stains from cloth at 400C than the current generation of European powders. Unilever said the article had been written before the row with Procter had erupted. 'We felt it was not an article on the general use of detergents, but on the chemistry of manganese catalysts,' the company said. Ronald van de Krol adds from Amsterdam: Unilever said sales of Omo Power in the Netherlands fell in late April after Procter's claims were publicised. Sales have partly recovered after widespread newspaper advertising, but remain below the 'excellent' results when the product was first launched. The company has asked Dutch shops to put stickers on Omo Power recommending it be used at 400C or 600C. Test results have shown that damage to clothing is highest when the detergent, designed for low temperatures, is used at 900C.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: FAT IN FISH  </P> <P> Question: Is there much difference in the amount of calories and fat to be  found in different kinds of fish? My family enjoys red snapper and swordfish,  for example, and I could prepare either one.  </P> <P> Would the calories and fat make any difference?  </P> <P> Answer: A 3-ounce broiled serving of red snapper provides 104 calories and 1.2  grams of fat. A similar portion of swordfish provides 128 calories and 4.3  grams of fat.  </P></p>

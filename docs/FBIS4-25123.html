			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shigeru Moriguchi, senior researcher at the </F> Sakura Research Institute's Center for Pacific Business Studies:  "Inflation in China -- Because the Central Government's Policy  of Slowing Down the Booming Economy Is Not Working in the  Provinces, Inflation Might Again Reach 20 Percent This Year"]    [Text] In the spring of 1992, senior leader Deng Xiaoping,  when he was on an inspection tour of the booming coastal  industrial areas, called for accelerated reforms to bring about  the sustained and rapid development of the national economy.  Since then, the Chinese economy has kept growing rapidly. Its  real economic growth rate reached 13.2 percent in 1992, and it  rose to 13.4 percent in 1993.    Among Asia's fastest-growing countries, China especially is  attracting attention because of its high growth rate and its  huge market -- 1.2 billion people. There is a spectacular  inflow of foreign money because after the country vowed to  create a "socialist market economy," foreign investors have come  to believe that China will not go back to the old-style  controlled economy.    In 1992, direct investment to China amounted to $58.1  billion  on a contract basis. It took only one year to exceed the total  amount of direct investment registered between 1979 -- the year  the reform process started with the implementation of the new  open-door policy -- and 1991. In 1993, direct investment almost  doubled, to $110.9 billion. On a working basis, it was $23.3  billion for all of 1979 to 1991, while in 1992 alone it suddenly  jumped up to $11 billion. It rose to $25.8 billion in 1993.  These figures show how huge is the inflow of foreign capital  into China.    The IMF has calculated purchasing power parity to evaluate  China's economy. According to the IMF, China's economy already  ranks third in the world. If its economic development continues  to progress smoothly, there is no doubt that China will not only  become an economic power in Asia but also an international  economic superpower because of its abundant national resources.  However, whether we will see the advent of such an era during  the 21st century is still open to question. When we take a  close look at China's current economic situation, we realize  there are so many problems that we can hardly say that China has  a rose-colored future in store.    The most critical issue is the aggravation of inflation. In  the second half of 1992, there were already concerns about  economic overheating and the surge of inflation in certain  areas. Inflation suddenly became rampant in 1993. In 1993, the  national retail price index climbed 13 percent, more than double  the 6-percent target set in the national program for economic  and social development.  <H5>  There Is No Effective Way To Check the Inflationary Spiral, </H5> Which Is Caused by Six Primary Factors    Over the same period, the workers' living cost index rose at  a higher rate of 14.7 percent, and actual conditions are said to  be reflected more accurately in the workers' living cost index  than in the retail price index because the former includes  prices for services. Moreover, in 35 major cities, the workers'  living cost index marked a high increase of 19.6 percent. Fuel  prices, as well as prices for services, rose 40 percent. During  the first months of 1994, the workers' living cost index went up  by 23 percent in 35 major cities. China can no longer leave the  price level as it is. Things are assuming a dangerous  complexion, because soaring inflation might lead to another  round of social disorder, as was demonstrated in the case of the  1989 Tiananmen Square incident.    The inflationary spiral has been brought about by various  combined factors, of which there are six primary factors: 1)  The central government has accelerated the process of  introducing a market economy; it has limited the fields subject  to price controls; it has promoted price liberalization; and it  has rapidly extended the fields subject to market adjustments.  These efforts have caused an increase in prices. 2)  Overinvestment has helped considerably to escalate the current  economic overheating and inflation. The growth-oriented  thinking that considers economic development to be an absolute  truth has brought about overinvestment and booming real estate  development in the special economic zones. These circumstances  have led to a sudden rise in energy prices and in prices of  construction materials such as steel, wood, and cement.    The investment boom was also caused by the fact that local  governments have gained greater autonomy with regard to  investment activities. Beijing's policy of devolving central  powers to local governments has brought forth economic dynamism.  It has promoted economic development, particularly in the  coastal industrial areas. The problem, however, is that the  control system to prevent investment from becoming excessive is  not working properly. (3) Illegal financing and the illegal  supply of investment capital have added fresh fuel to  overinvestment. Financial disorganization, which was evident in  three areas -- fund raising, interbank lending, and bank  management -- has come into question. The central government  has repeatedly issued circulars to restore financial order. (4)  A supply-demand gap, which is caused by a poor infrastructure,  and more particularly by a lack of transportation facilities,  has brought on a sort of bottleneck inflation. (5) Both the  government and the people are devoted to money worship. Traders  are actively engaging in speculation. In anticipation of a rise  in prices, some are forestalling, while others are holding off  selling. Moreover, some are taking advantage of tax reforms to  raise prices.    (6) In January 1994, China unified the exchange rate of the  Chinese yuan by introducing a controlled floating exchange rate  system based on the market's supply and demand situation.  Because the introduction of a single exchange rate virtually  corresponds to a substantial devaluation of the Chinese yuan,  there are concerns about a further rise in import prices.    China's growth-oriented thinking has also increased for the  following reasons. The Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95) has  projected an annual growth rate of 6 percent until the end of  this century. However, in October 1992, the CPC's 14th Congress  gave a strong show of support for Deng Xiaoping's call for  accelerated reforms and revised the projected growth rate to 8-9  percent. This upward revision has caused overinvestment and  financial disorganization because local governments, which have  obtained greater autonomy with respect to investment activities,  have striven for economic development and high growth as a  natural consequence.    The central government is fully aware of the growing  inflation pressures. At the beginning of 1994, it moved to  check the inflationary spiral by establishing financial order,  by promoting financial reforms, and by increasing controls on  bank loans to be used for fixed-asset investment. In May and  July 1993, it raised interest rates. Under the apprehension  that people might lose interest in bank savings, the central  government has decided to provide, from March 1994, interest  subsidies through the People's Bank of China to enable banks to  pay attractive interest rates on fixed deposits.    The last time that China's economy overheated was in 1988.  Compared to that time, the central government is now taking  prompt measures to meet the situation. However, there is no  system yet in China to control the economy through a bank-rate  policy. In 1988, when it adopted a financial retrenchment  policy, the central government carried out a series of direct  measures to adjust, through its own efforts, the economy. These  measures included controls on investment projects and measures  to hold down spending by government organizations and state-run  enterprises. As a result, the real economic growth rate dropped  in 1989 to 4 percent from 11 percent in 1988, while fixed-asset  investment registered negative growth.    Having learned a lesson from its previous experience, the  central government has projected a lower growth rate of 9  percent for 1994. However, it is not certain whether the central  government will be able to impose its policy of slowing down the  booming economy to bring about sustained and sound development,  because local governments, particularly in the coastal  industrial areas, are still eager for rapid development. They  are said to be strongly opposed to economic reforms that seek  strengthened macroeconomic control by the central government.  <H5>  Above All Else, There Is the Possibility of a Revolt by </H5> Farmers, Who Account for Nearly 80 Percent of the Population    If the inflationary spiral cannot be checked, and if China  continues to take growth-oriented measures, the decline in real  wages will weigh heavily on people's livelihood. If that is the  case, it might give rise to social disorder. There are  indications that the market economy system is already at a  deadlock. In some areas, panics have already occurred, because  workers are hastily making sundry purchases to hoard essential  goods.    Meanwhile, according to news reports, workers employed by  foreign companies are increasingly going on strikes in calls for  higher wages. This give the impression that the open-door  policy has also reached a deadlock. If inflation rides high at  20 percent or more even after the summer season, the central  government will be forced to carry out direct measures to adjust  by its own efforts the economy, as it did in 1989.    Moreover, if the economic gap between agricultural  communities and industrializing urban areas becomes wider,  dissatisfaction will grow among farmers, who are unable to share  in the benefits of economic development, and there will be no  holding them back. There is a possibility that the central  government might become unable to control the drift of  population from farm villages to cities. China's structural  distinction between agricultural communities and urban  communities is indispensable for maintaining the socialist  system in China. A change in the social structure might even  undermine the foundation of the Communist Party.    Even if inflation is curbed to a certain degree, companies  with foreign-capital affiliations will see the management  environment deteriorating, because they will be forced to raise  workers' wages following the adoption of a single exchange rate,  and the abolition of the maximum wage system, which was applied  to foreign companies. Until now, the maximum salary of a Chinese  worker employed by a foreign company was limited to 120 percent  of the salary of a similar worker employed by a state-run  enterprise.    The procurement of raw materials and locally made parts will  become more expensive due to inflation, while the Chinese yuan  will become hardly obtainable due to a credit squeeze.    Taxation reforms will increase the tax burden on foreign  firms. [China has introduced a value-added tax], but it said it  will take fiscal steps to offer a rebate over a period of five  years to foreign firms already operating in China. However, the  new tax will from this point forward handicap new foreign  companies coming to China.    If we take the per capita economic standard into  consideration, we have to say that China is still a country on  its way to development. However, its economic development has a  great influence on the world economy, because it has a huge  market composed of 1.2 billion people. China will for quite  some time grope for a new path to balance the central  government's macroeconomic control with rising economic activity  in different parts of the country.</p>

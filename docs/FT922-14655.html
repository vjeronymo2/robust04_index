			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Criticism between Polly Peck administrators TWO administrators of Polly Peck International have publicly distanced themselves from the third, in the latest twist in the story of Mr Asil Nadir's electronics, fruit and leisure company. But criticism of Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross by his fellow insolvency practitioners, Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte and Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully appears to have been intended to placate Turkish Cypriot sensitivities in the hope of unlocking Polly Peck records and funds in Cyprus. At a press conference on Thursday journalists were handed a press release, prepared by leading counsel, in which Mr Stone and Mr Jordan said a recent unsuccessful action by Mr Morris in the High Court in London against the Turkish Cypriot central bank was his sole responsibility. Statements and allegations by Mr Morris should not be attributed to them. They said they especially particularly regretted the fact that Mr Morris had described the Turkish army's intervention in Cyprus in 1974 as an invasion. The three administrators and the committee of Polly Peck creditors approved the contents of the statement earlier this week. Along with their comments on Mr Morris, the two administrators said they had regained control of two Polly Peck hotels in northern Cyprus, Jasmine Court and Palm Beach, and had appointed Execumaster Hotels, an international hotel management group, to run them.</p>

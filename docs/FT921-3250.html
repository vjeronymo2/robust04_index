			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Italian strike is overruled THE Italian government yesterday invoked special powers to cancel a proposed strike by air traffic controllers called for today, Robert Graham reports from Rome. Similar powers are likely to be invoked for another stoppage planned by different unions among the air traffic controllers for tomorrow. Mr Carlo Bernini, the transport minister, ordered air traffic controllers to report to work as normal and controllers who defy the order could face up to five years in jail. Strikes last Friday and Saturday by the air traffic controllers forced the cancellation of over 80 per cent of all flights in and out of Italy. The government has intervened after strong pressure from Alitalia and protests from other international airlines. The stoppages were called as part of a dispute over work conditions.</p>

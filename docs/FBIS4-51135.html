			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Wu Xichun, news  spokesman for the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, recently  disclosed that a new situation had appeared on the domestic  steel products market -- the total short-term supply of steel  products exceeds demand.    The situation of China's iron and steel production has been  very good since early this year. The output of finished steel  products reached 27.6 million tonnes from January to April,  registering an increase of 9.81 percent, or 2.46 million tonnes,  over the output of 25.14 million tonnes posted in the same  period last year. Excessive imports in the fourth quarter last  year resulted in an oversupply of steel products. Coupled with  the fact that the quantity of steel products imported in the  first four months of this year posted growth of 5 percent over  the same period last year, a new situation had appeared on the  domestic steel products market -- total short-term supply of  steel products exceeded demand. Prices on the domestic steel  products market dropped in the past two months. The prices of  steel products are predicted to basically stabilize for a  certain period of time to come. In view of the fact that the  current inventory of steel products kept by iron and steel  producing enterprises showed an increase of approximately 27  percent over the amount kept at the beginning of this year, Wu  Xichun reminded foreign trade enterprises not to blindly import  steel products.    Wu Xichun said: Due to the complex nature of the economy,  the prices of certain steel products may rise and those of  certain other steel products may drop, while the prices of most  steel products will be stable. Iron and steel enterprises must  pay close attention to market changes, continuously adjust the  structure of their product range, and enhance their capability  to adapt themselves to market changes.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE APPEARS TO URGE WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN TROOPS IN PANAMA  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II on Saturday appeared to call on Washington to withdraw its  forces from Panama as soon as possible, diplomats said.  </P> <P> "There, too, it is the civilian population which has suffered the most," the  Pope said in his yearly address to the diplomatic corps.  </P> <P> "One hopes that without delay the Panamanian people may return to a normal life  with the dignity and freedom to which any sovereign people have a right."  </P> <P> The United States has said 202 civilians were killed in a U.S. invasion last  month that ousted strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> Diplomats said that by using the words normal and sovereign, the Pope appeared  to be calling on Washington to withdraw its troops from Panama as soon as  possible. But they noted that his language was neither harsh nor pointed.  </P> <P> In what is known unofficially as his "state of the world" talk, the Pope also  told diplomats that the West should help newly democratic Eastern European  nations develop societies based on moral values, not treat them as new members  of a club of consumer countries.  </P> <P> The pontiff devoted more than half of his 13-page address to the stunning  changes in Eastern Europe, which he said resulted from the "irrepressible  thirst for freedom which has . . . toppled walls and opened doors."  </P></p>

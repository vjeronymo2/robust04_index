			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique "No. 21" issued by the Ministry of Defense on 17 </F> May; place not given]    [Text] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih yesterday sent large numbers of  barbaric forces with their vehicles into a deadly battle in a  desperate attempt to break through the fortified defense of the  Armed Forces. These forces, together with the masses of our  people, are defending justice, freedom, and honor. This was  preceded by false statements, such as those of al-Ansi and  al-Iryani, that the barbaric forces advanced behind a human  shield [words indistinct] into a deadly battle.    Our armed forces repulsed these forces by striking heavy  blows on them on the fronts of al-Karish, Abyan, Qa'tabah, and  Bayhan during which many of them surrendered, while the remnants  (?fled) toward Qa'tabah, al-Rahidah, and al-Bayda with our  forces still behind them. Our forces captured many arms and  vehicles abandoned by the oppressors.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated January 27, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;888). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposed to revise pertain to its coal exploration rules at Utah Administrative Rule (Utah Admin. R.) 645&hyph;200&hyph;100, scope of rules for coal exploration; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;200, responsibilities of the Division; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;100, requirements for coal exploration approval; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;200, notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration; and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;100, required documents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the February 25, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 9153), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT&hyph;897). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on March 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During its review of the amendment, OSM (1) identified concerns relating to the provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;232, roads and other transportation facilities, and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;235, disturbance of the hydrologic balance, and (2) provided editorial comments. OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated April 15, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;915). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah responded in a letter dated May 10, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;921). Utah proposed revisions to Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;200, responsibilities; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;100, responsibilities for coal exploration plan review; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;200, notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;300, major coal exploration permits; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;100, required documents; and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;200, performance standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM announced receipt of the proposed revised amendment in the May 24, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 26767) and reopened and extended the public comment period (administrative record No. UT&hyph;932). The public comment period ended on June 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During its review of the revised amendment, OSM identified additional concerns relating to (1) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;122, 645&hyph;200&hyph;123, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;210, lands designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining, and (2) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;235, disturbance of the hydrologic balance. OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated July 7, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;943). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah responded in a letter dated July 11, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;950). Utah proposed revisions to Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;100, scope of rules for coal exploration; Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;200, notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration; and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;200, performance standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the additional revisions to the proposed program amendment submitted by Utah, OSM reopened the public comment period in the July 29, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 38578, administrative record No. UT&hyph;956). The public comment period ended on August 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Director's Findings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds that the proposed program amendment submitted by Utah on January 27, 1994, and as revised by it on May 10 and July 11, 1994, is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

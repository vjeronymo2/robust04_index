			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Shoppers' optimism on economy tumbles OPTIMISM among UK consumers about the state of the economy took a tumble in the first half of this month, according to the latest consumer confidence survey from Gallup, the opinion poll company. The survey, carried out between June 2 and June 15 for the European Commission, found only 30 per cent of the 1,981 adults interviewed expected Britain's general economic situation to improve over the next 12 months while 31 per cent thought it would worsen. The resulting balance of minus 1, as a measure of consumer confidence, was 22 percentage points below May's result when a positive 21 per cent balance of respondents expected the economy to improve. The fall in the balance was the largest month-on-month decline since January 1991, when worries about the Gulf war pushed the balance down by 31 percentage points. Because Gallup does not ask interviewees to explain their feelings, company officials could only speculate about reasons for the sharp drop in confidence. It was suggested that the government's problems, after the sacking of Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor, could have hurt confidence. The 25 percentage point rise in the balance between April and May may have exaggerated improvements in confidence at the time. The latest Gallup survey fits in better with recent news of falling mortgage commitments in May and a slight decline in retail sales volumes last month. On the other hand, Gallup's polling was completed before last Thursday's surprise announcement of another fall in unemployment last month. This may be why 55 per cent expected unemployment would rise over the next 12 months compared with 49 per cent in May. Gallup also found its respondents more pessimistic about their own financial position and about inflation. However, 40 per cent of those polled thought it was a good time to make a major purchase compared with 29 per cent who thought it should be postponed. The resulting positive balance of 11 per cent compared with the 12 per cent recorded in May. The Treasury said not too much weight should be put on one month's change in the survey when results were volatile.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMING OUT IS A BALL;  </P> <P> YOUNG LADIES OF CHINESE HERITAGE TO TAKE THEIR TURN AS DEBUTANTES  </P> <P> At first glance, the 22 girls, resembling swan-like fairy princesses under the  bright photo studio lights, did not seem like trailblazers in the demure world  of debutanting.  </P> <P> They were stereotypically deb down to every ruffle and bow in their billowy  white gowns, no different from all the other girls who have prepared for this  "coming out" rite of high society from New York and Philadelphia to Los Angeles  and Newport Beach.  </P> <P> And, as they posed for Morgan Studio photographer Arone Long for their first  group portrait -- their Dec. 29 "Winter Blossom Ball" still months away -- they  acted as thrilled and properly awed as any debs-in-training before the big  event.  </P> <P> But these 22 girls from some of Southern California's posher neighborhoods, and  whose fathers range from doctors and engineers to corporate moguls, are not  your typical American debs.  </P> <P> These girls are all of Chinese descent. And their parents, immigrants from  China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, have organized their own  Chinese-American Debutante Guild, the first such all-Chinese group in Southern  California.  </P> <P> The unusualness, even oddity, of such a move -- especially for an  ethnic-minority group that had never been associated with this still highly  popular social ritual in America -- is not lost on these Chinese-American girls  from Orange and Los Angeles counties.  </P> <P> Murmured one of them, as she was re-fluffing her gown during a break in their  recent portrait sitting: "To me, it always seemed strictly for white girls. You  know, a Scarlett O'Hara or a Grace Kelly. But not us."  </P> <P> An Asian-American-sponsored debutante ball is still something of a novelty.  </P> <P> In the mid-'60s, the Japan America Society of Southern California, a cultural  affairs organization, did stage an annual ball that included whites but was  predominately for girls of Japanese descent.  </P> <P> But this Los Angeles "Cherry Blossom Ball" was discontinued in 1968 because, a  Japan America Society organizer explained, of the nationwide decline in the  popularity of debutante balls during the anti-establishment '60s.  </P> <P> The newly formed Chinese-American Debutante Guild is considered the first such  Asian-ancestry sponsor in Southern California since the '60s, representatives  in the Asian-American communities said.  </P> <P> Even so, the Chinese-American organizers like to assert that their effort is in  no way an ethnic-minority challenge to the traditional, white-dominated  debutante circuit.  </P> <P> They pointed out that some Asian-American girls have made their debuts at balls  on the traditional circuit with such long-established charitable presenters as  Las Campanas, Les Amis des Femmes and the Children's Home Society's Newport  Beach auxiliary.  </P> <P> Instead, the Chinese-Americans like to depict their new guild as just one more  effort to celebrate their own ethnic heritage and pass on ethnic success models  to their otherwise American-born, American-raised children.  </P> <P> These are much the same arguments used by the African-American community groups  -- including Links, a professional women's organization -- which have sponsored  their own debutante balls in Los Angeles and Orange counties for years.  </P> <P> "We see nothing wrong with forming our own (debutante) group. People with the  same backgrounds, the same values, feel more comfortable with each other,"  explained May Hsu of Tustin, co-chairwoman of the Chinese-American guild.  </P> <P> However, guild organizers said they are concerned that some Americans --  especially those critical of the proliferation of Asian-language signs and  Asian commercial strips in Los Angeles and Orange counties -- might perceive  their all-Chinese guild as racially separatist.  </P> <P> "Oh no, this is not so," said Ruth Ding of Newport Beach, long a key figure in  local Chinese-American cultural programs. "Our children are already so  Americanized. How can one small (all-Chinese) group like ours hurt."  </P> <P> "And, really, our program isn't so very different," Ding added. "We, too, want  the opportunity to honor our outstanding young women in this very special way."  </P> <P> For these guild members -- affluent families living in prestigious areas  outside the Chinese enclaves -- now find themselves turning their attention to  yet another status symbol of the upwardly mobile in America.  </P> <P> They have discovered debutanteland.  </P> <P> To many, debutanting has always meant dazzling but rather shallow displays of  conspicuous high society, when America's social elite staged its whirlwind  rounds of mammoth "coming out" parties.  </P> <P> Ever since, the more serious debutante-sponsor groups have tried to live down  the grandiose images. For years now, these groups have tied their events  closely to charitable causes -- using the balls as fund-raisers and also  recruiting the girls for community-service projects .  </P> <P> But the central vision of any debutante program is still this hallowed rite of  passage: the night of the debut extravaganza where the girls are formally  introduced to society.  </P> <P> Consider again the Chinese-American Debutante Guild-selected girls, ages 17 to  21. They are viewed as high-achiever students in various universities -- the  schools include Yale, Wellesley and UC Berkeley and Irvine -- as well as being  from socially prominent families in the Chinese immigrant community.  </P> <P> Although most of the fathers are in the business and professional fields, there  is one diplomat in the group: C.Y. Chang, Los Angeles director-general of  Taiwan's Coordinating Council for North American Affairs. His deb daughter,  Grace, is studying at Northwestern University.  </P> <P> As part of their deb apprenticeship, these girls have attended classes on the  American social graces for young ladies -- etiquette, poise, proper attire,  social dancing -- and on choosing careers. They have gone to numerous informal  parties at homes hosted by guild parents.  </P> <P> And the main event, the "Winter Blossom Ball" Dec. 29 at the Disneyland Hotel,  will feature much of the flourishes and speeches associated with such balls,  including the classic moment when each girl is announced and escorted down the  center of the ballroom.  </P> <P> "It's an exciting program and a lot of fun. It's real neat. All of us feel  proud and lucky at being chosen," said Emily Liu, 17, of Palos Verdes, who is  entering the University of Notre Dame this fall.  </P> <P> The girls also lauded the charitable side of today's debutanting. "I think  that's great because it gives depth to the program and the image," said Joni  Lee, 18, of Huntington Beach, a student at UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> The organizers pointed out that their guild was created as a fund-raising arm  for a proposed Orange County-based senior citizens center program for the  Chinese-American community.  </P> <P> The center project, still in the study stage, was launched last year with  $10,000 "seed money" from three organizations: Chinese-American Lions Club of  Orange County, Orange County Chinese Cultural Club and Pan Pacific Performing  Arts Inc.  </P> <P> According to project president Nelson Mar of Irvine, the proposed center will  chiefly be an informational and referral facility. Eventually, he added, the  center will join other Asian-American organizations in expanding housing,  health and recreation programs for seniors, particularly immigrants.  </P> <P> This community activism extends to each of the 22 guild debutantes. The girls  are required to serve at least 100 hours in a community-service program. Some  of the girls have already done extensive volunteer work, such as in hospitals.  </P> <P> Others, such as Christina Sun, 19, of Palos Verdes, have been involved in  Chinese community projects. A student at UCLA, Sun has been tutoring immigrant  children in English and other subjects at an elementary school in Los Angeles'  Chinatown.  </P> <P> Even with all this community activism, one historic mission of debutanting  cannot be underestimated, even in the '90s -- that is, these groups as social  catalyst and social arbiter.  </P> <P> For the debs, this means making the proper connections not only for careers but  also for marriage.  </P> <P> This is no small matter for those in the Chinese immigrant group. They worry  that their children, depicted as already too Americanized, are not making  enough contact with other Chinese. They fear that their great hope -- that  their children will marry other Chinese -- may be dashed.  </P> <P> The debs in the Chinese-American guild are a typical case. Nearly all were  raised in predominantly white American areas and went to elementary and high  schools there. And, unless they attended Chinese churches or Chinese language  schools, they seldom went to all-Chinese gatherings.  </P> <P> In fact, some of the older girls were already mostly dating white or other  non-Chinese males.  </P> <P> So the parents, when forming their debutante guild, saw a golden opportunity in  social arrangements: a program where nice Chinese girls can meet nice Chinese  boys.  </P> <P> The parents saw to it that the male partners at the debs' parties and social  dancing classes were all young Chinese-Americans from the same coterie of  immigrant families.  </P> <P> Tilting the ethnic scale even more, the parents have made it an official policy  that the male escorts to the Dec. 29 ball must be of Chinese descent.  </P> <P> And when one of the girls told the guild committee that she wanted her white  boyfriend to be her escort, her request was flatly turned down.  </P> <P> This deb, Sansan Kwan, 19, of Rancho Palos Verdes, said she is still not happy  with the committee's decision. "But I can live with it. It's one of those  things. I mean, all of us already know the feelings of our parents on this  issue," said Kwan, a student at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> Besides, she added, "this (guild) program is overall a very good one. I still  feel very honored at being part of it."  </P> <P> The other debs, too, seem to be taking their parents' ethnic arrangements in  stride.  </P> <P> "These (all-Chinese parties) are a lot of fun. I like the idea of meeting other  Chinese. And I think all of us are becoming more aware of our Chinese identity  as we get older," said UCLA student Rosalie Chin, 20, of El Toro.  </P> <P> But Yale student Stacie Cheng, 18, of Los Angeles added: "We also realize we're  a bicultural generation, and I think we have learned to be comfortable with  that. Socially, I don't think it (ethnic background) matters as much to us, one  way or another."  </P> <P> So on the marriage issue, the feelings of these debs may be summed up this way:  no matter whom they marry -- Chinese or non-Chinese -- the choice will be up to  them.  </P> <P> Their parents seem to agree.  </P> <P> "Oh, we can't push it (dating and marrying a Chinese)," said guild  co-chairwoman May Hsu. "We're in America, and you can't do that, can you?"  </P> <P> Yet, with the guild's specially prepared girl-meets-boy encounters in mind, Hsu  added: "But we can try and provide the right opportunities for them. We can  suggest -- and hope for the best."  </P> <P> get ready for their formal photograph.  </P></p>

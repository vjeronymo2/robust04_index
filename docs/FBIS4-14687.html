			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev today  received a delegation from the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly.  Our correspondent Ramiz Meshelihesenli reports:    [Begin recording] [Meshelihesenli] After sincerely greeting  the delegation headed by Medetkan Sherimkulov, chairman of the  Kyrgyzstan Supreme Council, Geydar Aliyev provided detailed  information on Armenia's aggressive war against Azerbaijan and  on the tragic consequences resulting from it. The Azerbaijani  president said that to date Armenia has failed to implement  concrete proposals and agreements worked out during the  Interparliamentary Assembly meeting in Moscow last September,  and that these agreements remained on paper.    It was reported that the agreements worked out by the  initiative of the international organizations and Russia for the  peaceful resolution of the conflict have been derailed because  of the Armenian side's disregard for them. What is more,  Armenia is not abiding by any of the four resolutions adopted by  the UN Security Council; rather, it is organizing new  large-scale offensives against Azerbaijan and is not putting an  end to its policy of occupation. Armenia will pursue its  aggressive aims unless punished by international organizations.    Geydar Aliyev also reminded the delegation that it was again  Armenia that undermined the agreements reached during the  meeting between the chairmen of the Armenian and Azerbaijani  parliaments.    As additional proof of Armenian aggression, Aliyev noted  that  it was Armenians who shot down the Iranian plane over Karabakh.    The Republic's president indicated that he is hopeful of the  new peace initiative of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's  delegation.    Medetkan Sherimkulov, who heads the CIS delegation, thanked  Aliyev for his detailed information on the situation. He added  that their efforts aim at settling the conflict by peaceful  means. The delegation proposed that the chairmen of the  Azerbaijani and Armenian parliaments meet in Bishkek in the  first ten days of May.    The delegation will leave for Yukhari-Karabakh  [Nagorno-Karabakh] today.    When Medetkan Sherimkulov noted the need for the  representatives of the Armenian community of Yukhari-Karabakh to  be present at the Bishkek meeting, the Azerbaijani president  replied: [Aliyev's statement in Russian omitted]    [Meshelihesenli] Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the  Republic's Supreme Soviet; Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov; State  Adviser Vafa Gulizade; Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov;  Namik Akhundov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Commission on  International Ties; Vladimir Kazimirov, Russian special  ambassador on the Karabakh problem; and other officials took  part in the meeting.

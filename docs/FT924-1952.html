			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Senior bourses lead Europe into decline There was another Nordic flurry last week as the devaluation of the Norwegian crown took place, but Europe's big bourses reflected industrial recession. It took a 1.7 per cent rise in Japan to leave the FT-Actuaries World Index with a 0.4 per cent gain. Tokyo moved from caution to recovery hopes ahead of the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey on business sentiment, which brought out profit-takers last Friday as it showed that confidence had fallen to its lowest level since 1975. Wall Street, with the Dow held back by fears for majors such as IBM and General Motors, saw new midweek highs in more broadly based indices and a rainstorm which flooded parts of downtown Manhattan last Friday. Overall, it produced an average performance. Falls in Germany, the UK and France were the main reasons behind a 0.8 per cent decline in Europe. Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, says Germany is moving into recession and that the market is too high on a p/e basis, especially in view of the prospect of a further annual fall in earnings next year. UK pundits put last week's slide in London down to profit-taking after a good run. France, although its economy is placed among the soundest in Europe, is seeing problems in the Parisian property market, gloomy news from the corporate sector in general and a slippage in earnings forecasts. Switzerland, however, provided some relief. Having discounted a negative vote in the referendum on membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), it rose on the news last Monday and extended its gains to close the week 2.7 per cent higher. Mr Bell observes that pharmaceuticals, food and financials add up to some three-quarters of the market and that this, together with the return of the Swiss franc as a safe haven for investors, makes a comforting contrast to prospects elsewhere.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 % change   % change in                  % change in local currency**   sterling** US Dollars**             1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year   Start of  Start of     Start of                                        1992       1992         1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -1.37   -1.75   -14.33   -13.99       -0.78       -17.35 Belgium      -0.82   -1.00    +0.22    -2.56      +12.48        -6.30 Denmark      +3.95   -0.16   -21.95   -22.43      -10.48       -25.43 Finland      +1.98   +9.10   +17.80   +16.98      +13.75        -5.26 France       -1.04   -1.70    +6.69    -0.28      +15.16        -4.07 Germany      -3.00   -4.44    -7.04    -9.07       +5.04       -12.50 Ireland      -1.98   +5.51   -14.92   -17.23       -5.44       -21.24 Italy        -0.16   -8.26    -8.91   -12.94      -13.83       -28.23 Netherlands  +0.51   +1.66    +7.29    +5.05      +21.52        +1.22 Norway       +3.69  +18.54    -7.32    -6.78       -2.05       -18.41 Spain        +0.44   +6.50    -9.44   -12.30       -9.71       -24.79 Sweden       +1.86  +21.65   +15.89   +12.40      +10.23        -8.18 Switzerland  +2.67   +3.29   +20.62   +16.33      +34.68       +12.18 UK           -1.36   +1.01   +13.96    +9.35       +9.35        -8.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE       -0.79   +0.34    +6.05    +2.06       +9.36        -8.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +5.17  +10.49    -6.40   -11.55       -3.55       -19.66 Hong Kong    -0.82  -18.84   +23.84   +18.48      +42.91       +19.03 Japan        +1.70   +6.63   -19.19   -21.74       -5.18       -21.01 Malaysia     -1.58   -3.94   +22.26   +17.04      +50.39       +25.28 New Zealand  -0.07  +10.97    +0.28    -6.02       +7.95       -10.09 Singapore    -0.25   +0.96    -1.46    -7.05      +10.35        -8.08 Canada       -0.68   +0.19    -4.24    -8.19       -0.14       -16.82 USA          +0.29   +2.51   +15.00    +4.22      +25.11        +4.22 Mexico       +2.30   +7.17   +31.94   +19.38      +40.05       +16.66 South Africa +0.27   +7.24   -11.34    -9.38      -26.44       -39.14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  +0.41   +2.71    +1.04    -4.74      +10.66        -7.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on December 11th 1992.

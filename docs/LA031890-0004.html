			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE PURPLE SAGE, A TREASURE HUNT;  </P> <P> SILVER LIGHT BY DAVID THOMSON (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 328 PP.; 0-394-55622-4)  </P> <P> Do the characters from Westerns have a life off-screen? Not just the easy ones,  Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, the hanging Judge Roy Bean and Billy the Kid and  Pat Garrett -- everyone knows they really lived, before myth wrapped round them  like kudzu.  </P> <P> But how about "Red River's" Matthew Garth and "The Searchers' " Ethan Edwards;  how about Ransom Stoddard and Tom Doniphon and Liberty Valance from "The Man  Who Shot Liberty Valance," or James Averill and Nate Champion from "Heaven's  Gate"? Screenwriters created them; actors inhabited them; directors browbeat or  cajoled them into their particular vision. Did they fade away when the  projectors stopped?  </P> <P> Not for David Thomson. To him they are as real as John Wayne's sweat-stained  Stetson, and their women are too. So for "Silver Light," Thomson's intricate,  hypnotic history/romance about the Old West and how we have come to perceive  it, he dips into the pool of common movie experience and into his own  imagination equally, ladling out characters who are a brash mixture of both.  </P> <P> Thus one of the pillars of his story is Susan Garth, who in the 1950s is 80  years old, a possibly great undiscovered photographer. It is her memories that  carry the narrative back to the 1860s. She lives in splendid isolation at  Arizona's Canyon de Chelly, near Monument Valley, the most movie-exploited land  in the world. And although no one will be blamed for reading a little of  Georgia O'Keeffe into Susan Garth's character, she is actually the daughter of  the movies' Matthew Garth, forever and indelibly Montgomery Cliff in "Red  River," and he will become a central character on these pages as well.  </P> <P> Then there is Susan Garth's lifelong friend, Bark Blaylock, wholly created by  Thomson. He's a journalist, writer, young witness to the death of Billy the Kid  and part-time technical adviser on Hollywood Westerns, who may have been the  son of Wyatt Earp. Or Bat Masterson. Or the cowboy "Curly Bill" Brocius. All of  them real enough Westerners.  </P> <P> Nora Stoddard, the provocative, prescient young Santa Fe museum curator who  discovers Susan Garth, seems to be at the book's center. Much of the  present-day story is concerned with the attraction that springs up between the  well-born Nora and James Averill II, the 50-year-old, casually philandering  Eastern philanthropist who heads the Averill Foundation, to which Nora applies  for backing of a show of Susan Garth's work.  </P> <P> (And if the first James Averill was played by Kris Kristofferson in "Heaven's  Gate," Nora carries an equally heavy movie heritage. Her father was the late  Sen. Ransom Stoddard, a.k.a. James Stewart, who did or did not shoot Liberty  Valance in the movie of nearly the same name.)  </P> <P> To Thomson's wide-ranging, sometimes arcane cast of film characters throw in  Charles Ives, on the occasion of the first performance of his "Three Places in  New England"; Willa Cather; alto-sax great Wardell Grey and Erich von Stroheim,  hard at work on "Greed" in the furnaces of the desert.  </P> <P> This technique, mixing and matching real and fictional characters, has been a  staple of E. L. Doctorow's; Gore Vidal pioneered a similar sort of legerdemain  years ago, but Thomson's movie-critic credentials lead him to draw primarily  from films. He played a simpler version of this game once before, with  "Suspects." There he prowled in and out of the lives of more than 80 movie  characters, filling in details of their lives off-screen with the fevered  imagination of an over-the-moon movie buff.  </P> <P> "Silver Light" is more ambitious than "Suspects," harder to sustain, with a  panoramic narrative that whips us back and forth in time. For the most part  it's done dexterously, although when one of the characters, referring to some  mischief Wyatt Earp is up to, says, "I believe he has done for some of those  boys. There are bodies in the corral," there is an almost irresistible impulse  to shout, "OK!!" if only to show that we're paying attention.  </P> <P> The writing, admittedly, strays into the purple and the unintentionally silly  at moments: Averill with Nora in bed, "looking down on the closed eyes of Nora  Stoddard, and on the hills of her, all blindly witnessing him," or 15-year-old  Sally Averill hearing her first Charlie Parker, live, in 1950: "She cannot stop  moving to the music, keep up, keep on, the beat, bop. She notices that her body  keeps the bass time . . . while her fingers and her hands are playing out the  notes of the saxophones and the vibraphone." Busy girl.  </P> <P> However this is more than balanced by the book's Byzantine and eventually  seductive design and characters, so deftly and imaginatively interwoven that  finally there is nothing left to do but surrender to them.  </P> <P> To the astringent Susan Garth, and Thomson's wonderful sequence in an abandoned  silver mine in which her own image imprints itself on a piece of silver left  behind by a miner -- and photography as her calling is as deeply imprinted on  the young girl.  </P> <P> To a masterly thunderstorm sequence, after which young Bark Blaylock fords the  Pecos river on horseback.  </P> <P> And to a picaresque subplot about Jack Chance, a sweet-natured young  middleweight managed by Blaylock, who must be goaded to anger to fight, and  Bark's scheme to get him mad by flirting with Chance's widowed mother. One can  put up with a bit of purple, when the rewards are this good.  </P> <P> Sensibly, the novel doesn't demand that we have the author's passion for its  movies, or even know all of them. (The discovery of an index at the end of the  book to every film character was an enormous relief.) Obviously it makes a  novelist's job easier when a character is called Ethan Edwards, and when John  Wayne shimmers to mind, doggedly searching through the years for a child  carried off by Comanches.  </P> <P> But if "The Searchers" isn't in our memory banks, "Silver Light" still works.  Thomson remains true to Ethan Edwards, or to Wayne's image of him as stamped by  John Ford, who will flicker into the story briefly too, as one of two  curmudgeonly directors, "Jack" and "Howard" (Hawks).  </P> <P> Curious, Thomson follows "The Searchers' " characters after the film leaves  them. What would have happened to Deborah, the young woman Ethan Edwards  rescued after more than a decade with the Comanches, half-deranged with not  knowing what people she belonged to. The book imagines Deborah's later child,  beautiful, headstrong and not a little spooked by her mother's history. This is  Sharon Pawley, who will become the love of both Bark and Susan's life, a  natural magnet for a movie camera and the star of Bark's primitive version of  "Tess of the D'Urbervilles," shot in 1915 in Northern California, with none  other than Susan Garth behind the camera.  </P> <P> Can't remember that silent film? Ah, that's because of the chicanery of Noah  Cross, decades before his appearance in "Chinatown," in the person of John  Huston. It's another of the interlocking bits that makes "Silver Light" the  treasure hunt that it is.  </P> <P> The only thing predictable about the book is that it won't make a great movie.  It already has -- about a dozen of them.  </P></p>

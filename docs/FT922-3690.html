			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BSS funds Cadel purchase with Pounds 16m rights BSS GROUP will become the second largest distributor in the domestic heating market, after Wolseley, with the Pounds 19.1m purchase of Cadel from Meyer International. It is, however, a market that has been hard hit by recession and Cadel has incurred operating losses of more than Pounds 10m in the past two years. BSS is funding the purchase with a Pounds 16.2m rights issue on a 1-for-4 basis, priced at 330p a share. Its share price fell 39p to close at 378p yesterday. BSS is acquiring only 37 of Cadel's 50 remaining branches, mainly in Scotland, the north-east of England and the Midlands. The remaining ones are being closed by Meyer. Mr Ian Phillips, chairman, said BSS had selected outlets on two grounds: to extend the group's national coverage and to take the more profitable sites. With a total of 58 outlets, its share of the domestic heating sector would amount to 14 per cent. The chain was established through the acquisitions of Heatek and Labone in 1989. The merged business had a turnover of about Pounds 55m last year. BSS said the section of the Cadel chain that it was buying made a trading profit of Pounds 1.77m on turnover of Pounds 67.8m last year. It was paying a Pounds 6m discount to the Pounds 25.1m net assets. It was taking on all of Cadel's stock, debtors and creditors. By reducing the working capital and phasing the payments for the business, the Pounds 16.2m raised should cover the cost of the acquisition, Mr Phillips said. At its March 31 year-end, net debt had fallen to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 20.3m), gearing of 38 per cent. The group also announced yesterday a 25 per cent decline in pre-tax profit, from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 10m, on sales of Pounds 209.2m (Pounds 219.7m). This was after a near Pounds 1m cut in interest costs to Pounds 1.88m. Earnings per share fell to 31.8p (41.6p). A final dividend of 11.5p makes an unchanged total of 17.25p. BSS also operates more than 60 branches serving the industrial and commercial markets. It said those had continued to weaken and were expected to remain in recession until next year. However, it believed the domestic heating and plumbing market would start to recover later this year.</p>

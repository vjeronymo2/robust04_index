			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television The first of five Young Musician Of The Year Masterclasses is given by British clarinettist Alan Hacker (7.30 BBC2). At 8.00, believe it or not, you can hear the 'Yes, no game' and people being asked whether they would rather take the money or open the box: Take Your Pick is being exhumed by ITV. Launched on Radio Luxembourg in 1952 by New Zealander Michael Miles, this ghastly game show was brought to British television in ITV's launch year, 1955, and stayed 13 years. The new host is Des O'Connor. Dear oh dear. Eight o'clock also brings a new comedy by Esmonde and Larbey (who wrote 'The Good Life') called Mulberry (BBC1). Karl Howman plays Mulberry, 'a mysterious but loveable character hired by a cantankerous old spinster', to wit, Miss Farnaby played by Geraldine McEwan. World In Action (8.30 ITV) reports on 'bond-based home income plans' which the programme regards as a scandal involving the fleecing of pensioners. In Panorama Tom Mangold investigates the case of a murdered Cardiff prostitute, and asks whether this is yet another case of British justice going awry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Huang Kuan-chun, Lo Kwang-jen, and Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Guatemala City, June 3 (CNA) -- Guatemalan President  Ramiro de Leon Carpio Friday [3 June] reiterated his support for  the Republic of China [ROC]'s bid to join the United Nations.    De Leon said his country will again put forth a proposal  backing the ROC's membership bid during the UN's 49th General  Assembly this year, even though a similar move was aborted last  year. He made the remarks in a news conference held with ROC  Premier Lien Chan at the Presidential Office.    Guatemala, along with six other Latin American countries,  submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali,  asking the UN to put the ROC's UN bid on the agenda for the 48th  General Assembly in September 1993.    Lien, leading a 21-member entourage, arrived here Thursday  evening from El Salvador for a four-day official visit.    Lien paid his respects to the memory of Guatemala's national  martyrs Friday morning. He was later given a key to Guatemala  City before he called on the Guatemalan Parliament and  Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias.    The Guatemalan Government also conferred a medal upon Lien  for his promotion of friendly ties between the two countries.    De Leon held a luncheon to honor Lien and his entourage,  which includes Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang, Vice  Foreign Affairs Minister Fang Chin-yen, Vice Central Bank of  China Governor Yu Cheng, and Government Information Office  Director-General Jason Hu.    Guatemala is the second leg of Lien's Central American  visit.  Before he flew into Guatemala, Lien spent four days in El  Salvador where he attended the inauguration of Salvadoran  President Armando Calderon Sol.    Meanwhile, Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang told the  press here that the two countries will sign an investment  guarantee agreement when De Leon visits Taipei in July.    Chiang's remarks came after the two countries held wide  ranging talks on economic issues, including agriculture, animal  husbandry, and trade and industry technological training.    According to Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of the Council of  Agriculture, a bilateral agricultural cooperative agreement will  be extended for five more years after it expires in November  1995.</p>

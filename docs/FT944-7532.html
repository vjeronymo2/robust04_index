			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / People: Kleinwort Benson poaches from NatWest's investment trust team Kleinwort Benson Securities has broken up the top team of stockbrokers covering the UK investment industry by poaching the bulk of the sales and marketing staff of NatWest Securities investment trust team. NatWest Securities' Hamish Buchan, the doyen of the investment trust sector, said yesterday that the first he knew about it was when 10 of his staff announced that they were quitting. He admitted that it was a big blow when a team walked out en masse and was particularly painful because it had coincided with his 50th birthday. Buchan, who has headed Extel's list of investment trust analysts for all but one of the past 21 years, said yesterday that he and Robin Angus, an equally big figure in investment trust research, intend to stay at NatWest Securities and rebuild the sales team. 'We think we have a fairly strong franchise,' says Buchan. It has been known for some time that Kleinwort Benson Securities has been keen to break into the investment trust sector which is dominated by NatWest Securities, along with Smith New Court and SG Warburg. Margins tend to be better than in other parts of the equity business and there is the added bonus of winning big fees on corporate business. When Kleinwort Benson launched its heavily over-subscribed European Investment Trust earlier this year it had to part with several million pounds of fees to rival brokers. By having its own investment trust sales team it could prevent this happening again and further its ambitions to become a big player in overseas investment trusts. It is understood that the team defecting to KB is headed by Robbie Robertson and Roger Hullett and come from the London end of NatWest Securities' investment trust operation. The best investment trust teams use their research analysts to feed their sales force and it is significant that the two best-known analysts at NatWest Securities have not defected.</p>

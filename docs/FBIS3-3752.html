Guizhou Governor Chen Sineng briefed him on the conditions  and realities in supporting the impoverished in Guizhou. Deputy  Wang Kunsheng spoke on Qianxinan Prefecture's work to support  the impoverished. Meng Sufen, vice chairwoman of the seventh  provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, also attended the meeting and gave a  briefing on the impoverished conditions of the Mashan area, the  most impoverished mountainous area in Guizhou.    After listening carefully to the briefings, Chen Junsheng  said: The state all along has regarded Guizhou as a key in the  work to support the impoverished, and it will remain so.  Guizhou has made great progress in supporting the impoverished  over the past few years. If soil improvement were to be pursued  on half a million mu each year, great changes certainly would  take place. Chen Junsheng said: There are still 129 townships  isolated from the province's highway network, and this issue  must be resolved as quickly as possible. It is hoped that  Guizhou will exert efforts, from the top to to grass roots, to  become well-off as early as possible.    Yang Zhong, deputy head of the leading group and director of  the Office for the Economic Development of Impoverished Areas,  also attended the meeting.</p>

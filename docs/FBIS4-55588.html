			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] New York, May 17 (TANJUG) -- United Nations  spokesman for peacekeeping missions Fred Eckhard said on Tuesday  that the situation in central Bosnia-Herzegovina had  considerably deteriorated as a result of offensive actions of  the Bosnian Moslem forces on Serb positions. Bosnian Moslems  have been attacking for days Serb positions on Mount Ozren east  of Doboj, Mount Vlasic north-west of Travnik and Mount Majevica  near Tuzla in north-eastern Bosnia. Cease-fire was also  violated by intensified sniper fire and fire from other weapons  in Sarajevo while in other parts of Bosnia the situation is more  or less normal, only with sporadic clashes, Eckhard told  reporters.    At the ministerial meeting of the United States, Russia and  the European Union in Geneva on Friday, the participants asked  Bosnia's warring sides to stop fighting for a period of four  months. The Serb side accepted the proposal but said it  preferred a permanent truce while the Moslem leadership rejected  it. Eckhard said that about eight shells had been fired on  Tuzla airfield during the landing of an UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] plane which carried equipment for locating mortar  positions and which will be positioned around the  Moslem-controlled town of Tuzla and Brcko, a Serb town in  northern Bosnia around which the Moslem side has been massing  troops lately.    No casualties were reported in the attack, said Eckhard and  added that the shells were believed to have come from the Serb  side. While the Moslem offensive is escalating, the U.S. media  is almost completely ignoring it, which is evidently the old  recipe of never mentioning Moslem assaults so that a possible  Serb counter-attack could be later presented as an "act of  aggression."    Such a scenario was applied in the case of Gorazde, where  the  Bosnian Serb Army in March stopped a Moslem offensive --  launched from the U.N.-proclaimed "safe area" which should have  been demilitarized last year -- and pushed back the Moslem  forces towards the centre of Gorazde in a counter-attack.</p>

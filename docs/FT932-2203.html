			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: 'Unfair' rates of interest BUILDING societies which charge 'unfair' rates of interest risk having to pay compensation to savers after a case handled by the building societies ombudsmen, says their annual report this week. Savers have seen their income almost halve since interest rates peaked in 1990. Most complaints to the ombudsmen centred on the failure of societies to alert investors to new accounts offering higher rates than the ones in which they had placed their savings. Although the ombudsmen reiterated their decision, arrived at last year, that the onus is on investors to be vigilant, they also said that if interest rates paid were 'unduly low,' these could be held to be unfair even if the society had publicised them. This is what happened in a case where investors bought a two-year variable rate bond with a minimum investment of Pounds 10,000. The society closed the bond to new investors and then reduced the rate to less than that paid on tiers above Pounds 10,000 on its 90-day notice account and some tiers of its instant access account. Investors knew the rate they were being paid but were powerless to do anything. The terms of the bond did not allow them to give notice. The society - which was not named by the ombudsmen - was forced to pay compensation of up to Pounds 1,400 each to 30 investors. Complaints about mortgage interest rates rose 35 per cent to 367; most were about the tardiness of building societies in bringing down their mortgage rates after a base rate cut. One particular area of concern was home income plans - complaints nearly quadrupled to 112 - and complaints about mortgage protection plans. In many cases, the ombudsmen found themselves tied by their terms of reference which does not allow them to make decisions about events which happen before a mortgage or investment is taken out, unless the building societies involved agree to it. 'It is fundamentally unsatisfactory that our jurisdiction depends on the building societies agreeing to it,' said Stephen Edell, one of three ombudsmen who prepared the report. Nine of the 21 societies against which complaints about home income plans and equity release schemes were made have refused to co-operate with the ombudsmen. These are: Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bristol &amp; West, Chelsea, Leeds, National Counties, Newcastle, Northern Rock, Staffordshire and West Bromwich. One case on mortgage protection cover which did fall within the ombudsmen terms of reference led to the highest compensation - Pounds 22,500 - awarded during the year. A customer applied for a mortgage with a society which required him to take out mortgage protection insurance. He did this through the society. The mortgage was completed on December 15 1989 but the society did not arrange cover for him until January 1 1990. The unemployment insurance excluded the first 90 days of unemployment but he lost his job more than 90 days after December 15 but less than 90 days after January 1. The ombudsmen found that the society was guilty of maladministration and ordered it to pay the amount the policy would have paid out, as well as compensation for inconvenience and some legal costs. The number of initial complaints dropped slightly to 9,402 from 9,525, and just over half related to mortgages.</p>

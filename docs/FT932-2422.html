			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Bradford &amp; Bingley comes to market BRADFORD &amp; Bingley has become the latest UK building society to tap the syndicated credits market. It has completed a Pounds 250m (Dollars 375m) revolving credit facility, increased from an initial Pounds 150m after the facility was oversubscribed, according to arrangers Swiss Bank Corporation and Westdeutsche Landesbank. A third of the facility will be drawn by the borrower after next week's signing. The five-year facility incorporates a US dollar swing-line option, allowing the borrower to receive immediate dollar funds in the US market at half a point above the US prime rate. The commitment fee on the facility is 17 basis points. The margin, if funds are drawn, is 32 1/2 basis points, unless more than 50 per cent of the facility is drawn, in which case a further 2 1/2 basis points is added.</p>

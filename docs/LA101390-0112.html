			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW DODGER MENU -- BUT HOT DOGS STAY  </P> <P> Citing an appetite for an "expanded menu selection" beyond the hot dog, Peter  O'Malley, president of the Los Angeles Dodgers, announced Friday that the club  will switch food concessionaires, ending 29 years with Arthur Food Services.  </P> <P> Marriott Corp.'s Sports &amp; Entertainment Division will operate the stadium  food concession beginning with the 1991 baseball season.  </P> <P> "This is something that has been in the works for a long, long time," Tom  Arthur, president of Arthur Food, said. "I guess it's time to go on to  something else."  </P> <P> The Dodgers had been evaluating the concession contract since June, and had  asked the Century City-based food company to expand its offering to  stadium-goers, Arthur said.  </P> <P> "But I've always felt that the big items sold in a baseball park were hot  dogs," said Arthur, who introduced other foods in recent years without success.  </P> <P> "There's such a drive on about nutrition and health, and people want chickens  and fruit drinks," he said. "We tried them all but we didn't find that they  were such a big deal."  </P> <P> Arthur even tried sushi once in 1984, "but it didn't go," he said.  </P> <P> O'Malley announced that the change was part of a "complete renovation and  modernization of all food facilities at the stadium. The Dodgers expect  Marriott to retain the traditional Dodger Dog, which is supplied by Farmer  John/Clougherty Packing Co. of Los Angeles. But Marriott will also to bring  into the stadium such fast-food chains as Carl's, McDonald's and sandwich  vendors, said Dodger spokesman Jay Lucas.  </P> <P> Professional sports concessions require heavy investment in cookers, venting  and other equipment whenever menus are enlarged, Arthur said. "And that's  something we're not prepared to do. We felt that what we had there was  adequate," he added. Arthur would not disclose financial information on the  privately held concessionaire.  </P> <P> Marriott pledged to make Dodger Stadium its "flagship operation" in sports and  entertainment food, according to Marriott Corp. spokesman Vince Pantuso.  </P> <P> Both the Dodgers and Arthur described the parting as amicable. "Nobody's out  there with sackcloth and ashes," Arthur said. "We're just going to try to make  a smooth transition."  </P></p>

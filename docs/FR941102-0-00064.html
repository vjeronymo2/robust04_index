This regulation addressed corn seed that originally was treated with captan as a seed protectant and was later ``detreated'' by washing or roasting so that the seed could be used as an animal feed. The basis for the revocation was the absence of residue data to support the regulation and the lack of adequate control procedures to ensure seed was detreated properly. On August 27, 1993, Ken Hunt of Ken's Roasting Service filed objections to that revocation. This Order denies those objections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In March 1986, as part of an overall review of captan, EPA determined that the record contained ``no acceptable residue data to support the roasting detreatment method at any dosage or period of storage.'' (Guidance for the Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Captan (March 1986).) The Residue Chemistry Chapter of the Registration Standard (August 1985) concluded that there were insufficient data for residues of captan on corn seed that had been treated at the maximum label rate and then detreated. The only available data were on residue reduction from washing of treated corn seed. The then- existing tolerance was exceeded in several samples, the treatments were not conducted at the maximum label rate, and crucial details of many of the experiments were missing. The validity of the data could not be determined, and the data covered only a washing process. Data were requested on the residues of concern on seed both before and after detreating. The detreatment methods of interest to the registrant(s), such as roasting, were to be tested. This information was essential to establish a proper tolerance and to evaluate the dietary risk from detreated corn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA announced it would revoke the food additive regulation for detreated corn seed unless within 1 year the following data and information were submitted: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Data on the residues of concern in or on corn seed treated with captan at the maximum allowable rate and detreated by an acceptable process. Data were required on residues of concern both before and after detreatment. Moreover, EPA made clear that different methods of detreating would only be permitted under the regulation if data were presented depicting residues resulting from each method. EPA required that the data must depict the influence of varying parameters of the detreating process, such as rate of seed treatment, volume of water required, temperature employed, etc. Finally, EPA explained that these data would be used to establish the acceptable conditions for detreating by each method. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. An acceptable method for informing corn seed treaters and corn seed distributors of acceptable methods for detreating captan-treated corn seed must be proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. An acceptable handling procedure for captan-treated seed corn (to be detreated) to assure that there are no other pesticides on the seed must be proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because no data or information were submitted over the next 3 years, on August 30, 1989 (54 FR 35897), EPA proposed to revoke the food additive regulation on the grounds that there were insufficient data to support it. EPA received several comments opposing the revocation, but none of the commenters submitted the data requested. EPA was not convinced by any of the comments that the data were not necessary and, therefore, on August 4, 1993, it issued a final rule revoking the tolerance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 27, 1993, Ken Hunt of Ken's Roasting Service, Arcadia, Nebraska, filed objections to the revocation. Mr. Hunt supplemented his objections on September 7, 1993. Mr. Hunt's primary objection is that detreatment of captan-treated seed by roasting is safer than simply disposing of the seed. As support for this contention, Mr. Hunt claims that his experience in feeding to his livestock seed that he has detreated has caused no harm to the livestock or to his family, which has consumed meat from that livestock. Mr. Hunt also notes that tolerances for captan on various other crops, such as grapes, are as high as 50 parts per million (ppm). Mr. Hunt submitted analytic sampling results from his detreated corn which show that the tested corn contained low levels of captan (2 ppm or less). Mr. Hunt claims that he avoids detreating seeds that contain pesticide residues other than captan by having his trucker check the labels on all seed that is picked up for detreatment. Finally, Mr. Hunt asks if EPA would allow him to continue his operation for a few more years because of the sizable investment he has put into it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons below, EPA must deny Mr. Hunt's objections. Magnitude of residue data, such as were requested here, are critical data in establishing or supporting tolerances and food additive regulations for pesticide residues. As EPA's Pesticide Assessment Guidelines explain, ``[r]esidue chemistry data on processed food/feed are used by the Agency to estimate the exposure of the general population to pesticide residues in foods (including animal commodities) and for setting and enforcing food additive tolerances for pesticide residues in or on processed food/feed under provisions of Section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.'' (Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision O, Addendum 4, p. 2 [MIS #PB88-117270, EPA 540/09-88-004 (Nov. 1987)].) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without magnitude-of-residue data, EPA cannot make accurate exposure estimates and hence risk estimates also will be inaccurate. The anecdotal information supplied by Mr. Hunt cannot substitute for safety evaluations made on the basis of valid scientific data. Additionally, magnitude-of-residue data allow EPA to establish enforcement levels in tolerances and food additive regulations that are representative of the residue levels that will be found under proper pesticide use patterns. If tolerances and food additive regulations are set at levels exceeding what could be expected from normal usage, then pesticide users might be encouraged to apply pesticides without strict regard to label requirements or not to follow proper detreatment procedures. If tolerances and food additive regulations are set too low, then otherwise safe food may be seized by the Food and Drug Administration or Department of Agriculture. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is true that several foods have captan tolerances at levels exceeding the levels Mr. Hunt has reported in his detreated corn, but those tolerances are supported by residue data and the safety of those tolerances has been evaluated based on those data, consumption pattern data, and information on exposure from other uses of captan. If residue data had been submitted for detreated corn, a similar analysis could have been performed for the food additive regulation at issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sampling results submitted by Mr. Hunt are no substitute for the magnitude-of-residue data requested. They represent a single detreatment method under unspecified conditions. Several summary analysis reports are given, indicating residues on detreated corn ranging from less than 0.01 ppm to 2.6 ppm. The analytical methods are not specified, and no method validation data were included. Moreover, no data were provided on the same corn prior to detreatment. The data are of the type that a business might use to monitor quality control in its process, but the data are totally inadequate for fulfilling residue chemistry data requirements. Mr. Hunt appears to follow a careful procedure for not detreating seed containing other than captan residues, but this alone is not grounds for maintaining the food additive regulation. Finally, EPA recognizes that Mr. Hunt may have a sizable investment in his operation, but tolerances and food additive regulations are rules of national application, and Mr. Hunt's investment cannot justify maintaining the legality of these pesticide residues nationwide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the objections are denied. This Order is issued under FFDCA section 409(f) and is subject to judicial review as provided in FFDCA section 409(g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lynn R.

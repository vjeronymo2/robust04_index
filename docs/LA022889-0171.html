			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRAN THREATENS BREAK WITH BRITAIN OVER 'VERSES'  </P> <P> Iran's Parliament voted today to break diplomatic relations with Britain in one  week unless London changes its "hostile stance" to the Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini's death decree against author Salman Rushdie.  </P> <P> Britain refused to bow to the Iranian ultimatum.  </P> <P> The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that 100 of 180 deputies  present in the 270-member legislature, known as the Majlis, voted for the bill.  </P> <P> It was Parliament's response to Britain's leading the 12-member European  Community in pulling its diplomats from Tehran after a death threat issued by  Khomeini against the Indian-born British author of "The Satanic Verses."  Rushdie's novel is considered blasphemous by Muslims.  </P> <P> The Iranian news agency said the Majlis would give Britain a week to  "reconsider its unprincipled stand on the contents of 'The Satanic Verses'  before ordering the Iranian Foreign Ministry to cut off all diplomatic ties."  </P> <P> The agency quoted one deputy, Hussein Mahlouji, as saying that "if Britain  apologized and regretted the contents of 'The Satanic Verses' and said it had  no part in the production of the book, it would be a great political victory  for Iran."  </P> <P> In London, British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said Britain  regrets the Iranian Parliament's threat to sever diplomatic relations but will  not change its stance concerning Rushdie.  </P> <P> "Clearly, the British position will not be altered by threats of that kind,"  Waldegrave said. "We regret the statement and hope Iranian leaders will  consider again what so many international leaders have now said to them, that  they have an obligation to behave within international law."  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons today that  freedom of speech and expression are "subject only to the laws of this land ...  and will remain subject to the rule of law."  </P> <P> "It is absolutely fundamental to everything in which we believe and cannot be  interfered with by any outside force," she said.  </P> <P> The fact about 100 lawmakers of the 270-member Parliament were absent from the  vote fueled speculation among political observers that there are some moderates  among the ruling clergy who oppose Iran's current anti-Western policy because  it may damage Iran's oil-based economy and further delay its economic recovery  from its 8-year war with Iraq.  </P></p>

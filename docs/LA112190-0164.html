			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORTHY'S NAME SURFACES IN PORTLAND ESCORT CASE;  </P> <P> NBA: THE LAKER IS LISTED ON THE LOG OF A SERVICE LINKED TO PROSTITUTION, POLICE  SAY. HE IS NOT BEING INVESTIGATED.  </P> <P> James Worthy's name appears on the log of an escort service linked to  prostitution, Portland police said today.  </P> <P> The Lakers forward pleaded innocent Tuesday in Houston to charges he solicited  prostitution from two undercover police officers.  </P> <P> Worthy allegedly called an escort service that was being monitored by police.  He was arrested last week before a game with the Houston Rockets.  </P> <P> Police made no attempt earlier this year to pursue Worthy in the Portland case,  Portland Police Bureau spokesman Dave Simpson said.  </P> <P> The detective who investigated the Portland case, Sgt. Rick Mosiman, said  Worthy's name appeared on the Feb. 6 log of Allstar Models and Escorts.  </P> <P> Police confirmed with officials at a local Marriott hotel that Worthy stayed in  the room listed next to his name in the log, Mosiman said.  </P> <P> Police seized the log in a raid on Allstar Models and Escorts, he said.  </P> <P> The service's operator, Valerie Ann Walton, 24, and her sister, Marla Walton,  22, later were convicted of promoting prostitution, Mosiman said.  </P> <P> In the course of a three-month police investigation of Allstar Models, an  undercover police officer also arrested two customers, he said.  </P> <P> But there never was any direct evidence that Worthy solicited sex from any of  the women who worked for the Waltons, Mosiman said.  </P> <P> He also said Worthy was the only professional athlete identified as a possible  customer of the service.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 June, a survey by the Ministry of Finance  indicated that Japan's direct investment in DPRK (North Korea)  recorded zero both on project and money basis in fiscal 1993.  Japan's investment in North Korea had continued since 1967 or  immediately after the latter lifted a ban on acceptance of  foreign investment. The investment indicated even a tendency of  a little increase in recent years. There have been so far 18  projects of direct investment in North Korea, totaling $35.609  million. The investment reached a peak in fiscal 1988 when  there were seven projects totaling $12.62 million. In fiscal  1992, there was one investment project amounting to $4.29  million. Investment was made mainly in such industries as  textile and timber.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Italy lays down a path for a return to the Eurodollar market THE Republic of Italy surprised investors yesterday with a plan to swap Dollars 9.15bn of its existing Eurobonds into two new issues in an attempt to pave the way for its return to the Eurodollar bond market. Italy has not launched a Eurodollar bond since January 1991. Issues in other currencies have also been limited due to growing concern about the economy and the budget deficit. Hopes of capitalising on a successful return to the markets after a DM5bn bond in January were hit by the intensifying corruption scandal - which exacerbated the mood of political uncertainty and led to a sharp decline in the value of the lira - along with downgradings of Italy's credit rating. The timing of the latest deal, managed by Morgan Stanley, suggests the treasury and its advisers may believe the mood towards Italy has now turned, and that political reform will gain momentum under the new government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former central bank governor. Yesterday's deal allows investors to exchange outstanding Republic of Italy Eurodollar bonds for one of two new issues. Investors in any of five issues with maturities from 1993 to 1997 will be able to swap into a 5.625 per cent five-year bond. An initial Dollars 500m tranche of the new bond was yesterday fully subscribed by Morgan Stanley and a pool of other banks. Holders of two outstanding Italy bonds with maturities in 1999 and 2001 will be able to exchange their paper for a new 6.625 per cent 10-year bond. However, holders of at least Dollars 300m of bonds will have to come forward for this transaction to take place. Investors taking advantage of the offer will receive a new bond in exchange for their old issue, along with accrued interest due and cash adjustment amount based on the price difference between the old and new bonds. The deal will offer existing bondholders the chance to swap into much more liquid paper, as many of the existing issues are relatively illiquid, without having to buy new paper. The transaction has several advantages for the Republic of Italy. It will enable the treasury to gain a much better assessment of its investor base and establish benchmarks for possible future Eurodollar bonds. The treasury indicated in January that it would like to borrow between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn on the Eurodollar markets this year to reduce its dependence on the domestic bond market and extend maturities on its existing debt. That ambition, scotched by political events soon after, may now have been revived. Bankers believe the treasury had been planning a very substantial Eurodollar bond, estimated at up to Dollars 5bn, to follow the D-Mark transaction. Assuming the swap offer is well received, it will now be better placed to price any new deal. The treasury may also be keen to assess the impact on the market of last week's downgrading to A1 from Aa3 in Italy's creditworthiness by Moody's, the US debt-rating agency. Some officials suggest that the tightening of spreads on existing paper which accompanied yesterday's exchange offer suggests investor confidence in Italian paper is actually higher than Moody's rating suggests. Eurobond dealers in London commented favourably on certain aspects of the exchange arrangement, pointing out that some investors will probably be keen to swap into a more liquid bond issue, especially since some existing Eurodollar debt is trading well over par. 'It's a good idea to try to clean up existing issues because of the various distortions in the market arising from tax exemption' said one syndicate head. But many houses had reservations about the offer. For a start, Italian investors who hold tax-exempt paper are unlikely to swap into the new, taxable issue, while those investors who are asset-swappers are unlikely to want to unwind their swaps. 'Those investors who bought Italian paper at a yield spread of around 30 basis points in the last year will probably be unwilling to sell it at 60 basis points,' said one European banker. Another syndicate manager questioned how many investors will want to increase their duration by exchanging their bonds. The bonds were reoffered at the issue price of 99.52 but were quoted at 99.24 by late afternoon for a yield spread of 65.5 basis points, according to Morgan Stanley. While Italy grabbed the market's attention, there were a clutch of other interesting deals. The International Finance Corporation, the private sector affiliate of the World Bank, made its debut in the Euroyen sector with Y40bn of 4.375 per cent, five-year bonds. The deal was seen as aggressively priced with a yield spread of 17 basis points over the No 111 JGB, and some rival houses suggested a yield spread of 24 basis points would have been more appropriate. The IFC issue was priced to yield 10 basis points more than an existing World Bank Euroyen bond, the 4 1/2 per cent due 1997, and the deal held its spread, according to Nikko, the lead manager. The proceeds were swapped into dollars and the borrower is expected to achieve 'substantially sub-Libor' funding of at least 30 basis points below Libor.</p>

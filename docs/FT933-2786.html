			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Gaddum urges return to banking basics THE 'innovative' practice of financing capital investment with short-term borrowings came under heavy fire yesterday from Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the vice president-elect of the Bundesbank. Urging a general return to more traditional methods, still predominant in Germany, he said it was no accident that the Bundesbank's interest rates policy found more support at home than in countries where investment was suppressed by over-dependence on short-term rates. 'No-one should conclude that it is the central bank's job to correct this inappropriate financing structure. The result should be reconsideration of the rules for industrial and construction financing,' he told a bankers' meeting in Bremen. Mr Gaddum, who takes office at the end of this month, appeared to be drawing a new line of defence against criticism of the Bundesbank's snail's-pace reduction in its short-term discount rate. While there has been some domestic pressure from business for faster easing of monetary policy in the past 18 months, it has been relatively muted. Some 80 per cent of all corporate lending in Germany is made at long-term rates. Financial markets in all western countries had been flooded with so-called innovative ways of packaging and guaranteeing financing in recent years, Mr Gaddum said. These had led people to ignore the traditional basic rules. 'For me these include the rule that long-term investments must also be financed over the long-term,' he said. 'Countries which have been more open to these innovations than Germany have had to learn costly lessons. 'The money market, that is the market for short-term money, is and remains the central banks' field of operations,' he said. Banks which had freedom to manoeuvre with their short-term rate policy could easily counter speculation which had no real economic grounds, he maintained. But if this room for action was limited then recent events - speculative pressure on European currencies which led to the effective suspension of the European exchange rate mechanism - could easily be repeated. Mr Gaddum claimed that monetary policy could not be blamed for the industrialised world's problems. Unemployment and public sector debt, which rose from one economic cycle to the next, reflected structural economic and social weaknesses. 'One cannot avoid the impression that the all too frequent attempts to blame monetary policy for blocking recovery are attempts to divert attention from inappropriate decisions on pay, social policy and state spending,' he said. The Bundesbank, which has pressed vigorously for a rethink on these issues within Germany, returned to the theme in its September monthly report, published today. Noting a considerable deterioration in public budgets, the report said the total year-end deficit could be worse than expected. Including off-budget borrowings by the post office, railways and the Treuhand privatisation agency, it could reach DM230bn (Pounds 92bn), equivalent to 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The federal deficit in the second quarter, helped by the injection of the central bank's 1992 profit of DM13bn, was only DM2.5bn. But this compared with a surplus of DM10bn in the same period last year, including DM14.5bn in Bundesbank profits.</p>

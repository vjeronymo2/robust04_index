			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fabbri Confirms Denial of Spy Plane </F> Facilities"]    [Text] Parma, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- Italian Defence Minister  Fabio Fabbri confirmed here today that the Rome government had  refused the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency permission to fly  two unpiloted espionage drones from Italy over ex-Yugoslavia,  but said unauthorised speculation seeking to explain the move  had got it wrong.    The American weekly, AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY,  said  in its edition on the newsstands today that Albania had agreed  to let the CIA fly the drones from its facilities because of  Italy's refusal.    After the release of a pre-publication copy of the article,  the author, John Morrocco, told ANSA that a service on the same  question two months ago quoted Pentagon sources as saying  various countries had turned down the CIA's request. "After  further research, we managed to learn that the refusal came from  Italy," he added, "but we don't know why or what the motivations  were."    Fabbri told reporters that the denial of the facilities  concerned only a question of air safety. "The remote-controlled  planes would have had to use Italian airspace used by intense  aviation traffic," he said, "and the risks would have been grave  in case of a crash or a technical fault."    He also pointed out there was no Italian or international  legal framework to work within which would create not a few  problems for the air traffic control authorities. Above all,  Fabbri was careful to stress that he found it "frankly  surprising and unacceptable" that there should have been hints  of a limited spirit of collaboration by the Italian authorities  when top U.S. officials recognised the "extraordinary  cooperation" shown for NATO and the United States in all their  operations in ex-Yugoslavia.    The drones the CIA will be using are reportedly two GNAT  750's developed after the Gulf War had disclosed shortcomings in  U.S. information gathering capabilities and now brought into  service ahead of time to improve information collection in  Bosnia.    The GNAT can fly for 24 hours at a stretch to a maximum  altitude of 8,000 m and with a range of 800 km, transmitting  digitalised information back to base via land stations or  another plane. Direct hookups with Washington are also  possible, AVIATION WEEK said.    The programme, which has been estimated at 6 million  dollars,  involves setting up a radar station in Albania with a CIA team  of twelve. February 1 was initially set as the starting date,  but missions may now start at the end of the month, the weekly  reported.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Observer: Black marks Whoever deserves a plus mark in this summer's Advanced-level exams, it is not the senior examiner responsible for a mathematics paper set by one of the A-level boards: the Oxford University Delegacy of Local Examinations. He included in the mechanics paper a complex problem requiring candidates to prove, among other things, that a stone catapulted at a moving target would hit its mark. His own workings and checks showed that, handled properly, the information given in the question yielded a quadratic equation which provided the answer. The equation was: 4t2 - 8t + 5 = 0 But when the A-level candidates sat the problem last month, the best equation any of them could derive from the data was: 4t2 - 8t - 5 = 0 which didn't yield any sort of answer at all. The Oxford board's chagrin is all the worse because between the setting of the problem in autumn 1991 and the exams 21 months later, the paper was subjected to repeated checks in which it was scanned by numerous staff. 'We thought our system was fool-proof,' said an official ruefully, 'but they can obviously still get though.' He's right. On Eddie George's first morning as Bank of England Governor he was given a champagne send-off by the newsagent who supplies his FT, Bernie Webb. In reporting the event, Observer - who attended without over-indulging  -printed his surname as Kemp. Apologies to Bernie, and heart-felt sympathy to the Oxford board.</p>

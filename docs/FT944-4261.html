			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Fifty in actions against Hoover Fifty dissatisfied customers yesterday started court proceedings against Hoover, the electrical group, over the company's free flights offer. Solicitors dealing with the cases, Merseyside-based firm J. Keith Park, said it had a further 8,000 files in hand. The promotion, which started in 1992, offered customers two free flights to continental Europe or the US if at least Pounds 100 was spent on a Hoover product. The company was overwhelmed by demand and thousands of customers complained. Maytag, Hoover's US parent company, said earlier this year that the promotion had cost more than Pounds 48m to fulfil. About 220,000 people have flown using the offer, but several thousand still say they are owed flights. Yesterday's proceedings, in the small claims division of St Helens county court, Merseyside, are for claims averaging about Pounds 1,000, plus costs, said J. Keith Park. The Hoover Holiday Pressure Group, representing claimants, said it believed 90 cases had already been brought to small claims courts, mainly by unrepresented individuals. Hoover had won 68 of these cases. Mr Harry Cichy, group founder, said the latest batch of 50 cases was 'the start of many' and the group hoped to go ahead with High Court action. He added: 'We don't want this to go on for ever. We want to try to negotiate a settlement with them (Hoover) but they don't seem to want to. 'People who failed to get flights are still as determined as ever to get justice and a fair deal.' Hoover said yesterday that it had offered flights to everyone who was entitled to them and would continue to defend cases where it considered it had fulfilled its obligations.</p>

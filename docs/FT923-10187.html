			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Deadline is imposed on Tecs THE GOVERNMENT has given Training and Enterprise Councils a mid-September deadline to decide whether they want a new central body to co-ordinate their activities. A shortlist of possible models is being prepared by Sir Christopher Ball, former warden of Keble College, Oxford, and they will be disclosed to Tecs for discussion next month. A decision on the type of umbrella organisation, if any, that should represent the 82 Tecs in England and Wales is one of the most difficult facing them. It might entail tough talks with the Department of Employment, which is awaiting the results of the Tec consultation. Some ministers would oppose a body that would give Tecs greater independence from the government. The issue has come to the forefront of the Tec agenda because the remit of the National Training Task Force, set up by the government to help it launch the Tec movement, will end this December. The task force has given a national dimension to many of the functions performed by Tecs locally. Most Tecs want structural change in their relationship with the government. They want more influence with the government and less interference from it. Some fiercely independent Tecs wanted no formal structure between them and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary.</p>

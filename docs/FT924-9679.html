			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (6): Patient still healthy - Predictions of banking gloom remain unfulfilled ABOUT a year ago, analysts were predicting that a combination of competitive, regulatory and economic were conspiring to send Luxembourg's financial industry - the main pillar of its GDP and employer of nearly 10 per cent of its workforce - into a steady decline. Evidence certainly pointed to tougher times. In 1990, profits in the banking sector had been squeezed hard by competition and extensive provision against problem loans. The number of new banks lining up to set up shop in the Grand Duchy was tailing off and new competitors, such as Dublin, threatened growth areas such as investment funds. At the same time, Luxembourg was reckoned vulnerable to renewed efforts by its EC partners to abolish the advantages offered by statutory banking secrecy and the lack of a withholding tax on investment income for non-residents. Such moves, it was said, would dampen the attraction of Luxembourg for private investors, just when their confidence in the stability of the Grand Duchy's banks had been rocked by the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Finally, banking in Luxembourg appeared to be pricing itself out of business with a lethal combination of exorbitant salaries and inflated property costs. Attempts to rein in personnel costs threatened to shatter one of the sector's vital assets - an almost strike-free tradition. Yet a year later, the patient stubbornly refuses to sicken. Many of the troubling indicators - such as profitability - have turned upward again. New regulatory constraints remain below the horizon. And the financial sector seems to be achieving a leaner, more competitive profile. Quality is more important than quantity, says Mr Pierre Jaans, director of the Grand Duchy's regulatory body, the Luxembourg Monetary Institute (IML), refering to the authorities' policy of encouraging only top-drawer financial institutions to set up subsidiaries or branches in the country. It is a policy which has gained more importance since the demise of BCCI in July 1991. Mr Jaans argues that the fraud-ridden bank was a legacy of the much more lax regulatory regime prevailing throughout Europe in the 1970s, and that such a bank would not be given a licence today. For example, he says the IML would not now accept a bank which had a Luxembourg holding company as a leading shareholder. Although Mr Jaans and his colleagues do not acknowledge it, observers believe a discreet 'spring-cleaning' operation is under way as various institutions with connections to BCCI or not seeming to meet the new standards of transparency on which the IML insists are politely invited to take their business elsewhere. Other banks (such as the loss-making subsidiary of Britain's TSB), have quit Luxembourg for a variety of reason's, while the ranks of Scandinavian and German regional banks have been thinned by mergers. Even so, at the end of August, Luxembourg boasted 192 banks, not far short of the 200-mark viewed by Mr Jaans as a rough natural limit. Recent newcomers have included several institutions from Germany and Italy, and a new contingent from South Korea. The new arrivals have found a more hospitable economic climate. While growth in the aggregate balance sheet total of Luxembourg banks slowed to a crawl in 1991, net profits increased by nearly 25 per cent, to LFr23.8bn, practically their record level of 1989, even after extensive creation of reserves and provisions. Just as importantly, the IML's annual report for 1991 records a slow but steady move away from reliance on interest income, where margins are being squeezed by competition, as a source of revenue. The share of interest income has declined as a proportion of total gross results from 80 to 73.5 per cent since 1987, thanks in large part to growth in commission income and profits from securities dealing. Nor does the investment fund sector seem to have suffered unduly from the competition. During the first eight months of 1992, the number of funds established in Luxembourg grew from 898 to 983, and their aggregate net assets soared by 30 per cent to 5,200bn francs. Meanwhile, banks have been tightening their belts. Employment in the financial sector, which grew by more than 6,000 between 1984 and 1990, has if anything declined since then. Redundancies in the course of mergers or restructuring efforts have become a regular occurrence this year, and most banks not actively shedding jobs are no longer hiring new staff. This means a difficult environment for trade unions as they seek to wrest concessions from Luxembourg Bankers' Association (ABBL) negotiators in a long wrangle over a new employment structure for the sector. The banks want changes in a complex and inflexible salary structure which will allow them to tailor pay more to responsibility and performance, and less to educational qualifications and seniority. The unions, which feared this would be used simply to lower pay levels, called a one-day strike last year which attracted some 11 per cent of the total workforce. Afterwards the two sides agreed to work out a compromise based on standards prevailing in rival financial centres, but this has proved elusive. Last February's deadline for agreement is long gone and banks and unions remain far apart. While there is no immediate threat of unwelcome new EC rules which might discourage private banking, the government is slowly moving toward new rules in areas such as tax fraud. This, and stiff measures against money laundering, may erode the edges of banking secrecy, but many Luxembourg bankers say that would be no great disaster for the sector. It is appropriate that the ABBL's president, Mr Charles Ruppert of the Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise, began his career as a teacher. Education is now the watchword within the industry, with the association leading an effort designed to ensure it is expertise and quality of service which makes Luxembourg stand out from its rivals. The Luxembourg Institute for Training in Banking was established by the ABBL in 1990 to co-ordinate and expand its training activities in areas ranging from apprenticeship-style courses to language classes (and work experience programmes for bankers from eastern Europe). The Luxembourg Banking Academy was created earlier this year, with help from institutions in Britain, France and Germany, to offer courses enabling specialists to become all-round bankers. If the initiative is successful, the programme may be transformed into a fully-fledged MBA.</p>

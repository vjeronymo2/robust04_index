			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Observer: Fall out Whatever may befall John Birt's director-generalship of the BBC, wax effigies of him transfixed with pins may soon be found in the hands of Britain's self-employed. Thanks to the furore over his arm's-length contractual arrangements with the BBC while on his way through the deputy dg's job to the pole position, it seems the chancellor of the exchequer might foreshadow a change of the rules for the self-employed in tomorrow's Budget. Gurus at the Institute of Taxation, the UK's professional body concerned with said topic, believe Norman Lamont may begin introducing self-assessment for the self-employed - on the lines of the pay and file system used for corporation tax. But mercifully, since it's proving difficult to devise a workable way of saddling them with a brand new system of current-year taxation instead of allowing them to earn now and pay later, the project is expected to take a while to perfect. Perhaps another three years, the gurus say.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE (JWI): "Stability: The Stability Pact </F> Must Be an `Encouragement'"]    [Text] Paris, 26 May (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister  Willy Claes emphasized Thursday [26 May] that the stability pact  in Europe was meant to "encourage" the countries of Central and  Eastern Europe to prepare to join the European Union (EU).    "The process leading to the stability pact must encourage  those countries which have been offered the chance to prepare to  join the EU by concluding reciprocal good-neighborliness  agreements," Claes stated in a speech given to the plenary  conference on stability in Europe, which is being held in Paris  over a two-day period.    In so doing, the Belgian foreign minister was implicitly  sweeping aside the reluctance on the part of some Central and  Eastern European countries that could view such a pact as  nothing more than an extra condition imposed on their entry to  the Union.    "The stability pact is intended to serve as an instrument of  dialogue (...) between the countries concerned and the EU.  Future accession in fact necessarily presupposes close,  constant contact between all those involved," Willy Claes  underlined.    Furthermore, the Belgian foreign minister reiterated that  the  deepening of European construction should not be called into  question by the EU enlargement. "If Europe has become a pole of  stability, it is primarily because its members have concluded  mutual political agreements," he said.    Consequently, the EU is calling upon the future candidates  for accession (the three Baltic states, the four [as received]  Visegrad countries: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and  Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria -- BELGA editor's note) to settle  their potential differences peacefully. It is also prepared "to  play an active role in helping them to bring their friendship  and good-neighborliness agreements to a successful conclusion,"  Willy Claes continued.    Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur traced out  the broad outlines of his plan, which "is clearly shaped by a  vision of Europe that aims to reconcile the wish to join the EU,  as harbored by many countries, with the need to maintain the  unity of our continent and consequently develop very close  relations with Russia," he said during his speech which opened  the conference. Mr. Balladur also took pains to calm the fears  of certain countries regarding borders. The negotiations that  are supposed to lead to good-neighborliness agreements will be  based on legal principles that are "clear and recognized by  everyone," namely territorial integrity and the inviolability of  borders," he affirmed.    "Let us be very clear about this: We want to see stable  European borders. So let us make sure that there are no  ulterior motives regarding them," he added.</p>

"While  we are talking about peace, the . . . guerrillas in Tigre . . . launched an  unprovoked all-out offensive against government forces," said Mengistu, who  interrupted a parliamentary session to make the announcement. The rebels have  been fighting since 1975 to topple the Marxist government. But a rebel  spokesman in Washington said that the Ethiopians launched the offensive and  were "suffering heavy losses."  </P></p>

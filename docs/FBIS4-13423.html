			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Two morning dailies  criticized U.N.'s ineffectiveness in supporting defenceless  people in Gorazde and termed the body a U.S. "lackey" whose  decisions were in conformity with initiatives of  quasi-superpowers and only served to appease the Serbs.    "TEHRAN TIMES" in its editorial referred to the statements  by  some U.N. member countries expressing regret over the  "miserable" U.N. failure in protecting lives of innocent  civilians in the "safe areas" of Gorazde.    The U.N.'s inability to carry out its peacekeeping duties  also prompted one of its officials to say: "The United Nations  died on the hills of Gorazde."    "The fact that the United Nations is greatly influenced by  the U.S. is no secret. Evicting Saddam's army from Kuwait,  which was done mostly through the deployment of American forces,  removed any doubt in this regard. It proved that what Uncle Sam  wants from the U.N., Uncle Sam gets from the U.N."    Stressing that the U.N. is only a mercenary of the U.S. and  its allies, the paper said that the only possible conclusion is  that the Serbs carried out the West's real objective of  decimating the only Muslim state in Europe and are being  protected and rewarded by their American and European masters.    Commenting on the same subject, "KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL" wrote  in its editorial that the world's free people expected the U.N.  to stop "being a pawn in the game of rivalry between the powers  and quasi- superpowers."    The body's passive policy in clear contradiction to the  active policy adopted vis-a-vis Iraq and Somalia, had rendered  the U.N. weak and unable to assert its will where the world  deemed necessary, the article said.    Referring to the fact that the U.N. has been created to help  alleviate the pain and suffering of the toiling humanity, the  paper noted that the body must strive to do its duty within its  Charter which calls for the defence of any people that might  face extermination such as the people of Gorazde.    The U.N. as a world body should represent all its members  and  should not come under the direct or indirect influence of a few,  only then would the world experience peace and happiness,  concluded the paper.</p>

This took place at  the extraordinary session the House held this afternoon under  Speaker Tahir al-Masri, atttended by Prime Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, to discuss the results of the  reprehensible massacre Zionist extremists carried out against  defenseless worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque.    At the start of the session, al-Masri said yesterday's  incident is a mournful and momentous event. Although what the  Zionists had perpetrated against the people in Hebron is not the  first of its kind that the Palestinians and Muslims have  experienced at the hands of the Zionist aggressors, the manner  in which it was carried out, in a safe and sacred place, adds to  the harm done to one's sentiments and makes it stand out as a  very strange incident.    Al-Masri added: If our relatives in the occupied territories  cannot be safe in their mosques and during their prayers, then  where can they be safe?</p>

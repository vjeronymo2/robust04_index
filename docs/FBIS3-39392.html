			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Erika Bjerstrom: "High Profile Required for </F> Influence"]    [Text] The Swedish environment will deteriorate, and in  return, we will gain greater influence over European Union (EU)  policy. But it will require a high environmental profile on  Sweden's part. That is the assessment of the environmental  consequences of membership.    This is not an unequivocal endorsement of membership. The  issue of the EU and environmental policy is much too complicated  for that, Anders Wijkman, chairman of the Environmental  Consequence Committee, said when he presented the committee's  report.    The committee's analysis was based on a 10-year perspective  of the consequences of EU membership, the European Economic Area  (EEA) agreement, or staying out of the EU. The conclusions have  been summarized in the form of the answers to three questions:     -  How will Sweden's chances for an independent environmental  policy be affected?    Conclusion: Little difference, no matter which scenario  Sweden chooses.    Needed: No hesitation in utilizing all possibilities to  exert  influence.    "An overcautious interpretation of the EC rules could lead  to  a kind of self-censorship in which we set narrower restrictions  on our actions than are necessary. It would be better to stretch  the limits even if it involves the risk of a court test," the  committee members wrote.    "We have discussed in detail the value of remaining outside  as a model in the California style. Tough environmental rules  cannot be created internationally, individual countries must  take the lead. But it would require a very strong economy and a  powerful Riksdag majority behind environmental measures for this  to work. As these prerequisites are lacking, the difference  between joining and staying outside is very small," Wijkman said.     -  What are Sweden's possibilities of influencing the EU's  environmental policy?    Conclusion: Greatest with membership.    Needed: An offensive strategy and resources.    "We must distinguish between our chances of exerting formal  and informal influence. But with our scant 4 percent of the  votes in the Council of Ministers we have little chance of  contributing to a qualified majority. A passive Sweden will have  no influence on the EU's environmental policy at all. By  maintaining a high profile we can have great informal importance  as members," according to Wijkman.     -  How will environmental conditions in Sweden be affected?    Conclusion: Membership will involve the biggest problems.    Needed: More far-reaching measures.    EU membership will lead to increased growth. This can result  in an increase of as much as 10 percent in carbon dioxide and  nitric oxide emission, according to the committee's calculations.    "The EU is responsible for 60 percent of the nitric oxide  fallout over Sweden, and its carbon dioxide emission is 40 times  higher. If we can contribute to changes in the union's  environmental efforts, it could compensate for the increased  Swedish emissions," according to Per Kagesson. The committee  concluded that radical rethinking with respect to energy,  traffic, and the purpose of growth is required. This applies to  both Sweden and the EU.    "My conclusion is that consideration for the environment and  environmental policy is no barrier to joining the EU," Wijkman  summed up.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Import curbs may threaten EC harmony - Single Market Watch THE first six months of the new single European market could be marred by legal disputes over national import restrictions, which are still in place in many EC countries despite the lifting of internal barriers on January 1, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. EC foreign ministers have still not agreed whether to abolish or harmonise national quotas on textiles, toys, footwear and a variety of goods from 'state trading countries' - China, North Korea and Vietnam. The European Commission has also failed to devise a temporary solution to national quotas. In practice, importers say this could lead to a ban on the import of such goods, as 1992 import licences have expired. Some are preparing to take legal action against the Commission if trade is disrupted. Meanwhile, Britain, France and Italy have asked to maintain controls on imports of bananas from Latin America. Under a special clause of the EC treaty, member states can request Brussels to allow them to keep or reimpose controls to prevent 'economic difficulties' caused, for example, by cheap imports across internal borders. Commission officials said yesterday they were unsure how such restrictions would be applied in the absence of internal controls on goods. Bananas are still subject to different import regimes across the EC, as a deal to harmonise the system will not become effective until the middle of this year. Until then the three countries, which have treaty commitments to Caribbean and African producers, fear a flood of cheaper Latin American bananas imported illegally from Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries. No member state has yet asked to maintain quotas on imports from state trading countries. But some importers are already preparing to switch imports to the most liberal EC countries. For example, Reebok and Nike, the sports shoe manufacturers, may try to import their Chinese-made training shoes through Ireland or Greece, the only EC countries without quotas for Chinese footwear, if they find that other member states are applying their restrictions. The companies are also ready to claim damages from the Commission if products are blocked at external frontiers. The question of what to do about outstanding national quotas is linked to controversial Commission proposals to streamline the procedure for imposing anti-dumping duties on non-EC imports. This will be one of the first issues which Sir Leon Brittan will consider when he takes over as EC trade commissioner tomorrow.</p>

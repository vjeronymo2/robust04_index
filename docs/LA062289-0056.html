			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LOST IN MEMORIES  </P> <P> The dinner reservation for Tuesday evening at a Santa Monica restaurant was in  the name of the "Robinson" family. Getting together were the actors who  portrayed the Robinsons in the 1960s CBS series, "Lost in Space," plus the  real-life family of Guy Williams, the actor who starred as Professor John  Robinson. They wanted to share their happy memories of Williams, who was found  dead of an apparent heart attack May 7 in Buenos Aires. "Guy's professional  family took his real family out to toast poppa," said June Lockhart, who  co-starred as Williams' wife. Billy Mumy, Angela Cartwright and Marta Kristen  of the TV family were there, along with Williams' wife, Jan, and their  children. "We had a lot of laughs and remembered all the funny things Guy had  done," Lockhart said after dinner. "Since Guy's death, I have had a lot of  touching fan mail and expressions of grief. I don't think Guy really knew how  loved he was, and I was able to pass all of that on to his family." In addition  to "Lost in Space," Williams was also TV's swashbuckling masked hero "Zorro" in  the late '50s. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

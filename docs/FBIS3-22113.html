			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 28 (CTK) -- The Environment Ministry is  willing, on condition that terms stipulated by Minister  Frantisek Benda are met, to consider completing the Temelin  nuclear plant and bringing into operation, the Ministry's  Spokesman Frantisek Stanek told CTK today.    Stanek was commenting in reaction to the decision by the  American EX-IM Bank to provide guarantees for the completion of  Temelin.    Construction of the plant, located in southern Bohemia,  started in 1986, and from the very beginning it has been  strongly criticized by environmental organizations, especially  in neighboring Austria. American banks and manufacturers are  involved in the project.    The Ministry's positive attitude is conditioned by the  passing of a nuclear law, an energy law, and laws on the plant's  decommissioning, insurance against possible nuclear damage and  state supervision of nuclear material, Stanek announced.    The EX-IM Bank does not observe the rules it requires in  other cases, Jindrich Petrlik, a representative of the  environmental groups Duha (Rainbow) and Deti Zeme (Children of  the Earth), stated. The projects for which the loans were  granted should be in line with Americans standards, he said,  adding that Temelin plant does not comply with them.    The activities against granting the guarantees for the loan  to complete Temelin plant will be continued also in the United  States and Greenpeace hopes that the congress will not recommend  providing guarantee for the loan, Vera Frankova, the Greenpeace  spokeswoman, told CTK.    The board of the EX-IM Bank approved guarantees for loans on  American export worth $317 million for the completion and  modernization of the safety equipment for Temelin plant,  originally Soviet-designed.    The EX-IM Bank must hand the whole project to congress which  has 35 days to assess any transaction of the bank regarding  nuclear energy before.</p>

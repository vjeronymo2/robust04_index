			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Walker 'freebooter in business world' Mr George Walker, the former Brent Walker chairman, was a 'freebooter' in the business world, Lord Richard, the leader of the Labour party in the House of Lords, told the Brent Walker trial yesterday. Appearing as a character witness for Mr Walker, the peer told the Old Bailey that the entrepreneur had a reputation as a tough negotiator. 'He knew what he wanted and usually got what he wanted.' Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, are accused of fraudulently inflating the company's profits. Both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify accounts. The trial continues today.</p>

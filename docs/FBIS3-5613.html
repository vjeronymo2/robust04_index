(IDO) has reached a broad agreement with Motorola Inc. of the  United States over Motorola's demand for more access to the  Japanese mobile telephone market, industrial sources said  Wednesday.    Motorola Vice President Arnold Brenner arrived in Tokyo on  Wednesday to finalize negotiations.    IDO said it hopes to straighten out differences over the  issue by the end of this week.    The accord would help avoid U.S. trade retaliation against  Japan. The U.S. Trade Representative Office has set March 17 as  the deadline for an announcement on sanctions over trade issues.    IDO and Motorola were near agreement over the timing of an  expansion of a network of Motorola-formula car phone relay  stations and an allocation of radio frequencies, IDO officials  said.    They said Motorola has agreed to IDO's offer to increase the  number of relay stations, which will total 190 at the end of  June, by an additional 159 stations.    But the officials said Motorola demanded that the network  expansion be completed within the next one and a half years,  while IDO contends that the project will take more than two  years.    IDO was also resisting Motorola's demand that part of the  frequencies allotted for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)  formula transmission be transferred to its service in Japan on  the ground of high costs, the officials said.    They said the frequency switch to the Motorola formula is  almost impossible because it requires remodeling all NTT-formula  relay stations, which would require an investment of tens of  billions of yen.    Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's top automaker and a major  investor in IDO, is set to help finance the project by  increasing IDO's capital through a new share issue, they said.</p>

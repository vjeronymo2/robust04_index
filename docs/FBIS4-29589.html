			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 19 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd., Japan's  largest comprehensive electric machinery manufacturer, will  shift production of television chassis at its plant in Malaysia  to Mexico, a leading business daily said Sunday.    According to the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, the company's  production shift will be made to cope with the North American  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect in January.    The company will begin manufacturing tv chassis this summer  at a plant in Tiajuana on the U.S.-Mexico border. Hitachi will  aim to produce chassis for 500,000 TV sets annually during a  five-year period, the paper said.    Hitachi's move is expected to facilitate other Japanese  electric makers' plans to shift their productions to Mexico to  avoid disadvantageous tariffs on goods manufactured outside  North America, it added.</p>

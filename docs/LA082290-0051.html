			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIRLFRIEND ARRESTED WITH SUSPECT IN SCHOOL SLAYING  </P> <P> A man suspected of gunning down three people at a West Covina vocational school  has been arrested in Mexico, and his girlfriend -- originally thought to be his  kidnap victim -- was booked Tuesday as an accessory to murder, police said.  </P> <P> Martin Meza, 24, a reputed gang member from Duarte, and Lisa Villela, 19, a  former nursing student, were found Sunday evening in the Mexican border city of  Mexicali and placed under arrest by the Mexican state police.  </P> <P> Police originally surmised that Villela had been kidnaped by Meza when  relatives were unable to reach her after the shootings. The two apparently fled  to Mexico with their infant son after the shootings last Thursday left one  woman dead and two men wounded, police said.  </P> <P> "The more and more (investigators) got into it, the less and less it looked  like she was a victim," Lt. Jim Dillon of the West Covina Police Department  said.  </P> <P> After his arrest, Meza claimed to be a Mexican national and was being held in a  Mexicali jail pending efforts to extradite him. Villela, a U.S. citizen, was  immediately turned over to West Covina detectives who had traveled to the  border city. She was returned to West Covina Tuesday night, where she was  booked and held without bail.  </P> <P> Their 18-month-old son, whom they had taken with them to Mexico, was released  to relatives.  </P> <P> Meza allegedly pulled a gun and opened fire on the campus of the North-West  College of Medical &amp; Dental Assistants last Thursday. A teacher was killed  and a counselor and a student were wounded.  </P> <P> Meza then allegedly jumped into the passenger seat of a waiting car and sped  away. Villela's relatives at the time expressed fears for her safety because  she had not been seen in the two days before the shootings.  </P> <P> But police now say she was probably the getaway driver and went along with Meza  willingly.  </P> <P> Dillon said the pair had been seen together often after the shootings, and had  registered under Villela's name at a Mexicali motel. He said several friends of  the couple, interviewed by investigators, indicated it was unlikely that Meza  had kidnaped her.  </P> <P> West Covina police alerted the Border Patrol and officers in several Mexican  cities after the couple fled. Mexican state police, conducting a motel-to-motel  search, found that the couple had registered on Sunday, but the room was empty.  Later, officers found the pair walking down a street with their baby, said  Ricardo Rojas, head of the police unit that made the arrest.  </P> <P> Rojas also said Villela appeared to be accompanying Meza of her own free will.  "They seemed at ease together, like newlyweds," Rojas said in a telephone  interview from Mexicali.  </P> <P> Rojas said Meza told investigators he suspected that his girlfriend was having  an affair with someone at the school. Dillon said that such a motive, among  others, was under investigation.  </P> <P> Dillon added that Villela is about five months pregnant.  </P></p>

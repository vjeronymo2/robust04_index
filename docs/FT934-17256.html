			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese firm merges with Arthur Andersen ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the worldwide accountancy firm, yesterday announced that it had merged with Asahi &amp; Co to create the largest professional services organisation in Japan. Asahi has been granted 'corporate membership' of the Arthur Andersen Worldwide Organisation, which will make it part of the firm's global cost-sharing structure. The firm said there had been no payment as part of the merger. The merger follows an affiliation agreement signed in December last year with Asahi to allow the firm to share fees and receive referrals from Andersen's own Japanese audit firm, Inoue Saito Eiwa. Asahi &amp; Co is formed from the merger of Asahi Shinwa and and Inoue Saito Eiwa, which together had fee income last year of Dollars 197m, about 2,000 staff and just over 300 partners. Andersen Consulting will continue as a 'sister' organisation alongside the new firm in Japan with some sharing of resources. It has Dollars 100m in revenues in the country. The merger is unusual because Asahi becomes a corporate partner of Andersen worldwide. The Asahi partners do not individually become partners in Andersen, although some may be appointed in the future. Mr Richard Measelle, Andersen's managing partner, said Asahi &amp; Co would retain its existing name 'indefinitely' rather than being called Andersen. He said a growing number of the firm's practices used other names for marketing or regulatory reasons. Mr Measelle called the merger 'a truly significant milestone for our firm'. It is the most important such development since Andersen merged with SGV, a large independent Asian practice based in the Philippines, in 1985. Asahi had previously been affiliated with Ernst &amp; Young, but all links with this firm have now been severed.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY PANEL OKS SUBWAY PROPOSAL  </P> <P> The Assembly Transportation Committee on Monday approved by an 11-1 margin  legislation to require that an extension of Metro Rail through residential  areas of North Hollywood and Van Nuys be built underground.  </P> <P> In 1989, a similar proposal was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, who said it  inserted the state into a matter that should be in the jurisdiction of local  authorities.  </P> <P> But Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) -- the author of both transit proposals --  expressed optimism that his latest measure will become law because it has drawn  support from a variety of local groups -- from the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission to business and community associations.  </P> <P> Citizen groups have protested proposals to place the line above ground because  it would slice up neighborhoods and increase noise in the area.  </P> <P> Under Robbins' proposal, 3.6 miles of the Metro Rail extension in the Valley  would be underground along a Southern Pacific railroad right of way, partly  following Chandler Boulevard, between the Hollywood Freeway and Hazeltine  Avenue.  </P> <P> The measure also exempts the acquisition of the Chandler Boulevard railroad  right of way from provisions of state law requiring preparation of an  environmental impact report. Because of that, the measure now must be heard by  the Assembly Natural Resources Committee, which reviews legislation affecting  the environment.  </P> <P> Robbins maintained that when the commission actually builds the Metro Rail  line, it still would be required to study environmental impacts of the line.  </P> <P> Supporters of the bill argued that it is necessary to spell out the routing in  state law to ensure that the Los Angeles Transportation Commission follows the  route.  </P> <P> Kurt Hunter, president of the North Hollywood Residents Assn., cited "a climate  of distrust" between his community and the commission over plans to build the  line.  </P> <P> But Assemblyman William Lancaster (R-Covina), the only committee member to  oppose the measure, complained that Robbins was singling out the San Fernando  Valley for special treatment.  </P> <P> Lancaster, who represents a portion of the San Gabriel Valley, which is  competing with the San Fernando Valley for transit funds, objected to detailing  the Valley subway route in state law because "if there's a need for change,  they'll have to come back to the Legislature" for a new law. As a result,  Lancaster said, he would urge the governor to veto the measure.  </P> <P> Lancaster, his voice rising, also expressed concern that transit funding in Los  Angeles County was already "too oriented to one section of the county."  </P> <P> But Robbins dismissed any suggestion that the measure would give a special  break to the San Fernando Valley. "We have been paying taxes consistently and  there has yet to be a penny" spent in construction of Metro Rail in the San  Fernando Valley, Robbins said.  </P></p>

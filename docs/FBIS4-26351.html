			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Liu Lida, deputy director of the provincial tax bureau, </F> answers questions raised by a reporter on strengthening  management over receipts and guaranteeing the smooth  implementation of the new tax system--date and place not given]    [Text] [Reporter] After the practice of the new tax system,  particularly since the recent period, the criminal activities of  lawless people on forging, reselling, and stealing receipts and  using receipts to engage in tax evasion, cheating, smuggling,  trafficking in smuggled goods, and profiteering have run rampant  in some areas across the country, particularly in some coastal  areas. What is the situation in our province?    [Liu Lida] Our province also has this situation. Judging  from the situation of our province's inspection of the  value-added tax special receipts, some problems have existed.  The comparatively prominent ones are first, the forging and  reselling of receipts. Shenyang and Fuxin have successively  investigated and handled this kind of case. Second, the items  to be filled in while writing the receipts are not complete;  third, some people fail to correctly count the items to be  filled in while writing the receipts; fourth, some people write  false items in a real receipt which are manifested in  arbitrarily writing the names of units or understating the value  of items in the receipts and expanding the scope of items to be  filled in the receipts.    [Reporter] Recently, the State General Administration of  Taxation, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly held  a "nationwide telephone conference on launching a special  struggle against the law-breaking criminal activities of  forging, reselling, and stealing receipts," and decided to  launch a special struggle against the law-breaking criminal  activities of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts in the  whole country. I think this is very necessary.    [Liu Lida] It is very necessary to launch activities on  dealing blows to the law-breaking criminal activities of  forging, reselling, and stealing receipts.    After the implementation of the new tax system, particularly  since the use of value-added tax special receipts, receipts no  long simply serve as a firsthand proof of the ordinary receipts  in the past, as a proof of keeping accounts, and as a basis for  tax checkup. More importantly, they serve as a proof for tax  payments. The value-added tax special receipts serve as a  "chain" holding all commodity circulation links together. When  a receipt is written, it implies that this receipt can be served  as an income tax payment. If problems occur in any link, this  "chain" will break off and taxation will be unable to calculate  accurately. In a written instruction on dealing blows to  law-breaking criminal activities on forging and reselling  receipts, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out: "Forging the  value-added tax special receipts is extremely harmful (even more  harmful than making counterfeit banknotes). If we do not put  several persons to death (or sentence them to life  imprisonment), perhaps, we will be unable to check this trend."    [Reporter] Evidently, the value-added tax special receipts  have played a role in tax reduction. This is not only the new  distinguishing feature and crux of the value-added tax but also  the direct reason for criminal elements to make a reckless move  to forge, resell, steal, and write false value-added tax special  receipts.    [Liu Lida] Your analysis is correct. Just think. If we fail  to manage the special receipts well, great losses of state  taxation will surely be created and reform of the tax system  will also be a failure. So, we should discard the past concept  of managing ordinary receipts, further enhance understanding,  regard the management of special receipts as an important means  for guaranteeing the smooth implementation of reform of the tax  system, and strengthen the sense of responsibility and urgency.    [Reporter] At present, the law-breaking criminal activities  of using receipts to engage in tax evasion and cheating have  become a common nuisance in society. As far as our province is  concerned, what measures should we take to check them resolutely?    [Liu Lida] In line with this special struggle, our tax  departments should continue to conduct checkups of the special  receipts, unceasingly improve this system, go through the  procedures carefully, and explore ways to check up receipts  under the new situation. However, this problem involves many  sectors, and most of these law-breaking criminal activities are  usually carried out covertly. It will be hard to discover and  solve them by relying only on the checkups of the tax  departments. Therefore, the tax departments must maintain close  coordination with the public security, judicial, and  procuratorial departments under the guidance and support of the  party and government leaders, take joint actions, and establish  organs for organizing this special struggle. If the  law-breaking criminal acts of forging, reselling, and stealing  receipts discovered during the checkup of receipts constitute a  crime, the people involved should be transferred to the  judicial organs for punishment in an effort to publicize the  legal system and to frighten the criminals. Meanwhile, we  should pay special attention to receipt propaganda work, enhance  the sense of legally using receipts in the whole society, let  the broad masses of people understand the importance of managing  receipts and the harmfulness of forging and reselling receipts.  In addition, we should also pay attention to mobilizing the  enthusiasm of the broad masses of value-added tax payers, and  make them voluntarily report the situation of the counterfoils  of the value-added tax special receipts on time so that tax  departments can accurately keep abreast of the situation in a  timely manner.    At present, the special struggle against the law-breaking  criminal offenses of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts  have been gradually carried out in all localities across the  province. I believe that with the support of leaders at all  levels and the coordination of the public security, judicial,  and procuratorial departments, this work will surely attain its  expected aim, the management of receipts will be unceasingly  strengthened in our province, and a good environment for  guaranteeing the smooth implementation of the new tax system  will be created.</p>

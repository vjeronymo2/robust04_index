			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Better news at last from the Wharf - Matrix's EZT scheme claims it can offer a fast return UNSECURED creditors of Canary Wharf, the London Docklands office scheme which went into administration last year, voted this week in favour of a re-structuring package and the project might soon be able to resume trading. The news has cheered Matrix Securities, which recently launched an enterprise zone trust (EZT) near Canary Wharf on the Isle of Dogs. Matrix South Quay has a novel structure which aims to give investors a fast return on their money through the use of a loan facility, and it has an arranged exit facility after 10 years. Investors in EZTs are entitled to tax relief at their top marginal rate of tax but, unlike the business enterprise scheme, there is no limit on investments in enterprise zone property. Tax relief is available on loans taken out to fund the property if the interest is paid using rental income. Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, is providing loans to investors equating to 67.5 per cent of the amount invested. This means that, for a total investment of Pounds 100,000, the amount of cash the investor would have to produce would only be Pounds 32,500. The investor then receives tax relief on the building costs of Pounds 95m for the total investment; according to Matrix, this would be 98 per cent. So, when the higher-rate taxpayer receives his rebate on a total investment of Pounds 100,000, this should amount to tax relief at 40 per cent on Pounds 98,000 - or Pounds 39,200. For an outlay of Pounds 32,500, the investor is making a profit of Pounds 6,700, which amounts to a return of 20 per cent. But James Higgins of Chamberlain de Broe, a fee-based adviser, warns investors that they will get the tax relief only if 'they do have the higher rate income to shelter and if they are up to date with their affairs.' He adds: 'The longer it takes to get the relief, the less the immediate profit.' The Hill Samuel loan lasts for 10 years, when the trust implements exit arrangements. So, in theory, the investor has a loan outstanding for a long time. But Hill Samuel guarantees sufficient rent to meet the interest payments and to give the investor enough cash to repay the loan. Hill Samuel is a creditor to South Quay Ltd, which is in administrative receivership and owns the property, but Matrix denies that it chose the bank for this reason. 'We were in discussion with a number of banks to provide this structured finance and Hill Samuel were offered the mandate,' says Matrix's Peter Bridgman. 'It was not until some time into our negotiations that we learned that Hill Samuel was one of the lender banks.' What if Hill Samuel was to go under and be unable to meet its obligations? There is provision so that, if this were to happen, the receiver would be obliged to treat the loan and interest as having been written off. 'It is not a non-recourse loan, so I do not imagine the that the last Budget's rules will catch it,' says Higgins. 'Hill Samuel already owns a big chunk of the property, so the loan of 67.5 per cent is really a discount. The scheme is complicated, so investors should seek professional advice before commiting themselves. But Higgins endorses it on the basis of the guarantees given by Hill Samuel. The minimum investment in the Matrix EZT is Pounds 25,000.</p>

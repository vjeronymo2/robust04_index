			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will attend a  worldwide meeting on trade, environmental protection, and global  sustained development scheduled for June 10-11 in Geneva, an  industrial official said Saturday [21 May].    Lin Chih-sheng, a division chief in charge of industrial  regulations at the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB), noted  that the two-day meeting will be hosted by the secretariat of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    The world trade regulating body, which will be superseded by  the World Trade Organization (WTO) next year, has as its top  priority the balanced development of world trade and  environmental protection, Lin said.    Major topics on the agenda include the relationship among  free trade, environmental protection, and global sustained  development, environmental protection costs versus trade  policies, and the future direction of international cooperation,  he elaborated.    In order to learn of the most recent developments in this  regard, he said, Taiwan must be represented at the meeting. The  bureau, however, has yet to decide on which delegates will  attend the meeting, he added.    A Taiwan delegation, led by Vice Economic Affairs Minister  Sheu Ke-sheng, is in Geneva this week for the fifth meeting of  the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership  application. Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in  September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the  end of this year.    Citing a faxed letter from IDB Deputy Director-General Ho  Mei-liang who is among the 33-member delegation in Geneva, Lin  said that the June 10-11 GATT meeting will be vital to future  trade and production trends.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / German industry sees return to 2.5% growth WEST German industrialists expect output to return to normal at the end of 1993, and grow at an average 2.5 per cent a year for the following three years, according to Ifo, the Munich economics research institute. The manufacturing workforce will fall 1.6 per cent this year, a further 0.5 per cent in 1993, and will then start to increase again, but only by 0.1 per cent a year. The forecasts, gleaned from a detailed survey of 400 large companies' medium-term outlook, suggest that while confidence is rising again, employment and investment plans have been affected by increasing labour costs in Germany and fears of fading competitiveness. The survey showed annual growth in new investment in Germany stagnating at the 5.1 per cent expected this year. A separate Ifo survey of 500 economists in 62 countries showed rising confidence abroad. The April poll showed that after further deterioration in the first quarter of this year, gross national product was forecast to increase by an average 2.4 per cent over the full 12 months. The highest rates, 4.9 per cent and 3.4 per cent, were expected in Asia and Latin America. Growth in western Europe will be limited to 1.6 per cent and to 2.1 per cent in north America. West German industry's order books are still feeling the effects of recession abroad and flat demand at home. The value of incoming orders in April was 2 per cent lower than in March, the economics ministry said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents] </F>   [Text] Groznyy, 20 Apr -- Any talks or consultations with  Russia should only be held by persons who have the authorization  of the people to do so, Yaragi Mamodayev, head of the Government  of National Trust of Chechnya, believes. In a telephone  conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent today, he said that  "it is necessary to hold a congress of the Chechen people in the  near future to work out the basic criteria for solving the  problem of Russian-Chechen inter-relations."    In the words of Yaragi Mamodayev, the government he leads  has  already begun preparing this forum. Consultations with the  chairman of Chechnya's Constitutional Court, well-known public  and religious figures, and representatives of various political  bodies have been held. I would like it to be understood in  Moscow, Yaragi Mamodayev said, that Dhozkhar Dudayev's  unjustified postponement of the beginning of the Russian-Chechen  talks does not reflect the position of the whole of Chechen  society. A people's congress needs to be held to work out this  position.    Yaragi Mamodayev again pointed out that open appeals by the  Russian side to forces opposing Dhozkhar Dudayev risked  aggravating the political split in Chechnya and could become an  obstacle in the negotiating process. Yaragi Mamodayev distances  himself from the opposition, explaining that he was appointed  head of government by the legal Chechen Parliament in April of  last year and therefore, represents the legitimate executive  power in the republic.    Yaragi Mamodayev believes that the Russian leadership should  have determined at the outset which authorities in Chechnya it  considered legal and only then should it have begun any talks or  consultations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Parliamentary Diary" article by Vladimir Isakov: "Does </F> Russia Need Deputies?"]    [Text] None The Wiser    It is snowing, sleeting edicts. Piling one on top of another  and mixing together, they form something like the impenetrable  porridge that fills Moscow's streets.    The edicts revoke or suspend laws and introduce new  juridical  norms instead; the edicts rip entire chunks out of the body of  existing legislation. What about the new Constitution? No  recollection of it. By error, apparently, Article 90 of the  Constitution stated: "Edicts and directives of the Russian  Federation president must not contradict the Russian Federation  Constitution and federal laws." What? The president  constrained by laws? We can't have that! But Edict No. 2270 of  22 December 1993 clears up the "misunderstanding": "It is to be  laid down that Russian Federation laws...do not apply when they  contradict the present edict." Now that's better!    But even then the recent edict "On Measures To Bring Russian  Federation Legislation Into Line With the Russian Federation  Constitution" stands out like a sore thumb. I do not want to go  on about the fact that "bringing legislation into line" is the  job of the legislative branch, and not of the president at all.  If there are people who have not yet realized that anything  goes as far as the president is concerned, they are presumably  about to be put right. But even in these conditions there are  things that cause embarrassment, to put it mildly.    Top of the list is Yeltsin's cancelation of his own 21  September 1993 Edict No. 1400 "On Stage-by-Stage Constitutional  Reform in the Russian Federation." Yes indeed, the very edict  that overthrew the Constitution, declared the dissolution of the  Congress of People's Deputies and Supreme Soviet, and suspended  the activities of the Constitutional Court. The edict, which  caused an acute political crisis in the country, led to the  firing on parliament and the enormous loss of life.    When he addressed the people, Yeltsin promised that the  edict  would be submitted for examination by the new parliament. He  was entrusting the assessment of his actions to the new  parliament, elected in the new conditions -- either to approve  or to condemn them. Now he has reneged on his promise. The  president has changed his mind.    There was an equally unceremonious edict on existing  legislation. Amid all the "bringing into line" the government  and the president are hastily getting rid of some of the legal  norms that get in their way. The law "On Personal Privatization  Accounts and Deposits," which fell foul of Chubays' voucher  privatization, has been repealed. The law "On State Protection  for the Supreme Representative Organs of Power" has been  repealed, evidently as a sensible precaution for the future.  Yeltsin also thought it was a convenient moment to dispense  with the duty of presenting an annual report on state policy in  the sphere of protection of citizens' health and the state of  the Russian population's health. No wonder in the three years  of his rule the health of the population has reached crisis  point (figures and facts on this subject were cited in  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA recently). So what you have to do is close  the subject to discussion!    A little further on yet another "minor masterpiece" of the  "constitutional renaissance" era is eliminated -- the edict "On  Legal Regulation During the Period of Stage-by-Stage  Constitutional Reform in the Russian Federation." But hang on,  wasn't this the very edict that served as the basis for the  executive's massive incursion into the sphere of legislation,  taxes, and the budget? Is it a case of "the Moor has done his  job, the Moor may go"?    At the end of the edict, which casts a shroud of silence  over the blood-spattered remnants of the legal system, we  encounter the familiar phrase: "This edict is to be submitted  to the Federal Assembly for it to examine..." What, more  promises? Is there any limit to the hypocrisy?  <H5>  Cult of Law or Cult of Force? </H5>   When assessing the results of the president's and  government's "fruitful activity" in the sphere of legislation,  it is hard to avoid the feeling that an experienced hand is  directing the breakup of the Russian state and legal system.    This breakup began three years ago, when the provision on  Russian laws taking precedence over union laws was enshrined in  the declaration on state sovereignty of the RSFSR, adopted by  the Congress. The results had a rapid impact. Union  enterprises soon began to be drawn into "Russian jurisdiction,"  and the Union government was put on "maintenance" -- a  single-channel system of taxes. The article on Russian laws  taking precedence was an excellent cover for a ruthless power  struggle which resulted in the destruction of the single Union  state.    Then came the decision to institute the post of president,  which gave rise to confrontation between the authorities and a  dangerous concentration of power in one pair of hands. Now we  can see that the system of "democratic checks and balances,"  which is in an embryonic state, could not prevent the slide  toward dictatorship.    The next stage in the breakup was the decision on extra  powers, which entitled the president to adopt edicts which had  the force of law. The two locomotives headed toward one another  were bound to crash. And they did. The result was  disintegration, instability, anomalies in legislation, and  Russia's declining authority both as a business partner and as a  state in which laws are respected.    The next step was the so-called "constitutional crisis,"  caused in fact by the president's reluctance to live and work in  accordance with the Constitution under which he was elected and  to which, incidentally, he swore loyalty in his presidential  oath. Cries of "patched-up Constitution!" and "It is impossible  to live by it!" disorientated a section of society,  unfortunately. As a result, the old Constitution was destroyed  while the new one...the new one is giving rise to more questions  than it is answering.    Taking advantage of the events of 21 September-4 October,  the  president and his entourage effected the total breakup of  representative authority from top to bottom. Tne Federal  Treaty, which had been passed off as a most important guarantee  of the country's unity and integrity in the new conditions, was  removed from the Constitution. On the pretext of concern for  local self-government its autonomy was effectively eliminated.    The facts indicate that Russia is being led toward the final  phase of the breakup of the legal system. The old Constitution  has been destroyed and the new one has been adopted with serious  violations having taken place. Immediately after the  Constitution was published it began to be discredited, and in  various areas moreover. In the first place, it is discredited  by the numerous examples of violation of the law during its  adoption. Second, by the arrogant attitude toward it on the  part of the president and the executive, which are as disdainful  of the new Constitution as they were of the old one. Third, the  Constititon is undermined by regions' legislative acts, which  contradict it at every step. You have, for example, the  constitutions of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan and the  constitution of the Ural Republic, which was adopted but  immediately rescinded. And you cannot really blame the  republics: Before giving Chechnya, Tatarstan, or Bashkiria  membership of the Russian Federation the consent of the members  of the Federation should certainly be sought. And what do you  have now: The old Constitution is no more, the new one has not  been agreed with them and approval was not obtained in the  referendum on their territory. A completely free hand!    In short, every effort has been made to ensure that in the  event of an acute political crisis none of the sides can rely on  the authority of the law, of the Constitution. To ensure that  the sole authority on the territory of Russia is the Kalashnikov  rifle and the special militia's stick.  <H5>  The Stick and Presidential Rule </H5>   A new contender appears to have joined the competition for  the best political spectacle of the year -- the Federal Assembly  session. The newly elected parliament has not yet started its  work, but there is no end of gloomy forecasts and predictions:  "They will split," "they will fight," "they will  disintegrate".... Actually, there are grounds for the gloomy  predictions: Indeed, Messrs. Sheynis, Bezrukov, and Mityukov  are in charge of preparatios for the first sittings, and the  other day they were joined by Mr. Filatov.    The mood of diappointment and pessimism is encouraged by  the fact that the Federal Assembly has been in an absurd and  humiliating position from the very outset. By an edict of the  president it was deprived of its official home -- the House of  Soviets on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. All service  components -- vehicle pool, accounting -- were cut back to the  bone. Now you have to go to the president's office for every  little thing.    The edict approved the Federal Assembly apparatus and  appointed its leader, Mr. Podoprigora. The leaders of the  apparatus are preparing for the opening of the first Federal  Assembly session, but in a very peculiar way. Experienced  staffers of the former Supreme Soviet are being swiftly  dismissed and replaced by "certified cadres." For instance, a  large part of the organizational department, which used to  handle the practical preparations for sittings and maintained  links with the regions, was eliminated. Dozens, hundreds of  specialists have received dismissal notices. And this a few  days before the session opens...    The draft Standing Orders of the State Duma and Federation  Council are already being prepared in the bowels of the  president's office. One constant desire can be discerned amid  the pages and pages of documents, like the moon peeping through  the clouds: To make the future parliament a talking shop rather  than a working body. For example, monitoring functions have  been removed completely from the standing orders: debate the  laws by all means, but monitor their execution -- no way!  Instead of a presidium a body called a "conference," implying  no obligation for anyone, is being instituted -- in it the  chairmen of factions (party structures) will each have several  dozen votes, while the chairmen of committees (the structural  components of parliament) will only have a voice but no vote.  The purpose of these novelties is clear and simple -- to turn  the future parliament into a political debating society.    The obvious intention is to create as many contradictions as  possible within parliament and cause clashes between Federation  Council deputies and State Duma deputies. The trigger for such  a conflict is not just simple, but very simple: All you need to  do is create a marked difference in salaries, living conditions,  and transport and office premises and facilities provision, and  emphasize your warm attitude toward one lot and cooler attitude  toward the other.... Now the ground is prepared for growing the  poisonous mushrooms of personal ambition and mutual discontent.  The current authorities have a wealth of experience in this  respect. Suffice it to say that the deputies representing the  opposition are still unable to obtain the basics -- to get the  telephones that were cut off during the election campaign  reconnected. Let them go around begging and swearing. It is as  easy as anything then to portray them as troublemakers concerned  only with their own "deputies' privileges."    There is yet another problem that is arousing a great deal  of  emotion. It is the former USSR and Russian Federation people's  deputies still living in official apartments. Some of them have  settled in Moscow, others have simply nowhere else to go to.  This brought on a fit of administrative rage: "You have 24  hours to move out!" But this is precisely a case where  administrative interference is harmful. If you throw onto the  street people whose only crime was to carry out their civic duty  and not seek handouts, we will not attract any deputies in the  future.    The question is: Do we actually need deputies in Russia?  Who wants to face the abuse and scorn of the press, feel  impotent in the face of an official's disdainful smile, be held  responsible for something you are unabler to change? Perhaps we  should immediately place power in the hands of those who know  how to make money out of it and no longer bother with  competitive elections?    That is way things are going, it appears. The fuss over the  work of the Federal Assembly before it has begun reveals a  hidden goal, which is to discredit the very idea of people's  representation in the people's eyes: No, they say, we are not  mature enough for a parliament.... The stick and presidential  rule -- that is what Russia needs.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Gas shake-up rules will be draconian, says watchdog Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, said yesterday that 'draconian' mechanisms will be put in place to ensure the complete separation of British Gas's transportation and storage unit from its trading arm. In her first major speech since the government last month rejected a Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendation that British Gas be broken up, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, told a conference that she intended to 'police the separation very stringently'. People in the independent gas market needed to have complete confidence that 'commercially sensitive information given to (British Gas's) transportation and storage division is safe', she said. Severe penalties would be imposed on British Gas if any breaches of the 'Chinese walls' occured. Ms Spottiswoode said the previously strained relationship between Ofgas and British Gas had improved markedly in recent months. At the conference Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, assured sceptical independent gas marketers that British Gas's trading arm would 'pay on the same basis as any other pipeline customer'. But Mr Kris Maroe, chief executive of Alliance Gas, a joint venture between British Petroleum and the Norwegian companies Statoil and Norsk Hydro, called for 'concrete' rather than Chinese walls. Ms Spottiswoode unveiled an ambitious timetable to meet the government's target for the partial lifting of British Gas's monopoly over the mainly residential sector of 18m consumers in 1996. Full abolition will coincide with the opening of the domestic electricity market in 1998. She confirmed that worries about the ability of British Gas's information technology and residential metering system to cope with a sudden shift of consumers to independent suppliers was the reason for phasing in competition. Ofgas will work closely with British Gas in tackling the issue, which is among many questions which will be raised in a consultation document to be published next month. The consultation period will end in May, when the DTI will start preparing the legislation to open up the residential market. The gas bill would need to be ready for introduction in November and become law next summer if the timetable is to be met. But the government has not given a commitment to introducing it this year.</p>

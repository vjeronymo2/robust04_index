			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fags increases stake in Chilean copper mine ANTOFAGASTA Holdings, which has interests in mining, banking, transportation and water supply in Chile, has increased its stake in the Lince copper mine and high technology treatment plant in Chile. Antofagasta paid Outokumpu Copper Resources Dollars 36m (Pounds 20.2m) cash for a further 39.985 per cent stake in Lince, which increases the group's holding in the open-pit mine and its solvent-extraction electro-winning (SX-EW) treatment plant to 99.985 per cent. SX-EW technology is an increasingly popular low-cost and highly efficient alternative to the traditional smelting process. The purchase of the Lince stake will give Antofagasta full control of the management of the mine and the plant, and enable it to use the treatment plant for processing other ores which it owns. The Lince mine is in the Antofagasta II region of Chile and has defined reserves of 16m tonnes of oxide copper with an average grade of 1.6 per cent. The development of the mine and construction of the treatment plant was com- pleted at the end of 1991 and the first trial copper cathodes were produced in January. During the 1992 second half production will reach a rate of 20,000 tonnes of copper cathodes per year. At the end of last year Lince had net assets of Dollars 63.2m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Ala' al-Mashahrawi] </F>   [Text] Gaza -- A prominent Gaza Strip Islamic official  said on 19 April that Hamas expresses its readiness to negotiate  with Yitzhaq Rabin's government if the Israelis prove the  sincerity of their intentions by: abandoning their policy of  killing innocent people; release all prisoners; lift the  economic siege; announce the evacuation of settlers from  settlements; and offer something worth negotiating about.    Ahmad Bahr, head of the Gaza Strip Islamic Society, added  that these negotiations should be carried out under an  independent Palestinian decision that ensures sovereignty and  security for the Palestinians alone. The negotiations should  also take place under international supervision so that it will  be proven to the entire world that it is Israel which is  persisting in obstructing any efforts aimed at achieving a  comprehensive and just peace.    Bahr added: These negotiations must proceed within the  framework of the strategy of Hamas and with the support of its  leadership and leaders abroad, and be preceded by a truce  between the Israelis and the Palestinians in order to ascertain  the sincerity of Israeli intentions.    Bahr called on Rabin to change his hard-line and suppressive  policy in the occupied territories -- a policy that is being  implemented by the Israeli Army against defenseless civilians  and which has led Hamas to retaliate in an exceptional way  against Israeli civilians, as Hamas is not eager to kill  civilians because this is forbidden by Islam.    Bahr believes that the resolution of this conflict lies in  the hands of the Israelis who daily are committing massacres,  destroying houses, and violating the human rights of  Palestinians to live in freedom and peace on their soil and  homeland.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The urgent need for a firm inner core For supporters of the European exchange rate mechanism - and there are still some, not swayed by fashion - the year 1992 has been a struggle to survive until German short-term interest rates fall to a more normal level. The fate of the ERM depends on how soon and how far German interest rates fall, and whether France can hold on until then. German interest rates may well be too high and the German measure of broad money, M3, may be giving misleading signals, as its US and British equivalents did in the early 1980s. German critics such as Norbert Walter, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, have been saying so for months, and with better right than most. The finance ministers of the weaker countries are, however, in no position to censor the German authorities for their counter-inflationary zeal. A monetary squeeze works in Germany, like in most other places, first by creating a recession or slowdown and then going through to prices and wages. If the National Institute for Economic and Social Research is right, German consumer price inflation will be below 2 per cent in 1993 - still less if the VAT increase due in January is discounted. If the inflation drop is combined with internal recession - industrial production is already 3 per cent below a year ago - German interest rates will fall sharply without the kind of outside prodding which only makes the Bundesbank dig in its heels. Lack of ERM credibility in the run-up to the French referendum and after has affected several countries. But they have fallen out of the ERM less messily than the UK. Italy is floating, but is still committed to rejoining at the earliest opportunity. Sweden and Finland, which are not Community members, but were shadowing the Ecu, are now floating. Norway is still, precariously, shadowing. Spain and Portugal have devalued - the former twice - but remain within the system. Denmark and, even more, Ireland, have been left exposed - Ireland because more than 40 per cent of its exports go to the UK and other non-hard core west European countries, and Denmark because more than 30 per cent of its exports do so. It is touch and go whether they succeed in keeping their place in the grid. At the other end of the scale, the inner bloc of Germany and Benelux remains solid. Will there remain an ERM for countries to adhere to or rejoin? What makes the ERM core more than a German bloc is the continued adherence of France. Nothing is for sure in this world. The biggest blow to franc credibility was the sinking of sterling and other currencies, which raised the effective exchange rate of the franc by nearly 4 per cent. The franc survived the Black Wednesday trauma with the aid of the Bundesbank, which was impressed by the fact that by all the Maastricht convergence criteria - low inflation and low budget deficits (as well as a low balance of payments deficit) - France has done better than Germany. By the time of the Swedish departure a week ago, France had repaid all its borrowings from the Bundesbank and had reversed all its emergency interest rate increases. Since then, the franc has inevitably come under further pressure, and will doubtless do so again until the European currency structure is clearer. If I were placing bets (which I am not) they would be in favour of the franc maintaining its parity with the D-Mark and even more in favour of its remaining within a monetary association with Germany. Meanwhile, I would recommend a magnificent diatribe against the search for alibis and scapegoats for recent currency events by Richard Portes, director of the Centre for Economy Policy Research*. In particular he rounds on the conspiracy theorists, who talk about markets being determined to bring a currency down. 'It is absurd and misleading to anthropomorphise a collection of competing firms taking very short-run decisions. The markets have no collective view; nor do they try to crack the ERM. They have better things to do, like making money.' The 'salivating predatory packs of speculators are sons and daughters of the gnomes of Zurich', the scapegoats of a previous generation. He is even more scathing about officials who said they were taken by surprise by the size of the speculative capital flows which overwhelmed their defences. 'If true, this is shocking - surely they know that foreign exchange trading is of the order of Dollars 1,000bn daily, of which probably less than 5 per cent is to finance trade in goods and services.' The NIESR outlines three possible paths for Euro-pean money: The most advanced is 'some kind of federal constitution within which Emu would take its place'. We can forget about the prospect for this generation, irrespective of the Maastricht treaty. The intermediate and most likely outcome is a multi-tier Europe. The least advanced is that national economies 'may retain their distinctive features, including national monetary policies, and hence national rates of inflation'. In that case 'the single market will never really live up to its name'. Karl Otto Pohl has suggested a variant of the second option: abandoning Maastricht and moving quickly to a full monetary union for Germany, France, Benelux and two non-EC countries, Austria and Switzerland. Something like this is quite likely to happen de facto. Portes is worried about the geopolitical problems of a northern European monetary club and its implications for those who stay outside. But in all probability the peripheral members would benefit from a more secure core to which they could relate their own currencies than the present so-called 'hard ERM'. In an outer tier will be countries like Spain or Italy, prepared reluctantly to change their ERM parities, but aspiring to eventual full monetary union. A further tier will consist of countries, maintaining indefinitely wide margins of say 6 per cent, and ready to realign. The outermost tier of all will consist of countries for which even that is too much. The most likely member of this far-out tier is too obvious to name. While the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin describes the British withdrawal as 'temporary', the chancellor spoke in Brussels about the conditions which will have to be fulfilled before Britain 'would consider rejoining'. Thus the UK is back to the Thatcher stance of doing the ERM a favour by joining one distant day, perhaps. The future of all the outer tiers depends on the centre holding. A rapid drive to full monetary union by France and the German group, so far from being divisive, would be a condition of the outer tiers remaining in some looser form of the ERM. It will also, in the words of the NIESR, be easier for the Bundesbank to 'begin the process of sharing responsibility for setting interest rates' if it did so within an inner circle of sound money countries than if it waited to be dragged in kicking and screaming to a forced union of most EC members. * 25 Old Burlington St, London W1X 1LB.

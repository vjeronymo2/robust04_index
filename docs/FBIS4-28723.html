			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with U Maung Maung Aye, information minister of </F> the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, by  unidentified BBC correspondent on 13 June; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] U Maung Maung Aye answered the following when asked  why the NLD [National League for Democracy] members had to  return to the legal fold.    [Aye] Concerning the return of the Kachin parliamentary  representatives, we received the letter of the Organizational  Committee of the National League for Democracy Liberated  Area-North dated 27 March 1994 which was addressed to the  Central Organizational Committee-Manerplaw, on 29 April 1994.  The letter says [they] won't be able to properly discharge  their duties and responsibilities given by the National  Coalition Government of the Union of Burma and the National  League for Democracy Liberated Area due to the cease-fire  agreement between the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] and  SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council]. The letter  also says there are financial difficulties and security risks in  carrying out their responsibilities outside KIO areas. It says  they decided to return home because it is impossible to survive  in the KIO area. Based on this letter, we perceive that the  Kachin parliamentary representatives returned because they  cannot survive in the KIO area.    [Correspondent] It has been learned that the Kachin  parliamentary representatives were discouraged and disappointed  because they were not given any responsibilities in the NLD's  exiled government. Would you like to clarify this matter?    [Aye] It is not true. Our National Coalition Government of  the Union of Burma was formed by parliamentary representatives.  This is why our genuine desire is to expand the National  Coalition Government of the Union of Burma especially by  including parliamentary representatives who are ethnic  nationals, and we have been striving for this for quite some  time. The Kachin parliamentary representatives also knew this.  This is why we would like to clarify that the report we have  just heard is not true.    [Correspondent] How is the situation presently in the NLD's  political movement?    [Aye] Yes, the return of the parliamentary representatives  will not affect the NLD's political movement because while there  are many who have returned to the legal fold, there are also  considerable numbers of parliamentary representatives, NLD  members, and people from other political parties who do not want  to live under the SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration  Council], and have come to the liberated area during the  revolutionary period. It is a natural phenomenon. Concerning  this matter, there is no effect on our work being carried out on  this side. It is because the communications between the NLD  groups in the north and the Manerplaw central headquarters are  very difficult. We would like to say that the return of the NLD  members in the north will not affect the National League for  Democracy's present and future activities because the NLD's  political activities are operated from Manerplaw.    [Correspondent] How is the situation in the NLD's political  movement in Thailand?    [Aye] Yes, it is true that we face more difficulties than  before, but not to the extend that we cannot do our work at all.  We can continue to survive and move around. We would like to  say that we are continuing to do our regular work.</p>

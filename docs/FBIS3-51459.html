			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Isabel Allende today  described the bilateral relations between Cuba and Spain as good  and constructive. Vice Foreign Minister Allende who is on a  working visit to Spain said that, as in every relation, the  parties involved have differing views on some topics, but the  important thing is the attitude assumed to overcome the  differences and difficulties. During her stay in Madrid, Isabel  Allende met with high-ranking Spanish Foreign Ministry officials  with whom she discussed bilateral matters such as the progress  being made by the joint scientific and cultural and technical  and industrial commissions. Allende also talked about Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's upcoming trip to Spain.  Robaina was been invited to visit the country by his Spanish  counterpart, Javier Solana.    Many Madrid newspapers today reported on Vice Foreign  Minister Allende's visit to Spain. The fact that the newspapers  covered Allende's visit has been interpreted as a sign of  interest in the island which has opened up to foreign  investment, mainly Spain's. In response to questions asked by  reporters about the blockade, Allende said that this U.S.  measure against Cuba is illegal, that it violates international  laws, and denies the precepts of a market economy, which is  based on freedom of trade, enterprise, and navigation. Allende  also admitted that since President Bill Clinton assumed office,  a less aggressive language toward Cuba has been evidenced;  however, this does not mean that their policy toward the island  will change. Allende, who is currently visiting the Cuban  consulates in Barcelona, Vigo, and Sevilla, will return to the  island next week.</p>

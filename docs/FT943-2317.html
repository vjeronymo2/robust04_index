			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / People: Bodies politic Charlie Woods, a senior official with Scottish Enterprise, the development body for Scotland, is to be chief executive of Scotland Europa, which supports Scottish organisations in Brussels. He succeeds Grant Baird, the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief economist who opened Scotland Europa in 1992. Yesterday Baird became chief executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the body which promotes the Scottish financial services industry. Scotland Europa, an offshoot of Scottish Enterprise, assists Scottish organisations and companies in their dealings with the European Commission. It can advise and represent them, give them early warning of developments that may affect them, and also provide them with office space in Brussels. It has had more success signing up public sector organisations than companies. Woods held senior posts with the Scottish Development Agency before it became Scottish Enterprise and put together Scottish Enterprise's network of local enterprise companies. His most recent job at Scottish Enterprise's headquarters was director of Scottish and international operations. He is currently in California, investigating US electronics companies, a big source of investment in Scotland.</p>

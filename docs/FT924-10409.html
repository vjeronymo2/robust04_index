			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: US fall-out - Radio WHILE WE await the last week of the American election, John Humphrys, the BBC's Washington correspondent two decades ago, presents in The Fading Dream (Radio 4, Wed) a sketch of the electorate as he now sees it. In Seattle, that once knew 'the highest quality of life' in the land, beggars sell ten-dollar charity vouchers to buy drink. In a two-square-mile quarter of Los Angeles, there are eight rival gangs of armed youths. Two-thirds of the State are against immigration, including, no doubt, the blacks who harass the Koreans. Further east, the citizens of Sinclair Lewis's 'Main Street' fight the prospect of a five-lane main street through the middle of their community. At Ellsworth Base, South Dakota, the guardians of the ICBMs must soon seek new jobs when the base is closed. Four-fifths of the people reckon themselves worse off than under Reagan. It sounds very different from the television views of the campaign. Looking elsewhere for serious commitment to current affairs, I found that Tuesday afternoon's Radio 4 play, The Legs that Came in from the Cold by Karoline Leach, was unexpectedly about radio-active material and based on a true story. Casual thieves bluff their way into a reprocessing plant and steal a van-load of 'metal rods', that are in fact plutonium. Their boss realises what he has got and offers a media story. No one cares but a pacifist group, Rainbow Peace. The 'rods' have meanwhile been dumped on a council site, removed for recycling and made into table legs. It is quite fun, but not truthful enough. Serious commitment to current affairs, no. Director, Nigel Bryant. Conscience takes me to Radio 5 now and then, and I had a look round the week's evening rivals to homework. At 6.30 yesterday was Greywing, closely descended from Superman. Nigel puts on this grey kit to do good deeds in. This week, tipped off by girlfriend Judy in the local radio station, he saves the local ice-cream king from sabotage by a rival. Colin Swash directed. At 7.15, Pie in the Sky by David Campton, read by Philip Hawthorn. A girl gourmet, Buster, is kidnapped to a new planet, to tell the inhabitants how food tastes and smells, pleasures they lack. She fights back with a battery of hot items like curry and horseradish. At 7.15 daily from Monday to Thursday came a four-part tale, The Water Horse, by Dick King Smith, read by John Gordon Sinclair. The eponymous creature was found in its egg by Kirstie, who took it home and put it in the bath, where it hatched - and demanded its keep. At 9.30, also on Monday, we had the first part of a thriller for those that have finished their homework, or indeed their elders. Run Man Run, adapted from a novel by Chester Himes, is set in Harlem in the 1950s. Black Jimmy (Eamonn Walker) is cleaning a diner on the night shift when a drunken white cop, looking for his stolen car, breaks in, shoots two of his mates and wounds him. He recovers in hospital, but the cop is still after him, to make sure he doesn't tell about the shootings. Three more parts to know what happens. For the grown-ups, there was John Arden's Armstrong's Last Goodnight on Sunday, on Radio 3 - quarrelsome matter, between Scottish King James V and English King Henry VIII at the top level, between the fighting Borderer John Armstrong and his neighbours at a lower. To summarise a complex tale, rich in extraneous incident, Armstrong was treacherously betrayed to the young king by Sir David Lindsay, for supposed help to the English. The king had promised him friendship, but had him hanged. Arden's wordy script is in Lowland Scots. I found its 200 minutes dull on the Chichester stage in 1965, and its 120 minutes dull on radio. Adaption by Bennett Maxwell, direction by Stewart Conn.</p>

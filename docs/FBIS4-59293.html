			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 10, IRNA -- Within three months since  the tragedy in February of opening fire at Palestinian  worshippers at the town of al-Khalil [Hebron], Yasir 'Arafat  betrayed more than 46 years of resistance and struggle for  liberation of Palestine. He revived the shameful memory of Camp  David through signing of an accord with the Zionist regime.  Signing the accord was followed by waves of violence and  people's hatred against the PLO leaders and the Zionist regime.    The accord known as limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho  was  signed in Cairo on May 4 between PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and  Prime Minister of the Zionist regime Yitzhaq Rabin. Even the  most optimistic observers doubt the successful implementation of  the accord in view of its ambiguity. Palestinian activists  believe that the intifada will determine the fate of Palestine  and that the Palestinian nation will never betray the blood of  thousands of Palestinian martyrs.    An expert on the Middle East issues, Dr. Amir Reza'i, told  IRNA Tuesday that the Gaza-Jericho plan was an obvious treason  to the cause of Palestine and the main objective of the plan was  to suppress intifada. He said the Zionist regime is now trying  to sow discord among the Palestinians in an attempt to eliminate  their movement. The extensive protest movement in Jericho, Gaza  Strip, Halhul, al-Khalil and Ramallah in recent days showed that  the plan of the Zionists will not succeed and remain a mirage  for Israeli leaders, he said.    A general study of the plan formulated by the United States,  Russia and some other western states in Madrid conference in  1991 indicated that the only matter that they ignored was the  interests of the Palestinians, Reza'i said.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE SOCCER TEAM GAINS CREDIBILITY IN LOSS;  </P> <P> MATADORS PLAY DIVISION I POWER UCLA ON EVEN TERMS BEFORE SUCCUMBING LATE IN  MATCH, 2-1  </P> <P> UCLA versus Cal State Northridge cannot be considered a rivalry yet, but the  Matadors took a big step Saturday night toward making it one.  </P> <P> Playing before 2,491 fans at North Campus Stadium in their annual  season-opening soccer exhibition, the Bruins edged the Matadors, 2-1.  </P> <P> The score was in stark contrast to last year's match when UCLA walloped  Northridge, 4-0.  </P> <P> "We made them look human tonight," Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad said of UCLA.  "In the past they toyed with us. They used us as playthings. But tonight we  gave them a game."  </P> <P> Northridge, runner-up in the last two NCAA Division II championships, took a  1-0 lead on Keith Martin's direct free kick at the 78:47 mark, but UCLA  answered with two goals in the next 10 minutes for the win.  </P> <P> Kirk Ferguson, a junior forward from Stockton, accounted for both UCLA goals.  </P> <P> The winning goal came at the 88:32 mark when the Matador defense appeared to  have a brief letdown after being whistled for a foul.  </P> <P> Tim Gallegos sensed the drop in Northridge's intensity and fed Ferguson with a  crossing pass in front of the Northridge net that goalkeeper Mike Littman had  little chance of saving.  </P> <P> "They caught us on our heels for a brief second," Ass'ad said. "We've got to  learn that we can't do that. We have to constantly be on our toes."  </P> <P> UCLA, which tied Dominguez Hills, 1-1, in a exhibition match on Tuesday, tied  the match at 1-1 less than two minutes after Martin's score when Ferguson  scored on a rebound of an Eric Page shot.  </P> <P> Littman had deflected Page's attempt directly in front of the goal, but  Ferguson was there to follow with a shot that Littman again deflected, but not  hard enough to prevent it from rolling into the net.  </P> <P> "I don't know what happened," said team co-captain Martin. "We just seemed to  have a letdown after we scored. It seemed like our goal pumped them up. They  seemed to get energy from it and we seemed to be a little slow after that."  </P> <P> Martin caught UCLA goalkeeper Anton Nisti cheating to score Northridge's goal.  </P> <P> Decoying a crossing pass to teammate Matt Ziegler, Martin decided at the last  second to fire away instead.  </P> <P> "Originally, I had no intention of taking the shot," Martin said. "But as I  approached the ball, I saw him starting to go to his right side. When I saw  that, I just let it fly and I lucked out. It skipped off the grass and  underneath him."  </P> <P> Despite the loss, Ass'ad came away pleased with his team's performance.  </P> <P> "Defensively, we're way ahead of last year," he said. "We played much more  aggressively against them tonight than we did last year."  </P> <P> Although the first half ended in a scoreless tie, UCLA outshot Northridge, 8-2,  and had four excellent chances at scoring.  </P> <P> The best opportunity came when Gallegos got loose down the right sideline and  fed Chris Roosen with a crossing pass that Littman dove to block at the  10-minute mark.  </P></p>

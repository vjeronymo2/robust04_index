			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bossi in One of 37 Enimont Case </F> Indictment Requests"]    [Excerpts] (ANSA) Milan, April 30 -- Northern League leader  Umberto Bossi, one of the two major partners of media magnate  Silvio Berlusconi in the incoming right-wing coalition, was the  subject of one of 37 indictment requests made by the Milan chief  prosecutor's office this morning in connection with illegal  party funding by the Ferruzzi-Montedison group and kickbacks  paid for Montedison's 1990 pull-out from the year-old Enimont  chemicals joint venture with public fuels group ENI [National  Hydrocarbons Corporation].    Preliminary hearings judge Italo Ghitti will pronounce on  the  indictment requests -- also including many disgraced former  party heads and the former Ferruzzi top brass -- on May 24.    Leading prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro said the indictments  were sought for "all those who gave and took the money."    Bossi's citation for violation of party funding laws is  based  on testimony from former Montedison managing director Carlo  Sama, that the Northern League, like many other parties,  received an unrecorded electoral contribution (200 million lire,  or 125,000 dollars) in the run-up to the 1992 general election.    Bossi denied knowledge of the payment in testimony to the  Enimont-linked trial of money manager Sergio Cusani, which ended  with an eight-year conviction two days ago. He said that the  party treasurer, since sacked, had been a fool to accept the  money, which he claimed was stolen from League offices shortly  after the treasurer accepted it and while he was still working  out what to do with it. But he expressed the view that he might  have done the same thing if he had been in the treasurer's  shoes, given the rising party's cash needs at the time.    Among the others for whom indictments are sought are three  former party heads who have admitted illegal contributions to  their parties, Socialist Bettino Craxi, Liberal Renato  Altissimo, and Social Democrat Carlo Vizzini, as well as the  former Christian Democrat Budget Minister Paolo Cirino Pomicino,  and his party's former treasurer Severino Citaristi, who have  also admitted to receiving money from the firm. [passage  omitted]    Also on the indictment list was Republican Party chief  Giorgio La Malfa, who stepped down but was recently reinstated  after admitting an under-the-table payment of 300 million lire  (like the payment to the League and the smaller parties, a small  sum compared to the more than 150 billion lire, or 94 million  dollars, allegedly paid out in the Enimont affair).    Another big name was 1988-92 Christian Democrat leader  Arnaldo Forlani, who denied any knowledge of kickbacks or other  illegal party payments in testimony viewed by the prosecution  and media as reticent.    Two former Socialist high-fliers, former Justice Minister  Claudio Martelli and former Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis  were also cited, as were two of De Michelis's former staff, one  still on the run. Another former minister named was ex-Liberal  Egidio Sterpa. Craxi's brother-in-law and former Milan Mayor  Paolo Pillitteri was also named.    Former head of Ferruzzi external relations Luigi Bisignani,  who allegedly arranged the passage of 93 billion lire in  Treasury Credit Certificates (CCTs) via the Vatican Bank in  payment of Enimont kickbacks, was named along with the  Swiss-based architect of Ferruzzi-Montedison's "parallel  accounts," Giuseppe (Pino) Berlini.    Alberto Grotti, a former Eni deputy chairman facing charges  in the separate Eni-Sai kickbacks case, was also named. Also  cited was Mauro Giallombardo, a former Socialist Euro-MP whose  Luxembourg and Swiss accounts were allegedly used as payment  conduits.    The League's former treasurer Alessandro Patelli was named  along with the man he and others allegedly received the money  from, Marcello Portesi.    Leading prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro has claimed the  Enimont-linked payments were divided into three phases: bribes  to obtain tax breaks at its inception, payments to extricate  Montedison at the highly favourable price of 2.8 trillion lire,  and further payments to secure the benevolence of parties with  whom ex-Ferruzzi supremo, the late Raul Gardini, had realised he  must come to terms.    Di Pietro was unable to convince Cusani to come clean on the  final destination of more than 100 billion of the Enimont and  related kickbacks. Cusani said he delivered the bulk of this  sum back to Gardini, but was unable to prove this.    Gardini committed suicide in July last year just three days  after the jail suicide of former ENI chairman Gabriele Cagliari  and just ahead of detention warrants for himself, Sama,  Garofano, and Cusani.    The closing page of the 63-page request to bring the 37 to  trial referred to "serious evidence" against all those under  investigation accumulated through confessions made by many of  them and the findings brought to light during the Cusani trial,  "which have been fully appended to the present request."    The document also recalled that in his prosecution  statements at the Cusani trial, Di Pietro reported that  investigators could not track down an individual who received  "the alleged billion lire coming from the Enimont bribe and  going to the Italian Communist Party." Thus, the public  prosecutors office will pursue this end of the investigation  "for a complete reconstruction of the episode and to ascertain  possible responsibility."    The investigation will also be continued in an attempt to  pin  down the identities of other people who received Enimont  kickbacks, especially unknown persons who laid hands on more  than 1.5 million dollars delivered by Bisignani in dollars to  Christian Democrats of the time in the faction led by Giulio  Andreotti, seven-times premier and now senator for life.    Forlani, said the request, is wanted to stand trial for  acting in complicity with Citaristi and Enrico Boreatti, named  as an official in the administration of the old Christian  Democratic Party, for allegedly taking four billion 750 million  lire (nearly three million dollars) in installments from  Gardini, Sama and Garofano. The former head of the ex-Christian  Democratic Party was also named in connection with another four  billion lire in bribes doled out by Grotti, the former deputy  chairman of the ENI.    Named in connection with Bossi were Patelli, the former  League administrative chief, and Poresi, the past head of  Montedison external relations. The request said ahead of the  April 1992 general election, in which the League rose to  national prominence on a protest vote, "Bossi and Patelli  received from Sergio Cusani and Carlo Sama, at the time of the  electoral campaign for the 1992 general election, the sum of 200  million lire (materially paid by Marcello Portesi)...."    With his arrest by Clean Hands magistrates, Patelli became  the first official of the League to be linked with the business  and political corruption so strongly decried by the separatist  movement.    According to the document covering the indictments sought,  part of the flood of Enimont bribery funds was allocated as  follows: 200 million to Altissimo, a former leader of the tiny  government party; 200 million to Bossi; 8.5 billion (5.3 million  dollars) to Citaristi; 8.5 billion to Forlani; some 11 billion  (nearly 7 million dollars) to Craxi; 100 million to De Michelis;  500 million to Martelli; 300 million to La Malfa; 100 million to  Pillitteri; five billion lire to Cirino Pomicino.    The investigations said all these and other sums to others  were intended for the political parties but that they were not  written into the parties' balance sheets. Thus, the host of  politicians cited are wanted for appearances in the dock on the  charge of violations of the law on the public financing of  political parties.</p>

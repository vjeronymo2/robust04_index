			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRONKO NAGURSKI A REAL ALL-TIMER  </P> <P> Anyone lucky enough to watch Bronko Nagurski play football got their money's  worth. He played hard and clean for 60 minutes against top and tough  competition that gave no quarter. Comparisons are academic, but should there be  a Super Bowl in heaven, Nagurski will be the starting fullback.  </P> <P> BILL RETCHIN, La Quinta  </P></p>

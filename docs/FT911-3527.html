			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: SDP Duck in Drake city? - Local election diary (Plymouth) PLYMOUTH'S local elections look likely to form the final chapter in the chronicle of a political death long foretold. Under the leadership of a local boy, Dr David Owen, the city of Sir Francis Drake could claim to be the principal birthplace of grassroots social democracy. Ten years on, both Labour and the Tories are promising that Social Democrats Plymouth - the P for party was redesignated to the city's name just a few months ago - will be finally laid to rest next week. As with the demise of the Alliance, Dr Owen himself is accused of having played a leading part in digging the grave. Reports that the member for Devonport is considering a shift rightward to the Tories were widely deemed the last straw. At the borough council elections in 1987, the SDP fought every seat. This time, it is contesting only 15 in Dr Owen's Devonport constituency  - three of which are even being challenged by their old Alliance partners, the Liberal Democrats. Mr Harold Luscombe, local SDP leader, admired by many but loathed by Labour, claims the party can hold the five seats it commands on the 60-seat council. Yet the impact of several defections to the Tories and a resurgent Labour party, especially in the job-depleted docklands, make that improbable. Pressed, Mr Luscombe admits that annihilation is a possibility. Until May 2 at least, the party will continue to fight on a fiercely independent platform that has something to irritate everyone in the big parties. That includes a Torier-than-Tory plan to sell off a participation in the still uncompleted Pounds 25m municipal conference and leisure centre to the private sector - opposed as unrealistic by the Conservatives. Mr Luscombe annoys Labour by castigating his old party as spendthrift. 'I look back on the last few years with a certain pride,' he says. 'Nationally, we have been the saviours of the Labour party. 'The ridiculous thing is that as the party leadership has become more moderate, the local party has been going the other way.' Three miles away in Keyham ward, the sober suits and yet more sober language of Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's national organiser, and Mr John Ingham, the local leader, appear to tell a different story. As in the party's campaigns in Nottingham and Milton Keynes, the heavy emphasis is on a council partnership with private enterprise and the community. If Tory taunts about a hidden agenda ring hollow, local Labour economics seem firmly rooted in the wishful-thinking school. In Plymouth, the party claims it could have set a poll tax Pounds 10 below the Tories' Pounds 380 largely by persuading non-payers to do their civic duty. Nevertheless, Labour - currently with 23 seats on the council to the Tories' 31 - looks in with a real chance to take control for the first time in 25 years. Dr Colin Rallings, a psephologist at Plymouth's South West Polytechnic, calculates that the same 8 per cent swing is needed as Labour requires nationally to take power. Last year's county council elections in key Tory wards proved that was possible. But in a general election, much would depend on whether Dr Owen's fans jump left or right. The three-way split in all three parliamentary seats makes Devonport winnable for Labour. Dame Janet Fookes' Plymouth Drake is also vulnerable if the SDP vote collapses as predicted. Ironically, Mr Alan Clark, the defence minister much disparaged in Plymouth for failing to defend the city's navy interests, seems safest, with a 4,000 majority over the Liberal Democrats. Plymouth's difficulties - housing, the need to diversify from a single industry base, lack of development land - are relatively commonplace. As in the other towns visited by this diary, that creates difficulties from a political point of view, as the options are limited. Often, for little more than the satisfaction of personal ambitions, strenuous efforts are made to dress up what a broad consensus into the tribal warpaints of national politics. One missed opportunity is a curious fact that elsewhere might provoke controversy - as a security measure the entire city centre is permanently filmed by video cameras, monitored by the council's security men. In the event, that draconian measure has not only sharply reduced petty crime - it has also met approval from Tory, Labour and Democrats of both Social and Liberal tendencies. Three centuries on, the city that saw off the Armada has silently fallen to the unblinking tyranny of electronic technology.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Language staff try to master VAT-speak: Why English schools are having tax troubles When Richard and Sue Johns, directors of Kingsway English Centre, a private language school in Worcester, signed a contract to build new premises, they had no idea it would result in a tax nightmare. Just after they completed the building deal, Customs &amp; Excise granted all independent English language schools exemption from value added tax, effective from this month. So far so good. The government's decision came after several years of lobbying by Britain's 1,000-plus private English-as-a-foreign-language schools to be on an equal footing with the 200 English-teaching state colleges, which have always been exempt. The independent schools had long argued that VAT forced them to charge higher prices than the state colleges and hoped exemption would sharpen their competitive edge - and boost profits. But VAT exemption has a down side. The Johnses, for example, can no longer reclaim VAT on some of the supplies and services, such as building materials, they buy for the school. When they signed the building contract earlier this year, they expected to be able to do so. They have decided to create a company to build the premises. That company will reclaim the VAT and the school will rent the property. The Johnses' juggling is an example of how VAT exemption has turned out to be a mixed blessing for an industry which claims to be the UK's eighth-largest source of invisible earnings, ahead of film, television and advertising. For the 550,000 people who travel to Britain each year to study English and spend about Pounds 570m during their stay, the VAT change has not produced the widespread price reductions they may have expected. No school has discounted prices by anywhere near the 17.5 per cent rate of VAT. A few have cut fees by as much as 5 per cent, but most are merely refraining from increasing fees this year. 'There is a bit of grumbling from travel agents who are now demanding lower prices,' said Mr Johns. The schools say it is not simply a matter of cutting their fees by 17.5 per cent. 'The savings from not charging VAT are much less than most people assume,' said Mr Timothy Blake, principal of the London School of English, which is lowering its fees by 5 per cent next year. 'If one is not able to recover VAT on inputs there are increases in overheads. So in the short term we have something of a communications task.' This task is made difficult by the fact that there is no single industry body to speak for it, promote its interests and set and monitor standards. 'So many professional organisations for EFL schools are springing up,' said Mr Jergen Gemmeke, director of Munich-based agent Prolinguis, which places 3,500 students in English language schools in the UK each year. 'It is not clear who does what, why and for whom.' At least three associations have been set up by EFL schools, each with its auditing schemes and codes of conduct. But the British Council, the UK's main agency for cultural relations overseas, is the only body which hires independent, trained auditors to inspect EFL schools in Britain through its recognition scheme. When the government decided in April to grant VAT exemption to the schools, Customs &amp; Excise announced that it would exempt only schools which were recognised by the council. But when a number of 'non-recognised' schools, notably members of the Association of British Language Schools, argued that the ruling would create unfair competitive practices, the government extended exemption to all independent EFL schools. The government's attempt to draw a distinction between schools illustrates a marketing problem faced by many schools and by home tuition centres, where pupils stay in teachers' homes. The British Council, the British Tourist Authority and many chambers of commerce advertise only schools which pass muster with the British Council. 'If we could be recognised, it would definitely cut the costs of marketing,' said Ms Susan Anderson, co-director of Channel English Studies, a home tuition service. Because the council's recognition scheme is voluntary, only those schools which apply are inspected. The recognition scheme costs each school about Pounds 1,000 a year in fees to the British Council.</p>

Through the investigations opened by the security services  on  the assassination of a Russian national yesterday in Saoula,  south of the capital, it became clear that the Russian national  used to frequent a spare-parts merchant and an ironmonger in the  area.    The same sources pointed out that the victim had made an  application to the two merchants to buy certain products 10 days  earlier and arrived at the specified time in the same car he was  using to receive the merchandise. This gave his assassins a  chance to seize him, then assassinate him.    The same sources said that the security services, which  immediately surrounded the place after they were informed of the  operation, succeeded in killing and identifying four of the six  armed members. The matter concerns Seddou Said, Chalmouh Ahmed,  and Boutiche Yazid, who lived in Ouled Fayek and Douira [only  three names as received].    The two armed persons sought out by the security services  are  Kisoume Omar and Zitouni Djamal.    The security sources reported that the search is still under  way for Sayeh Atia, the main executor of the assassination of  the governor of Tissemsilt and members of the accompanying  delegation on 11 January last.</p>

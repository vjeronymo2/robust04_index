			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Derivatives markets moved mostly in tandem with the underlying stock market yesterday as they reacted to the sudden nervousness prompted by Wall Street's setback, writes Terry Byland. The FT-SE 100 Index opened 36 points down and the June contract on the index also plunged, showing a discount of just over 8 points to the cash market; the fair value premium is estimated at 3 to 8 points. Although volume was unexciting, the market then turned higher and the June contract was showing a premium of around 10 to cash as the FT-SE 100 approached its closing reading for the day. However, with Wall Street dropping afresh at the beginning of the new session, a large seller of the June future appeared and it quickly collapsed to 3,055, a 30-point discount against the index. Volume was moderate at under 20,000 contracts. But post-session trading saw the June contract quickly recover virtually all of its discount as the seller disappeared, and traders said the opening quotations this morning would depend entirely on Wall Street's performance. Business in traded options increased to 42,164 lots from 23,741. The FT-SE 100 contract held the limelight, trading 20,480 against 9,446.</p>

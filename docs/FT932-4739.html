			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / People: Briscoe clears his desk at Midland Global Markets Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, is moving to rival gilt-edged market-maker SG Warburg later this summer. He will join the research team as senior gilt-edged market economist, filling the seat vacated by John Shepperd, who recently moved to Yamaichi Bank. Briscoe, in his early thirties, moved to Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged - now the gilts arm of Midland - from the Treasury where he worked for six years. Much of his time at the Treasury was spent as an economic adviser, focusing specifically on the public sector borrowing requirement. In the six years that he has been at Greenwell's, Briscoe, a keen socialite and football lover, has become one of the City's best-known commentators on UK government bonds. So close is the rivalry between Greenwell Montagu and Warburg's that Greenwell's has asked Briscoe to clear his desk at the earliest possible moment. He will take up his post towards the end of August, plugging the hole created by the departure of Shepperd and his junior Nigel Richardson to Yamaichi Bank. Briscoe's move is just the latest in a general reshuffling of economic commentators in the gilts market. It now falls on Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell's to replace Briscoe.</p>

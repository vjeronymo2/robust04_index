			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: David Lloyd Leisure to join market with Pounds 70m tag SHARES IN David Lloyd Leisure will come to the market later this month at 150p, valuing the tennis and fitness chain run by the former Davis Cup player at Pounds 70.4m. The issue price represents 14.5 times earnings per share from forecast pre-tax profits for the year to end-September of no less than Pounds 5.5m. This forecast is supported by Robert Fleming, the group's advisers. This earnings multiple represents a 5 per cent discount to the prospective multiple for the market as a whole. Earnings have been established after assuming a 20.6 per cent tax rate. In total, Flemings will be raising Pounds 59m through the placing of 39.36m shares with institutional and other investors. Three quarters of the shares are being placed firm, and the balance is being conditionally placed subject to clawback to meet public demand. Some 72 per cent of the company's equity is held by Leisure Holdings, which wants an exit and is to sell all its stake. This will leave the company with Pounds 13.6m after expenses and Mr David Lloyd, chairman, said that combined with the cash flow and banking facilities, the proceeds would allow the group to develop an average of two new clubs each year for the next few years. The pre-tax profits forecast reflected directors' confidence in current trading, and took account of membership renewal rates in October 1992 and the level of new memberships which was now ahead of budget. The 150p flotation price represents a forecast gross dividend yield of 2.9 per cent. Applications are due by March 11 and dealing is expected to start on March 19. COMMENT The trouble with pricing David Lloyd's flotation is that the closest - but still not a close - comparison can be drawn with First Leisure, rated at a 47 per cent premium to the leisure sector. Clearly, management that is unproven in the public arena could not hope to start with a rating near that. Indeed, given the rapid recent increase in profits, a price at a 10 per cent discount to the sector is pitched correctly if investors have any doubts whether management can meet its forecast. But private investors should be encouraged by the transparency of David Lloyd's profits from early in the year, as so much of the company's income is derived from up-front subscriptions. These forecasts come after five months of the year are already in the bag, so the issue is likely to attract a good deal of public interest.</p>

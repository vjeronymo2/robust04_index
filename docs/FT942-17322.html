			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Embargo strangles Macedonia: Kerin Hope reports from Bogdanci on the damaging effects of the Greek blockade Costs have soared for producers of spring cucumbers and tomatoes in Bogdanci, a village in southern Macedonia just across the border from Greece, since the Greek government imposed a trade embargo on the former Yugoslav republic two months ago. Mr Gjorgi Icev, financial director of Izvorski, the region's biggest exporter with 24 hectares of greenhouses, says: 'Fuel for greenhouse heating and all our pesticides were delivered from Greece. Now everything has to make a detour through Bulgaria. It's a ludicrous situation.' The embargo was intended to force Macedonia into making concessions in the dispute with Greece over its flag and constitution, both seen in Athens as signalling expansionist designs on the northern Greek province of Macedonia. It is having a disastrous effect on the Macedonian economy, already struggling as a result of UN sanctions against Serbia, formerly its main trading partner, and the demands of a stabilisation programme backed by the International Monetary Fund. However, separate mediation efforts by the United States and the European Commission, aimed at restarting bilateral talks under UN auspices, have failed to persuade either Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minster, or Mr Kiro Gligorov, the Macedonian president, to shift their positions. Greece, already accused by several EU partners of trying to destabilise Macedonia through the blockade, is now threatened with a European Court action on grounds of violating the Rome and Maastricht treaty requirements on the free movement of goods. Macedonia estimates the embargo is costing about Dollars 80m (Pounds 54.7m) monthly in lost exports and higher transport charges for shipping goods through the Black Sea port of Burgas in Bulgaria and Durres in Albania, a figure equivalent to about 85 per cent of average monthly export earnings. Few exporters were as prescient as Izvorski, which abandoned plans to truck this season's early vegetables through Greece in favour of setting up a joint venture with a Vienna-based trading company to air freight about DM10m (Pounds 3.8m) of produce to markets in central and eastern Europe. Macedonia's heavy industry, already in steep decline after losing markets in the rest of the former Yugoslavia, is grinding to a halt. The state-controlled steelworks in Skopje, the country's largest employer, shut down last month with the loss of around 8,000 jobs. Other large state enterprises which relied on a rail link with the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki appear close to collapse. After shrinking by 15 per cent in 1993, Macedonia's gross domestic product was projected to decline by another 8 per cent this year. Per capita income dropped to around Dollars 700 last year, while the yearly inflation rate is around 70 per cent. Yet despite the economic cost, the Skopje government is set for a prolonged stand-off rather than give in to Greece's demands that Macedonia change the symbol on its flag, associated with the ancient Greek kings of Macedonia, or amend the constitution to suit Greek sensitivities. 'Even if the Greeks lifted the embargo tomorrow, how do we know they won't impose it again? We have to reduce our dependence on Thessaloniki,' says Mr Hari Kostov, deputy finance minister. The government says there is enough oil stockpiled to meet requirements for another two months, long enough to set up a fleet of tanker trucks to import petroleum products from Bulgarian refineries. Meanwhile, a search is on for bridge funding to build a 65km rail link with Bulgaria, to carry crude oil for the Skopje refinery and raw materials. The Dollars 120m project could be completed in nine months, as Macedonia's state-controlled construction and engineering companies have few contracts at present. After repaying its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt to the World Bank, amounting to Dollars 106m, Macedonia is eligible for Dollars 80m in fresh loans, but is unlikely to start drawing down funds until next year.</p>

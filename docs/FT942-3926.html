			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Blair and Prescott in clash over jobs targets Full employment emerged as the central issue in Labour's leadership election yesterday as Mr John Prescott and Mr Tony Blair clashed over whether a Labour government should set targets for cuts in unemployment. As Mr Ken Livingstone joined four other candidates seeking to succeed the late John Smith, a poll for Granada Television confirmed that Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, is the most popular candidate among voters. The poll, which was not restricted to Labour members, gave Mr Blair 42 per cent support. Mr Prescott, shadow employment secretary, won 30 per cent, Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader, 23 per cent, and Mr Denzil Davies, a former treasury minister, 5 per cent. Mr Blair, the candidate of Labour's dominant modernist wing, warned on BBC Breakfast with Frost that Labour should avoid setting unemployment targets it might not be able to keep. 'What we are about is not remaining a party of opposition but moving to be a party of government,' he said. Mr Prescott, whose support is mainly on the party's traditional socialist wing, said a Labour government would have to set targets to retain credibility with the electorate. He said: 'I believe we will have to set ourselves a target . . . because I don't think the people in this country are going to be satisfied with rhetoric. Let the politicians be judged on how many people they get back to work.' Mr Prescott, who called for a 'crusade' to put unemployment at the top of the political agenda, declined to define full employment or indicate what targets a Labour government should set. But he said big cuts in unemployment could be financed by raising taxes on the better off, making joint venture infrastructure projects easier, and allowing local councils to spend Pounds 6bn of accumulated capital receipts. Mr Prescott also injected a note of controversy by combining his blunt rejection of Mr Blair's cautious approach to full employment with an attack on Labour's 'tendency to avoid difficult questions' in favour of 'easy answers' and 'warm language'. Mr Livingstone, the MP for Brent East, said he was prepared to stand as the candidate of the leftwing Campaign group of MPs. Mr Jeremy Corbyn, MP for Islington North, will seek election as deputy leader. Mr Livingstone, who unsuccessfully sought nominations for the leadership in 1992, said he planned to write to Labour MPs today 'saying the views of the left are views that should be heard in this election'.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy </F> Saburov by Yelena Gornaya; place and date not given: "Yevgeniy  Saburov: `Support for the Population Must Be Targeted'"]    [Text] A few days ago the Government of Crimea  submitted to the Supreme Council a proposal to consider the  question of increasing targeted support for low-income  population strata. It is no secret that the other side of this  "coin" is a terribly unpopular increase in bread prices.    Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Ye.F. Saburov already had  occasion to have it out with the people on this subject at the  beginning of April. After three days of unrest and anxiety,  everything settled down somehow. Crimean residents and guests  still eat cheap bread.    [Gornaya] So, Yevgeniy Fedorovich, why does the government  need the extra hassle of targeted support?    [Saburov] The government takes a firm position that support  for the population must be as targeted as possible. This is the  principle of the social policy during the transition period. We  can make basic foodstuffs and some services cheaper through  budget financing of enterprises, or we can give this money  directly to those who need it most. Aid to enterprises does not  belong in the category of social programs. What happens when  subsidies are not targeted? Take the example of bread: In order  to keep prices down, the bread-baking industry was subsidized,  which required enormous budget expenditures. Which, by the way,  came not from some abstract state but from the pocket of that  same low-income taxpayer. That is, the poor foot the bill for  the right to buy cheap bread not only for themselves but also  for well-to-do people, plus visitors.    Now, one way or the other, the vacation season has begun.  Bread production has increased 1.5-fold. We, Crimean residents,  pay the cost of the additional 50 percent for better-off  vacationers. By the way, bread in Russia is considerably more  expensive than in the Crimea, and nobody there is shocked by  this, because the population's income there is higher. Our  budget, on the other hand, carries unjustified expenses that do  not protect anyone here, in the Crimea. This was clear even to  the previous government. But because of various political events  and endless elections nobody dared to get rid of the absurdity.  Completely different mechanisms were utilized. Loans were  obtained at horrendous interest rates. Paper games were played  with the cost of flour--ostensibly cheaper flour was used for  subsidized bread while flour purchased at a higher price was  sort of set aside for later. And this is how it still goes. At  the end of summer grain from the new harvest will begin to  arrive, and then a huge jump in the cost of bread is inevitable.    [Gornaya] Especially considering that the yield of grain  crops is predicted to meet just about half of the need.    [Saburov] And not only in the Crimea. The entire south of  Ukraine was struck by drought. We will have to go quite a  distance to buy the rest of the grain. Plus rising fuel  prices--just make a mental calculation how much transportation  is involved on the path from the field to a loaf of bread. Had  bread prices been rising gradually, the current expected jump  would have been substantially smaller.    [Gornaya] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, you said all this before in  mid-spring, when the government attempted to raise prices. But  then it came out, as the president said, that some additional  information had not been taken into account, allowing prices to  be restored apparently without losses for the budget.    [Saburov] It is rather awkward for me to criticize the  president's actions, since I am his deputy. Frankly, Meshkov's  decision at the time to repeal the announced price increase was  unexpected for me--after all, concurrence had been reached on  this issue, and the government could not do something like this  unilaterally. The explanation is that candidates for deputy  seats put tremendous pressure on the president at the time.  Remember the time period between the first and the second round  of parliamentary elections? You may put it this way: The  president could not go against the will of the Crimean people  expressed by the candidates for deputies. From the political  standpoint, I can understand him. Although from an economic  standpoint it only swept the problem further under the rug. Now,  however, in the midst of vacation season, it is simply laughable  for us to feed visitors at our own expense.    The same goes for excise taxes on alcohol. Our wine is  considerable cheaper than in Russia. Visitors are very happy to  buy it. If we now introduce a normal excise tax, it will not  faze these visitors. So why should we provide "free" booze for  them over the entire vacation season?    [Gornaya] In the winter it was said that wine-making  enterprises had surplus inventories. As I understand it, this  problem no longer exists, does it?    [Saburov] That is why we propose a flexible excise tax that  envisages regulation both in the event of surplus and when  demand goes up. The deputies got concerned, however, suspecting  that it would create conditions for corruption. They started  talking about auditing the Ministry of Finance. Where will the  money from redistribution of subsidies go? Well, first, to aid  low-income people. Second, it is time to start thinking about  preparations for winter. Schools and other municipal sphere  facilities will need repairs. And most importantly, we need to  stockpile fuel. Pump in gas, bring in coal. We are  catastrophically short on money for these purposes. And at the  same time, one may say that vacationers are happily drinking up  our winter fuel.    [Gornaya] And you are probably also facing the necessity to  find the money in the local budget for MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] maintenance...    [Saburov] Yes, this will be a considerable amount. We keep  facing new problems all the time. I am very concerned about the  situation in Crimean institutions of higher learning. Financing  from the Ukrainian state budget only covers teachers' pay and  student stipends. But what about building repairs? Or supply of  fuel? We have to preserve our institutions of higher  learning--the only Russian-language higher education schools in  Ukraine--at any cost.    [Gornaya] Our new parliament has abandoned the tradition of  the old Supreme Council to decide right at the plenary meetings  the issues involving subsidies, compensations, and so on. And  has abandoned it so completely that it only "took under  advisement"-- this was the wording adopted at the presidium  meeting--all these problems associated with the necessity to  raise prices and targeted subsidies. Taking into account how  socially acute this matter is, such a position of people's  elected representatives does not look very noble.    [Saburov] Parliament members like to use the word "ethics."  Here is a specific situation. Future deputies begged in the  spring to keep bread prices down. Then they won the election.  But the problem remains unresolved. The government is ready to  face the criticism. Nothing we can do about it--this is the fate  of every government. In this particular case we asked for only  one thing--for the Supreme Council to approve the government's  actions with respect to targeted protection of the population.  But the presidium only "took it under advisement." All right,  this is a trifle. I am concerned about a different matter: Over  the period of these entire three months, in all its concrete  undertakings the government not only has not got any support but  has more often faced opposition. We came here to work. After  all, we did not beg to be invited.    [Gornaya] Yes, it is not easy to be in the role of the hated  one... All right, what if this political issue of bread prices  is again thrown at the mercy of populism? And on top of that we  will be drinking cheap vodka all summer?    [Saburov] We will make it through to the fall. By then we  will eat up the entire budget. By the time winter comes, we will  be without fuel and bread.    [Gornaya] And then "mommy dearest" will be able to extend a  helping hand in the form of direct presidential rule.    [Saburov] The whole thing is a paradox: What kind of  independence can there be if we have to crawl for pennies to  Kiev on every occasion? In order to strengthen Crimean  independence, which is what the deputies are dreaming of, we  have to take care of keeping revenue coming into the budget. No  constitution by itself will feed the people and keep them warm.  We have to do something, not just talk, in order to attract  additional money to the Crimea. For instance, our proposals to  attract money to the Crimea may be implemented instantly, but  they are stymied time and again by the position of the Republic  Bank of Crimea. Next. We need to immediately deregulate all  prices--both industrial and agricultural producers are convinced  of it. We do not have to fear a sharp jump in prices as it had  happened in Russia, Here the solvent demand already limits price  rises. In short, it is time to move to a market economy and stop  this decay the Crimea has been wallowing in for several years.    [Gornaya] Are you sure that the system of targeted support  will be effective and those who need help will indeed get it?    [Saburov] In principle, it already has been worked out and  in  operation in the Crimea for quite some time. Currently we are  only talking about strengthening it. By the way, in April  certain categories of the population received an anticipatory  targeted subsidy, and although bread prices were brought back to  the old level, the subsidy is being paid to this day.</p>

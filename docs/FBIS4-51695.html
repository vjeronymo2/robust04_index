			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 3 May (AKP) -- On Sunday, King Norodom  Sihanouk condemned the attack against a peace march by the Khmer  Rouge [KR] guerrillas, who killed at least three persons in  northwestern Cambodia on the previous day. "I express my  condolences and my grief to (march organizer Superior Bonze)  Moha Khosananda, the bonzes and laymen, and my compatriots and  foreign friends who sacrificed themselves for the ideals of  peace, national reconciliation, nonviolence, and friendship  through Lord Buddha's peaceful means," the monarch declared in a  communique. He stated the Khmer Rouge were responsible for these  "tragic and sad actions."    A peace march spokesman, cited by AFP, declared that three  persons, a bonze, a nun, and a layman, were killed Saturday  evening with automatic weapons while at least three bonzes were  wounded by the Khmer Rouge. According to the Battambang police,  the violence resulted in four dead during this attack, which  took place near Bavel District.    King Sihanouk urged the organizers of the march to cancel  the  initiative out of fear that "other incidents" would take place.  The peace march of some 1,000 persons, led by Buddhist spiritual  leader and Nobel peace prize nominee Moha Khosanada, left for  Battambang on 24 April. It planned to go to the Khmer Rouge  headquarters in Pailin, some 400 km from here, and then go on to  the Angkor Wat temples. According to march organizers, several  of the 12 foreigners who took part in the march were kidnapped  by the Khmer Rouge.    King Sihanouk demanded they be freed immediately, but  information on these alleged kidnappings remained unclear  Sunday. A British diplomat said there were contradictory  reports about their fates and that one of the persons believed  kidnapped was seen safe and sound in Battambang. Serei Kosal,  deputy Battambang governor, said he had heard that foreigners  were reported missing and believed kidnapped by the Khmer Rouge,  but he could not confirm these reports.</p>

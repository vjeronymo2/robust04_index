Police and customs agents confiscated roughly 20 kilograms  of  hashish, a record 3.3 kilograms of amphetamines, and 200 grams  of cocaine in 1993, with the above-cited monetary figure based  on a 15 percent catch rate for illegal drug smugglers and  current street prices for the poison.    "It's often been said that we ferret out and confiscate from  10 to 15 percent of the substances that enter the country.  Whether this is right I dare not comment on, but it is clear  that we fail to stop all but a fraction of what comes to  Iceland," daily DV [Reykjavik DAGVISIR] quoted narcotics officer  Gudmundur Baldursson as saying.    Baldursson said the surprising drop in cocaine seizures--a  mere 200 grams was snatched in 1993, compared to 1.3 kilograms  the previous year--was likely attributable to the economic  recession and the drug's high street price.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Qin Chun (4440 2504) and Zhang Jimin (1728 </F> 4949 3046)]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- The seventh congress of  academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS] and the  inaugural meeting of the Chinese Academy of Engineering closed  here today. Song Jian, state councillor and minister of the  State Science and Technology Commission, addressed the congress.  On behalf of the State Council, he congratulated the  academicians of the two academies for successfully accomplishing  their missions. At the congress, prizes were presented to  winners of the 1993 Chen Jiakeng Award.    Song Jiang said: The Eighth Five-Year Plan will successfully  be fulfilled next year. This year, we have begun drafting the  Ninth Five-Year Plan and the development program up to 2010.  China's scientific and technological circles are preparing to  enter the 21st century with a new appearance and new stance. We  should formulate our Ninth Five-Year Plan for scientific and  technological development on the basis of democracy, inherit and  develop the fighting spirit of the Chinese scientific and  technological circles and the great achievements they have  scored over the past nearly half a century, and continue to work  hard to meet the development target for the next century.    Song Jiang pointed out: We will continue to focus on the  central task of economic construction, persist in reform and  opening to the outside world, and more energetically implement  the principle that economic construction must depend on science  and technology and science and technology must be geared to  economic construction. We must accomplish reform of the science  and technology management system which has been undertaken for  nine years, establish a science and technology management system  and operation mechanism that meet the needs of a socialist  market economy and conform to the law governing the development  of science and technology, give full play to the role of science  and technology as the primary productive force, and lay a solid  foundation for building China into an economic, science, and  technology power. This will be the basic task of the scientific  and technological circles during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period.    Discussing the principle of "holding fast to one end and  leaving the whole field open" for scientific and technological  work, Song Jian said: In the days to come, we shall maintain  and strengthen a contingent of competent scientists and  technicians who shall engage in basic research and undertake the  missions of high-tech research and development and the task of  tackling major scientific and technological research that has a  bearing on the national economy, the people's lives, and  national defense. He said in any case, whether to hold fast to  one end or leave the whole field open, scientific and  technological departments must constantly try to raise their  capacity to compete in the areas of research, experimentation,  and market development, and work hard to move closer to or reach  the advanced world level.    In conclusion, Song Jiang stressed: In the past four  decades, China has made tremendous success in scientific and  technological development, but the true upsurge has yet to come.  During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, we should make  preparations for the advent of the upsurge. We should train  tens of thousands, or even millions, of young scientific and  technological experts, further expand our contingents of  scientists and technicians, strive to create conditions for  their growth and their participation in the world scientific and  technological arena, constantly heighten China's scientific and  technological level, and make unremitting efforts to press on  toward the forward position of science and technology.    At the congress, CAS President Zhou Guangzhao presented  prizes to the seven winners of the 1993 Chen Jiakeng Award.  They were Professor Wu Wenjun, winner of the Mathematical  Science Award; Professor Tang Aoqing, winner of the Chemistry  Award; Professor Zhu Zhaoliang, winner of the Agricultural  Science Award; Professor Shi Yuanchun, winner of the  Agricultural Science Award; Professor Wu Mengchao, winner of the  Pharmaceutial Science Award; Professor Huang Jiqing, winner of  the Geoscience Award; and Professor Zheng Zhemin, winner of the  Technological Science Award.</p>

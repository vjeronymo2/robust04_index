			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Markets: Used endowments, handle with care - Serious Money ENDOWMENT policies are not my favourite type of investment, as regular readers will realise. They are not a bad product - just a product which best suits a limited number of people but which, over the past decade, has been mass marketed. Most commentators have welcomed the growth of the second-hand endowment market. It addresses one of the fundamental problems with endowment policies  -inflexibility. Twenty-five years is a long time to wait for your number to come up - as Manchester United supporters can attest. During that quarter of a century, you are dependent on the investment performance of one management group - you cannot transfer the funds to a better-performing insurance company. Until the emergence of the second-hand market, the options for disillusioned policyholders were limited. They could make the policy paid up, which prevented them from sending good money after bad, but locked up their cash. Or they could surrender the policy and take their chance on the surrender value. This value tended to be limited because of the insurance companies' desire to recoup the costs of selling the policy (including the commission paid to the salesman or adviser). Now policyholders can auction their policies, or sell them to a market-maker, and hope to receive more than the insurance company is willing to pay. As well as giving investors a choice the second-hand market is thus creating competition - something which, even in these post-Thatcherite days, is generally perceived as a good thing. Furthermore, the evidence of surveys such as that recently conducted by Money Marketing indicates that surrender values have been improving. This could be owing to the competition from the second-hand market, or it could be a response to media criticism of low payouts. Whatever the reason, it is good news. The second-hand market seems, then, to have benefited policyholders who sell. But Standard Life this week raised the question of whether investors who buy the second hand policies are getting a good deal. The company has decided to write to people who buy its policies second-hand and tell them that 'where a policy has been purchased from its original owner, the overall return to the new owner will depend not only on the bonuses declared, but also on the purchase price paid. We must make it clear that, since the price paid is not under our control, we cannot be responsible if the eventual return, when the policy proceeds are taken, is considered to be unsatisfactory.' At the heart of this issue is whether the surrender value paid by Standard Life is 'fair'. Suppose the fair value of a policy after 10 years was Pounds 10,000. If Standard Life offered a surrender value of only Pounds 8,000, then a policyholder could sell his policy for Pounds 9,000. He would be in profit and so would the buyer - since he would have bought a policy with a fair value of Pounds 10,000 for Pounds 9,000. Standard Life, however, believes that the surrender values it pays are fair. In other words, second-hand investors are paying Pounds 9,000 for policies worth only Pounds 8,000. 'Bonus rates have been reduced and, if investment returns remain low in the future, further reductions can be expected. Coupled with an unrealistic initial price being paid for a policy, this could lead to the purchaser feeling dissatisfied with the return achieved at the end of the day,' the company says. Given that Standard Life is one of the most respected companies in the insurance industry, and one of the best performers, these views carry weight. And they provoked a quick response from Policy Portfolio, one second-hand market-maker, which produced a six point rebuttal. In essence, its argument is that returns from second-hand policies will still be good, may not be available elsewhere and that, in any case, the risks are clearly spelt out to investors. The surrender value of an endowment policy is something which actuaries can (and do) debate at length. Christopher Dobie of Beale Dobie, another firm in the second-hand endowment market, points out that, after 15 years of a 25 year policy, Equitable Life can pay out 28 per cent more than Standard Life. But has the second-hand market grown too quickly for its own good? There still seems plenty of demand. Kleinwort Benson's Endowment Policy Trust, which raised Pounds 30m to invest in second-hand policies in July 1992, is only 50 per cent invested and has admitted that its purchasing programme has been slower than expected. BZW and Beale Dobie are to launch a Pounds 20m offshore fund with similar investment aims. The extent of future supply is harder to assess; with interest rates low, fewer borrowers will be forced into surrendering; on the other hand if bonus rates fall, more investors may be disillusioned. Those considering buying second-hand policies should remember the 'smoothing' nature of with profits policies. The evidence is that insurance companies paid too much in 1989 and 1990 and have yet to redress the balance. Thus future bonus rates could well be lower than if the insurance companies had started with a clean slate. Standard Life has done the industry a service by highlighting the issue.</p>

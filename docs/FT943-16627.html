			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / International Press Review: Reshuffle fails to convince - United States The White House did its utmost to put a favourable spin on last week's reshuffle in its ranks, but the US media resolutely refused to be spun, remaining sceptical of many aspects of the shake-up. The oft-repeated official line that the changes were just the kind of routine tinkering that any organisation goes through found few takers. 'No explanation has been given for the changes,' wrote Mary McGrory in The Washington Post. 'To hear everyone speak at the graduation ceremonies in the Oval Office Monday, everyone has done a spectacular job, things had never been bad, they just could be better.' The grumbling, she said, was all behind the scenes. There was praise for the key players in the game of musical chairs  - Mr Leon Panetta, who switched from heading the Office of Management and Budget to become White House Chief of Staff, Ms Alice Rivlin, who stepped into Mr Panetta's shoes, and spinmaster Mr David Gergen, who went from an advisory role at the White House to one at the State Department. But one common theme was: Good people, pity about their boss. Giving the top White House job to a Washington insider like Mr Panetta would help at a time when Mr Clinton's foreign policy was under attack, healthcare reform was mired in Congress, and the president's poll ratings were falling, suggested David Lauter at the Los Angeles Times. 'But because Clinton's problems go far beyond his sometimes disorganised staff structure  - and stem in large measure from his own lack of decision-making discipline  - the help may be limited,' he wrote. The New York Daily News was more succinct. 'If Clinton wants real change, he'll read the riot act to the man in the mirror,' it said. Mr Gergen too was praised at the expense of his boss. However, Doyle McManus writing in the Los Angeles Times thought Mr Gergen's star had been waning, and White House staffers must have been relieved to get rid of the Republican in their midst ahead of November's mid-term elections. The Post welcomed Ms Rivlin's step up from deputy at OMB and thought her nomination 'virtually certain to sail through Congress'. She had 'earned a reputation as the administration's fiercest deficit hawk', it said. The Los Angeles Times could not resist reminding readers of her Capitol Hill nickname  - Tiny Alice. The only apparent loser in the reshuffle was Mr Thomas 'Mack' McLarty, Mr Clinton's childhood friend, who was eased aside by Mr Panetta but will remain in the White House as a senior counsellor. Mr McLarty was widely reported as a nice guy who just lacked sufficient Washington experience to head the White House staff. But there was no sympathy from New York Times columnist William Safire. 'Mack McLarty, who went to kindergarten with Clinton, is taking their old sandbox into the Oval Office's bunker of broken dreams.' However, a Washington Post editorial thought that in switching from an executive to an advisory role, Mr McLarty might even find himself wielding more power than before. It pointed out that Mr George Stephanopoulos, former White House communications chief, was 'reassigned from an executive function to a counsellor's role' last year and is now more influential than ever. Mr McLarty is nothing if not loyal. Only hours after the shake-up announcement, which sounded at times like his funeral, up he popped on CNN's Larry King Live show, flanked by Mr Panetta, saying what a great idea it all was. Mack the Nice and Neon Panetta, as King dubbed them, then seemed to appear on every talkshow or news programme that would have them, or that was not dominated by blanket coverage of the OJ Simpson case. No news out of Washington last week could compete for air time with the drama in Los Angles as one of the nation's most prominent sporting heroes faced a televised preliminary trial hearing accused of murder. Elsewhere there was much debate over whether more high-level reshuffling was to come, particularly in the foreign policy area, where rumours of change have been rife for weeks. The Wall Street Journal, in a lengthy memo to Panetta, urged change at the top of the foreign policy machine, reserving some harsh words for the Secretary of State: 'Everyone in this town (Washington) thinks that Warren Christopher is a lame duck.' For The Washington Post's In the Loop column, Mr Christopher was not so much a lame duck as a bald eagle  - the comeback of which from the verge of extinction was much celebrated in the US last week. But only a big administration victory on Bosnia, Haiti or especially Korea could remove Mr Christopher and Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, from the endangered species list, it warned, and even that might be temporary.</p>

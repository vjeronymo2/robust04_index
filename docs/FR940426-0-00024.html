The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and DFW Quarantine appear to meet the requirements of the regulations for designation as a port of embarkation and an animal export inspection facility, respectively. We are also revising the listing for a port of embarkation in Los Angeles, CA, that has changed its name and telephone number. These actions update the regulations and add a port and an inspection facility through which horses may be processed for export. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  May 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  For information concerning the Texas port, contact Dr. Lisa Ferguson, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 760, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7511.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For information concerning the California port, contact Dr. Michael David, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 761, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7511.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States. The regulations state, among other things, that all animals, except animals being exported to Canada or Mexico, must be exported through designated ports of embarkation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To receive designation as a port of embarkation, a port must have export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection facilities available for the inspection, holding, feeding, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> watering of animals prior to exportation to ensure that the animals meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain requirements specified in the regulations. To receive approval as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export inspection facility, the regulations provide that a facility must meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified standards in &sect;91.14(c) concerning materials, size, inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implements, cleaning and disinfection, feed and water, access, testing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment, location, disposal of animal wastes, lighting, and office and rest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 12, 1993, we published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 59962&hyph;59963, Docket No. 93&hyph;106&hyph;1), a proposal to amend the regulations by designating the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas as a port of embarkation for horses. DFW Quarantine in Lewisville, TX, was proposed as the export inspection facility for that port, for horses only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also proposed to make changes in the regulations indicating the name and telephone number changes undertaken by the export inspection facility currently listed as Steifel Bros. Livestock in Los Angeles, CA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We solicited comments for our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending December 13, 1993. We did not receive any comments. The facts presented in the proposed rule still provide the basis for this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, there were over 73,000 horses exported out of the United States. Approximately 60,000 horses (82 percent) were exported to Canada, mostly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through northern land border ports, while about 6,000 horses (8 percent) were exported to Western Europe by way of John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. The remaining exports included about 3,700 horses to Latin America, about 3,500 horses to Asia, and a small number of horses to Australia, New Zealand, and Africa. Horses exported to Latin America generally were shipped through Miami, while exports to Asia generally were shipped through Los Angeles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although we do not know how many horses will be exported out of the United States through the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, we do not expect the number to exceed 5,000 horses annually. Further, we believe that only a few entities will engage in the export of horses from Dallas/Fort Worth and that they all will be small entities, having 100 or fewer employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe, therefore, that this action will have no significant impact on horse exports from the United States. Moreover, we expect any impact to be beneficial, since the proposal establishes an additional, possibly less expensive, port for the export of horses from the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy in Beijing and Dick Chan] </F>   [Text] China's legislature yesterday decided to postpone  scrutinising a hard-line statement that denounces Hong Kong's  three-tier political structure as set up under British rule.  The National People's Congress (NPC) presidium suggested the  statement--proposed by Hong Kong delegate Cheng Yiu-tong, and  supported by more than 30 delegates--be referred to the legal  committee, rather than being passed during this plenary session.  It appears the move is to cool the atmosphere created by the  row with Britain as China accelerates efforts to unite the  people of Hong Kong.    Mr Cheng proposed using legislation to defy the Legislative  Council, district boards and municipal councils set up in Hong  Kong if Britain and China failed to agree on democratic reform.  His proposal states China has a right to re-organise the  government under the Basic Law and the decisions of the Congress  and its Standing Committee. Mr Cheng said yesterday his  proposal was not dismissed and suggested the Congress chairmen  might have felt it was "not the best timing" to make such a  statement.    In a separate move, Britain's ambassador to Beijing, Sir  Robin McLaren, dismissed Chinese suggestions that introducing  the single-seat, single-vote election system was a "backward  step" in democracy for Hong Kong. He was responding to comments  made last week by China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, Lu  Ping, who is the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office. Sir Robin said: "That is not the view of either the  British Government or the Hong Kong Government, and I don't  think it is the view of Legco, since it has frequently supported  the single-seat, single-vote system. It does not seem to me  that 60 constituencies for a population of six million is  excessive."</p>

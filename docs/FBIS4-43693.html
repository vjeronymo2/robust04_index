			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Price Tag of 18.75 Billion Dollars </F> on Court Ruling"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 13 -- A ruling handed down by the  Constitutional Court last week on minimum pension benefits will  cost Italy at least 30 trillion lire (18.75 billion dollars),  Labor Minister Clemente Mastella confirmed today at the end of a  meeting with Mario Colombo, the special commissioner in charge  of the National Social Security Institute (INPS).    Colombo said the effects of the ruling were "terrifying" as  Mastella explained that within the 30 trillion price tag were  the funds in arrears and the costs of an earlier Constitutional  Court ruling on the transfer of benefits to the heir of a  deceased person drawing a pension. Some 7,000 cases were  covered by the December ruling, he said.    Tomorrow, the labor minister will confer with the three  economics ministers, Budget, Treasury and Finance, and then the  "hot potato" will reach the premier's office. "It is obvious  that an issue of this breadth will directly involve the premier  as well. The matter concerns the government as a whole," added  Mastella.    He went on to say, "After a meeting with Colombo Saturday  [11  June], I thought it might rain. This is not the case. It's a  flood." An initial check of the figures involved was enough to  make "one lose one's head," he stressed.    Also speaking out today on the nation's social security  system was Budget Minister Giancarlo Pagliarini who said that  the pension system is devoid of ethics, is burdened by pension  debt towards the citizens made up of pension benefits already  payable of some 3,000 trillion lire (187.5 billion dollars) and  must be changed.    On the attack in a statement delivered at a conference in  Milan, the minister said the present system "forces our children  to pay our pensions." In other words, "with the contributions  we pay, we are not building our own pensions but a sort of  credit towards those who will pay us our pensions."    On the transfer of funds from state coffers to INPS,  Pagliarini said these transfers in 1994 will come to 74 trillion  lire (46.25 billion dollars), "equal to the cost of three  tunnels under the English Channel or about 14 percent of gross  domestic product."    On the side of remedies, the minister said he wanted to see  "the removal of all fiscal dis-incentives on pension funds to  get them started immediately."    Pagliarini also said he would favor a mid-year supplementary  budget of five trillion lire (3.125 billion dollars) and noted  that a decision along these lines would be up to Premier Silvio  Berlusconi.    Meeting members of the foreign press here, the minister  recalled that the budget deficit target for the year is 154  trillion lire whereas the figure of 159 trillion (nearly 100  billion dollars) has been indicated as more realistic.    He also spoke of the prospect of another correction required  for the shortfall of up to 30 trillion lire in INPS accounts as  a result of the court ruling.</p>

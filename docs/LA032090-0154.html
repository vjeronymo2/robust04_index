			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEATH;  </P> <P> CAPUCINE JUMPS TO HER DEATH  </P> <P> French actress Capucine, who played the slinky seductress in the first "Pink  Panther" movie, jumped to her death from her eighth-floor apartment, police  reported today.  </P> <P> The 57-year-old actress, who starred in movies with such Hollywood stars as  John Wayne, Stewart Granger and Peter Sellers, took her life Saturday, police  said.  </P> <P> Swiss media said friends who knew her since she moved to Lausanne on Lake  Geneva 28 years ago reported that she had lately been ill and depressed.  </P> <P> Born in Toulon, France, as Germaine Lefebvre, Capucine first studied painting  and then became a model. She won Hollywood fame in films of the late 1960s.  </P> <P> Beautiful, tall and dark-haired, Capucine was the slinky femme fatale in the  first of the "Pink Panther" comedy films with Sellers playing the loony French  police inspector.  </P> <P> She chose the stage name Capucine from the French for an exotic ornamental  South American flower with large petals that are typically orange.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Oscar Salas has been reelected to the post of  executive secretary of the Bolivian Labor Federation [COB].  Julio Roca Laguna reports on the 10th COB congress from Tarija:    [Begin recording] [Roca] Up to now five of the seven  commissions that have been established have submitted their  reports to the 10th ordinary congress of the COB being held in  Tarija. The Political and Organization Affairs Commissions have  yet to submit their reports. The latter report is drawing more  attention because it centers on the COB reorganization.    Moreover, the Economic Affairs Commission has made the  following recommendations: the safeguarding of properties of  state-owned companies and the reactivation of mines; the  issuance of a statement against the privatization of the  National Road Service; the disbursement of $7 million to build  the Jaime Mendoza highway.    In its report, the Peasant and Agricultural Affairs  Commission repudiates the concentration of land in the hands of  a few and calls for a halt to the plundering of Bolivian forests  and jungles. Regarding the coca leaf issue, the commission  disavows Law 1008 because it is unconstitutional and demands the  repeal of Article No. 2 of the coca industrialization decree.  [end recording]    According to the FIDES news agency, the 10th COB congress  closed before dawn today with the election of a [word  indistinct] fifth executive committee. The report states that  Oscar Salas Moya has been reelected as COB executive secretary.  Salas is a member of the ASD [Democratic Socialism Alternative].  Juan Chavez, a factory workers' union representative and member  of Conscience of the Fatherland Party, was elected first  secretary general.

Sirotkin; </F> UDC 621.039]    [Abstract] This paper proposes a model describing the  deformation and destruction of heat-releasing elements due to a  pulsed energy release which arises in an uncontrolled release of  positive reactivity into a reactor. The pulse is less than one  second long. It is assumed that the jacket is destroyed by  high-speed deformation due to internal pressure. In addition to  pressure due to heating and evaporation of water, this paper  also considers thermal expansion, fusion of fuel, and the  presence of gas in the gap and within the fuel. A single  approach is used to describe the dynamics of heat-releasing  element behavior (in particular, the increase in internal  pressure) and the threshold value of destruction in relation to  energy release pulse parameters and the initial state of the  heat-releasing element. Model figures agree with theoretical  values for pressure amplitude and the onset of heat-releasing  element destruction. As the proportion of gas increases, the  threshold of destruction increases. The threshold power of the  burst decreases as pulse length increases. Figures 4; table 1;  references 9: 3 Russian, 6 Western.</p>

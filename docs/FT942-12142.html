			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (6): Little pieces of old magic - Vivienne Becker considers the continuing allure of antique jewellery When it comes to buying diamonds and gemstones, investment value and quality are what buyers seem to look for. But when it comes to antique jewellery different considerations come into play. Jewellery as pure ornament, jewellery for art's sake, seems to be making a comeback. Strong design that reeks of its era, of all periods and styles, fine craftsmanship, inventive use of luxurious materials, and above all, charm, are what canny connoisseurs of antique and period jewellery are searching for; and they are prepared to pay handsomely for these ingredients when they find them. The relentless hunt for quality is more than ever the central theme of the antique and period jewellery market. Last year was a turning point for fine jewellery at auction. Jewellery appears to have been largely recession-proof, certainly at auction. The problem in the trade has been one of acute shortage of the right goods to appeal to an increasingly discerning clientele. Last year saw a growth spurt, with an influx of fresh goods on the market, all culminating in the well-publicised shattering of world records for diamonds and diamond jewels at the Geneva sales last autumn. This year looks set to be the year of the jewel rather than the gem, with more emphasis than ever on design, provenance and romance. In fashion terms, jewels of wit and whimsy are taking the place of flamboyant, flashy adornments. Jewellery wearers want individual, meaningful, beautifully made jewels that are reminiscent of their original, magical roles. The forthcoming Geneva sales point in this direction. The chart-toppers this spring are period pieces rather than rocks: Sotheby's is selling a ravishing high-society collection of Duchess of Windsor look-alike jewels that belonged to Helene Beaumont, the 1930s Riviera raver, masses of superb Van Cleef &amp; Arpels rippling with ribbons of sapphires, emeralds, rubies and diamonds; while Christie's concentrates on classical jewels from a European Royal family; and Phillips parades a dramatic 1920s Egyptian revival Cartier creation. It is a trend that is permeating all levels of the market, from the top to the middle range of collectable, wearable decorative accessories, where, for example, 19th and 20th century jet and amber jewels, long rows of soft-toned beads, antique crosses, all totally a la mode are being snapped up by fashion followers. In the realm of the true collector's item, selectivity rules. Only the best and the rarest will do, and preferably with an impeccable background, collectors would rather bide their time, saving their money for the big one. At Bonhams at the end of last year, prices for jewels by Victorian art-jeweller, Carlo Giuliano went through the roof, as hungry buyers, chasing fresh goods with an unimpeachable lineage, paid more than twice the generous estimates for purest Giuliano style: a star sapphire, enamel and diamond parure reckoned at a generous Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 30,000 made a staggering Pounds 46,200. Although a name alone is not quite enough these days, a jewel has to stand up for itself. Customers are still generally prepared to pay a premium for a good signed piece. Cartier is still the magical name, synonymous with a lost and longed-for era of gracious, glamorous living. Van Cleef &amp; Arpels packs a pretty good punch too, each jewel a blissful package of superb gemstones and haughty high-fashion. Boucheron, Chaumet and the grand jewel houses are also seen as evocative seals of quality and style, although slightly less well known names are creeping up, particularly Lacloche and Ostertag of Paris, both known for 1920s and 1930s rich, orientalist opulence; Mauboussin, who epitomises the 1940s; and Sterle's energetic animals and wild birds with shaggy gold chain manes, wings and tails which typify the look of the 1950s. The baroque and rococo creations by high-society jewellers Verdura and Schlumberger, the genuine originals from the 1940s to the 1960s, are rare and prized by collectors as 20th century classics. The designer jeweller age of the 1960s is slowly attracting a more appreciative audience; names to conjure with include Grima, the British designer of prickly explosions of gold and crystals, or David Webb, instigator of the chic Jackie Kennedy image, all green enamel frogs and door knocker lion's heads bangles. Fashion is influencing trends in the period jewellery market: crosses, particularly Chanel-style Maltese crosses and Edwardian and Art Deco cuff-links are selling well, and the Japanese have a penchant for pretty bejewelled pocket watches. Tie pins with all sorts of interesting and unusual motifs and gemstones, worn as lapel pins by women, or several at a time on a waistcoat, provide a relatively inexpensive introduction to antique and 20th century jewellery. Sandra Cronan of Burlington Arcade, who sells decorative wearable jewellery, medieval to mid-20th century, sees a trend towards rich gold Victorian jewellery set with stones such as amethysts and carbuncle garnets. 'People are more positive and confident now,' she says, 'daring to wear bigger and bolder antique jewellery in order to make a statement.' Animals and insects are more popular than ever, from a delicate Regency coloured-gold butterfly, symbol of the soul, to a little pair of Edwardian owls on a crescent moon and a 1940s bird of paradise in shrieking colours. Charm, apparently a rare commodity these days, with a generous dollop of sentimental symbolism, sells every time. Perhaps it shows a new recognition of the universal need to have small, personal, magical or amuletic objects around us.</p>

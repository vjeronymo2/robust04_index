			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTICE TO READERS  </P> <P> Readers of the The Times' financial tables will now find it easier to monitor  the activity of individual stocks.  </P> <P> Starting today, boldfaced lines in the listings for the New York Stock  Exchange, American Stock Exchange and NASDAQ National Market System issues will  indicate price changes of 5% or more from the previous day's close. Boldfaced  lines in the weekly quotes that appear in Sunday's Business section will  indicate a 10% or greater price change. Arrows (/) in the left margin will  replace the footnote (u/d) to indicate a new 52-week high or low reached during  that day's trading.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] La Paz HOY in Spanish on 12 June carries  on page 18 a 1,500-word report datelined Santa Cruz by Jose  Manuel Pando, who notes that "the assets seized from drug  traffickers, instead of being used for social projects, go into  the pockets of a few and disappear into thin air."    The report states that "five years after Law 1008" (the  Repentance Law) "was implemented, the state and society have  hardly benefited from the confiscated goods of millionaires,  which because of inadequate government policy get lost  irretrievably."    Pando comments that "Law No. 1008 authorizes drug  enforcement  authorities to confiscate assets and investigate the origins of  dubious fortunes, and in a few years has allowed the  confiscation of mansions, farms, vehicles, aircraft, property,  jewelry, and money worth more than $50 million, but  unfortunately most of these goods have been stolen or misused."    The report then notes that Santa Cruz District Attorney  Francisco Borestein commented not long ago that the assets  seized from drug traffickers were misused, and that there were  questions as to how the large sums of money seized from drug  traffickers have been used. He also said that many assets had  disappeared, such as was the case with several vehicles, because  of poor administration.    The report then mentions Government Minister German Quiroga  as having noted that the money seized from drug traffickers is  placed into the hands of judicial authorities, while not long  ago Attorney Ives Padilla said that the Office of the Attorney  General is not in charge of administering and guarding  confiscated assets because the Office of Confiscated Assets does  that.    After describing several cases in which public servants  misused the assets confiscated from drug traffickers, the report  mentions that according to recent information there are 214  confiscated vehicles and some 100 houses in Santa Cruz alone  that run the risk of deteriorating or being looted by public  servants.</p>

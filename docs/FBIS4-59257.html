			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algeria: Ben Bella Completes His </F> Mediation Between Authorities and Salvation Front in Washington"]    [Excerpt] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable sources in Algiers  have said that former President Ahmed Ben Bella, leader of the  Movement for Democracy, has been in Washington for a week and  that he met with senators and Western and Algerian figures close  to the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. En route to the United  States, Ben Bella stopped over in London, where he met with Arab  and foreign figures who encouraged him to mediate between the  FIS and the authorities.    Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that the former  president's "secret mission" is represented in continuing  contacts with some FIS leaders, which began in Algeria three  weeks ago on orders from President Liamine Zeroual.

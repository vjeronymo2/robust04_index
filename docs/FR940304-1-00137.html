			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average consumer of $70.39 for the representative class of electric water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters with no impact on gas water heaters, which remain at the base case at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this level; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $81.04  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and $19.13 for electric and gas water heaters, respectively; standard level 3,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by $974.88 and $29.81; standard level 4, by $1024.20 and $29.81; standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 5, by $1024.20 and minus $3.77; standard level 6, by $907.99 and minus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $3.77; standard level 7, by $907.99 and minus $13.12; and standard level 8, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $907.99 and minus $437.41. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level, other than levels 5 through 8 for gas water heaters, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause any economic burden on the average consumer. See Technical Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document, Tables 4.5 and 4.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely face in financing the purchase of water heaters. Similarly, DOE did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that national average energy prices were appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that for all classes of water heaters, standard level 1 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce a net present value of $0.19 billion to consumers. The corresponding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net present values for levels 2&hyph;8 are $0.99 billion, $40.17 billion, $42.92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billion, $42.68 billion, $38.15 billion, $39.91 billion and $32.50 billion,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

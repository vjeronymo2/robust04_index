In a statement to  AL-HAYAH, he said that he had contacted Patriarch Nasrallah  Sfayr suggesting that "a day of prayer and mourning be held for  the souls of the martyrs with the patriarch urging all the  Lebanese to attend. Then, after the day of prayer, a national  stance would be formulated."    That was Gen. 'Awn's first contact of its kind with the  patriarch since he left Lebanon. He had a courtesy contact with  him through a third person when he was in Marseilles.    'Awn said that "the explosion was a part of a chain of  incidents aimed at underming Christian-Muslim relations,  including the attack on the al-Mansuriyah graves, the leaflets  distributed to prevent feast celebrations, the Phalangist  headquarters explosion, and, before that, the al-Balamand  explosion." He said: "We are not accusing anyone, but we know  that Syria is responsible for security in Lebanon, so if it is  not in collusion, let it expose the perpetrators."    He added: "We do not want statements in the air condemning  the traditional enemy, which is Israel, and those who do not  want peace in Lebanon. We want identification of the culprits  and their links, otherwise the Syrians should leave Lebanon  because all their claims about maintaining security have fallen."    He continued: "Whichever hand perpetrated all these  incidents, I call on the Lebanese, especially the Christians,  not to level charges against one another and to close their  ranks to put an end to this continuing plot against Lebanon.  The culprits are the same people who hatched this plot as far  back as the early seventies and who agreed to depose me by force  on 13 October 1990 in order to complete the plot because I had  urged you all to cut off the foreign extensions in Lebanon." He  concluded: "I hope the world's condemnation will be at least as  strong as its condemnation of the al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre  because the only difference between the two incidents is in form  not in substance."</p>

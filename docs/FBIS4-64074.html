			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme Council of the Liberal-Democratic Party  [LDP] accused the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Izvestiya of  refusing to publish its letter of protest against Yegor Gaydar's  article entitled "A Stalk on Rascals." The article said that  "all the classical attributes of a fascist party, ideology and  personality perfectly apply to Zhirinovskiy and his party."    The Liberal Democratic Party's appeal to Izvestiya, handed  to  Interfax, says that instead of initiating a direct dialogue  between political opponents, Izvestiya was playing into the  hands of politicians of the same bias, publishing articles  discrediting the Liberal Democratic Party one after another.    The letter says that the Liberal Democratic Party leaders,  "considered their duty to inform its electors of their attitude  to Gaydar's dirty article through any other Russian newspaper  which will not be afraid to give space to the party which won  the election on December 12, 1993."</p>

DPR&hyph;21. DPR&hyph;65 and NPF&hyph;49 which authorize operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3 (Millstone) respectively. The license provide, among other things, that the Haddam Neck Plant and Millstone plants are subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Haddam Neck Plant is a single-unit pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site located in Middlesex County, Connecticut. The Millstone plants consist of a boiling water reactor and two pressurized water reactors located at the licensee's site in New London County, Connecticut. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 26.21(b) of title 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations requires that Fitness-For-Duty (FFD) refresher training be completed on a nominal 12-month frequency or more frequently where the need is indicated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated February 10, 1994, the licensees requested a one-time exemption from their requirements of 10 CFR 26.21(b). The exemption is needed because the licensees perform FFD refresher training as part of a consolidation of various annual training requirements. While the consolidation of annual training requirements results in substantial gains in efficiency, it also results in the potential for individuals who would have been scheduled to receive FFD refresher training during January 1994, to go until October 1994, before receiving this training. In addition, there will be individuals whose scheduled training interval is extended for shorter durations. However, the 9-month delay is the most bounding, so an overall extension from 12 to 21 months has been requested by the licensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensees state in there February 10, 1994, application that they are confident that affected personnel understand the FFD program and requirements, and that no adverse impact will result from this requested change. Between the four units, approximately 15 percent of the on-shift personnel will fall outside of the nominal 12-month window. All of the individuals have received FFD training in the past, and will read and sign a synopsis of the FFD requirements prior to exceeding the nominal 12-month window. In addition, within each shift, the supervisory personnel will be trained within the nominal 12-month frequency pursuant to 10 CFR 26.22. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has reviewed the licensees' rationale for a one-time exemption from 10 CFR 26.21(b) in order not to separate FFD refresher training from other annual training requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on its review, the Commission finds the licensees have shown good cause for the requested exemption from 10 CFR 26.21(b). Therefore, the exemption to extend the time requirement to 21 months for completing FFD refresher training is acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IV. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 26.6, the exemption is authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest and hereby grants an exemption from the time requirements of 10 CFR 26.21(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the issuance of this exemption will have no significant impact on the quality of human environment (59 FR 13750). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This exemption is effective upon issuance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, the 30th day of March 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jose A.

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Personal View: Why arts need public money to flourish It is depressing enough to read as ill informed and ill thought-out an article as David Sawers's 'No case for subsidies to the arts' (Personal View, September 30), but the realisation that he is an economic consultant writing for the Institute of Economic Affairs fills one with alarm. The fact is that the commercial and subsidised theatre have been totally interdependent for many years. The reason the British theatre is the envy of the world, both artistically and financially, is that, since public money went into revitalising regional theatre from the 1950s onwards, a tremendous talent base has developed through the network of subsidised theatre companies across the UK, where actors, directors, designers, technicians and managements learn their craft. It is misleading to say unsubsidised theatres still account for the majority of the audience. Most UK theatres outside London's West End were built, saved or funded by public money through the Arts Council and local authority grants. Even those now in private hands were brought back from disrepair and neglect during the 1960s and 1970s with public money and effort. At any time, most of the plays and several of the musicals in the commercial West End have come out of subsidised theatres. The international blockbuster musicals which attract millions of people (and therefore earn many millions in revenue) have nearly all been created by directors and designers whose main professional experience has been in the subsidised theatre. The wide choice of shows available in London and in theatres and concert halls around the country generates a vast amount of money for the British economy. The state tourist authorities in countries such as Australia and America have calculated that, for each dollar spent at the theatre box office, on average a further Dollars 2.70 is spent in the local economy through, for example, travel, hotels and restaurants. The arts are undoubtedly one of Britain's important industries and, unlike most of its other industries, does not suffer from foreign competition. Its only problem is one of under-funding, not over-funding as Mr Sawers thinks. At this time the whole fabric of the British theatre is under threat from government cuts. What is going to go to the wall is not the high-profile theatre that Mr Sawers's 'richer classes' visit, but the grass roots of the theatre that ordinary people need and support: Theatre in Education, schools' programmes, flourishing regional theatres where Shakespearean productions are properly cast, grants for drama students, etc - in fact, all the areas where the next generation of productive talent and audiences will come from. When I started producing in the mid-1960s, the only way I could get a show together financially was by working with a subsidised repertory theatre to launch a tour. The majority of shows that my fellow producers and I put on during our formative years came from state- and local authority-subsidised theatres. If there was no subsidised theatre, the choice of theatre available would shrink dramatically. I am convinced that, contrary to Mr Sawers's opinion, audiences would also shrink, because it is variety that stimulates both artists and public alike. Popular musical shows such as Cats, Les Miserables or Miss Saigon are only spectacular successes because they engage the talents of such world-class directors as Trevor Nunn and Nicholas Hytner. These directors' main body of work can only thrive in the subsidised sector, where they can work on new and classic plays and great operas, properly cast and realised on a scale to do justice to the author's work. Whenever I visit America, people constantly bemoan the fact that there are so few directors and designers coming through in the US to revitalise the theatre, whereas Britain has a constant stream of new talent. The reason is simple: the US does not have the fabric of subsidised theatre that the UK does. Subsidies give a cushion for learning and experiment, just as a commercial company invests in the testing of a new product that may or may not go into successful production. If all funding were put into the hands of local authorities, we would indeed be in the situation Mr Sawers considers undesirable, 'because it gives politicians and public servants the opportunity to influence the development of the arts'. At least the Arts Council, whatever its shortcomings, is a body whose only purpose is to develop and nurture all the arts, and not a collection of local politicians whose agendas may only peripherally include the arts. Art has a much longer shelf life than commerce, and the UK cannot afford to squander any more of its artistic fabric or it will disinherit future generations. The author is a theatrical producer</p>

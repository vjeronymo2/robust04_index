			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Airport monopoly to be cut Mr Manuel Oreja and Mr Karel Van Miert, European commissioners for transport and competition, yesterday announced plans to open the market for ground handling services at European airports, a move which could sharply reduce airline costs. The commissioners' proposal will strip airports and national carriers of their monopoly rights over ground handling, which covers passenger and baggage check-in, loading and unloading of baggage, mail and cargo handling, refuelling, and aircraft maintenance. The proposed law will require airports and airlines to separate accounts covering ground handling activities from those relating to other parts of their business. It also aims to allow airlines to manage their own activities on arrival at an airport - currently severely restricted. The draft directive, which the commissioners would like to be in place by July 1996, will be presented as a formal proposal to the Council of Ministers next year.</p>

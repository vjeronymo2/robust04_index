			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME BUYERS FAIR;  </P> <P> BENEFITS OF OWNERSHIP;  </P> <P> BUYING AN OLDER HOME AND MAKING IT LIVABLE;  </P> <P> REMODELING: EXPERTS SUGGEST PLANNING WITH CARE AND OBTAINING ACCURATE COST  ESTIMATES BEFORE BUYING A FIXER UPPER.  </P> <P> So you've found the almost-perfect house: it's in the perfect location at the  perfect price. The problem is that its floor plan gives you the blues. In that  case, buying and remodeling it may be the answer.  </P> <P> Analysts say that an increasing number of consumers are buying homes and  remodeling them soon after they move in. If planning such a move, it's wise to  take a realistic look at the costs involved.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are in fact buying older houses and may want to shape them to  their own needs," said Michael O'Brien, a spokesman for Western Wood Products  of Portland, Ore., which represents trade associations in 12 lumber-producing  states.  </P> <P> "If anything is contemporary, having a remodeling job done is. Remodeling is an  incredibly booming industry," he said. Dumpsters "have become status symbols in  California."  </P> <P> The prices and scarcity of new homes are forcing would-be owners to consider  older houses, O'Brien said.  </P> <P> Census Bureau figures show that there are about 100 million residential homes  in the United States, 60% of them 20 years old or more.  </P> <P> "Many people do buy with (renovating) in mind and they do it very quickly after  buying the house," said Ken Betz, editor of the Chicago-based Qualified  Remodeler magazine, a trade publication.  </P> <P> As a first step in deciding whether to buy a home to remodel, some experts  advise hiring a private inspector or an experienced contractor to detail  exactly what is needed and what it will cost. This can have several advantages.  </P> <P> "It behooves a homeowner to look for someone with some professional credentials  -- who has an office and can give some references -- to examine the house,"  Betz said.  </P> <P> In addition, buyers should have contracts drawn up "spelling out what will be  done and what it will cost," Betz said. "We can't afford the informal handshake  anymore."  </P> <P> An inspector can tell you whether costly systems such as the plumbing, heating,  air conditioning, hot water or electrical units need replacing, he said.  </P> <P> Bryan Patchan, executive director of NAHB's remodeling council in Washington,  advises buyers to have inspectors check for the presence of environmental and  health hazards such as asbestos or radon gas, which can cause cancer, and  lead-based paint, which can damage the nervous system.  </P> <P> "All of those things are quite expensive to repair and can be found in a home  built in 1950 or earlier," he said.  </P> <P> Finances will dictate if a home's repair needs are too costly, Betz said.  </P> <P> "There are some problems that are so severe that it would be very costly and  time-consuming to repair," he said. Buying a home with "major structural  problems or problems like rot, termites and water damage" is often not  advisable, according to Betz.  </P> <P> But Patchan offers a different opinion.  </P> <P> "Let's say the house is in terrible shape and needs a lot of remodeling but the  price is right. Then it might be a good investment if it's in a good  neighborhood," he said. "It's always a good idea to know what you're buying.  That's why inspectors are really advisable."  </P> <P> An inspector's report also can be used to "negotiate on the price," he said.  </P> <P> Studies show that new owners most often revamp their kitchens and bathrooms or  add a family room or master bedroom. The cost, which can run as high as $15,000  per room, should not put the house above the value of neighborhood homes.  </P> <P> More money is spent on installation of insulating windows and doors, than any  other remodeling project, Betz said, followed by kitchens, room additions and  bathrooms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW TO FIND A HOME INSPECTOR  </P> <P> Family and friends may suggest a good inspector or referrals can be sought  through these organizations:  </P> <P> California Real Estate Inspection Assn.  </P> <P> 1100 N St. Suite 5D  </P> <P> Sacramento, Calif. 91365  </P> <P> (916) 443-1422  </P> <P> American Society of Home  </P> <P> Inspectors  </P> <P> 3299 K St. N.W.  </P> <P> Washington, D.C. 20007  </P> <P> (202) 842-3096  </P></p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Cresson's popularity sinks lower as regional polls loom THE popularity of Mrs Edith Cresson, France's embattled prime minister, has sunk to a new low, just a week before regional elections. Only 19 per cent of French voters approve of Mrs Cresson, compared with 21 per cent last month, according to a poll by Ifop, for Journal du Dimanche. In the 10 months since she was installed by President Francois Mitterrand to give the government a new elan, Mrs Cresson's unpopularity rating has risen by 42 points to 59 per cent, according to yesterday's poll. Moreover, only 39 per cent of Socialist sympathisers still support her, down eight points on February, said the poll. While not directly comparable, it is striking that Mrs Cresson's score now stands just a few percentage points ahead of the extreme right wing National Front (FN), whose anti-immigration policies have attracted support from 13.5 per cent of the electorate. The Socialist government can draw little consolation from the fact that the same poll shows President Mitterrand has gained two points in the popularity ratings over the past month, to a mere 26 per cent. The uproar surrounding the FN's election rallies - some of which have been banned by local authorities - intensified on Saturday night, when fighting broke out in the cathedral town of Chartres. FN supporters attacked left-wingers, who were protesting against a rally led by Mr Bruno Megret, the FN's deputy president. Police arrested 10 FN supporters and were still holding two yesterday. In another symptom of the protest vote, the Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition party, which supports the right of all French citizens of any political colour to kill wild animals and birds, has been winning 5 per cent popularity scores in recent polls. FRANCE'S economic downturn caused the government to overshoot its budget deficit by 63.2 per cent last year, the first time since 1987 that it has allowed the shortfall to increase, writes William Dawkins. Final calculations of 1991 accounts show a FFr131.7bn (Pounds 13.5bn) deficit, against the FFr80.7bn envisaged in that year's budget, said the Finance Ministry. This brings the deficit to 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product, up from 1.4 per cent of GDP the previous year.</p>

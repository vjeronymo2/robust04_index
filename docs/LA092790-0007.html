			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA WATCH;  </P> <P> BULGING PORTFOLIO  </P> <P> The prospect that MCA Inc., a giant U.S. entertainment company, might someday  have Japanese owners is troubling not only because it looks to some people as  if yet another slice of Americana -- along with Rockefeller Center, Columbia  Pictures and soon, Pebble Beach -- might be added to Japan's portfolio.  </P> <P> The real worry about Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s move is that it  illustrates a major weakness in U.S. business: We have given up too much of our  manufacturing capability.  </P> <P> By virtually abandoning the production of consumer electronics, no U.S. company  is in a position to compete with the strategy reflected in Matsushita Electric  Industrial Co.'s interest in MCA.  </P> <P> The Japanese firm, one of the world's largest consumer electronics companies,  is holding talks with MCA, whose vast film and TV library includes "Field of  Dreams," "Jaws," "E.T." and "Murder, She Wrote." The programming would give  Matsushita something to show on its new generation of high definition TVs, thus  enabling the company to own a whole entertainment package -- "hardware" as well  as "software." Sony had the same idea when it bought Columbia Pictures last  year.  </P> <P> It's ironic how the Japanese have stolen a page from America's book. Way back  when, U.S. electronics pioneer RCA developed radio and then founded National  Broadcasting Co. network. Today, Zenith Electronics is the only American  company manufacturing TVs. It is pursuing high definition TV, too, but lacks  programming resources. It's an increasingly familiar story.  </P></p>

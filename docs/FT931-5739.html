			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Airtours queries benefits of Owners/Cook tie-up AIRTOURS, the holiday tour operator, yesterday questioned the benefits that rival Owners Abroad says it would achieve from a proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel agency and financial services group. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said there was a great difference between identifying costs savings from his proposed takeover of Owners Abroad, and projecting increased sales. Airtours also said that according to latest statistics from Stats MR, the market research organisation, Owners Abroad's winter business was down at the end of January. This meant that Owners Abroad would be making higher winter losses from leased aircraft capacity that is surplus to needs. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, said estimates of benefits from the tie-up with Thomas Cook and its sister LTU, the German holiday company, had been approved by its auditors and advisers. These would be at least Pounds 9m in 1994 and at least Pounds 11m the following year. He said Airtours still had not specified how it would arrive at savings from a merged Airtours and Owners Abroad that Mr Crossland says would be 'significantly' above the benefits from the Thomas Cook tie-up.</p>

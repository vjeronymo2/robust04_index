			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Banks given fraud warning The Bank of England has warned banks to be alert to frauds where their names might be used to persuade investors to put money into complex schemes offering high returns, Alison Smith and Robert Rice write. Mr Michael Foot, head of banking supervision at the Bank, warned of 'prime bank guarantee frauds' - schemes in which a fraudster promotes low-cost or high-return bonds said to be issued or guaranteed by well-known banks, but restricted to professional investors. Would-be investors must pay an advance fee before being let in on the deal. The 'prime bank' may be unaware its name is being used. He emphasised that supervisors needed 'full, frank and prompt information' from banks to enable them to focus their monitoring properly. The Bank has also decided against any significant extension of the scope of regulation or of the powers of regulators.</p>

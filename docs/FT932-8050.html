			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand in the black UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurer, yesterday reported a first-quarter profit, before allocations, of NKr150m (Dollars 21.8m), compared with a pro-forma loss of NKr151m in the same period last year. The group, which is producing quarterly results for the first time, says its expects a good result for 1993 as a whole. The figures reflect consolidated results of Uni Storebrand, which is under public administration, and Uni Storebrand New, which was established following Uni's collapse last August. Mr Per Terje Vold, chief executive, attributed the improved performance mainly to substantial gains on securities and lower interest rates. First-quarter net operating income for Uni Storebrand New was NKr5.88bn. No comparative pro-forma Uni New figures were given. Uni New posted a profit, before allocations, of NKr209m. Uni did, however, give comparative pro-forma 1992 figures for individual business units. Life insurance business doubled profit to NKr1.04bn from a pro-forma NKr512m, despite a fall in market share of 1.9 percentage points to 32.8 per cent. Premium income fell to NKr1.48bn from a pro-forma NKr1.83bn. Non-life business posted a profit of NKr87m against a pro-forma loss of NKr110m. Uni said this year's figure included a charge of NKr121m related to claims. Premium income rose to NKr1.78bn from NKr1.67bn. The stronger result is mostly due to a transfer of NKr105.7m in surplus reserves. International business lifted profit to NKr31m from a pro-forma NKr21m. Premium income remained at last year's level of NKr1bn. Mr Vold said the international unit was undergoing a restructuring in which the scope of business would focus on reinsurance.</p>

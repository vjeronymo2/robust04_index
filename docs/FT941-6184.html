			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Court blow for Italian centrists The Pact for Italy, the centrist alliance of referendum leader Mario Segni, has suffered a serious reverse following the refusal of the supreme court to allow candidates in 10 constituencies to contest the March 27 general elections, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Other parties were also penalised, often falling foul of legal technicalities that applied to the 155 seats covered by the old system of proportional representation in the chamber of deputies. (Under the new electoral laws, 75 per cent of the seats are being fought under the first past the post system). The pact, which includes former Socialists, Republicans and the Popular party (the former Christian Democrats), has been relying on the advantages of the proportional system to pick up the bulk of its seats. The absence of votes in these eight constituencies will complicate the task of mustering 4 per cent of the national vote, the minimum required for a grouping to be included in the allocation of proportional seats.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Replace arbitrary water charge Sir, The letters you published from Chris Smith MP and James Skinner (July 15), concerning who pays for water purity, will find strong and widespread support both within the conservation movement and from the wider public. May I add that the increase in water charges under discussion, however large, will fall even more inequitably on some consumers as we continue for the most part to pay according to the arbitrary and obsolete rateable value of our homes and premises. Now that the council tax is in place, this is one unfairness that could easily be remedied. Andrew Phillips, Swallow House, Long Road West, Dedham, Essex CO7 6ES</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Pie in the sky in Rio IT WILL be a miracle equivalent to the saving of Noah from the Great Flood if this summer's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro achieves its organisers' aims. The enormous gathering of politicians, officials and green campaigners must overcome two severe handicaps. It is being hijacked by the Third World, and it lacks the full support of the United States. This is not to say that its timing is wrong. In theory, it should reflect both the rise in popular concern about the environment and the huge re-ordering of political priorities that has followed the ending of the Cold War. As such, it represents an opportunity to identify some of the most pressing issues facing the world. Yet the final preparatory meetings now taking place in New York are not encouraging. As matters stand, this much-trumpeted event will do little more than add to the hot air which is already generating so many worries about the world's climate. The coming weeks will need some rigorous work by the organisers if Rio is to produce results. This is partly due to the enthusiasm with which the summit's backers have thrown themselves into the task. Just about every issue from the ozone layer to the ocean depths has been put on the summit agenda; as a result, the plan of action that participants will be asked to sign runs to many hundreds of pages. The amount of cash being demanded to support these voluminous proposals - over Dollars 100bn a year - is totally unrealistic. North-South balance It is easy to see where the money would go. The preparatory work has been increasingly dominated, not by environmental questions, but by the problems of the poorer countries: their backwardness, the inequalities of the North-South balance, the barriers to development. These are legitimate issues, since poverty is as much a source of pollution as industrialisation. But the Summit must not permit itself to be waylaid into treating the troubles of the developing world as if they were central to the world's environmental problems. The purpose of the gathering is to lay the groundwork for sustainable growth - that is, to permit the world economy to advance without ruining the environment. These are, at present, matters for the industrialised nations whose wasteful habits have caused the greatest damage. The richer countries are central to the debate. They may be obliged to pay off poorer countries faced with heavy clean-growth costs, although not to the extent of Dollars 100bn. They must show by example that environmental good practice need not inhibit economic development. Narrower focus The Summit would stand a better chance of succeeding if it narrowed its focus to a few important issues, and used the spotlight of Rio to bring pressure for action in those areas. For example, it could attempt to break the deadlock among industrial countries over energy policy. At the moment, no single country wants to introduce tough fiscal or regulatory curbs on its own. The US is the most reluctant, on any terms. Its presidential campaigners might respond to its environmental movement in this election year. Another practical aim would be to devise a more sensible global regime for trade in agricultural goods. The absurd subsidies which cause widespread overfarming but also prevent poorer nations from exporting their produce have a profoundly damaging effect on the natural environment. The Summit could give a fresh impetus to the issues that have become deadlocked in the Gatt. A third goal might be to create a clearing house for environment-friendly technology. If Third World aid is to be an aspect of the Summit, the richer nations might consider additional ways by which this technology could be transferred to the less well off. The Summit will fail if it does not adopt a businesslike approach to matters which are all too often coloured by emotion allied to special interests. The future of the planet is a serious matter. It requires a serious international forum where the right priorities can be established.</p>

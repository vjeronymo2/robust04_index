			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Variable rates drop Although building societies did not react to February's base rate cut of 0.25 per cent by reducing their standard mortgage rates, they have been reducing variable investment rates; indeed, some have lowered these more than once. Others, such as Buckinghamshire and Manchester, have withdrawn their market-leading postal accounts to new investors because of overwhelming response. While interest on variable-rate products has been dropping, escalator bonds continue to be the 'in' thing due to the low cost of funds on the swap markets. They are now offered by most of the major societies, the top payers being Birmingham Midshires (the only four-year term), Newcastle and West Bromwich. These bonds offer tempting rates but should be viewed as long-term investments as earlier access, if permitted, is costly. The sometimes exceptionally good rates offered in the fifth year may, however, be misleading and, in some cases, the average rate offered over the term does not match ordinary five-year fixed rates. The best average, from the Newcastle at 8.55 per cent is also worth a look. If investors require gross interest, Confederation Bank Jersey offers a five-year bond paying 8.25 per cent. Gross fixed interest can also be obtained from the Retail Co-operative Societies. There are several offering rates above the 7 per cent mark. The CWS (061-835 2345) is offering up to 8 per cent fixed for five years and 7.75 for four years on sums from Pounds 5,000. The Brighton Co-operative Society (0273-606 722) offers up to 7.3 per cent fixed for five years on as little as Pounds 100.</p>

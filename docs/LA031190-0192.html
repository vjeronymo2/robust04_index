			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 5 VOCATIONAL INSTRUCTORS LOSE JOBS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: A REORGANIZATION OF AN OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM IN NORWALK  AROUSES CONTROVERSY.  </P> <P> Five teachers in a vocational training program for high school students have  lost their jobs under a controversial reorganization plan that officials say  was necessary to provide the most qualified instructors and prevent a possible  state penalty.  </P> <P> The reorganization at the Southeast Regional Occupational Program involved  classes that offer training in office skills. The program serves students in  the Norwalk-La Mirada and ABC school districts.  </P> <P> Classes offering basic clerical training had virtually no students, while some  of the computer-training classes were full and had waiting lists, Supt. Bill  Allen said.  </P> <P> "We were paying people for 35 hours a week to run classes that had no  students," Allen said.  </P> <P> A total of 13 teachers were laid off Feb. 5, and then were told they would be  considered for rehiring if they took a skills examination, Allen said. The  examination emphasized computer knowledge and skills. Eight of the teachers  passed the examination and were rehired. One teacher failed the test and the  other four decided not to take it, he said.  </P> <P> "We're trying to present the best program with the best qualified teachers,"  Allen said.  </P> <P> The beginning office classes were running into problems because of poor  attendance. Since September, a total of 175 students had dropped out of the  classes offering basic clerical training, Allen said. The 32 classes offering  computer training had an average of 25 students, who were learning how to use  word-processing equipment and other skills needed to be hired in offices with  computers, Allen said.  </P> <P> The teachers with fewer skills had fewer students, while teachers with computer  training had more students, Allen said.  </P> <P> Officials also wanted to make sure that the program passes an audit scheduled  early in 1991 by the state Department of Education, Allen said. The program was  ordered to repay $158,000 to the state in 1988 and $39,000 in 1978 after  apparently reporting inflated student attendance figures.  </P> <P> The reorganization plan has drawn some criticism. Norwalk-La Mirada school  board member Armando Moreno said he was concerned about why the teachers were  laid off and then were asked to reapply. "This doesn't make sense," Moreno  said.  </P> <P> Moreno said he has asked the Norwalk-La Mirada board members to consider  holding a joint meeting with the ABC school board members to discuss the issue.  Norwalk-La Mirada board members are expected to discuss the reorganization at  the next regular meeting March 19.  </P> <P> Allen said officials believed the procedure was the most objective, and that it  had been approved by the program's attorneys. "It is an emotional rough thing  to go through," he added. "I don't enjoy putting people through it."  </P> <P> Juanita Wagner, one of the teachers who refused to take the test, said the exam  was unfair. Wagner, who has been a teacher with the program for 3 1/2 years,  said she and two others had purchased home computers to try to upgrade their  skills.  </P> <P> She said she decided not to take the examination after discovering that some of  the questions dealt with topics beyond her skills.  </P> <P> The test was given March 1 to 34 applicants, including the eight teachers who  were rehired. Another two or three applicants who passed the test may be hired  part time, Allen said.  </P> <P> The beginning office class is one of about 40 vocational education classes  offered in the program, which also arranges some on-the-job training for the  students. Some jobs pay, while others do not. There are about 4,000 students.  </P> <P> Classes include welding, accounting, general office skills, auto mechanics,  auto repair, word processing and cosmetology. There are about 58 teachers.  </P> <P> The students attend 50-minute classes a minimum of three times a week, Allen  said.  </P></p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / New Zealand Labour party moves up in polls Support for New Zealand's Labour party has improved, with opinion polls timed to coincide with its annual conference at the weekend showing it with 25 points against the National government's 42, Terry Hall reports from Wellington. The change in Labour's fortunes has been dramatic: less than three months ago it came in fifth place in a a by-election in the South Island Selwyn constituency, a seat it nearly won in last year's general elections. The polls suggests that the New Zealand political scene is set to return to its traditional dominance by its two old-established parties. Labour's resurrection has been partly due to hard work by Ms Helen Clark, the party leader in distancing it from the right-wing policies it followed in government between 1984 and 1990 that caused its eventual landslide defeat. Labour's unity has been helped by defections of both left- and right-wing critics to other parties.</p>

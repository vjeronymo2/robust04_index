The opposition parties in Burundi have  decided to suspend for two days their efforts to turn Bujumbura  into a ghost town. This started on Monday [31 January]. [passage  omitted] The Army is being accused of passive complicity. This  is denied by Defense Minister Charles Ntakije. He spoke to  Dominique de Courcelles:    [Begin recording] [Ntakije] On Monday and Tuesday, we tried  to talk, to raise the demonstrators' awareness, but today we  have started making arrests. The situation is controlled by the  Army. The situation is returning to normal. People can, I  think, return to work this very afternoon or tomorrow.    [Courcelles] Has calm returned to the streets of Bujumbura  then?    [Ntakije] Yes, calm has returned. People are going about  their normal business in the street.    [Courcelles] How is it that the small parties belonging to  the Collective were able to find such sympathy, manage to  paralyze Bujumbura, and stir up trouble that left several dozen  dead, even though they are not present in the parliament and the  Army, UPRONA [Party of National Unity and Progress], FRODEBU  [Front for Democracy in Burundi], and everyone has agreed to  maintain legality. How is it that they have so much power?    [Ntakije] Because, as far as political circles are concerned  in Bujumbura, there is a lot more extremism being expressed than  there is moderation and political good sense. This means that  the extremists have had much more effect on young people, who  are open hearted and who go into the streets if asked. So they  didn't use older people, who might think and refuse. They used  young people, and now it is young people that we are having to  deal with in the streets. We haven't seen any adults manning  these barricades. I think that this is where they have been  much more successful in raising people's awareness and blocking  the streets.    [Courcelles] Can you say that the Army is resolutely behind  the new president?    [Ntakije] Completely behind the president. Our problem is  that politicians [words indistinct] cause problems where there  aren't any, because they [words indistinct] the procedure  instead of installing him immediately. They agree on the  person, but don't want to install him. The Army is keen to see  him installed as soon as possible because he is regarded as a  factor of security.    [Courcelles] The chief of staff has said that the Army would  not hesitate to resort to violence to restore calm. What does  that mean?    [Ntakije] It means that since people's awareness was raised  on Monday or Tuesday, we found that the consciousness raising  that we were doing was not finding a response. The others who  were stirring up the young people managed to get other messages  across and that meant that, as far as the methodology of  consciousness raising is concerned, we couldn't get through. So  we had to resort to violent methods--arrests, for example, and  using tear gas.    [Courcelles] What kind of arrests have you made? You are  speaking of arrests? Who?    [Ntakije] First of all, we arrested the young people visible  in the streets, blocking the streets, and setting up barricades  in order to deter them from continuing this. And at the same  time, we are explaining to these young people that it is not in  their interest to block the roads because that means that  economic activity comes to a halt and there is a risk of  supplies drying up. Parallel to the arrests of these young  people, we raise their awareness so that they won't start doing  the same thing again. After that, we shall start on fines. [end  recording]</p>

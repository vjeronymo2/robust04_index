			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US in drive over Tokyo copper tariffs US copper producers still hope for the removal of tariff barriers that have allowed Japan to build up one of the world's strongest copper smelting and refining industries, even though it has no copper mines. The issue is expected to be pressed in the next few weeks by US officials who have expressed growing frustration over what they see as Japan's failure to take action to close its trade surplus with the US. They feel there is an opportunity to agree a bilateral deal during the run-up to the February 11 meeting in Washington between US President Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister. Japan's import tariffs, equivalent to about 8.5 per cent, and the 1 per cent US duty were almost swept away during the recent General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks as progress was made towards zero duties on all non-ferrous metals. But negotiations on this issue ended in chaos and recriminations after the European Union refused to cut its 6 per cent tariff on aluminium and Japan withdrew its offer to remove copper duties. The US non-ferrous metal producers committee, in recent talks with Mr Micky Kantor, the US trade representative, claimed the Japanese duties injured the world's more efficient producers. They seriously hindered imports of refined copper to Japan and raised the copper price in Japan above world market levels. This gave Japanese copper producers a protected base from which to export aggressively to third countries - and allowed Japanese smelters to offer higher prices for copper scrap and copper concentrate (an intermediate material) which are imported to Japan duty-free. Japan dominates the world copper concentrate market, importing about two-thirds of all the material traded internationally, said the US organisation. This dominant position also gave Japan a disproportionate influence in the financing of new copper mines anywhere in the world because owners usually needed a contract with a Japanese smelter before they could obtain finance.</p>

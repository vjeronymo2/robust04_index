			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Uneasy return for Marcos's remains: Fears and hopes accompanying the ex-dictator's body THE RETURN to the Philippines this week of the body of Mr Ferdinand Marcos, the deposed dictator, could provide fuel for his old supporters to stoke up disenchantment over a stagnant economy. Mr Marcos's body is scheduled to be flown to his home province of Ilocos Norte in the northern Philippines today. It will be put on display at a newly constructed family mausoleum until burial rites on Friday. The former president's only son, Ferdinand Jr, left Manila last Friday to fetch the body from Hawaii, where it had been kept in a refrigerated crypt since his death in September 1989. Mr Marcos's widow Imelda has been barred by courts from leaving the Philippines. Mr Marcos was forced out of the presidency in 1986 in a military-led revolt against his administration. He fled with his family to Hawaii. The dictator's fall swept into power Mrs Corazon Aquino, whose husband Benigno, a charismatic opposition leader at the time, had been gunned down in 1983 upon his return from a three-year exile in the US. Aquino family members remain convinced that the Marcos government had a hand in the slaying. Mrs Aquino, during her presidency, had refused to allow the return of Mr Marcos's remains. Marcos supporters were involved in several armed attempts to overthrow her. All were thwarted - due to a large extent to the support given to Mrs Aquino by Mr Fidel Ramos, her armed forces chief of staff and later defence secretary. Mr Ramos, who was also among the leaders who sided with the military mutiny against Mr Marcos in 1986, is now president. When Mr Marcos lies in state in his home town this week, his supporters are hoping, apparently in vain, for a visit by Mr Ramos. They say that such a visit befits someone who was not only a former head of state but also a relative. Mr Ramos and Mr Marcos are distant cousins. Some argue that the return of the body could aid a reconciliation among the country's disparate ethnic and political factions, and remove a big stumbling block to sustained economic progress, were Mr Ramos to pay his respects. The people of Ilocos, known for their frugality and clannishness, are regarded as a strong base for anybody with political ambitions. Commonly referred to as the 'Solid North', the Ilocos region was a big asset in the political machine of Mr Marcos. Although the government does not plan to extend state honours at the funeral, Mr Ramos has named four cabinet secretaries to a committee that will help the Marcoses in the burial. His sister, Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani, will represent him at the funeral. Vice-president Joseph Estrada will be the highest-ranking official present. Mr Ramos has also allowed the use of a government building in Mr Marcos's home town as a venue. Throngs of Marcos admirers are expected to gather in Ilocos. Millions of other Filipinos, however, still remember Mr Marcos as the president who placed the country under martial law in 1972. He said then that communists were threatening to destabilise the government. The era, however, came to be known for the abuses perpetrated by the military and civilian leaders while the economy, at the time the most prosperous in Asia after Japan's, deteriorated steadily. By the early 1980s the economies of virtually all of the country's neighbours were booming while the number of Filipinos living below the poverty line swelled. The country is still trying to extricate itself from the economic shambles that Mr Marcos left behind.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its comments on design options for gas and electric ovens, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that since the DOE test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure does not require maintaining heat in the oven over a period of time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improving the insulation in the cabinet will not show any energy savings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 58). With regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced vent size, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this design option should be considered only for electric ovens, not for gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ones. It then proceeded to state how any reductions in vent size will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negatively impact cooking and baking performance as well as safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 58, 59). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that, according to the DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedure, existing instrumentation cannot measure the small energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency gains that result from reducing conduction losses. (Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 59). As with cooktops, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that reflective surfaces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degrade quickly in ovens. This significantly reduces their impact on energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use over the life of the product. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61A at 59, 60). The Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers asserted that oven thermal mass cannot be reduced. Further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in the gauge of the oven wall material may result in cracking and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat loss. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 60). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that an oven separator to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce oven thermal mass would pose potential safety problems due to improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation, gas combustion considerations, and the handling of the separator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the consumer. No test procedure currently exists to certify the safety or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of an oven using a separator. In addition, the Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers questioned the separator's utility, as consumers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already use microwave and toaster ovens for small loads. The Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers also questioned whether the DOE test procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could evaluate this design option. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61A at 60&hyph;62).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For electric ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed separate product classes for forced convection ovens for cooking and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning, halogen lamp ovens, and steam cooking ovens. The Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that due to unique operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics a separate class should be adopted for convection ovens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 45, 46). With regard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to halogen lamp ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asserted that the baking performance is relatively poor compared to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of a conventional electric oven. But since it may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain advantages for broiling applications, the Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers said it should be a separate class. (Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 46). Since no United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer is currently producing steam ovens and because the food products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that can be cooked or baked by this oven type are limited, the Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers said it should be adopted as a separate class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 47).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the discussion of product classes, the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established two product classes for electric ovens (standard and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-cleaning), and analyzed halogen lamp, convection, and steam cooking as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design options for electric ovens. The design options commented on by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and others have all been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered for electric ovens. This includes the biradiant oven concept that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was referred to by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Data provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, oven manufacturers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppliers, and published reports <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  were used in the analysis of electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ovens. Manufacturers' data supplied by the Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers were the only source of cost and efficiency data provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze oven separators. The improved insulation and reduced vent size design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options were analyzed only for standard electric ovens. Insulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement levels and vent size reductions for standard ovens were selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to bring their baseline unit to the same efficiency level as the baseline unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected for self-cleaning ovens. The Department received no data that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that insulation could be improved beyond the baseline level for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-cleaning ovens. In addition, any further reductions in vent size were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed to jeopardize both oven safety and cooking performance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department did not receive any energy-use or cost data concerning the halogen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lamp and steam cooking design options, thus preventing them from being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed for electric ovens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Costing Analysis of Design Options for Residential Appliances and Space Conditioning Equipment,'' Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, prepared by ADM Associates, Inc., Purchase No. 4541710, December 1987, ``Energy Efficient Electrical Product Knowledge Base,'' Canadian Electrical Association, prepared by ORTECH International, C.E.A.

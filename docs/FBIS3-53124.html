			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Khatib] </F>   [Text] Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman of the Hamas  Movement, has said that the first meeting of the central command  of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] will be held in  Damascus on 19 January 1994.    The APF was officially set up last week after its factions  agreed on its political and organizational program.    Ghawshah rejected the argument that Hamas has conceded its  demand for a 40 percent share of the alliance's central  establishments. In answer to a question by AL-ASWAQ, he said:  We, in Hamas, have declared from the beginning that we are  committed to the formula of the 10 factions, considering this  formula as the minimum acceptable by the Palestinian forces  opposed to a settlement with the Zionist entity.    Ghawshah added: The formula that was approved is more  advanced than that of the 10 factions although it is less than  the one we were hoping for. In view of the insistence of some  brothers in some factions on this formula, we decided to approve  this formula after some members admitted that it is a phased  formula, and that representation according to the size of each  faction is necessary, but at later stages.    Ghawshah stressed that the reconstruction of the PLO  establishments on democratic bases will take into consideration  the size and strength of each faction after agreeing on the  yardsticks for deciding size and strength.    Asked about the Hamas position on the Fatah Movement calls  for a comprehensive national dialogue, which Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi was assigned to conduct, Ghawshah said: After  reading the results of Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi's recent visit to  Tunis, one feels the pessimism regarding the negative results  achieved by his delegation. According to our estimates, these  results had been expected.    Ghawshah added: The pragmatic Tunis leadership tried two  months ago to send [Fatah Central Committee member] Hani  al-Hasan to conduct a dialogue with the Palestinian opposition  forces, but he did not succeed. Now Yasir 'Arafat is trying to  send Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi to carry out the same role played by Hani  al-Hasan, particularly after the setting up of the APF.    Ghawshah urged Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi not to embark on his  mission, which is doomed to failure after his call for  democratic reform fell on deaf ears. He urged 'Abd-al-Shafi to  take the side of the popular Palestinian fold, now represented  by the APF, which has clearly declared its forthcoming political  tasks. Ghawshah added that meeting with 'Abd-al-Shafi and  conducting dialogue with him depends on the approval of the 10  factions.</p>

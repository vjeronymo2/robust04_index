			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / State of the Art: The verbiage of creativity that is. . .mad, bad and dangerous to use - Architecture / Post-moderism was invented by architects hanging on to history as a result of the destruction of much of the past during the 1960s AT THE top of the high-tech headquarters of Lloyd's in London is a board room designed by the 18th century architect Robert Adam, bought by Lloyd's to provide an appropriately classical setting for their Council's deliberations. At the top of the brand new hotel in Canary Wharf is a set of conference rooms designed and furnished in the style of the 18th century cabinet maker Thomas Chippendale. At the top of the massive modern office blocks at Broadgate there are bankers' dining rooms and director's offices furnished as though they were occupied by Cotswold squires about to emulate the activities depicted in the hunting prints on the walls. Earlier this year I had breakfast at the New York apartment of a successful currency dealer whose fortune is made by the speedy working of communications technology. The elevator arrived in a Louis Quinze entrance hall and we ate as though we were in an English country house, surrounded by Paul de Lamerie silver and 18th century portraits. Down the road on Madison Avenue, is a major office building designed by one of America's leading architects, Philip Johnson, originally as the headquarters of the telecommunications giant, AT &amp; T and now occupied by the even more technocratic Japanese company Sony. It has a grand classical entrance hall with an arched golden ceiling and the building hits the New York skyline with a giant broken pediment worthy of ancient Rome. It is known as the Chippendale building because it happily reminds New Yorkers of an 18th century tallboy. What is going on? Why is so much recent architecture still hanging on to history with its finger nails. What happened in the second half of the 20th century that made the apparently solid foundations of modern, functional architecture quiver and shake with historical uncertainty? The virus that infected the body of contemporary architecture and changed it forever is a phenomenon known as post-modernism. Many people use this term in fields of creation other than architecture: but it is to architecture that the term has become firmly stuck. The simple definition of modern architecture was the one liner coined by the Bauhaus boys: 'form follows function.' I suppose the simple one liner for post modernism must be: 'form follows fiction.' Since the end of the 1950s those architects who can be classified as post-modernists have designed buildings that pay some homage to both the recent past and to a much more distant past. A post-modern building (a good example is the Sainsbury Wing in London by the American architects, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott-Brown) combines the spatial planning wizardry that architects have learned from the International Modern Movement with a sometimes quixotic use of traditional sources. Part of the point of post modernism is the fact that it acknowledges some of the technological advantages of modernism while adding elements to the architectural design that are familiar and based on historical sources. Why do we seem to need the comfort of the past and the familiar? What is it that makes an important international high-tech computer company from Texas decide to make its British headquarters in a group of buildings Richmond that are new but resemble an 18th century palace, a Palladian pavilion and a Venetian Gothic villa? Why is it that at Euro-Disney and Disney World all the buildings have to resemble something else? There are hotels in the shape of swans, diners in the shape of dolphins and a hotel with a classical pediment supported by the seven dwarfs. At Disney it is not the internationally famous architects who really design the buildings but the teams of Disney animators and 'imagineers'. Why does Euro-Disney need to bring to Europe an American version of a romantic Sleeping Beauty castle when France is full of examples of the real thing? It is as though in our post-modern world, when our eyes are conditioned by television and video, we can no longer believe reality. We have to be served with a selection of historical fragments, artfully arranged to provide an elementary illusion of the real thing. I suspect that the real reasons for the invention of post-modernism and the token revival of history that it briefly provided are twofold. One is the need for a sense of comfort brought on by our unhappiness at the rapid destruction of so much of the past in the development booms of the 1960s and 1980s. The other is bad reason I suspect is only too true: cynical intellectual idleness on the part of a poorly educated architectural profession. History has not been well taught in architectural schools for the best part of half a century. A profession that dimly sensed the public disaffection with modern tower blocks, cities raped by motorways and crude out-of-scale developments, reached out for fragments of history to make their creations more palatable. The result is a rash of pedimented office blocks and false facades that barely conceal the routine ordinariness of the commercial spaces behind. Just take a look at the Bishopsgate end of the Broadgate development in the City of London where we witness a giant Wurlitzer of styles applied to a steel frame series of office boxes. The public senses something is wrong but they are equally uninformed about the past and so appear to be content to swallow travesties and jokes that are both slight and hollow. I used to think that post-modernism in architecture was an important transition from the worst aridities of naked modernism to a possible revival of ornament, richness and decoration. Sadly, that has not happened and the few good post-modern buildings are isolated in a sea of mediocre Disney-style jokes. Post-modernism has shown that there is no satisfaction in an effortless, superficial styling that pretends to understand history. Real architecture is difficult and complex and satisfying in its resolution of problems according to a set of rules. Post modernism broke the rules and appeared to abandon social improvement function and form. It certainly demonstrated the lack of any common language and in a world where anything goes threw architectural standards to the winds. It is any wonder that we cling to our architectural roots in the hope that some reality remains in a world of cynical illusions?</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONDON DECLARATION: 'WALLS THAT ONCE CONFINED PEOPLE, IDEAS ARE COLLAPSING'  </P> <P> Following is the text of the London Declaration on a Transformed North Atlantic  Alliance issued by heads of state and government participating in the meeting  here July 5-6 of the North Atlantic Council:  </P> <P> 1. Europe has entered a new, promising era. Central and Eastern Europe is  liberating itself. The Soviet Union has embarked on the long journey toward a  free society. The walls that once confined people and ideas are collapsing.  Europeans are determining their own destiny. They are choosing freedom. They  are choosing economic liberty. They are choosing peace. They are choosing a  Europe whole and free. As a consequence, this alliance must and will adapt.  </P> <P> 2. The North Atlantic Alliance has been the most successful defensive alliance  in history. As our alliance enters its fifth decade and looks ahead to a new  century, it must continue to provide for the common defense. This alliance has  done much to bring about the new Europe. No one, however, can be certain of the  future. We need to keep standing together, to extend the long peace we have  enjoyed these past four decades. Yet our alliance must be even more an agent of  change. It can help build the structures of a more united continent, supporting  security and stability with the strength of our shared faith in democracy, the  rights of the individual, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We reaffirm  that security and stability do not lie solely in the military dimension, and we  intend to enhance the political component of our alliance as provided for by  Article 2 of our Treaty.  </P> <P> 3. The unification of Germany means that the division of Europe is also being  overcome. A united Germany in the Atlantic Alliance of free democracies and  part of the growing political and economic integration of the European  Community will be an indispensable factor of stability, which is needed in the  heart of Europe. The move within the European Community towards political  union, including the development of a European identity in the domain of  security, will also contribute to Atlantic solidarity and to the establishment  of a just and lasting order of peace throughout the whole of Europe.  </P> <P> 4. We recognize that, in the new Europe, the security of every state is  inseparably linked to the security of its neighbors. NATO must become an  institution where Europeans, Canadians and Americans work together not only for  the common defense, but to build new partnerships with all the nations of  Europe. The Atlantic Community must reach out to the countries of the East,  which were our adversaries in the Cold War, and extend to them the hand of  friendship.  </P> <P> 5. We will remain a defensive alliance and will continue to defend all the  territory of all of our members. We have no aggressive intentions and we commit  ourselves to the peaceful resolution of all disputes. We will never in any  circumstances be the first to use force.  </P> <P> 6. The member states of the North Atlantic Alliance propose to the member  states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization a joint declaration in which we  solemnly state that we are no longer adversaries and reaffirm our intention to  refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or  political independence of any state, or from acting in any other manner  inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and  with the CSCE (the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe)  Final Act. We invite all other CSCE member states to join us in this commitment  to nonaggression.  </P> <P> 7. In that spirit, and to reflect the changing political role of the alliance,  we today invited President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev on behalf of the Soviet  Union, and representatives of the other Central and Eastern European countries  to come to Brussels and address the North Atlantic Council. We today also  invite the governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Czech  and Slovak Federal Republic, the Hungarian Republic, the Republic of Poland,  the People's Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to come to NATO, not just to  visit, but to establish regular diplomatic liaison with NATO. This will make it  possible for us to share with them our thinking and deliberations in this  historic period of change.  </P> <P> 8. Our alliance will do its share to overcome the legacy of decades of  suspicion. We are ready to intensify military contacts, including those of NATO  military commanders, with Moscow and other Central and Eastern European  capitals.  </P> <P> 9. We welcome the invitation to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner to visit  Moscow and meet with Soviet leaders.  </P> <P> 10. Military leaders from throughout Europe gathered earlier this year in  Vienna to talk about their forces and doctrine. NATO proposes another such  meeting this Autumn to promote common understanding. We intend to establish an  entirely different quality of openness in Europe, including an agreement on  "Open Skies."  </P> <P> 11. The significant presence of North American conventional and U.S. nuclear  forces in Europe demonstrates the underlying political compact that binds North  America's fate to Europe's democracies. But, as Europe changes, we must  profoundly alter the way we think about defense.  </P> <P> 12. To reduce our military requirements, sound arms control agreements are  essential. That is why we put the highest priority on completing this year the  first treaty to reduce and limit conventional armed forces in Europe (CFE)  along with the completion of a meaningful CSBM (confidence-building measures)  package. These talks should remain in continuous session until the work is  done. Yet we hope to go further. We propose that, once a CFE Treaty is signed,  follow-on talks should begin with the same membership and mandate, with the  goal of building on the current agreement with additional measures, including  measures to limit manpower in Europe. With this goal in mind, a commitment will  be given at the time of signature of the CFE Treaty concerning the manpower  levels of a unified Germany.  </P> <P> 13. Our objective will be to conclude the negotiations on the follow-on to CFE  and CSBMs as soon as possible and looking to the follow-up meeting of the CSCE  to be held in Helsinki in 1992. We will seek through new conventional arms  control negotiations, within the CSCE framework, further far-reaching measures  in the 1990s to limit the offensive capability of conventional armed forces in  Europe, so as to prevent any nation from maintaining disproportionate military  power on the Continent. NATO's High Level Task Force will formulate a detailed  position for these follow-on conventional arms control talks. We will make  provisions as needed for different regions to redress disparities and to ensure  that no one's security is harmed at any stage. Furthermore, we will continue to  explore broader arms control and confidence-building opportunities. This is an  ambitious agenda, but it matches our goal: enduring peace in Europe.  </P> <P> 14. As Soviet troops leave Eastern Europe and a treaty limiting conventional  armed forces is implemented, the alliance's integrated force structure and its  strategy will change fundamentally to include the following elements:  </P> <P> NATO will field smaller and restructured active forces. These forces will be  highly mobile and versatile so that Allied leaders will have maximum  flexibility in deciding how to respond to a crisis. It will rely increasingly  on multinational corps made up of national units.  </P> <P> NATO will scale back the readiness of its active units, reducing training  requirements and the number of exercises.  </P> <P> NATO will rely more heavily on the ability to build up larger forces if and  when they might be needed.  </P> <P> 15. To keep the peace, the alliance must maintain for the foreseeable future an  appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces, based in Europe, and kept  up to date where necessary. But, as a defensive alliance, NATO has always  stressed that none of its weapons will ever be used except in self-defense and  that we seek the lowest and most stable level of nuclear forces needed to  secure the prevention of war.  </P> <P> 16. The political and military changes in Europe, and the prospects of further  changes, now allow the Allies concerned to go further. They will thus modify  the size and adapt the tasks of their nuclear deterrent forces. They have  concluded that, as a result of the new political and military conditions in  Europe, there will be a significantly reduced role for sub-strategic nuclear  systems of the shortest range. They have decided specifically that, once  negotiations begin on short-range nuclear forces, the alliance will propose, in  return for reciprocal action by the Soviet Union, the elimination of all its  nuclear artillery shells from Europe.  </P> <P> 17. New negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the  reduction of short-range nuclear forces should begin shortly after a CFE  agreement is signed. The Allies concerned will develop an arms control  framework for these negotiations which takes into account our requirements for  far fewer nuclear weapons, and the diminished need for sub-strategic nuclear  systems of the shortest range.  </P> <P> 18. Finally, with the total withdrawal of Soviet stationed forces and the  implementation of a CFE agreement, the Allies can reduce their reliance on  nuclear weapons. These will continue to fulfill an essential role in the  overall strategy of the alliance to prevent war by ensuring that there are no  circumstances in which nuclear retaliation in response to military action might  be discounted. However, in the transformed Europe, they will be able to adopt a  new NATO strategy making nuclear forces truly weapons of last resort.  </P> <P> 19. We approve the mandate given in Turnberry to the North Atlantic Council in  Permanent Session to oversee the ongoing work on the adaptation of the alliance  to the new circumstances. It should report its conclusions as soon as possible.  </P> <P> 20. In the context of these revised plans for defense and arms control, and  with the advice of NATO military authorities and all member states concerned,  NATO will prepare a new allied military strategy moving away from "forward  defense," where appropriate, towards a reduced forward presence and modifying  "flexible response" to reflect a reduced reliance on nuclear weapons. In that  connection, NATO will elaborate new force plans consistent with the  revolutionary changes in Europe. NATO will also provide a forum for allied  consultations on the upcoming negotiations on short-range nuclear forces.  </P> <P> 21. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) should become  more prominent in Europe's future, bringing together the countries of Europe  and North America. We support a CSCE summit later this year in Paris which  would include the signature of a CFE agreement and would set new standards for  the establishment, and preservation, of free societies. It should endorse,  inter alia:  </P> <P> CSCE principles on the right to free and fair elections  </P> <P> CSCE commitments to respect and uphold the rule of law  </P> <P> CSCE guidelines for enhancing economic cooperation, based on the development of  free and competitive market economies; and  </P> <P> CSCE cooperation on environmental protection.  </P> <P> 22. We further propose that the CSCE summit in Paris decide how the CSCE can be  institutionalized to provide a forum for wider political dialogue in a more  united Europe. We recommend that CSCE governments establish:  </P> <P> a program for regular consultations among member governments at the Heads of  State and Government or ministerial level, at least once each year, with other  periodic meetings of officials to prepare for and follow up on these  consultations;  </P> <P> a schedule of CSCE review conferences once every two years to assess progress  toward a Europe whole and free;  </P> <P> a small CSCE secretariat to coordinate these meetings and conferences;  </P> <P> a CSCE mechanism to monitor elections in all the CSCE countries, on the basis  of the Copenhagen document  </P> <P> a CSCE Center for the Prevention of Conflict that might serve as a forum for  exchanges of military information, discussion of unusual military activities,  and the conciliation of disputes involving CSCE member states; and  </P> <P> a CSCE parliamentary body, the Assembly of Europe, to be based on the existing  parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, in Strasbourg, and include  representatives of all CSCE member states.  </P> <P> The sites of these new institutions should reflect the fact that the newly  democratic countries of Central and Eastern Europe form part of the political  structures of the new Europe.  </P> <P> 23. Today, our alliance begins a major transformation. Working with all the  countries of Europe, we are determined to create enduring peace on this  Continent.  </P></p>

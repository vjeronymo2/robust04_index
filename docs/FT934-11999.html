			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sara Lee earnings increase 9% SARA LEE, the Chicago-based consumer products company, yesterday reported a 9 per cent rise in underlying first-quarter net income to Dollars 155m, excluding the impact of accounting changes. Including accounting charges of Dollars 35m, or 76 cents a share, Sara Lee earned Dollars 120m in the quarter, or 23 cents, compared with Dollars 142m, or 27 cents, a year earlier. Sales advanced 6 per cent to Dollars 3.8bn from Dollars 3.58bn. Sara Lee, whose brand names include Hanes, L'eggs and Dim, said operating profits from its personal products division rose 2 per cent to Dollars 140m on sales up 5 per cent to Dollars 1.61bn. The group said markets were depressed in Europe and hosiery profits declined in the US. Acquisitions helped support operating results. Operating profits on the household and personal care side climbed 38 per cent to Dollars 29m, although sales rose only 5 per cent to Dollars 352m. Results were swollen by the acquisitions of SmithKline Beecham's personal care operations and two brands - Endust and Behold - from SC Johnson Wax. The group said it also benefited from stronger sales of higher margin 'core items'. On the food side, operating profits from the packaged meats and bakery division rose 21 per cent to Dollars 62m on sales up 13 per cent at Dollars 1.34bn. Excluding acquisitions, unit volume for packaged meats rose 3 per cent in the quarter.</p>

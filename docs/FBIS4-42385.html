			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- The plutonium discovered in  Baden-Wuerttemberg in May and which is suitable for the  construction of a nuclear bomb, seems to have come from Moscow,  according to German intelligence services. As DPA learned on  Friday [3 June] from well-informed sources, the plutonium  arrived in Germany by "a roundabout route." From the Russian  capital it was first brought to Hungary and Switzerland. So  far, no further details are known.    The highly radioactive heavy metal was discovered on 10 May  during the search of the apartment of a businessman in Tengen  near Konstanz in the course of investigating a case of money  laundering. The businessman is in detention pending trial.  Experts say that this is the first case of smuggling  weapons-grade plutonium that has been uncovered in Germany.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 26 YOUNG INMATES SUBDUED AFTER 20-MINUTE FIGHT  </P> <P> Simmering racial tensions between Asian and Latino prisoners at a  minimum-security California Youth Authority facility in the Antelope Valley  boiled over into a full-scale battle Thursday night when more than 26 inmates  fought for nearly 20 minutes before they were subdued by authorities.  </P> <P> Supt. Steve Shaw said most of the Asian and Latino inmates at Camp Fenner, a  minimum-security work camp in Llano, were involved in the fight, which was  waged with mops, brooms and sticks.  </P> <P> Shaw said four prisoners were treated at hospitals for injuries received in the  incident.  </P> <P> The disturbance, which broke out shortly before 9 p.m., stemmed from a racially  motivated fight earlier in the day, he said.  </P> <P> Camp Fenner houses 125 juvenile offenders who are between the ages of 18 and  25.  </P></p>

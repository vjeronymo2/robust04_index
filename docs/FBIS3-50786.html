Cardenas made his statement when visiting Ruben Lenero  and Magdalena de las Salinas Hospitals during the celebration on  Nurses Day. Cardenas also said that instead of being concerned  about electoral strategies, we must seek a political solution to  the conflict in Chiapas and prevent any further loss of human  life.    [Begin Cardenas recording] Regardless of what your electoral  preferences may be, regardless of your sympathies for the sides  in the conflict, you are not the one directly involved in what  is going on. We have to call on both sides to create the  opportunity to suspend the hostilities. We need to seek  political negotiations, because this is a political conflict,  which emerges from the application of failed policies. We hope  a solution may be found. [end recording]    Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said whether or not the uprising in  Chiapas is promoted by Indians, the lives of Mexican people are  being lost, and this must be stopped. The PRD presidential  candidate said the three Chiapas bishops have the best chance of  being heard by those involved in the conflict. He said he hopes  the participation of the bishops could stop the bloodshed. The  PRD presidential candidate also said he will not change his  campaign program, adding that within the next three months he  will be going to Chiapas State.</p>

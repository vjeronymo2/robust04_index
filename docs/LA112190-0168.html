			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> RICK JAMES RECOVERS FROM FALL  </P> <P> Soul-funk singer Rick James was recovering today after a fall Tuesday night  from the stage at a Hollywood night club during a benefit concert.  </P> <P> James was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and released after he was  treated for cuts and bruises, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> According to one witness at the China Club, James had climbed onto a  loudspeaker to dance and then fell backward into a space between the stage and  the club's VIP section.  </P> <P> The spectators were "totally freaking out, people were screaming, going in all  directions" after James fell, the witness said.  </P> <P> The rest of last night's concert was canceled after the accident.  </P> <P> James is probably best known for his 1981 hit "Super Freak," but reached the  charts three years earlier with the song "You and I."  </P></p>

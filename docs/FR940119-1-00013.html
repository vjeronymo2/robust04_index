			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Special conditions are proposed for the functions and operations of the parachute recovery system. These requirements would ensure the following: (a) There is no fire hazard associated with the system, (b) the system has adequate reliability, (c) the sequence of arming and activating the system will prevent inadvertent deployment, (d) the system can be activated from either the pilot's or the copilot's position by various sized people, (e) the system will be labeled to show its identification function and operating limitations, and (f) if must be shown that the occupants will be protected from serious injury after touchdown under various adverse weather conditions, including high winds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions are proposed for protection of the parachute recovery system. These requirements would ensure that the system is protected from deterioration due to weathering, corrosion, abrasion, and other causes; and that provisions are made to the parachute canister to provide adequate ventilation and drainage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions are proposed for a system inspection provision. These requirements would ensure that adequate means are available to permit examination of the parachute recovery system components and that instructions for continued airworthiness are provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions are proposed for the operating limitations of the parachute recovery system. These requirements would ensure that the system operating limitations are prescribed for inspecting, repacking, and replacing the system's parachute and deployment mechanism at approved intervals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has considered the features proposed by Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc., for the GARD installation in the primary, normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes and has concluded that special conditions should be proposed for such systems to provide the necessary level of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84

Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Secs. 313(a), 601, and 603 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958; as amended (49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1421, and 1423); 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR

PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes the following special conditions as a part of the type certification basis for primary, normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes modified to incorporate parachute recovery systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flight test demonstration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (a) The system must be demonstrated in flight to satisfactorily perform its intended function, without exceeding the system deployment limit load factors, for the critical flight conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Satisfactory deployment of the parachute must be demonstrated, at the most critical airplane weight and balance, for the following flight conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For airplanes_(1) Power off stall with slow entry, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Spin with deployment at one turn, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Maneuvering speed with 0g normal load, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Never exceed speed with 1g normal load. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In addition, for acrobatic airplanes_during inverted flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Occupant restraint. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Each seat in an airplane modified with the parachute recovery system must be equipped with a restraint system, consisting of a seat belt and shoulder harness, that will protect the occupants from head and upper torso injuries during parachute deployment and ground impact at the critical load conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Parachute performance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (a) The parachute must comply with the applicable requirements of TSO&hyph;C23c, or an approved equivalent, for the critical airplane weights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The system limit load factor for deployment must not exceed 80 percent of the airplane ultimate load factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) It must be shown that, although the airplane structure may be damaged, the airplane impact during touchdown will result in an occupant environment in which serious injury to the occupants is improbable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) It must be shown that, with the parachute deployed, the airplane can impact the ground in various adverse weather conditions, including winds up to 15 knots, without endangering the airplane occupants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> System function and operations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (a) It must

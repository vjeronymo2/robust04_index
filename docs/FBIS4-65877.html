			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael J. Inacker: "Signal From Karlsruhe for </F> Bundeswehr Missions Abroad"]    [Text] Bonn -- In the future, the Bundeswehr will be able  to participate in international missions abroad without any  restrictions. According to information obtained by WELT AM  SONNTAG, it is expected that the Federal Constitutional Court  will approve the participation of German armed forces in  peacekeeping and peacemaking (combat) missions.    This assessment is based on findings by legal experts close  to the Constitutional Court. A corresponding decision is  expected in late June.    According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, this  assessment is derived from an analysis of the course of the  hearing at the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe to date and the  questions by the judges in the hearings on 19 and 20 April on  the complaints by the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and Free  Democratic Party Bundestag groups against German participation  in the monitoring of the UN embargo against Serbia, the AWACS  monitoring of the Yugoslav airspace, and the now concluded  German Somalia mission. It is said that the way in which the  hearings are conducted by the constitutional judges permits the  conclusion that the issue no longer is whether a future German  participation should be permitted, but only procedural questions.    The lawsuit is pending at the Second Panel of the  Constitutional Court, to which two SPD members belong -- namely  former Berlin Justice Senator Jutta Limbach as president and  legal expert Ernst-Wolfgang Boeckenfoerde.    The juridical assessment of the expected ruling, which was  also conveyed to the Federal Government, is based on the  following factors:    -- The Constitutional Court dealt only briefly with the  question whether the contents of the Basic Law generally permit  Bundeswehr missions.    -- In contrast, the questions asked by the constitutional  judges during the hearings on 19 and 20 April dealt almost  exclusively with mere procedural issues. Thus, it was discussed  heatedly whether the Federal Government can decide on a foreign  mission on its own or whether it requires approval by the  parliament. In particular concerning the requirement of  approval, the court did extensive historical research on the  development of the Basic Law in order to be able to make  deductions about the need of parliamentary decisions for foreign  policy actions by the state ("parliamentary reservation").    However, since, as legal experts say, parliamentary  reservations exist only for things that are basically permitted  by the constitution, during the hearing the Constitutional Court  obviously no longer discussed the legality of a state act as  such but only the form of authorization. Therefore, it is to be  assumed that, in the view of the Karlsruhe court, the Bundeswehr  may participate in UN combat missions abroad.    In Bonn, however, it is expected that in its ruling, the  Constitutional Court will set down some sort of "parliamentary  reservation" for Bundeswehr missions abroad.    This reservation will probably not be a two-thirds majority,  because this would endanger the ability of the respective  government majority to act, but only an absolute majority, the  so-called chancellor's majority. According to information  obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, conservative Social Democrats would  welcome such a ruling by Karlsruhe, because this is the only way  they see to change their own party's decision against UN combat  missions.</p>

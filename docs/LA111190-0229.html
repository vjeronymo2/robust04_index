			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWAGHOLDER SIMPLIFIES WINDOW TREATMENTS  </P> <P> A decorative window pouf can be quickly make with just a scrap of fabric using  Kirsch's new Tulip Swagholder.  </P> <P> Simple hemmed panels also can be formed into rosettes, bows, hearts, shells and  other forms, then used singly or in groups and with rods or poles to create  window treatments with a minimum of fabric.  </P> <P> They can be mounted inside or outside window frames, on walls or even the  ceiling. The hardware comes with instructions for creating different looks;  Kirsch says anyone who can tie a bow can master the Swagholder.  </P></p>

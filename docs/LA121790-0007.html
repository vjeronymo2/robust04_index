			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILINGUAL EDUCATION  </P> <P> How many languages does he suggest we teach in? Offhand, we have large  populations of Latinos (of several countries), Vietnamese, Chinese, Armenians,  Russians, etc.  </P> <P> Where do we get the money for these bilingual programs since we are already in  a severe budgetary crisis?  </P> <P> Finally, how did the masses who immigrated here at the turn of the century get  by? At that time we had many Polish, German, Yiddish, Italian-speaking people  come to our shores. They managed to learn English and prosper without special  programs.  </P> <P> I think the answer may be in the fact that those turn-of-the-century immigrants  were dedicated to becoming Americans and learning our language. Our newest  immigrants' hearts and minds still live in the country they left instead of  America.  </P> <P> Surely they can preserve their culture and still learn English so they can get  an eduction.  </P> <P> DAVID J. JOHNSON, Los Alamitos  </P></p>

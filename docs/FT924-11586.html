			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Coffee price rally back in gear THE COFFEE market engaged forward gear again this week after consolidating the substantial gains achieved at the beginning of the month. At the London Futures and Options Exchange the January robustas contract was yesterday pushed through the psychologically important Dollars 900-a-tonne level to close at an eight-month high of Dollars 903 a tonne, up Dollars 47 on the week. Prices were down in both London and New York on Monday but the following day saw technically-inspired gains in New York's arabica market help London's robusta contract to regain its recent six-month high of Dollars 868 a tonne in the January position. That milestone was quickly passed as traders enjoyed what one called 'a total turnround in market sentiment'. That was attributed chiefly to the smaller crop in Brazil, the biggest producer, which last week said it had exported only 1m bags (60 kg each) in September, compared with 1.6m in September 1991. Resistance appeared on Thursday when the Dollars 900 was approached, but as that level was breached yesterday a few stop-loss buying orders were triggered and the January price moved on to Dollars 905 a tonne. Long-liquidation pushed it below Dollars 900 again, but the buyers were not to be out-done and soon had it back close to the highs. The changed mood of the market was well illustrated by one dealer's comment to the Reuter news agency yesterday. 'We could see a 2 or 3 cent setback (equivalent to Dollars 44 to Dollars 66 a tonne),' he said, 'but it would be good for the market; we'd get rid of some short-term longs and then we could build again.' This optimism has even extended to expectations of the next round of talks on renegotiating the International Coffee Agreement, scheduled for the end of next month. The achievements of talks held so far have been far from impressive - the kindest thing one New York analyst could find to say at the conclusion of the September round was: 'At least they (producer and consumer delegates) didn't strangle each other like they did in July'. But one London trader suggested this week that the recent price recovery might encourage delegates to redouble their efforts to thrash out an accord. 'They won't want to let go the ground we have gained under such difficult circumstances,' he said. Cocoa prices also made good ground, with London's March futures position gaining Pounds 29 on the week to Pounds 709 a tonne. The upturn began on Monday, helped by the pound's weakness, but the key development was a 'chart reversal' in New York on Monday night. Dealers noted that the advance was being held back by 'scale-up selling' but thought the market was 'in for a good run' once that dried up. 'It looks like the manufacturers have probably bought from the trade more (Ivory Coast cocoa) than currently seems to be available,' one said yesterday. The Ivory Coast is the biggest producer but has recently been holding back supplies from the market. The annual London Metal Exchange Week began pretty dismally with copper dipping on Monday to a 4 1/2 -month low, zinc to an eight-month low and aluminium to a nine-month low. Nickel, meanwhile, was uncomfortably close to a 31-month low. By last night's close the only LME metal showing a gain on the week was copper - up Pounds 31.50 at Pounds 1,383 a tonne for cash - and that was entirely due to sterling's decline against the US dollar. The week's most substantial decline was in cash zinc, which fell by Dollars 31.50 to Dollars 1,109 a tonne as flagging sentiment was further undermined by Chinese liquidation. Tin was another big loser, cash metal ending Dollars 77.50 down at Dollars 5,877.50 a tonne. But perhaps the most disappointing performer was aluminium. Early in the week news of a 600-tonne rise in average daily output between August and September, which came as no surprise, was outweighed by bullish technical factors. But the rise later in the week that followed an announcement by VAW, the German metals group, that it was cutting its aluminium output by 105,000 tonnes to about 300,000 tonnes a year was quickly snuffed out by long liquidation. The LME announced yesterday that stocks of aluminium in its registered warehouses had grown by another 16,375 tonnes, which underlined the need for further substantial production cuts to bring the market back into balance, at least in the short term.  ---------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------- Aluminium     +16,375    to    1,411,075 Copper         +2,075    to      307,150 Lead             -300    to      181,475 Nickel         +1,374    to       55,080 Zinc           +1,150    to      377,575 Tin               -20    to       14,720  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

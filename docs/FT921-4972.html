			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: BIL confident despite 48% decline BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and trading group, yesterday reported a 48 per cent fall in net profits to NZDollars 90.48m (USDollars 49.4m) in the first half to December from NZDollars 175.18m a year earlier. However, Mr Paul Collins, chief executive, said the group was at a 'turning point' and more confident about its future than at any time in the past four years. During the period the company's debt fell to under NZDollars 1bn from NZDollars 4bn as a result of sales of long-term assets such as Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn, the UK car dealership, to Inchcape. He said that BIL, most of whose assets were in the UK, was 'through the worst' with its investments in such companies as Mount Charlotte, the UK hotel group, and its 23 per cent stake in Budgen, the UK supermarket group. Its other UK investments in United Scientific and GPG were doing well. Most of its New Zealand investments were performing much more strongly, and some of these investments could be partially refloated to take advantage of revitalised interest in equities. Mr Collins said that earnings for the restructured group were more comparable with the NZDollars 36.54m earned in the second half of last year. The result included an exceptional loss of NZDollars 21m on its investment in Magnum Corporation, the New Zealand based liquor group. BIL was committed to seeing a profit turnround in Magnum. However, BIL also announced an unexpected 'exceptional' loss of NZDollars 17m after writing down 4 cents a share to 6 cents on its shareholding in property group Ariadne, due to the protracted downturn in the sector in Australia. Mr Collins said that the improvements in earnings of subsidiaries came from a reduction in loss-making operations, increased efficiencies, a lower cost base and more competitive exchange and interest rates rather than increased sales. BIL was now well positioned to benefit from any upturn in domestic activity through a much higher conversion rate to profit. Benefits of restructuring Air New Zealand, its 42 per cent owned associate were readily apparent with a half-year profit of NZDollars 56m. Mr Collins defended the sale of Tozer for Pounds 393.5m (Dollars 692.56m) following payment of dividend and other agreed payments to Inchcape. He said a Pounds 46m profit was achieved, and there were few other possible buyers apart from Lonrho, which was unacceptable to the Japanese motor companies. Mount Charlotte Hotels, the largest hotelier in London, produced a full-year profit of Pounds 1.5m compared with Pounds 29.1m. 'While the result is disappointing it represents an exceptional achievement in the most difficult year in the UK hotel industry since 1960,' Mr Collins said. The trading profit of Pounds 72.6m, down from Pounds 99.3m, was 'streets ahead of its competitors', representing a 32 per cent return on sales. He said forward orders for the summer and autumn periods were well ahead of 1991. It was a reflection of the value of other assets that BIL would absorb a NZDollars 180m interest cost on holding Mount Charlotte and still achieve an increased profit in 1991-92. The directors are increasing the interim dividend to 8 cents a share from 4 cents.</p>

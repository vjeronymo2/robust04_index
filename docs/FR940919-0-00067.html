			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Commenters objected to the proposed levels and provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment data for only two metal limits, chromium and mercury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency revised the proposed treatment standards for chromium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and mercury as described later in this section. For the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UTS metal constituents the Agency promulgated standards as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For four of these metals beryllium, thallium, vanadium and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zinc, the previous standards limited the metal at one level,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which was proposed and promulgated for UTS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For four other metals, antimony, cadmium, nickel and silver,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency proposed and promulgated the UTS level at the highest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the previous standards. This occurred based on the best data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the most difficult to treat wastes. Commenters did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit new data supporting lower limits for these constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the limits for some waste codes are raised, EPA considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A broader assessment of the treatment data;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Some of the low/previous metal standards simply reflected low levels in the untreated wastes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Regulation of other metals for a waste code, namely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those that are present in significantly high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations, will control design and operations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the remaining four metals, arsenic, barium, lead and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selenium, the Agency did not propose or promulgate the UTS at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest previous standard. Commenters did not submit data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these metals. The justification for rejecting lower levels are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same as those presented for antimony, cadmium, nickel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> silver in the preceeding discussion. For these metals, EPA did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not choose the highest previous standard; rather, the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the most difficult to treat waste was selected and it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved a lower standard than the highest previous standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above consideration, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered matrix effects. In setting the nonwastewater metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits, EPA has examined the most difficult to treat wastes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, if a matrix relationship exists, other wastes should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more easily meet the limits. If there exists a waste that can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not meet the limits, the Agency has a treatability variance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process to address those instances. It appears that HTMR is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matrix independent, consistently achieving the same level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment performance as measured in the residuals, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the influent matrix composition. With regard to matrix effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on stabilization, adjustments to the type and quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stabilizing agents can greatly compensate for matrix effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The UTS standard for chromium (Total) was proposed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.33 mg/l in the TCLP extract based upon the K061&hyph;HTMR treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard data. One commenter (Occidental Chemical), objected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed limits and supplied stabilization data for chromium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They indicated through 85 data points that they could achieve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of 0.58 mg/kg. The Agency evaluated treatability data from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various sources, including Occidental Chemical and previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated waste codes. These evaluations compared analyses of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance data between untreated and treated concentrations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metal waste. From this treatability data the Agency selected the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most difficult to treat waste. It was determined that the waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria selected was submitted by Cyanokem for F006 during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation of the Third Third rule (June 1, 1990). This waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was a composition of stripping liquids, plating operations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pelletizing operations, and clean out wastes from plating tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data sets involving the most difficult to treat waste were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to calculate the limit of 0.86 mg/l TCLP. The other data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sets, including those from the comments, generally achieved the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.86 mg/l TCLP. The treatment results that did not meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels may be due to treatment being designed to only meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic levels. It is the Agency's belief that with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of a more effective stabilization process, a lower level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be achieved, as demonstrated by the fact that a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to treat waste attained the level of 0.86 mg/l TCLP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Agency is promulgating the treatment standard of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.86 mg/l TCLP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposed UTS for low mercury subcategory nonwastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (containing less than 260 mg/kg total mercury) at 0.009 mg/l  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCLP. Many commenters expressed concern over this standard. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has reconsidered the proposed UTS for mercury and is promulgating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards as follows: 0.200 mg/l TCLP for low subcategory retort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residues, and 0.025 mg/l TCLP for other low subcategory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonwastewaters. (The existing treatment standard for high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcategory mercury nonwastewaters (concentration greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 260 mg/kg) is already RMERC, i.e., recovery of mercury by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retorting or roasting. This treatment standard is unaffected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule.) Comments and EPA's responses are summarized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters expressed the belief that the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards for K106, D009, and K071 wastes should remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in effect. These commenters submitted data from the analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retorted mercury waste to support the claim that the proposed UTS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for mercury is not achievable by retorting, the recognized BDAT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for K106 and D009 wastes. These data consisted of total and TCLP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses of 109 residue samples from retorted K106 and D009  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes. Although 23 of these samples contained greater than 260  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg/kg total mercury and would therefore require further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retorting, of the remaining 86 samples, 18 contained greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.009 mg/l mercury by TCLP, the proposed UTS for mercury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonwastewaters. All 86 samples contained less than 0.15 mg/l  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mercury by TCLP. These data support the commenters' position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed UTS for mercury is not achievable by properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated BDAT treatment technology (e.g., RMERC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further examination of available data has convinced the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency that the proposed nonwastewater standard was too low. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for the proposed UTS for metal nonwastewaters, which was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data from the treatment of K061 by high temperature metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery (HTMR), is not appropriate for mercury wastes. K061  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste does not typically contain large quantities of mercury and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HTMR facilities do not accept wastes containing high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of mercury. EPA has therefore decided not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgate the proposed nonwastewater standards, and instead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply the existing treatment standards for K071, K106, P065,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P092, and U151 as the UTS for mercury nonwastewaters. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, since mercury is the most significant constituent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these wastes, and BDAT for these wastes is particularly directed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to treating mercury. The Agency continues to believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised limits for mercury and 12 other metal constituents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K061 provide adequate assurance that BDAT will occur for K061.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the universal treatment standards for low subcategory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mercury wastes will be 0.20 mg/l mercury by TCLP for retort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residue nonwastewaters, and 0.025 mg/l mercury by TCLP for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low subcategory nonwastewaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following table is a compilation of the final metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> universal standards for nonwastewaters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

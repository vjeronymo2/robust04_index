			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / TUC warns top companies about works councils As many as 59 of the top 100 UK companies will be legally compelled to establish European-level consultative committees for their workers on the Continent in spite of Britain's opt-out from the social chapter of the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, the TUC says today. The EU's draft directive on information and consultation in transnational companies will require companies employing at least 1,000 workers in other EU states and 100 or more in at least two of those states to negotiate European-wide arrangements if this is demanded by their employees or their representatives. The directive is expected to come into law in the second half of this year during the German presidency. In an estimate issued today by its EU-funded multinationals information project, the TUC concedes that none of the named companies will have any legal requirement to include British workers on the planned committees. But Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said yesterday that he expected British employers would extend consultation arrangements to their British workers. A number of the companies named by the TUC said they were awaiting the final passage of the works council directive before deciding what to do. They said they would comply with the law, and make up their minds later on whether to include British employees in the scope of any machinery they set up. The Confederation of British Industry last night accused the TUC of a 'blatant attempt to bounce UK companies into something they know very well would not work'. The FTSE companies listed by the TUC cover a range of activities. Those in the food, leisure and transport sector are Allied Lyons, Associated British Foods, Bass, BAT Industries, British Airways, British Petroleum, Burmah Castrol, Cadbury Schweppes, Forte, Granada Group, Grand Metropolitan, Great Universal Stores, Guinness, Inchape, Ladbroke Group, Marks and Spencer, Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, Reuters Holdings, Shell Transport and Trading, Scottish and Newcastle, and United Biscuits.

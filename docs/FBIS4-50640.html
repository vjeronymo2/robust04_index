			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, May 20 (XINHUA) -- The Asian Development  Bank (ADB) today approved a technical assistance grant of  600,000 U.S. dollars to China for the Chang Jiang (Yangtze  river) water and soil conservation and environment project.    The technical assistance will assist China in strengthening  its capability to manage and develop the upper and middle  reaches of the Chang Jiang basin in a economically viable and  environmentally sustainable way, the Manila-based bank said.    With the assistance, seminars and workshops will be held for  arousing greater awareness of environmental conservation among  officials from the nine provinces included within the upper and  middle reaches of the basin.    The technical assistance also will help reinforce linkages  among government ministries to strengthen the concept of  integrated basin management in order to achieve more effective  flood control and to optimize efforts in economic development  and environmental protection, said the ADB.</p>

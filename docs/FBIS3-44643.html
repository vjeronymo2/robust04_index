The circular touched on four aspects of enterprises listed  in  stock exchanges abroad, that is, the limits of and procedure for  assessing state-owned land assets, how to handle state-owned  land assets, the method and proportion of converting land-use  rights into stocks, and registration of changes in land-use  rights.    According to the stipulations, the work of assessing land  assets of all stock-experimenting enterprises established within  the territory and authorized to be listed in stock exchanges  abroad must be solely organized and conducted by the State Land  Administration Bureau. As far as the procedure of assessment is  concerned, enterprises or designated stock-holding units of  state-owned land assets must first apply for assessment and  submit relevant registration certificates on land-use rights use  to the authorities, and then enterprises must select one of the  assessment organizations recommended by the State Land  Administration Bureau to assess their land assets and results of  the assessment must be reported to the State Land Administration  Bureau for confirmation.    The circular provided for how to handle state-owned assets  of  stock-experimenting enterprises listed in stock exchanges  abroad: First, land-use rughts are priced and converted into  stocks. Land- use rights obtained by enterprises through  purchase are priced and converted into stocks, whereas land  assets are converted into legal- person stocks. Second, the  State leases land-use rights to stock enterprises and receives  appropriate rents. After obtaining land- use rights through  purchase, enterprises can lease land-use rights to stock  companies.    The circular also explicitly provided for the amount and  proportion of equity capital converted from the rights of using  state-owned land. The amount should not be less than the total  of examined and verified land assets divided by multiples of  stock premiums, and the proportion should not be less than the  proportion of total land assets to total state-owned assets of  stock enterprises.    The circular also stipulated that reorganized enterprises  listed in stock exchanges abroad can only apply to people's  government departments responsible for land administration at  and above the county level for changes in registration after  getting official written replies from the State Land  Administration on confirming the conversion of land assets into  stocks.</p>

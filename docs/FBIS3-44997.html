			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Late Talks in Bid to Halt </F> Textiles War"]    [Text] China and the United States are to hold a new round  of talks in Beijing on Saturday [15 January] in a bid to avert a  major trade war.    The talks have been scheduled before the U.S. acts on its  decision to slash import, quotas of Chinese textiles and clothes  "by 25-35 percent" from next Monday.    The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-operation (Moftec) revealed yesterday that this fourth round  of talks on the Sino-U.S. textile trade agreement would end the  same day.    But officials refused to comment on the talks in advance.    Analysts also declined to predict the outcome of the  last-ditch effort.    However, if the bid failed, they said the U.S. would reduce  some $1.2 billion worth of textile imports from China, which had  threatened to retaliate.    "It's not clear whether the two sides will make any  compromise to avert a more bruising trade conflict," one  observer said.    China on Monday urged the U.S. to reconsider its decision  and  to negotiate a solution.    It charged the U.S. with treading on the spirit of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and the  Multi-Fibre (international textiles) Arrangement [name of accord  as published] by unilaterally reducing Chinese imports last week.</p>

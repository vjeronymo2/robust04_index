			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A preliminary meeting for  forming a new political group was postponed indefinitely Tuesday  [31 May] after a report suggested the new group might serve as a  stage for a return to central politics by Hokkaido Gov.  Takahiro Yokomichi, officials said.    The meeting, which had been expected to be held Wednesday,  was to bring together members of a Social Democratic Party (SDP)  policy study group called "Democrats" and of a parliamentary  group consisting of new party Sakigage [Harbinger], the Group  Seiun and Minshu no Kaze (Democratic Wind).    The idea of forming the new political group, aimed at  seeking  a new direction by uniting democratic forces, was revealed by  Minshu no Kaze members on May 20.    However, plans were apparently derailed by a report in a  leading Japanese daily that Yokomichi was to be involved. The  MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported in its Monday evening edition that the  new political group to be formed by some 60 lower house members  in June had already asked Yokomichi to become a member.    The 53-year-old Yokomichi, who was elected four times to the  House of Representatives with SDP backing beginning in 1969, is  widely regarded as a likely leader of a new political group in  the event of further political realignment.    Yokomichi told a press conference in Sapporo, Hokkaido,  about  a week ago that he would not seek reelection as governor of the  northernmost main island next spring, promoting speculation that  he might return to national politics.    One of four Minshu no Kaze members, Yuichi Takami, denied he  had contacted Yokomichi on the issue, saying "we will wait until  the public excitement over the affair dies down" before forming  the group.    Political sources said the prospects that the group would  offer a stage for Yokomichi might be based on the close  relationship between the governor and another Minshu no Kaze  member Satoshi Arai who once served as head of the governor's  office in Hokkaido.    The four-member group Minshu no Kaze on Tuesday joined an  existing 18-member parliamentary group comprising new party  Sakigage and the Group Seiun.    Minshu no Kaze defected from the Japan New Party (JNP)  headed  by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa due to differences  with the party leadership.    Sakigage, a 15-member party, is headed by Masayoshi  Takemura,  former chief cabinet secretary in the preceding coalition  government.    The three-member Seiun, also a breakaway from the JNP, left  after Hosokawa failed to carry out a planned merger with  Sakigake.</p>

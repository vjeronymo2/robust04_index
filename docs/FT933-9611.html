			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Management: Taking quality to heart - A cultural change at Legal &amp; General For an idea so firmly established in the consultants' lexicon, total quality management has recently encountered a surprising amount of flak. More than one survey has revealed that many companies feel TQM has not delivered the results hoped for. Legal &amp; General, however, is not disenchanted. Through its 'quality development' programme, the large UK life and pensions provider says it has substantially improved its service administration, cut its cost base and boosted its standing with the independent financial advisers which sell its products. Outside recognition came when Legal &amp; General won the 1992 'Administering Total Quality' award of the Institute of Administrative Management. But the initiative had its roots much earlier during the boom in life and pensions products of the mid and late 1980s. 'From 1988 onwards our administrative systems were starting to creak,' says Ray Wilkinson, manager in charge of the quality programme at L &amp; G's administrative headquarters for high-volume individual products in Hove, Sussex. 'With the onset of the recession it was also clear that, like our competitors, our expense base had become too fat.' Faced with a much tougher environment, L &amp; G established a three-pronged strategy of which better service was one component. The other prongs were an overhaul of product design and improved investment performance. L &amp; G managers involved in the quality programme - which consumed 10,000 work days of training in 1992 alone - believe that efforts to make the continuous improvement philosophy acceptable throughout the company were important to its success. A policy of open communication helped, including staff feedback sessions over coffee and regular assessments by staff of their managers. Managers cannot hide in their offices (the Hove headquarters has just three). A questioning attitude is the heart of healthy TQM. After soliciting ideas from employees, L &amp; G implemented 800 'projects for improvement' in 1992. Another 2,000 'opportunities for improvement' were raised. 'These have to be followed through, or the manager has to justify why they are not being pursued,' Wilkinson explains. Quality improvement teams, a 'quality council', and the development of a common quality language were all part of L &amp; G's approach. 'It is not so much the structure that's important,' says Wilkinson. 'It's the attitude and willingness of people to implement it.' Regular feedback, a system of rewards and recognition, and competitions between sections are all part of the process. To keep the focus on customers, L &amp; G introduced customer advisory groups - panels of brokers and agents which meet at least every three months. Ideas from these panels were fed last year into a document called the 'Commitment to Customer Service' which represents the centrepiece of L &amp; G's quality programme. It lists turnround times for 38 processes - such as policy quotation, underwriting and claims settlement - alongside the company's results for the latest and previous quarters. A better yardstick of progress may be a survey conducted this year by City Research which showed that independent financial advisers rated L &amp; G number 11 out of 23 life companies in terms of head office efficiency and prompt despatch of documents (against 16th a year ago). On existing policy service and prompt commission payment L &amp; G improved from 18th to 10th and 16th to 9th respectively. Robin Phipps, managing director of L &amp; G's services division, says rival companies have been visiting Hove to learn from the L &amp; G example. He is not concerned about unwittingly giving away secrets. 'I don't think we can be copied that easily,' he says. 'You can mimic a product but not a culture change like ours.'</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Leader of coup may be Thai PM despite vow GENERAL Suchinda Kraprayoon, the army commander who led last year's Thai coup d'etat and vowed he would not accept the premiership, yesterday appeared likely to be nominated as the country's next prime minister. However, MPs who oppose the appointment of an unelected prime minister and command almost half the seats in the lower house were thought to have officially proposed an alternative. Gen Suchinda did not stand in the March 22 general election. But he emerged as the leading candidate after the majority alliance of five parties endured almost two weeks of strong public opposition to their original proposal to nominate Mr Narong Wong Wan, leader of the pro-military Samakkhi Tham (Justice Unity) party, which won the largest number of seats. Mr Narong was alleged to be associated with heroin trafficking, and the US government confirmed that it had refused him a visa last year on these grounds. He has denied the charges and has not officially given up his candidacy, but some leaders of the five parties say their alliance had switched support to Gen Suchinda. The army chief would not comment yesterday. If he does accept the premiership he will have to explain why he has decided to break a categorical denial last year that neither he nor the powerful air force commander, Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rajananil, would accept the premiership. 'I can reaffirm here that both General Suchinda and Air Chief Marshal Kaset will not be prime minister after the promulgation of the constitution,' Gen Suchinda said then. Much of the press opposes Gen Suchinda, as does a large section of public opinion in Bangkok, where an anti-military party took all but one of the seats in the election. In accepting the premiership Gen Suchinda may also have to let leading members of the five parties be ministers even though some of them were in the government that was overthrown and were later proclaimed 'unusually wealthy'. Without their support, Gen Suchina would not be able to rule. But their selection could also be difficult to explain because one of the key justifications for last year's coup was corruption in the cabinet.</p>

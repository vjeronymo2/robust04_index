			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] In Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi,  south of Rwanda, the situation is calm but still very tense.  Last night's abortive coup by several dozen soldiers and  officers has failed. Some of those behind the coup have been  arrested, others are on the run. Francoise Berlaymont first  tells us how the abortive coup started:    [Berlaymont] Those behind the coup were arrested last night.  According to the interior minister, they are three Tutsi  extremists, three officers, namely two captains and one officer  cadet of the Superior Institute of Military Officers [Institut  Superieur des Cadres Militaires]. They went out yesterday  afternoon with one armored car and two trucks as well as some 50  men. They tried to storm the residences of the chief of staff  and the defense minister, as well as the president's residence.  However, those behind the coup did not manage to convince the  other barracks. The abortive coup was not only directed at the  government, but also at the army high command.    Those officers who have been arrested are believed to  reproach the chief of staff for its lack of firmness in the  Kamenge clashes. This is the Hutu district of Bujumbura, whose  inhabitants have been opposing the Army for two weeks. The Army  issued an ultimatum. Yesterday, Sunday [24 April], at 1800, all  the inhabitants were to surrender their weapons, which they  failed to do. The ultimatum was postponed to this evening, at  1800. Several thousand soldiers came from other regions of the  country last weekend to surround Kamenge. This maneuver could  have been used as a cover for the coup.    Shooting went on all day in Kamenge with guns, grenades,  machine guns, and rifles. It is impossible to enter or leave  the district. The rest of the capital is calm, but tension is  extremely high, despite seemingly normal life. Francoise  Berlaymont reporting from Bujumbura for the news bulletin.    [Announcer] We have heard that contacts are being  established  in Bujumbura. Their aim is to prevent a violent confrontation  in the northern districts of the town between the Army --  dominated by Tutsis -- and the Hutu gangs of armed resistance  fighters who have found refuge there. If these contacts fail,  this would in all likelihood lead to more tension in Burundi.    In Brussels, the FRODEBU [the Front for Democracy in  Burundi], has said that last night's abortive coup is to be  attributed to the supporters of the former president,  Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, who, for his part, has strongly denied  these allegations. The FRODEBU, the majority party in Burundi,  has also said that the coup was continuing, that the Army was  putting the government under pressure, that the next few hours  will decide whether it is double or quits.</p>

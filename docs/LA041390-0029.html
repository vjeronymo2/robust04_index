			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> MCGUIRE OVERCOMES A TIGHT SPOT TO THROW A SHUTOUT  </P> <P> El Camino Real High's Ryan McGuire sustained a pulled right hamstring making a  long stretch for a ball while playing first base last week. But the last thing  he wanted to do was miss a longer stretch because of a little tightness.  </P> <P> After meeting with his teammates and discussing his injury with Coach Mike  Maio, McGuire asked if he could again pitch, something he had not done in  almost a week.  </P> <P> Maio agreed, but made it clear to his standout left-hander that he wanted  up-to-the-inning progress reports. Otherwise, he'd show McGuire what being  pulled was really all about.  </P> <P> "I promised I'd let him know the first time I had any problems," McGuire said.  "And he said, 'If you don't, I'll beat you up.' It was one of those things  Coach Maio says.' "  </P> <P> McGuire shortened his delivery and tossed a three-hitter in a 6-0 victory over  Ventura on Wednesday to give El Camino Real third-place honors in the Thousand  Oaks tournament.  </P> <P> Oddly, it was McGuire's first shutout of the season. After striking out 38  batters in an impressive two-game stretch two weeks ago, the UCLA-bound McGuire  (4-0) struck out four and walked two against Ventura.  </P> <P> Pressure cooker: Being tabbed as the league favorite in any sport is worth an  extra wrinkle in a coach's forehead. It's even worse when his team is so loaded  with talent that it is expected to win a City Section title.  </P> <P> Can losing a rather meaningless spring tournament game ease the burden of an  undefeated season?  </P> <P> Perhaps. Sure, Maio wasn't at all pleased with his team's 7-6 loss to Montclair  Prep on Tuesday, but it could serve as a pressure valve of sorts.  </P> <P> "Going undefeated is a nice lofty goal," Maio said. "But on a given day, if the  ball isn't moving or you hit it right at people, things happen."  </P> <P> El Camino Real (11-1-1) didn't go easily. The Conquistadores left 10 runners on  base.  </P> <P> "We hit it hard," he said. "But that's exactly what I mean -- you have days  like that."  </P> <P> Said McGuire: "Looking back, it was a big load off us. At the time, we didn't  see it that way, though."  </P> <P> And it's definitely better to lose now than in league play.  </P> <P> "Or the playoffs," McGuire said.  </P> <P> Red numbers: Chaminade golf Coach Mark Kardon calls Tim Powers the best golfer  in the Valley. Powers, a junior, is doing his best to prove his coach correct.  </P> <P> In Powers' last 63 holes of competitive play, he is five under par. The streak  includes a four-under 67 at Simi Hills Golf Course and a two-under 34 at Encino  Golf Course.  </P> <P> The Encino round included a birdie and two eagles.  </P> <P> After recording a nine-hole average of 37 strokes last season -- playing on  Chaminade's first-year team -- Powers is averaging 36 this season.  </P> <P> According to Kardon, Powers has never been beaten in high school competition.  </P> <P> R &amp; R: A freshman can only be expected to do so much, so when Birmingham  middle-distance runner Deetra Dear pulled her right quadriceps in a dual meet  with Reseda last week, Coach Scott King pulled her from Saturday night's  Arcadia Invitational.  </P> <P> "There's no reason (to over-race) a ninth grader," he said. "We'll probably  rest her for a couple of weeks (and) only bring her back when it's safe."  </P> <P> Before Saturday, Dear had the fastest girls' time in the Valley area for 800  meters, at 2 minutes 21.82 seconds, until Buena senior Fanya Bryant recorded a  2:19.07 in Arcadia's Open competition, which preceded the featured  invitational.  </P> <P> Dear, scheduled to run in the invitational 800 at Arcadia, first injured her  leg March 24 while competing in the Pasadena Games' Open 800 at Occidental  College. Just after the 400 mark, Monica Callan of San Diego Poway ran up on  Dear's leg, causing her to stumble into Lane 3.  </P> <P> Heir apparent: It may be difficult for sprinter Marion Jones to escape the  shadow of Angela Burnham, but no one can say she isn't trying.  </P> <P> Jones, a freshman at Rio Mesa, follows Burnham, the UCLA freshman who won five  state high school titles.  </P> <P> As a 13-year-old eighth-grader, Jones shattered Burnham's national age-group  record of 24.90 seconds in the 200 meters. Jones clocked 24.30.  </P> <P> At the Arcadia Invitational, Jones, running into a slight head wind, broke  Burnham's record of 24.08 in the 200 as a 14-year-old with a time of 23.80.  </P> <P> Mike Glaze, Kirby Lee and staff writer Steve Elling contributed to this  notebook.  </P></p>

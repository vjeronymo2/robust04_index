			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Mondadori replaces managing director MR FRANCO Tato, a former top executive of Olivetti, the Italian computers group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, is to be the new managing director of Mondadori, the media concern subject to a control battle between Mr De Benedetti and Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Mr Tato, who shifted to the Berlusconi camp soon after he left Olivetti in October, is to replace Mr Corrado Passera, the close De Benedetti aide who became Mondadori's top executive after Mr De Benedetti regained control of the group last July. Since then, the pendulum has swung firmly back Mr Berlusconi's way, thanks to a number of court decisions which have progressively loosened Mr De Benedetti's control of the company, despite continuing legal efforts on his part to reassert his grip. That process culminated in the election yesterday of a new 15-member board, 10 of whom allied members of the Mondadori and Formenton families, against five for the De Benedetti side. Meanwhile, there is more speculation about the chances of a negotiated settlement of the Mondadori dispute. This follows the recent intervention of Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, a leading Rome-based entrepreneur closely associated with Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister. Mr Ciarrapico has reinvigorated the idea of a division of the group between the De Benedetti and Berlusconi sides, with a financial settlement based on the differing values of the assets assumed. As before, the plan involves the transfer to Mr De Benedetti's CIR holding company of La Repubblica, Italy's biggest-selling newspaper, and L'Espresso, a leading news magazine. The deal could also include Panorama, the country's top-selling news magazine, and a chain of local newspapers. According to Mr Passera, who always stresses the damage being done to Mondadori by the uncertainty over its fate, the chances of an easy settlement should not be exaggerated. As in last summer's abortive talks on a deal, agreeing to a figure for the settlement may again prove the stumbling block. Despite Mr Ciarrapico's good offices and the idea of tossing more small parts of the group into the pot to make the deal cheaper, a gulf may still remain between the two sides' conception of what constitutes a fair settlement.</p>

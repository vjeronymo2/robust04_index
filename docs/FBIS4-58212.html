			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with al-Tijani al-Tayyib, secretary general of </F> the Sudanese Communist Party, SCP, by an unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [AL-WAFD] We would like to know your views on the  differences the press reported recently among the factions of  the National Democratic Grouping [NDG]?    [Al-Tijani] In fact we just had normal differences. We did  not want them to be publicized by the press. We in the Sudanese  Communist Party [SCP] have nothing to say to the press on the  difference of views among the NDG factions. However, I am  willing to explain some facts if you ask me about them.    [AL-WAFD] Ummah Party says that the NDG's higher  coordination  committee is controlled by the left and that it is not an  effective democratic instrument that enlivens the opposition's  and the NDG's performance.    [Al-Tijani] I believe that it is unthinkable to accuse the  SCP of controlling the NDG's coordination committee, which  includes representatives from Ummah Party, the Democratic  Unionist Party [DUP], the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement  [SPLM], the legitimate command of the armed forces, Southern  Sudan Political Association [SSPA], and the Sudanese National  Party [SNP], in addition to other independent figures. Accusing  the left or any other party of controlling the committee would  be an underestimation of all these partisan bodies. All these  parties are independent and control their own decisions; they  make the decisions they believe serve their interests and views  as well as the interests of the Sudanese people and the  collective struggle to overthrow the National Islamic Front  [NIS] regime. How then can we conceive of the left, represented  by one party, the SCP, as controlling all the other parties that  are represented in the coordination committee? The SCP does not  have the necessary enormous funds, does not have many masses--as  Ummah Party puts it--and does not have the military power.  Hence, the allegation that it controls the committee is  inconsistent with reality. The SCP cannot afford to dictate any  decision to the legitimate leadership. The same thing applies  to the DUP, the SPLM, and all the rest.    [AL-WAFD] Last week the Ummah Party put forward an  integrated  plan to restructure and reorganize the NDG and the coordination  committee. What do you think of that plan?    [Al-Tijani] No one denies the need to structure the NDG. The  issue has been under consideration since 1991 and it is being  discussed at every single NDG meeting. The Ummah Party did not  put forward any plans in this connection until last April, and  their plan was not complete. However, we believe that this  issue will not benefit the Sudanese struggle if it is published  in the press. The public who read the press cannot alter the  problem, unless they stage demonstrations in front of party  headquarters. But that is impossible in view of the conditions  Sudanese opposition activity experiences at present. Hence, it  would have been better to discuss these issues among the parties  to reach a final decision that all the parties concerned approve  in a democratic manner.    As matter of fact, a committee that was formed in the NDG  discussed a large number of proposals put forward by all  political forces. The committee worked out recommendations and  forwarded them to the NDG and the coordination committee to be  decided on at the NDG's 5th congress. There is no disagreement  on the need to restructure the NDG. We, as a Communist Party,  put forward a plan to the coordination committee along with the  plans submitted by the other parties. The fact that the  coordination committee has failed to resolve this issue since  September 1991 shows that this problem may be "lopsided"--that  is, this structure may favor a certain policy. If there is no  clear policy, it is difficult to imagine the structure. The  election of the coordination committee chairman or secretary  general, for example, and the formation of ad hoc committees  should be preceded by outlines of the usefulness and political  tasks of these new bodies. There should be an agreement among  all parties on the policies that these bodies will follow.  Conversely, the parties may decide to restructure the NDG first  and then agree on the political tasks. This is no problem.  What counts is that the structuring should be linked to the  policies that the NDG is supposed to follow. We, as a Communist  Party, have no objections to any restructuring of the NDG on  which the parties agree. We make no conditions other than  regarding the persons who will fill the posts.    [AL-WAFD] What do you mean by "conditions" about persons. Do  you mean that you are opposed to certain persons?    [Al-Tijani] We are not opposed to certain names or persons,  but we have legitimate questions about the "president" and the  qualifications he must meet. I believe that we should reach an  agreement in advance on the president or secretary general,  whoever they may be.    [AL-WAFD] From the political point of view, how would you  explain the reasons the Ummah Party raised the issue of  "restructuring the NDG" at this time?    [Al-Tijani] We believe that this issue should not be  discussed in the newspapers. The person who first raised this  issue in the newspapers should bear the responsibility. I do  not believe that any political forces anywhere in the world  would broach such a sensitive and serious issue in the  newspapers. We, as the Sudanese opposition, are members of one  committee and one grouping. We all agree on the need to solve  the issue of restructuring the NDG. I believe that raising the  issue in the newspapers is not in the interest of the NDG nor  will it help solve the issue of restructuring.    [AL-WAFD] Now that the SPLM has declared a "New Sudan" in  the  south, how does the Communist Party view the significance of  this declaration? What about the SPLM's continued membership in  the NDG, particularly since certain people interpret the  declaration as being tantamount to the secession of southern  Sudan?    [Al-Tijani] First, as far as we know, the SPLM is not a  secessionist movement; its leader has stated more than once that  his favorite option is a unified, democratic, secular Sudan.  Garang has stated this stance more than once. I believe that  Garang is not a separatist, but a unionist. Regarding the plan  submitted at the SPLM congress, we have not yet received the  text of that plan. However, we do know that the SPLM is in  control of certain areas in southern Sudan. They want to run a  civil administration in that area. This is their right and it  does not mean a step toward secession. This is my view,  according to the information I have so far received.    [Text] [AL-WAFD] In the light of all these changes, how do  you view the future of the NDG? Will it overcome its crisis or  will the Sudanese opposition embark on other organizational  courses?    [Al-Tijani] The NDG was formed of parties and forces with  their own differences. These differences come to the surface  from time to time, but it was possible to resolve most of them  during the past four years. We in the NDG have agreed on a  formula not only to bring down the regime, but also to solve the  chronic government crisis in Sudan on the basis of an agreement  reached by all the Sudanese parties and forces. This agreement  constitutes part of the NDG charter, its program, and  resolutions. We think that the majority of the Sudanese people  accept and support the NDG formula.    There is no doubt that we in the opposition will strengthen  our unity and cohesion. The NDG will remain in the field as an  instrument for the Sudanese opposition, whether some people  agree or not. We are confident that the great majority of the  NDG forces are satisfied with it and its representational  capacity and are ready to work together to bring down the NIF.  Whoever works for the good of the people will survive, but the  scum will disappear. Mutual consent is the solution.    [AL-WAFD] Finally, do you think it would be useful to hold a  meeting between the Communist Party and the Ummah Party to  discuss their problems?    [AL-Tijani] We held regular, scheduled meetings with the  Ummah Party less than a month ago. We discussed many of the  issues of interest to the NDG and the whole country. If  differences have emerged, they should not provoke insults. This  is something that we do not approve of. Democracy recognizes  differences of views. We respect the right of the Ummah Party  to defend its views by democratic means. We also ask it in  return to respect our views and not to insult us. We have not  insulted anyone, but expressed our views. We may disagree, but  we do not insult anyone. We express our views frankly and  boldly, while at the same time expressing our readiness to meet  half way with any force that we disagree with. We think that  decisions in the NDG must be reached through mutual consent.  The NDG was established on this basis. When the NDG was  established, the parties in it had differences of views. Even  the SPLM and the Ummah Party, which used to fight each other,  are now in the same grouping. Differences do exist, and we  cannot disregard them, nor can we resolve them over night. The  only solution is for us to achieve mutual consent on all  decisions we make for the good of the Sudanese people.</p>

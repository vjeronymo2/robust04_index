			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TAL SMITH WILL FILL IN TEMPORARILY IN THE PADRES' FRONT OFFICE  </P> <P> With spring training fast approaching and Jack McKeon preparing to doff his  general manager's cap for a field manager's, the Padres announced Thursday that  Tal Smith has agreed to temporarily expand his duties with the club to include  overseeing day-to-day baseball operations.  </P> <P> Smith will fill the role from Feb. 22, the day the Padres' first full-squad  workout is scheduled, until a permanent president is named; Dick Freeman has  been acting as interim president.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, McKeon's trade talks continue to percolate with no results. Pitcher  Mark Langston, his target in Seattle, signed a one-year contract with the  Mariners Thursday. Atlanta outfielder Dale Murphy, also coveted by McKeon, is  recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery and still waiting to hear if the  Braves are planning to trade him.  </P> <P> Thursday, though, the attention was centered on the Padre front office.  </P> <P> "This is really what I regard as temporary," Smith said from his office in  Houston. "I'll be pinch-hitting until the Padres select their new president,  after which time any further delineation of the baseball responsibility will be  his."  </P> <P> Said Freeman: "He's filling in . . . most of his roles will be as a general  manager on a temporary basis. The job Jack is leaving to go down on the field  is a general manager's job, and that responsibility is being left without  anyone to fill it."  </P> <P> The Padres contracted with Smith after the 1988 season to serve as a consultant  to Freeman and the club on contract negotiations, trades, arbitration hearings,  minor league operations and scouting department decisions. Smith also is under  contract in the search for a new club president.  </P> <P> Smith started his baseball career with the Cincinnati Reds' organization in  1957. He served as the New York Yankees' executive vice-president from 1973  through 1975 before becoming the president/general manager of the Houston  Astros in 1976. He was with the Astros until 1980 and started Tal Smith  Enterprises in 1981.  </P> <P> "I've served almost continuously as a consultant for the Padres since May 1981,  and I have a good working relationship with Jack McKeon, Dick Freeman and  (minor league director) Tom Romenesko," said Smith, who will also be working  with his 25-year-old son, Randy, the Padres' director of scouting.  </P> <P> Tal Smith said his new role will not lead to the Padres' presidency.  </P> <P> "Not at all," he said. "I've had plenty of opportunities to get back with a  club, but a permanent position (in baseball) is not my preference.  </P> <P> "I've done well as a consultant. I enjoy the diversity and the people, and I  like the opportunity to do the different things that my independence provides."  </P> <P> Smith will be spending most of his time in Yuma, Ariz., and San Diego while on  assignment with the Padres.  </P> <P> On the trade front, McKeon has had conversations this week with both Seattle  and Atlanta but hasn't turned up anything.  </P> <P> Langston signed a one-year contract for $1.3 million plus incentives with the  Mariners, avoiding a Feb. 15 arbitration date. He was looking for a three-year  deal, which the Mariners say still may be worked out.  </P> <P> The Padres and the Mets remain the chief competitors in trying to land  Langston, who was 15-11 last season with a 3.34 earned-run average and 235  strikeouts, second in the American League to Roger Clemens.  </P> <P> The same two clubs are also wooing Atlanta General Manager Bobby Cox over  Murphy.  </P> <P> "We're just listening now," Cox said Thursday. "Jack McKeon is very aggressive  in his pursuit of Dale Murphy. Jack's a hard worker -- he does his job. We've  bantered about some names, but we're still trying to sort out everything."  </P> <P> The Padres' prize bait, catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., doesn't interest Atlanta as  much as other teams because the Braves have Jody Davis. Atlanta is looking for  a power hitter and a young center fielder.  </P> <P> As a 10-and-5 man -- 10 years in major league baseball, five with the same team  -- Murphy has the right to decline a trade. There have been reports that Murphy  would veto a trade to the Mets and accept one to the Padres. Cox said he hadn't  spoken with Murphy about that.  </P> <P> "We're trying to work something out," Cox said. "If it gets close, we'll talk  to Mr. Murphy and Mr. Turner (Braves' owner Ted)."  </P> <P> All indications are that Murphy is recovering smoothly from arthroscopic knee  surgery Jan. 31. An Atlanta spokesman said Murphy appeared at a team luncheon  three days after the surgery without crutches and that he is walking now  without a noticeable limp.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> A Braves' spokesman said Dale Murphy videotaped his knee surgery in case a club  interested in trading for him would like to view it. . . . The Padres and new  pitcher Walt Terrell are scheduled to go to arbitration Feb. 16. . . . Three  pitchers and three catchers have been invited to the Padre major league  training camp that opens with workouts Feb. 19. The pitchers are Joe Bitker,  Terry Gilmore and Joe Lynch, and the catchers are Mike Basso, Greg Hall and Bob  Lutticken. A total of 42 players have been invited to spring training, 36 of  whom are on the major league roster.  </P></p>

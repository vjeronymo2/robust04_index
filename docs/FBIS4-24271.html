			<p>BFN     [Text] The issue of South African mercenaries in the  Angolan civil war once again surfaced yesterday. Captain (Van  du Toit), who in the 1980's was a prisoner in the hands of the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party  [MPLA-PT] in Cabinda, traveled to Cabo Ledo to supervise  military training of the People's Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FAPLA], MPLA troops. This is a paradox  since it is known that Nelson Mandela intends to assist in  ending the Angolan conflict. Will the mercenaries contribute to  peace in Angola? This is the big question placed before Nelson  Mandela's good offices.</p>

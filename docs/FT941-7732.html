			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc, Snia form further venture Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, and Snia, a subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, are to pool their engineering plastics operations in a joint venture. The move, announced yesterday by the two companies, is designed to strengthen their position in a depressed sector. It is the latest step in a process of combining and rationalising their fibres and polymers activities. Last year, Snia and Rhone-Poulenc set up a 50-50 joint venture in carpet and poly-amide fibres. Earlier this year, they established a venture in polyamide textile yarn, which is used in the manufacture of stockings. The new company, which will be called Nyltech, will also be a 50-50 joint venture and will pool all of the engineering plastics operations of Rhone-Poulenc and Caffaro, a division of Snia. Engineering plastics are highly resistant to heat and are used in a range of industrial products, including automotive and aircraft components. The new company will have annual sales of about FFr1.2bn (Dollars 205.5m) and will employ about 800 people. It will be based in Lyon, involving the relocation of current employees but no significant job cuts, according to Rhone-Poulenc. All of the production sites and technical centres will be included in the joint venture. According to Rhone-Poulenc, the venture will allow greater efficiency in production and marketing. Research and development costs will be shared, marketing costs will be reduced, and product ranges will be combined.</p>

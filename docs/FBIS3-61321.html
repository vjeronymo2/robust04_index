			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ye.T. Gaydar, first deputy prime minister of </F> the Russian Federation, by M. Panova; place and date not given:  "The Logic of Reform"]    [Text] The government of Russia has been accused of  neglecting "explanatory efforts" for a reason. Even professional  economists do not always understand the logic of steps taken by  the government; many actions cause bewilderment and, as a  consequence, protest. In an effort to assist the readers of  EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN in figuring out what the government itself  means by the policy of reform, the editorial office approached  Ye.T. Gaydar with a request to answer a number of questions  which are encountered most frequently in letters from our  readers. Therefore, Yegor Gaydar, first deputy prime minister of  the government of Russia, is our interlocutor.    [Panova] Yegor Timurovich, before we ask you questions about  the plans of the government, we would like to ask how you  personally assess the path traveled by the country since the  fall of 1991, when the policy which has come to be called the  "Gaydar reforms" began?    [Gaydar] Let me answer two questions at once--about the  reform process, i.e., the way the reforms were carried out, and  about the intermediate result, i.e., what the reforms have  brought about.    The reform process has been extremely contradictory, and  transformations have proceeded quite inconsistently. It is the  custom in our country to address rebukes to some generic  authority; however, it should be understood that authority as a  united entity or at least noncontradictory has not existed in  our country so far. The government was involved in continuous  confrontation with the Supreme Soviet, which did everything to  stop the reforms. As is now obvious to all, various trends also  existed within the government, and the reformist line was not  necessarily dominant. We were forced to agree to numerous  compromises and retreat on many significant nuances in order to  salvage the key point. This inconsistency was perceived by both  specialists and the population. The choice we had was either to  do what was possible while consenting to much of what we  considered incorrect, but taking what we viewed as fundamental  steps, or, "saving face," become the opposition and observe,  this time from the sidelines, how the country would waste an  opportunity to overcome the crisis. We preferred the path of  compromise, although perhaps we disappointed a segment of our  supporters in this manner.    As far as the results of these two years are concerned, I  cannot agree in any way with apocalyptic assessments which are  quite frequently published in the press. On the contrary,  clear-cut favorable trends have emerged in the economy of  Russia. Strange as it may seem, the word "success" is  considerably more fitting for Russian reforms than the word  "failure."    Our current situation should not be compared to the United  States or Germany but rather to our own situation as of two  years ago, as well as to the tendencies and expectations we had  at that time. Recall the fall of 1991--complete breakdown of the  market, empty stores, the dominance of barter, humiliating hours  in lines, and the feeling of hopelessness. There were a great  many predictions of famine, cold, and rebellion. One may be as  critical of the activities of the government as one wants, but  it is impossible not to acknowledge that these predictions have  failed to come true. Not only have we survived, but we feel much  more confident than two years ago. For example, even the most  irresponsible people do not discuss the threat of famine at  present.    In general, when our opponents now enumerate the troubles of  the Russian economy with an accusatory intonation, we would like  to ask the basis for their belief that it could have been  easier? At the time of disintegration of the USSR several crises  at once were superimposed over one another. The output of energy  resources--the main item in Russian exports--declined sharply.  Due to the attempts of the last union government to patch up the  holes with the use of Western credit, Russia fell into a debt  trap. An irresponsible financial policy brought about the  emergence of a huge merchandise deficit and the actual  depreciation of the savings of the population, which really  perished right then, in the years of perestroyka. In January  1992 this merely became obvious.    Of course, the standard of living of a majority of the  population is still very low. However, in this instance, too,  everything is not as bad as it appears to be. In the last 10  months the real income of the population has not declined, and  if we were to compare it to the beginning of 1993, it has  increased.    Therefore, despite the situation remaining quite complex,  with quite a few things not working out the way we had planned,  I view the results of the past period favorably.    [Panova] As you see it, what should be the key priorities of  economic policy for the next year or two?    [Gaydar] Our main task is to ensure a break in the  inflationary spiral and ensure the predictability of key  economic parameters in the production sphere.    For this purpose, it is necessary to consistently reduce all  types of subsidies in the production sphere in 1994: import  subsidies, preferential credit, and credit extended to the  states of the Commonwealth, and to bring the deficit to a volume  not exceeding 5 percent of the gross domestic product.    In turn, this will make it possible to abandon the financing  of the budget deficit through emission by the end of 1994, and  to switch to financing it from healthy sources, both domestic  (state treasury bonds) and foreign.    The rate of growth of the money supply will drop from 10  percent per month in early 1994 to 3 percent per month at the  end of the year. This will make it possible to maintain a  relatively stable rate of depreciation of the ruble against the  dollar, not to exceed one-half of the rate of inflation. The  currency exchange rate, relatively cheaper imported goods, and  the strengthening of price competition on this basis--all of  these may be used to slow down inflation from 15 percent a month  at the beginning of 1994 to 5 percent a month at the end of 1994.    Subsequently, as the rate of inflation drops, prerequisites  will be created for lowering the discount rate of the Central  Bank, lowering the interest rate on the market, and,  correspondingly, the growth of private investment in the  production sector.    [Panova] What awaits us in the sphere of taxation?    [Gaydar] Unfortunately, in the environment of a considerable  budget deficit there will be no opportunity to reduce the burden  of taxes in 1994. At present the level of tax withholdings comes  to 50 percent of the gross domestic product; a real reduction in  it may be discussed no earlier than 1995. The key directions in  this area are: reducing taxation of wages (withholdings for  social security), and canceling levies on above-the-norm labor  compensation fund.    The codification of a universal form of distribution of  taxes  to the levels of the budget system, between the federal budget  and the territories, a transition from customized norms for each  region established in the process of bureaucratic bargaining to  universal rules, with appropriate support to poorly developed  regions--such is the substantial advance which may and should  occur in 1994.    An increase in taxes on factors of production--natural  resources, real estate--as a share of the total volume of taxes  is yet another long-range avenue for the system of taxation.  However, this will only become possible after a low level of  inflation is attained.    [Panova] People have the impression that the government's  tax  policy encourages only commerce and banking, but makes  operations in the production sphere unprofitable.    [Gaydar] Generally speaking, our taxes are the same for both  production and commerce. However, the effect you mentioned  exists as a consequence of the so-called inflationary tax. The  inflationary tax means losses which the owners of monetary  savings suffer as a result of high inflation. Naturally, losses  due to the inflationary tax are not comparable to profits in  commerce and the banking sector, in which money is turned around  quickly. In turn, these losses are very significant in  production, especially in sectors with a long production cycle,  and for the population.    This problem cannot be solved through differentiated  taxation  of the spheres of production and distribution; after all,  increased taxes in the sphere of distribution will cause massive  tax evasion. This is why there is only one way to even out  conditions for taxation--it is to stop inflation.    [Panova] Will the privatization policy undergo changes?    [Gaydar] As we discuss the process of privatization, we  should compare what has already been accomplished in the course  of it with what is yet to be done in the long term.    Privatization in Russia is unprecedented in scope and not  comparable to the experience of any of the countries of the  world. There are monumental technical difficulties in its path  here affecting the forms of privatization, the system of  vouchers, and the appraisal of privatized property.    All of these are objective aspects.    However, there are also subjective aspects. We are not the  authors of the privatization program--we proposed a different  program which did not have such great preferences for labor  collectives, that is, the point for which we are now being  criticized.    However, decisions were made by the Supreme Soviet, often  contrary to our opinion; as a result we have a compromise  version of the program with many flaws.    We cannot change the rules of the game in the middle without  the risk of triggering major social conflicts; this is why we  should conduct the current stage of privatization to the end and  change the rules gradually.    Property has already been distributed, but effective control  over it by the new owners has been absent so far. The role of  the management and labor collectives is clearly excessive. This  is why the most pressing task is to create effective owners, to  establish rules and procedures for the redistribution of  property, and to create a system counteracting all attempts to  squander such property. In this instance, the role of investment  funds as outside coowners of enterprises in resisting the  arbitrary rule of directors is very great.    We are making a transition from the system of handing out  property free of charge to selling it, from unconditional  privatization to privatization conditioned on additional  investment.    [Panova] At present, everyone agrees that structural changes  in our industry are necessary. What would be your description of  the situation in this sphere? Are structural changes underway in  our country? Are you satisfied with this process?    [Gaydar] Of course, structural changes are progressing, and  they are not progressing poorly. Statements about a profound  crisis in industry or fatal declines in production are either  manifestations of incompetence or simply deliberate distortions  of the facts.    Let us look specifically at areas where we have considerable  declines in production, for example, light industry. However,  many light industry enterprises were so ineffective that they  generated a negative value added for our entire industry,  whereby the total cost of output was less than the cost of  resources consumed in production. The "production of the means  of production"--machine tools for the production of machine  tools, metal for the machine tools producing machine tools,  power for smelting this metal, and so on--which is well-known  from school textbooks, is also declining in our country. On the  contrary, the share of civilian machine building and the food  industry in the structure of the national economy (in constant  prices) is increasing. The strengthening market mechanisms is  throwing up a barrier in the path of producing everything that  is not associated in any way with meeting human needs. Industry  for the sake of industry, which indeed is a peculiar  accomplishment of ours, is yielding to production for the sake  of the people, however slowly and with resistance.    Certainly, such a decline is beneficial. It is no accident  that, until a few months ago, the total level of decline in  production in Ukraine was lower than in Russia, whereas the  standard of living fell considerably more than in our country,  and social tensions were greater, to boot. We are gradually  getting rid of that production which was pulling us to the  bottom.    It is necessary to note one more aspect here which is  important in principle. So far, the process of structural change  has proceeded without major social upheaval and against the  background of a quite low unemployment rate. For two years now  they have been promising us the 20 million level of  unemployment. However, at present the rate of unemployment does  not by any means exceed 3 percent, even with the inclusion of  those who are on forced leave. We have every reason to believe  that in the coming 1.5 years the unemployment rate will remain  quite low. Nonetheless, the government is attentively following  the situation in the labor market. We have developed special  programs of aid to the unemployed and retraining for those who,  having lost their jobs, would like to train in new professions.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Yuhai (2621 3768 3189): "To Ensure the </F> Establishment of a Market Economy and Promote Sound Economic  Growth, Shandong Has Speeded Up Its Pace of Local Legislation,  with the Shandong People's Congress Standing Committee Drawing  Up and Ratifying 30 Local Laws and Regulations in 1993"]    [Text] Shandong's Eighth People's Congress Standing  Committee has adapted to the needs of Shandong's rapid economic  growth and establishment of a socialist market economy, by  steadily speeding up its pace of local legislation, particularly  economic legislation. Since its change of session in early  1993, it has drawn up 14 local laws and regulations, and  approved 16 local laws and regulations drawn up by the three  cities of Jinan, Qingdao, and Zibo.    The establishment and perfection of socialist market economy  operating forces has to rely on a corresponding market economy  legal system for guidance, standardization, guarantees, and  restraints. The Shandong People's Congress Standing Committee  has steadily freed up its thinking and revamped its legislative  concepts, making its prime mission legislative work,  particularly economic legislation. Shandong People's Congress  Standing Committee Chairman Li Zhen [2621 2182] [former Shandong  Vice Governor] has repeatedly emphasized the need to adapt to  the needs of rapid economic growth, by using the spirit of  reform to do a good job of local legislation. The Shandong  People's Congress Standing Committee, in order to build as  quickly as possible the basic framework of a market economy  legal system throughout Shandong, so that there will be laws to  follow in the key areas of reform, opening, and economic  development throughout Shandong, has held two local legislative  symposiums, which specially studied the new situations and  issues posed to local legislation by a market economy, and  explored innovative legislative thinking under the new  conditions. Based on extensive investigation and study, and  numerous changes in their drafts, they set the Standing  Committee's 1993 legislative plans and Shandong's five-year  legislative program, acting in line with market economy  development needs, by setting forth legislative items to provide  for future legislative objectives and missions.    They first proceeded from Shandong's realities, by promptly  drawing up local laws and regulations, such as the "Shandong  Statistics Regulations," the "Management Regulations for the  Qingdao Duty-Free Zone in Shandong," and the "Management  Regulations for Shandong's Establishment of Project Bidding," to  accomplish matters, such as standardizing market subjects,  preserving market order, and tightening macroeconomic regulation  and control, in order to promote sound market economy  development. Directed at the "development zone and real estate  fevers," they drew up and approved legislation, such as the  "Shandong Regulations on the Sale and Transfer of Urban  State-Owned Land Use Rights," and the "Management Regulations on  Urban Real Estate Transactions in Qingdao City." To adapt to the  needs of the rapid growth of reform, opening, and foreign  investment throughout Shandong, they drew up and approved  economic laws and regulations involving foreigners, such as the  "Shandong Management Regulations on Economic and Technological  Development Zones," the "Shandong Management Regulations on  Enterprise Registration in Economic and Technological  Development Zones," and the "Labor Management Regulations for  Qingdao FIEs."    To improve legislative quality and make local laws and  regulations more serviceable, the Shandong People's Congress  Standing Committee conducted bold explorations in areas, such as  reforming local legislative systems and procedures, and  broadening legislative channels, which breached the local  legislative fetters of "empirical maturation and policy  finalization," to achieve legislative leadership and foresight.</p>

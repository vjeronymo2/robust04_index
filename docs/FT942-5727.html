			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: European spinning set to fall The west European spinning industry is set to suffer further sharp falls in output as production shifts to the Far East, according to a report* by Textiles Intelligence and the Economist Intelligence Unit. The report predicts that spun yarn production in western Europe will fall to 2.3-2.6m tonnes by 2000, from a peak of 3.3m in 1987, in spite of technological advances and improved yarn quality. The industry's fastest growth will be in China, India and Pakistan, where labour costs are low and raw cotton is locally available. Asian producers of yarn will also benefit from the rapid growth in textile and clothing manufacturing in the Far East. Conversely, European spinners will face an ever-declining market for their products, the report predicts, in a trend that will get worse as quotas are liberalised under the new Gatt agreement. In the five years from 1987, only Italy, which accounts for 30 per cent of European spun yarn production, and Benelux maintained production levels. Other leading producers experienced sharp falls in output, with UK production off by 30 per cent. Cotton yarns are expected to be the hardest hit in Europe, with output set to fall by a quarter between 1991 and 2000. Synthetic fibre yarns also face sharp declines in output, of up to 18 per cent. *World Markets for Spun Yarns: Forecasts to 2000.

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Too gloomy a picture of air travel Sir, Professor Doganis paints a gloomy picture of the likely results of air transport liberalisation within the Community (Personal view: 'No freedom in the skies', April 29) but it is in our view far from complete. He sets out first the supposed expectations of the protagonists of liberalisation and compares them with what he perceives to be the reality post-1992. This is a false comparison. For all but the last few years, governments have controlled the European air transport market through a series of inflexible bilateral arrangements, limiting the routes to be flown, nominating the carriers to operate them, fixing the capacity to be offered and the fares to be charged. The last interest to be considered was that of the customer. Henceforth, all this will be taken out of governments' hands. It may be that not all airlines will want to take advantage of their new found freedom to compete - and, incidentally, we share Professor Doganis's fears that there may be fewer of them to do so - but they will at least be free to do so if they wish. And as experience quickly showed on the London-Amsterdam route, following the pioneering negotiation of a liberal air services agreement between Britain and the Netherlands, the presence of only one extra carrier on a route does produce very real benefits for the consumer as well as stimulating a growth in traffic. Moreover, Prof Doganis ignores the stimulus which liberalisation has already provided for new services to the Continent from regional airports. For instance, in 1985 Belfast had only one such route, to Amsterdam, whereas this summer there are now in addition direct daily flights to Paris, Stuttgart and Milan. This would have been unthinkable only five years ago. Faced with a choice between the old regime and the new, the user can only vote one way. This is why we have consistently supported the UK government, and will continue to do so, in its now largely successful attempts to transform the regulatory framework for the Community air transport industry.

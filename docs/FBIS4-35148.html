			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 27 Jun (DPA) -- Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Fernando Naranjo today said the Costa Rican Government  will not reestablish diplomatic ties with Cuba as long as Fidel  Castro's regime fails to promote changes leading to the island's  democratic opening.    Nevertheless, Naranjo reiterated that Jose Maria Figueres'  administration is still interested in encouraging a peaceful  transition in the Caribbean nation.    In statements to the domestic media, the foreign minister  noted that most of the countries on the continent want a  "democratic Cuba" that can join the OAS, adding: "We believe  that a solution to the Cuban crisis must be the product of  exchanges and the participation of all parties interested in  finding a solution to the problem."</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Anglo-Eastern more than doubled INCREASED palm oil production helped Anglo-Eastern Plantations to more than double pre-tax profits from Pounds 530,000 to Pounds 1.2m for the first half of 1993. Palm oil production from the group's 6,500 hectare Tasik estate in northern Sumatra rose from 32,994 tonnes to 45,718 tonnes. Target production for 1997 is 130,000 tonnes of palm oil. Outside processing carried out by the dedicated crushing mill, opened in 1991, increased from 8,900 tonnes to more than 28,000 tonnes. Mr Rollo Barnes, chief executive, said the Tasik estate was coming to maturity. At the same time a shortage of crushing capacity in the area had raised the throughput at the group's mill. The average palm oil price obtained at Rotterdam in the half was Dollars 375 a tonne, although the price had since fallen to about Dollars 340 a tonne. Production in the first three months of the second half was well up on last year and if this trend continued, the group said results for the year should be very satisfactory. Turnover was ahead 54 per cent from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 3.5m. Earnings per share rose from 1.4p to 3p, and the interim dividend is up from 0.375p to 0.5p. The group said no provision had been made for expenses relating to Chillington Corporation's planned sale of most of its 49 per cent stake in Anglo-Eastern to Genton International of Hong Kong. It estimates its expenses at between Pounds 120,000 and Pounds 160,000. Shareholders in Chillington, which also has interests in property and engineering, vote on the sale early next month. If it is approved, Genton will make a full offer for the rest of Anglo-Eastern at 68p a share. Yesterday the shares were unchanged at 74p.</p>

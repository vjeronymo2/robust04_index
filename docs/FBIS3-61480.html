Doronin, </F> NIKIMT Scientific Production Association; UDC  621.791:621.643.1/.2]    [Abstract] The effect of the purity of gases transported  over various types of pipelines with welded joints on the  "memory" of modern electronic devices, the scarcity of detailed  data on the extent to which the welding practices and welds  serve as sources of trace amounts of impurities, and the lack of  relevant regulatory documents governing the design and process  parameters prompted a reevaluation of the practical aspects of  wedding on pipelines intended for carrying superpurified gases  in the electronics industry. The appearance of superfine residue  on the welded pipe surface with particles 0.5-1 m in  size  and changes in the weld and heat affected area (OShZ) surface  composition, e.g., the appearance of nonmetallic inclusions, are  discussed, and certain factors which determine the weld and heat  affected area protection inside the pipe are described in  detail. The effect of the shielding gas purging duration which  ensures a twentyfold replacement of the gas atmosphere as a  function of the flow velocity (in order to eliminate the fine  deposit), the weld and heat affected area surface quality as a  function of the plate surface preparation on the fusing side,  and the effect of the welding conditions and inner surface state  on the weld surface roughness are summarized. The findings  demonstrate that the weld is the principal source of elevated  impurity desorption which can be lowered by taking into account  the effect of the welding method and conditions on the weld  surface roughness, shielding gas rate, and protective device  design on the development of nonmetallic inclusions, evaporation  products, and changes in the phase composition of the heat  affected area surface.

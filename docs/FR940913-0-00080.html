			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in &sect;84.71(a), including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.62  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Remedies for noncompliance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, HUD may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in &sect;84.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hearings and appeals <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In taking an enforcement action, HUD shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effects of suspension and termination <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless HUD expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relationship to debarment and suspension <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 24 (see &sect;84.13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_After-the-Award Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.70  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 84.71 through 84.73 contain closeout procedures and other procedures for subsequent disallowances and adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- The United States called  Wednesday [19 January] for new action to boost the share of  foreign semiconductors in the Japanese market but Japan rejected  the request, officials said. Both sides said Tokyo does not  view as serious recent declines back below the 20 percent goal  for foreign share of the Japanese microchip market, a level  reached last year after high-profile talks that prompted  criticism as managed trade.    "We were disappointed," said a U.S. trade official, citing  Japan's "lack of willingness to take the measures necessary" to  prevent the microchip issue from reemerging as "a point of  contention" before a bilateral summit on February 11.    A Japanese Trade Ministry official said Tokyo rejected the  call for new steps because, despite recent share declines,  foreign access to the Japanese market has steadily expanded and  efforts in the area were being rewarded.    "You don't have to alternate between hope and despair over  quarterly figures," the Japanese official told reporters,  speaking on condition of anonymity. But the U.S. official told  a separate briefing, also on condition his name not be used,  that last year witnessed "a continuous decline for foreign  market share."    Noting that broad-based bilateral talks that aim at  agreement  before the meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa include a review of  existing accords, he said the microchip issue will likely be  "another problem to be dealt with."    But, touching on an area of strong Japanese objections, the  U.S. official said the specific target-setting used in  semiconductors "is not necessarily the right approach for all  products or for all areas we have problems with." He also  expressed hope that Wednesday's "emergency consultations," which  Washington requested, will lead Japan to "take a more  forthcoming and activist approach to the issue."    No date was set for further semiconductor talks.    The U.S. made no specific proposals but asked Tokyo to craft  a plan to boost foreign microchip use in autos,  telecommunications and video games, increase "design-in"  opportunities and consider reviving some earlier steps, the U.S.  official said.    The U.S. reckons that the foreign share of Japan's microchip  market fell to 18.1 percent in the quarter through September  from 19.2 percent in the preceding three months and 19.6 percent  in the first quarter of 1993. Japan, which includes in its  calculations "captive" microchips sold by foreign makers to  their subsidiaries in Japan, says the July-September figure was  19.7 percent, after 21.6 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively,  in the previous two quarters.</p>

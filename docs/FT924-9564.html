			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Gummer makes secret visit MR John Gummer, agriculture secretary, flew secretly to Chicago on Tuesday in a vain attempt to help break the deadlock in the talks on farm trade and the Uruguay Round. Mr Gummer, who was in the US on church business, registered under an assumed name at a hotel near the Mayfair Regent Hotel where EC and US officials were holding talks. He took no part in the negotiations, which Brussels handles for the EC, but was there to strengthen the hand of Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner. The UK currently holds the EC presidency and Mr Gummer chairs this council. Mr Gummer's surprise appearance came as Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, is understood to have told Mr MacSharry that dealing with the EC was like 'negotiating with phantoms' because each country had a different line. The US claimed that Mr MacSharry was going beyond his mandate, or that he could deliver more within it. Mr MacSharry dialled Mr Gummer's room and said ask the president of the council 'if I'm being inflexible'. Mr Gummer duly gave his backing. The US came up with a compromise, but the talks later collapsed.</p>

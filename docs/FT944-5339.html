			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 I have read nothing so entertaining and intellectually stimulating this year as Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct (Allen Lane, Pounds 20). He sets out to demonstrate that language is not a cultural invention but a neurological mechanism, and along the way offers up many witty and fascinating reflections on anthropology, Darwinism, cultural snobbery, as well as an elegant defence of 'hopefully' as a sentence adverb. In Craig Raine's long poem History: The Home Movie (Penguin, Pounds 9.99) language is wrought into a kind of mental jewellery; imagery of clarity and fabulous invention shines on every page. The minutiae of the private life and the great upheavals of this century are given equal weight to create a history of intense emotional reality. When modern warfare engulfs a literary mind the result is usually interesting enough in itself, but Tobias Wolff's memoir of his time in Vietnam, In Pharaoh's Army (Bloomsbury, Pounds 14.99), has an irresistible flow. He is a lucid, self-honest spirit with a gift for narrative. I read him at a sitting, and was sad to run out of pages.</p>

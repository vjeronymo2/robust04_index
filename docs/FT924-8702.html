			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Obscure diners with a mind to spoil the party - The new-found influence of the 92 Group PRIME MINISTER John Major might be forgiven for wanting a quiet supper on Thursday - the day his chancellor presents what looks set to be a controversial Autumn Statement. His diary will tell him he is unlikely to be granted such a wish, since he is due to dine with the 92 Group of Thatcherite rightwingers. This 100-strong group of Tory backbenchers contains many of the 'enemy within': those MPs who have been making the government's life a misery in recent weeks by exploiting its slender Commons majority to push for climbdowns on key aspects of economic and European policy. Over the weekend, it turned its attention to forcing a more favourable balance in the ranks of the chief policy-makers themselves. This culminated on Sunday with a public demand by Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North and a 92 Group member, for the prime minister to take 'an early opportunity to redress that balance and have a cabinet more representative of popular and party opinion.' In terms of raw power, the 92 - under the guileful chairmanship of Sir George Gardiner, the veteran MP for true-blue Reigate - has never been more of a force to be reckoned with. The government's anaemic majority and the large proportion of the new Tory intake who have swiftly become card-carrying members have seen to that. When Sir George said publicly that he and four colleagues were preparing to support the government in last week's critical Maastricht divisions, it was front-page news. Its members form a powerful bloc on the executive of the 1922 committee, which acts as mouthpiece-in-chief of Tory backbench opinion. But in some ways, the increasingly public profile that the 92 has adopted since April's general election is an ironic indication of waning influence. During the Thatcher years, the group was able to concentrate instead on working behind the scenes to secure the election of sympathetic candidates to the chairs of the most important Tory backbench committees, emerging occasionally to take issue with those whose conduct it considered beyond the pale. A sign of the obscurity in which it has traditionally operated lies in the number of seasoned Westminster observers who wrongly believe that the 92 owes its name to the year of its foundation. In fact, this derives from the address - 92 Cheyne Walk in fashionable Chelsea - where it was established several years ago. Now, as Mr Carlisle's remarks imply, the corridors of real power are insufficiently lined with 92 group sympathisers however full of them the back benches may be. The less than stellar qualities of some of those being proposed as replacements for 'targeted' ministers like Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, and Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, suggest that this 'imbalance' may not quickly be corrected. Meanwhile, the views of those deemed most likely to succeed Mr Major should he decide to throw in the towel are if anything even less in tune with those on the right. And there, in effect, is the rub: the nature of the 92 group's power is purely destructive. If it is exercised to topple the present administration, the group could be lumbered with a still more unsympathetic government. If Mr Major is groping for an encouraging thought over the sherry on Thursday, this may well be it.</p>

He added that it is a fact there for all to see that since  1949 and since the initiation of reform and opening drive in  China, tremendous progress has been achieved in the country, a  fact universally recognized, while pointing out that "trade is  after all trade, we are opposed to linking trade with anything  irrelevant."

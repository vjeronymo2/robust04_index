			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Geneva, 15 May -- "As a co-sponsor of the Middle  East peace process, Russia favors further progress towards  settlement," Andrey Kozyrev said in Geneva on Saturday evening,  while receiving his Egyptian counterpart, 'Amr [Muhammad] Musa,  at the Russian Federation permanent mission at the UN European  branch.    "Many factors are prompting us to pool our efforts," the  Russian foreign minister stressed. "Many difficulties will have  to be overcome in order to implement the Cairo agreement between  the Palestinians and Israel. We also have to move forward in  the matter of Israeli-Syrian relations."    He went on to say that Cairo was "playing a key role in the  Middle East process and in resolving other international  problems." We appreciate the contribution to the Bosnian  settlement made by such member states of the Islamic Conference  Organization as Egypt, which has adopted a balanced and  even-handed approach on this and other issues.    As to bilateral relations, Moscow is "getting ready for  President Mubarak's visit, which will be a very important  event." The Egyptian leader is held "in the highest esteem in  Russia." Boris Yeltsin and Husni Mubarak keep in contact and  exchange messages. "We are moving consistently towards a  Russo-Egyptian summit," stressed Andrey Kozyrev.    "Russia plays an important role in the Middle east  settlement  and has the trust of many sides," noted 'Amr Muhammad Musa.  According to him, Cairo is ready to continue helping to set up  various meetings that can advance peace.    The Egyptian minister stressed the "Bosnian issue occupies  an  important place on our agenda." This subject was discussed at  his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on  Saturday.</p>

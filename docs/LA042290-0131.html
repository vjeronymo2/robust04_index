			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASTROS SPOIL THIS ANNIVERSARY PARTY;  </P> <P> DODGERS: CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION ENDS IN DISAPPOINTMENT AS HOUSTON SCORES TWICE  IN THE NINTH INNING TO WIN, 6-5.  </P> <P> Appropriately, on the centennial anniversary of the Dodgers' first victory in  the National League, fans were treated to a few things Saturday night that  happen about once every 100 years.  </P> <P>  -- Eddie Murray committed an error. It was the Dodger first baseman's first  error in 123 games, since May 30 of last season.  </P> <P>  -- Casey Candaele of the Houston Astros hit a home run. It was the second  homer of the infielder's career. The first, in 1987 with Montreal, was  considered so special the Expos painted the seat at Olympic Park.  </P> <P>  -- Jay Howell blew a lead.  </P> <P> That final oddity is what the Dodgers will remember, as Howell was handed a 5-4  lead in the ninth inning and gave up two runs, resulting in a 6-5 loss to the  Astros before 48,434 at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Howell had not allowed an earned run in two appearances this season, and cost  the Dodgers losses in three of 56 appearances last season. But none of that  made what happened Saturday any easier to accept.  </P> <P> "I stunk," said Howell, who battled shoulder stiffness last week but did not  blame his problems on anything physical. "I am not searching for any excuses.  The team did their job. I did not do mine."  </P> <P> After the Dodgers had taken a 5-4 lead on an error by Ken Caminiti in the  sixth, the Astros had managed only one hit over the next three innnings off  starter Fernando Valenzuela and reliever Don Aase. In came Howell to finish the  game in the ninth.  </P> <P> Three pitches later there was trouble, on a ground ball single to right by  Rafael Ramirez. Up stepped pinch-hitter Ken Oberkfell, who led the major  leagues in pinch-hits with 18 last season. He lined a double past Murray that  scored Ramirez.  </P> <P> Gerald Young replaced Oberkfell on second base. Two pitches later, he raced  home when pinch-hitter Terry Puhl blooped an 0-and-2 fastball to left field for  the game-winning single.  </P> <P> "If you wanted to cite a mistake, that 0-and-2 pitch was it," Howell said. "I  can't allow something like that. But the guys know I'm busting my butt. . . .  And I know this certainly won't carry over."  </P> <P> The Dodgers had a chance in the ninth against reliever Dave Smith, as Juan  Samuel led off with a single. But Samuel was thrown out attempting to steal by  catcher Craig Biggio.  </P> <P> "I was given the sign to run, but my legs just don't run fast enough," Samuel  said.  </P> <P> After Willie Randolph walked, Chris Gwynn struck out and Murray grounded to  second to end the game. Gwynn, starting in left for the injured Kal Daniels,  went hitless in five at-bats. He left the bases loaded in the sixth.  </P> <P> Howell lost a victory for a pitcher who really understands frustration.  Fernando Valenzuela, despite allowing four runs on seven hits over six innings,  was poised for his first win, which would have come 47 days before last  season's first victory. But he remains 0-2.  </P> <P> Valenzuela thought the game was won in the sixth on a bases-loaded error by  Caminiti, who bobbled Randolph's grounder. The bases had been loaded against  reliever Juan Agosto on singles by Mike Scioscia and Alfredo Griffin and a walk  to Mickey Hatcher.  </P> <P> The Astros' ninth inning ruined all that, and spoiled the Dodgers anniversary  day celebration.  </P> <P> The pregame festivities delayed the start of the game, which was scheduled for  7:05, by 34 minutes. The Astros, unlike the public, had been told the game  would start about 7:20 p.m., so they didn't protest. But Fred Claire, Dodger  vice president, was ready with a response.  </P> <P> "It's not easy covering 100 years in 10 minutes," Claire said with a smile. "If  they had wanted to protest, I would have told them, 'You try it.' "  </P> <P> After the Astros took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on Glenn Davis' homer, the  Dodgers scored a run in their half of the inning on Murray's double, but the  Astros scored again in the third on Bill Doran's double.  </P> <P> "They give me runs, and I give them back," Valenzuela said.  </P> <P> After the Dodgers had taken a 4-3 lead in the fourth inning thanks to another  grounder off Caminiti's chest that allowed a run, Valenzuela let the Astros tie  it again in the fifth by giving up the homer to Candaele. He almost gave up  more later in the inning, after the bases became loaded on a walk, an infield  hit, and a grounder by Davis that bounced off Murray's glove for an error. But  he struck out Glenn Wilson to end the threat.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Jeff Hamilton, suffering from a torn rotator cuff, was placed on the 15-day  disabled list as expected. As an indication of the potential seriousness of Kal  Daniels' twisted side, in replacing Hamilton, the Dodgers ignored triple-A  middle infielder Jose Vizcaino and recalled left-handed hitting first baseman  Brian Traxler. By doing this, they are giving the third base job to the platoon  of Mike Sharperson and Lenny Harris, but not filling a backup infielder spot  previously held by the two players.  </P> <P> Traxler hit .301 in 64 games at triple-A Albuquerque last season and was  hitting .296 in seven games this year. He was counseled by Manager Tom Lasorda  this spring about his biggest problem -- his weight. Traxler, 5-foot-10, has  since dropped 15 pounds, putting him at around 200 pounds. He is not a home run  hitter -- he has just 14 in his two full minor league seasons. "With Kal hurt,  we wanted to get a left-handed bat in there," Vice President Fred Claire said.  Daniels hit off a tee in a batting cage and his side, twisted Friday night, was  still bothering him. "I thought I'd be able to play, but it's still sore,"  Daniels said. "I'll watch it day to day."  </P> <P> Look for the Dodgers to make a determination about surgery for Hamilton within  10 days, after evaluating the results of rest and rehabilitation. He received  another scare Saturday when he tried lifting a small weight with his right arm,  and then his left arm. The right arm was noticeably weaker. "Whatever it takes  to get my arm stronger, I will do," Hamilton said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MARTYR TO ESSENTIALISM;  </P> <P> SIMONE WEIL AN INTELLECTUAL BIOGRAPHY BY GABRIELLA FIORI TRANSLATED BY JOSEPH  R. BERRIGAN(UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA PRESS: $35; 376 PP.; 0-8203-1102-2);  </P> <P> UTOPIAN PESSIMIST THE LIFE AND THOUGHT OF SIMONE WEIL BY DAVID MCLELLAN  (POSEIDON PRESS: $21.95; 316 PP.; 0-671-68521-X)  </P> <P> Weil's life was, by her own choice, brief. On its outlines, Gabriella Fiori and  David McLellan agree. She was born in Paris in 1909 to nonpracticing Jews, a  "gentle, self-effacing" doctor, in McLellan's words, and his "assertive,"  "indefatigable" yet "articulate, persuasive and charming" wife, whose father  had prevented her from studying medicine.  </P> <P> Selma Weil, preferring her son, Andre, encouraged her daughter to be manly and  forthright even at the risk of appearing rude. Both biographers reveal the  young Weil as sickly, obstinate, disgusted by physical touch, devoted to but  competitive with her older brother.  </P> <P> Like Andre, she was highly educated, receiving a degree in philosophy from the  Ecole Normale Superieure. In spite of devastating migraine headaches and  generally poor health, she then taught for several years. She also became  involved with trade unions, wrote articles for syndicalist publications and  held menial jobs in several factories, the better to understand workers' lives.  </P> <P> Her activist inclinations led her to Spain during the Civil War, but within  days of joining the anarchist militia there -- with an ineptitude that  characterized her physical life in general -- she stepped into a pot of boiling  oil and burned herself so badly that her parents (who dogged her wanderings and  rescued her from more than one disaster) took her back to France.  </P> <P> Upon the occupation of Paris in 1940, the three went to Marseilles, where Weil  continued her writing, found agricultural work and deepened the spiritual quest  that had gradually superseded her political activism. After a short, unhappy  stay in the United States in 1942, she left her parents behind to join the Free  French in London.  </P> <P> Disillusioned and chagrined that no one had found her "any useful work that  involved a high degree of hardship and danger," she stepped up the  self-starvation she had practiced to some degree all her life, and by the end  of August, 1943, she was dead -- still unbaptized -- despite her profession of  faith "in God, in the Trinity, in the incarnation, in the redemption, in the  Eucharist, in the teachings of the Gospel" -- because of her resistance to the  institutional church.  </P> <P> Into this biographical framework, both McLellan and Fiori weave summaries of  Weil's rigorously intellectual reflections in the form of letters, articles and  books, many of which were not published until well after her death. McLellan is  the more successful at this task. His presentation, although plodding, is lucid  and substantial, as his synopsis of Weil's favorite themes reflects: "her  biting criticism of the view of history as progress; her antipathy to Rome and  Israel; her admiration for the Greeks; the mistaken dominance given to science  in contemporary society; her strong connection of art and literature with moral  values; the centrality accorded to physical labour; her unwillingness to  consider political institutions, however democratic, as the main legitimizers  of the distribution of power; her awareness of the danger of all collective  activity; her insistence that genuine liberty and equality could only be  founded by reference to other worldly values."  </P> <P> Fiori's approach, less conventionally academic, promises to be lively and  inventive: Basing her work solely "on evidence provided by people who knew her  and upon her works," she intends "a biography . . . designed as a mosaic  reconstruction or, even better, an organism of living cells." Unfortunately,  thanks to shifts in tense and point of view, overblown rhetoric and  typographical oddities, the result is more of a mishmash, for which author,  translator and editor all must bear responsibility.  </P> <P> Instead of a simple statement that Weil rejected the idea of marriage, for  instance, Fiori is translated as saying, "As far as the idea of love codified  in marriage, associated somehow with feminine attraction, dates, clothes, the  signals and messages of use and wont, she perhaps never paused there at all."  If a clear sense of Weil's being fails to emerge through McLellan's dutiful but  dull prose, it fares no better in Fiori's meandering verbiage.  </P> <P> And for some reason, the life that lies at the heart of any biography, even an  "intellectual" one, never does quite animate either book. Perhaps the  difficulty is that neither confronts Weil's anomalous existence as a creature,  and specifically a female creature, struggling against incarnation. As the  subtitle and structure of McLellan's book suggest, he views "thought" as  separable from, and even preferable to, "life"; and, except to report her  always disheveled appearance and her crippling headaches, he ignores her bodily  experience almost entirely.  </P> <P> Briefly, at the very end, he notes that "hunger and nourishment are the  dominant metaphors in her writings," only in order to deny that she was  anorexic. In view of her death, her anorexia is incontestable, however,  although it appears to have been not the anorexia nervosa prevalent today but  rather perhaps the anorexia mirabilis of certain medieval female mystics. By  inexplicably passing over the dominant metaphors in her writings, McLellan has  failed to connect the bodies of the woman and the work.  </P> <P> Fiori shows herself more sensitive to such connections, affirming that, "In  reality, there was no split between the substance and the appearance of this  young woman" and dubbing her, with infelicity but good will, "a genius-woman."  Her essentialist understanding of "woman" is revealed, however, when she refers  to Weil's "feminine sensibility which more easily grasped the concrete detail  apt to overthrow the useless abstraction." "I am not a feminist," Fiori quotes  Weil, and apparently she perceives this statement as excusing her from a  feminist reading, which might have provided the focus her project lacks and  enlivened her exploration of Weil's genuinely mysterious life.  </P> <P> The reader who wants a coherent, workmanlike introduction to that life would do  well to choose "Utopian Pessimist" over "Simone Weil." Better yet, however, now  that much of Simone Weil's own work has been translated, read some of that:  "The Need for Roots," perhaps, or "Waiting for God." It will be worth the  struggle.  </P></p>

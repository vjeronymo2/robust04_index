He was  commenting on the prospects of such a deal being struck during  the a forthcoming summit in Moscow between the Presidents of  Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine.    In his words, though the company has vested interests in  Ukraine, these have nothing to do with the dismantling of  nuclear weapons. More importantly, said the official, Gasprom is  not a state but stock company and that is why all crucial issues  linked to its financial standing are subject to discussion by  its shareholders.    Kiev's debt for gas imports from Russia runs at more than  Rbs  1 Tn, about a third of its total debt to Moscow. But it owes  only Rbs 30 Bn for oil imports.    However, one other company official in an interview with  Interfax did not rule out the possibility of a gas-for-weapons  swap following "a decision on the highest level." In this case,  he said, the government will have to compensate Gasprom for  financial losses which is very problematic given that it has no  such money. The official says a mere write-off of Kiev's debt  without compensation to Gasprom will cause anger in Russia's gas  producing regions and result in "several Nadyms".    The country's large gas producing region of Nadym was almost  brought to a standstill at the end of last year after local  workers went on strike because of not being paid wages for  several months due to defaults by Gasprom customers.</p>

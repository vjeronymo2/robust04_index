			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Standard Chartered to restructure management STANDARD Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, is to reshape its management following the recruitment of Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays, and the planned retirement of two of the bank's long-standing senior directors. The changes, which may result in Mr Wood being given wider responsibilities than just being Standard's finance director, are likely to include a reallocation of responsibilities for the bank's treasury and merchant banking functions. The bank last month announced a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 202m for 1992 after incurring a Pounds 305m loss in India as a result of the Bombay securities trading scandal. It has been trying to strengthen its controls to prevent a repetition. Mr Wood is taking over as finance director from Mr Richard Stein, but the bank is also looking outside for a replacement for Mr Alan Orsich, the deputy managing director in charge of global businesses, who is due to retire in November. Mr Malcolm Williamson has taken over as chief executive from Mr Rodney Galpin. Mr Galpin is due to hand over the chairmanship of the bank to Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman of Asda, at the bank's annual general meeting in May. The bank is likely to announce an interim change in its management structure within a month, and will then consider further how to allocate responsibilities under Mr Williamson after it recruits a replacement for Mr Orsich. One possibility would be the appointment of a deputy chief executive under Mr Williamson. Mr Wood, who was excluded from being considered as Barclays' chief executive by the decision to look outside the bank, would be a prime candidate. But the bank may not replace Mr Orsich's role as deputy managing director in this way. One reason for giving Mr Orsich this responsibility was that he was along-standing senior director of the bank when Mr Williamson was appointed. The interim changes have been approved by the bank's board, and are being explained to the bank's management in regions such as Africa and the Asia Pacific. They are aimed at strengthening Standard's functional reporting lines. The bank is thought to have examined ways of integrating its treasury function - which has come under Mr Orsich's global businesses division  - with parts of its financial services division, including merchant banking. The bank said yesterday that it could not comment on any management changes, but expected to make an announcement shortly. It said that any changes it would announce were unrelated to the Bombay securities trading losses. Fifteen managers - including three in London - have already left the bank as a result of the Bombay incident. A further six have been reprimanded.</p>

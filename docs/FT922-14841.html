			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Hopes for farm trade reform deal MR Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister, expressed hopes yesterday that the change in government in Paris will open the way to decisions in France 'that allow the European Community to come to a compromise with the US government' on farm trade reforms. Speaking at a conference in Paris, Mr Mollemann said it would be 'a catastrophe' if the Uruguay Round of talks on liberalisation of world trade were to fail because of deadlock over agriculture. Negotiations began in 1986, but have been paralysed since the end of 1990 by EC refusal to accept these reforms. France has been the most reluctant to compromise, particularly on US demands for cuts in the volume of subsidised farm exports. The German minister pointed to a summit in Washington between President George Bush and EC President Jacques Delors on April 22 as an opportunity for compromise. Commenting on the appointment on Thursday of a new French government headed by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, Mr Mollemann noted that Mr Beregovoy 'has a very high understanding of the international economic problems we are facing'. At the same conference, Mr Frans Andriessen, vice-president of the EC, talked of Mr Beregovoy as a 'very EC-oriented man'. 'It seems trivial that such an enormously important exercise (as the Uruguay Round) is depending on farm trade. We should accept the challenge to make reform.' Mr Mollemann called for a special Group of Seven summit to resolve the trade deadlock if no compromise was reached in Washington in April.</p>

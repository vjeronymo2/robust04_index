Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approved State permit programs provide interaction between the State and MSWLFs owners and operators regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only owners or operators located in States with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by 40 CFR part 258 to the extent the State permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State and the permit status of any facility, the Federal MSWLF criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hawaii applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Hawaii's application and issued for public comment a tentative determination that Hawaii's permit program is adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Based on a thorough review of Hawaii's MSWLF program and the fact that no comments were received from the public, EPA is today issuing a final determination that Hawaii's MSWLF program is adequate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The determination of adequacy for Hawaii shall be effective on June 2, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  U.S. EPA Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California, 94105. Attn: Greg Wilmore, mail code H&hyph;3&hyph;1, phone (415) 744&hyph;2093.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6941&hyph;6949(a), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Section 4005 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945, also requires that EPA determine the adequacy of State MSWLF permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To facilitate this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State and Tribe Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State and Tribal landfill permit programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to approve State MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. EPA interprets the statutory requirements for States to develop ``adequate'' permit programs to impose several minimum standards. First, each State must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State must also provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6974. Finally, the State must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a State has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA expects States to meet all of the criteria for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. In addition, States may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 8, 1993, Hawaii submitted an application for adequacy determination for Hawaii's MSWLF permit program. On March 7, 1994, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Hawaii's MSWLF program. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 59 FR 10644 (March 7, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment. EPA received neither comments nor a request for a public meeting on this determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Hawaii has the authority to enforce the requirements of its MSWLF program at all MSWLFs in the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the tentative determination, EPA proposed to fully approve Hawaii's MSWLF program. Hawaii's application for adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Hawaii is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its MSWLF permit program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

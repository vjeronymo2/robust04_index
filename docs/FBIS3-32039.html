			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Ramon Diaz] </F>   [Text] Given the likelihood of changes in the military High  Command once Rafael Caldera becomes president, all active  generals and admirals of the National Armed Forces [FAN] agree  that the new president should ratify the current commanders in  their posts, headed by Defense Minister Admiral Radames Munoz  Leon, in respect for seniority and merit. On 5 July all these  general officers will retire as a result of time in service.  Then the picture will change.    According to the military leaders, moving high command  figures is a constitutional act and, furthermore, a prerogative  of the president and commander in chief of the FAN. They added  that relieving the general command posts and the defense  minister is part of the normal military procedure. They added  that this clearly shows the normal atmosphere reigning at  military headquarters and confirms that such changes cause no  disruptions in the business of state, as long as such changes  are in accordance with current military regulations. If  otherwise carried out, said changes might create an unnecessary  crisis within the armed institutions.    One high-ranking Army officer pointed out that seniority --  which some politicians have tried to overcome so many times  before and has recently been treated with very little respect --  still has its place within the FAN.    As we all know, the High Command and the commanding general  officers of the Armed Forces are, firstly, Vice Admiral Radames  Munoz, whose command post is at the Ministry of Defense;  Division Generals Miguel Angel Andara Clavier and Ismael Antonio  Guzman, inspector general and chief of the Joint General Staff  of the FAN, respectively.    Commanding the services are Gen. Jorge Isaac Tagliafierro de  Lima, the Army commander; Gen. Freddy Yanez Mendez, the Air  Force commander; Gen. Pedro Romero Farias, of the National Guard  (GN); and Vice Adm. Julian Mauco Quintana, the Navy commander.    The first three commanders are to retire on 5 July. They  belong to the class of 1964, each in his own command academy.  Munoz Leon is a graduate of the "Gran Mariscal Ayacucho"; the  old Venezuelan Naval Academy in Maiquetia. As such, he -- like  his fellow commanders -- will have completed 30 years of active  service, according to the FAN Organic Law.    Regarding the commanding general officers of the individual  forces, the oldest soldiers in the force are Army Commander  Tagliafierro de Lima and Air Force Commander Yanez Mendez.  These two officers also graduated from their forces' academies  in 1964. Gen. Romero Farias (GN) and Vice Adm. Mauco Quintana  (Navy), however, are still relatively new to active service.    Along this same line of thought, what would happen if  President Caldera were to remove the current command staff and  replace the defense minister with the young and brilliant Army  Gen. Rafael Angel Montero Revette, the current inspector general  of the Army? In their words, "this would be the worst political  decision the chief of state could make," although they are sure  such a thing will never happen. Caldera, they say, is a  seasoned public figure and statesman, and knows how the pieces  move on the FAN chess board, to use a metaphor. They also  believe that it would be even worse if the president were to  decide to appoint one of the division generals -- such as Nestor  Lara Estrano, the current director general of the Defense  Ministry, Moises Orozco Graterol or Alberto Emerich Esquea  Torres, the executive secretary of the National Security and  Defense Council -- above Gen. Montero Revette.    In any case, the top commanders believe that if anyone  "tries  to get rid of Adm. Munoz Leon," which is the new president's  prerogative, the logical thing would be to appoint Andara  Clavier (Air Force), the current inspector general of the FAN,  as new defense minister until 5 July. Then Army Gen. Guzman,  chief of the FAN Joint General Staff, would replace Andara in  normal rotation. Vice Adm. Mauco Quintana, commander of the  Navy, would replace Guzman.    There are other formulas that they call "logical," but the  wisest thing for President Caldera to do is reaffirm Munoz in  his post until next 5 July, even though he is the supreme  commander in the end.    Munoz Leon, who would seem to be the president's current  "target," would not mind going home. He thinks that command  rotation is necessary, now more than ever, in times of crisis.    There is a generation eager to work, to continue with the  preset plans and carry out the ideas they have been kneading all  their lives. It is the FAN's rotation policy at the minister of  defense's office and the reverence for seniority that has  honored the institution and has been a source of hope for the  military command component. It has been an effective mechanism  to prevent one force from prevailing over the other and the  difficulties such a situation would entail.    In summary, for the members of the military High Command,  balance is the important thing in delegating the various Defense  Ministry posts. That is, that no single force should have an  advantage over the others and the men be place in accordance  with their skills and qualifications and, above all, their  ability to render the best possible service to the FAN, with the  desire to equally distribute the missions to be accomplished.</p>

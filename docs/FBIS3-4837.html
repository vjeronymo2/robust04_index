"I cannot help describing such a decision to resuscitate the  Super 301 as unproductive," the top government spokesman told a  news conference.    Noting Tokyo has decided to voluntarily devise a package of  possible measures to further open its markets by the end of  March, Takemura said, "we strongly urge the U.S. Government to  take sensible action."    The chief cabinet secretary made the comments after THE NEW  YORK TIMES reported Clinton is scrambling to reinstate his legal  authority to impose early sanctions on Japan.    Super 301, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1988, gives the  President the right to retaliate against countries which the  United States deems to be engaging in unfair trade practices.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: ANKLE INJURY SIDELINES HARBOUR  </P> <P> The ankle injury suffered by David Harbour of Camarillo High early in last  Wednesday's 76-52 basketball playoff loss to Glendora was diagnosed as a broken  bone in his right foot.  </P> <P> Earlier in the season, the sophomore guard tore ligaments in his left ankle and  missed several games. Harbour, the Scorpions' scoring leader, also plays  baseball but will miss the first three to four weeks of the season.  </P> <P> The injury climaxed a rash of ankle and foot mishaps for Camarillo in the last  week of the season. The Monday before the third-round playoff game against  Glendora, forward Scott Foster sprained an ankle. On Tuesday, reserve Dominique  Zuniga broke an ankle. Then, on Wednesday, Harbour went down.  </P> <P> "All stepped on someone else's foot," Camarillo Coach John Harbour said. "I  think it was a weird, freaky thing."  </P> <P> Harvard High's water polo team, the defending Southern Section 2-A Division  champion, has been invited to compete in a tournament in Bergmo, Italy, this  summer.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, the Saracens will train in West Berlin in the same facilities  where Harvard Coach Rich Corso may coach next season. Corso is considering  leaving the Harvard program for a club team named Wasserfreunde Spandau 04.  </P> <P> The six-team tournament includes club teams from northern Italy and is  tentatively scheduled to start the last week in June.  </P> <P> "It will be a good way to train," Corso said. "But instead of watching it on  video, we'll experience it."  </P> <P> David Eagle, a Harvard High senior who was a first-team All-San Fernando Valley  League tackle, has been named a scholar-athlete by the National Football  Foundation and Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-4, 245-pound Eagle carries a 3.7 grade-point average.  </P> <P> Mitchell Butler, two-time Southern Section Small Schools Division Player of the  Year from Oakwood High, has been selected to play in the McDonald's Wildcat  Western Classic at University of Arizona on April 15.  </P> <P> Mike Evans, 16, of Glendale has advanced to the national Pepsi-NBA Hotshot  competition in Cleveland on April 7-10 after winning his 16-18 age division in  the area final. Brian Holsinger, 13, of Lancaster, lost in the final of his  division.  </P></p>

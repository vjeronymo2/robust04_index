			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Italians trace problems back to budget deficit - A constantly shifting figure WITH the lira collapsing and Italian equities in apparent free fall, the focus has again shifted to the country's main source of its problems - the budget deficit. Understanding the deficit is like taking a bubble bath in numbers; there are lots of them and they keep moving. The size of the figures stem from the low unit value of the lira and the magnitude of the state debt. Their constant changes derive from uncertainty even among experts as to how much Italy owes and the dynamics of shifting interest rates and inflation. Rising prices after Sunday's devaluation are one of the reasons why even the latest set of forecasts, prepared each July by Italy's three economics ministries, are already in doubt. The cut in the lira's value will add about half a percentage point to this year's price rises, according to the Confindustria employers' federation. Until last year Italy had been making some progress on controlling its vertiginous debt. In 1990 the so-called 'primary deficit' - spending net of interest payments on the debt - was set to become positive, meaning government receipts would exceed spending, excluding the huge cost of debt servicing. Expectations of a positive primary deficit have now been postponed to next year, according to Mr Giuliano Amato, prime minister. The blame lies largely with deteriorating state finances in 1991, which may mark a nadir in political responsibility for managing the debt. The prospect of elections made ministers reluctant to take unpopular moves in the closing months of Mr Giulio Andreotti's government, even though it was apparent that assumptions of a lower deficit, made when the 1991 budget was presented in September 1990, were no longer valid. As a result last year's deficit amounted to 10.7 per cent of GDP, while the total debt reached 104 per cent of GDP. Failing remedial action, this year's figure would have reached at least L180,000bn (Pounds 81bn), equivalent to 11.8 per cent of GDP, while the total debt would have hit 108 per cent of GDP, according to the new government. That was way above both the Andreotti government's original L127,800bn target and the revised L160,000bn released in March. If allowed to run unchecked the deficit would have reached more than 18 per cent of GDP in 1995, when the total debt would hit almost 141 per cent of GDP. 'Even the L180,000bn may no longer be valid,' warns the chief economist at one of Italy's biggest banks. 'It's difficult to say how much it has drifted but, 10 weeks from publication of the government's forecasts, we guess the figure is nearer L190,000bn owing to recent rises in interest rates and worsening economic conditions, which have lowered tax receipts.' Mr Amato's first step on coming to office was a L30,000bn emergency budget for 1992, bringing down this year's deficit to L150,000bn, or 9.9 per cent of GDP. But it is his next move which is most important. The 1993 budget, to be unveiled shortly, requires swingeing spending cuts and new revenue raising measures. While economists predicted the total package would be worth L83,000bn last month, the rise in interest rates and economic slowdown has led to forecasts of at least L100,000bn now. The increase in the expected size of next year's measures also stems from doubts about the efficacy of the emergency budget and the assumptions on which future years' forecasts have been based. The emergency budget comprises extra revenue and lower spending. About L16,500bn will come from increased charges for services like driving licences and other permits. But economists are doubtful about both the remaining components. The government expects L7,000bn from privatisation, but with only four months left to run this year it is hard to see the full amount arriving by end-December. Bankers also doubt the government will make L7,000bn in spending cuts in view of rising political opposition within the coalition. 'We reckon of the L30,000bn total, only L20,000bn is certain. So our forecast for this year's deficit is L160,000bn, or around 10.5 per cent of GDP,' says one economist.  ------------------------------------------------------------                  ITALY'S FINANCIAL OUTLOOK                 % of gross domestic product  ------------------------------------------------------------                           1992     1993     1994     1995  ------------------------------------------------------------ Budget deficit             9.9     14.4     16.7     18.2 With proposed measures       -      9.2      7.4      4.9 Public sector debt       106.2    116.2    128.2    140.9 With proposed measures       -    110.9    113.6    113.5  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Report by treasury, finance and economics ministries  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

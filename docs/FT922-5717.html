			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Swiss movement AFTER YEARS of dithering, the Swiss have reached a moment of decision. Last week's referendum, in which they decided to join the IMF and the World Bank, confirms earlier hints of withdrawal from dogmatic neutrality. The government's move to apply for membership of the EC, together with the scheduling of two referendums later this year on joining the European Economic Area, has clearly posed the European question. From the EC's viewpoint, Swiss membership in both bodies is welcome. Exporters of goods and services to Switzerland would benefit from the removal of mechanisms which still protect 70 per cent of Swiss internal trade from market forces. Politically, Britain in particular would find Switzerland a valuable ally, sharing its concern about the EC's bureaucratic and centralising tendencies. And the Community as a whole would benefit from Swiss administrative and diplomatic competence. From the Swiss viewpoint, closer links with the EC would improve the economic outlook at a time when the special circumstances which led to Switzerland's postwar industrial and financial success have disappeared. Contrary to some perceptions, the Swiss have never been isolationist. But they risk being isolated in the future unless they move closer to the EC. The young are suffering from being unable to work and study freely in other European countries. By joining the EEA, the Swiss would assure themselves a place inside the world's largest trading bloc. There are heavy costs, notably a commitment to invest a colossal SFr30bn or so over the next 20 years to build two new rail tunnels through the Alps. Yet the Swiss have much more to gain than to lose from EEA membership. The question of joining the EC is more difficult. The Swiss confederation is a relatively weak alliance of four linguistic groups, which do not obviously have much more in common than a currency, a railway and a postal service. It has been held together by a light and decentralised structure of government, and by the tradition of referring most decisions to the people. If it joined the EC, regional and linguistic alliances could become stronger than the national one, and the frail glue that holds the confederation together could weaken further. Perhaps that would not matter, if the Swiss succeeded in communicating the secret of their improbable cohesion to a wider Europe, of which they are already the geographical heart and linguistic microcosm.</p>

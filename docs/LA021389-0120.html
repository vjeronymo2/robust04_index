			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THEY WANT MORE TO SAVE FOR RAINY DAY;  </P> <P> FRENCH METEOROLOGISTS GO ON A 24-HOUR STRIKE  </P> <P> Government meteorologists called a one-day strike today, leaving the French to  gaze into the sky and guess at the prospects for rain or snow.  </P> <P> The 3,000 employees of the National Weather Service agreed to provide crucial  aviation and marine forecasts during the walkout, called to press demands for  higher pay.  </P> <P> The four unions representing meteorologists conducted a series of meetings in  December and January with Transport Ministry officials but said the discussions  were not satisfactory and called the strike to underscore demands for more  money. A starting meteorologist earns about $1,000 a month.  </P> <P> The newspaper Le Monde noted that the strike means "silence on the great  preoccupation of vacationers and staff at ski resorts: the prospects for snow."  </P> <P> Snow has been scanty this winter in the Alps, causing many resorts to close  some or all of their ski trails. The latest long-range forecasts, issued  Sunday, said there was a possibility of scattered snow later this week.  </P></p>

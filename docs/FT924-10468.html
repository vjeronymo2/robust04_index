			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Letter: Drug prices that bear some interesting comparisons Sir, With reference to Paul Abrahams' article 'Cost of prescribed drug ingredients rises 22 per cent' (October 23), it seems to me the cost is based on 'get as much as you can' from Britain's National Health Service. As a diabetic I am naturally interested in the cost of insulin and during my recent travels I have found some interesting cost comparisons. The retail price of a bottle of insulin manufactured by a Danish company is Dollars 16 in the US and FFr38 in France; though free on prescription in the UK the bottle is priced at Pounds 14.99. When I asked the Department of Health for an explanation I was fobbed off with gobbledegook. No wonder the NHS is short of funds. C Sonabend, 62 Elsworthy Road, London NW3 3BU</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Ukraine signs deal to buy Iranian oil UKRAINE at the weekend moved to protect itself from a looming economic war with Russia by signing a deal to purchase 4m-5m tonnes of crude oil annually from Iran - about 10 per cent of Ukraine's consumption - in exchange for construction materials, Mr Konstanin Masyk, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, met Iranian officials in Tehran. According to Mr Viktor Hladuch, Ukraine's minister for industry and transport, the two countries agreed to build three pipelines, with an annual capacity of 25bn cubic metres, from Iran to Ukraine via Azerbaijan and Russia. The cost of the project, which was not revealed by officials, is to be split between the Ukraine and Iran (45 per cent each) and Azerbaijan (10 per cent). Eventually Iranian oil and gas could be refined in Ukraine - which has a 60m tonne capacity - and sold to Europe. Mr Hladuch said Ukraine had also begun to expand port facilities in Odessa. Odessa's capacity is less than 10m tonnes, leaving Ukraine dependent on the overland route through Russia and thus vulnerable to an economic blockade. Mr Hladuch said Ukraine, which would have a trade deficit with Russia of upwards of Dollars 10bn at world prices, hoped to avert economic warfare.</p>

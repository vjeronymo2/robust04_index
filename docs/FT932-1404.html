			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Soros resumes D-Mark attack MR George Soros, the widely-followed financial speculator, has again talked down the D-Mark with a declaration yesterday that Bundesbank resistance to an early and substantial fall in German interest rates was futile, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. 'I think they (the Bundesbank) are trying to accomplish the impossible and they are now beginning to fail,' Mr Soros said in a speech to the US chamber of commerce in Budapest. The Bundesbank, contending with a weak economy and an overvalued currency, was like an emperor without clothes, he said. The Hungarian-American financier judged that the Bundesbank 'refuses to move' on interest rates in order to force the German government to tackle the fiscal deficit and to maintain the external value of the D-Mark. Mr Soros forecast, however, that the differential between US and German interest rates would decline and said it was 'only a matter of time before the markets begin to discount it'. Yesterday's comments on the D-Mark are the strongest since Mr Soros argued earlier this month in an open letter that German currency and bonds 'need to be sold'. Mr Soros's investment announcements have moved markets in foreign exchange, gold and UK property, and his earlier statement on the D-Mark turned sentiment and prompted the currency to fall sharply.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Kohl's idea of solidarity may decide the future of federalism: The only point of agreement between the Bonn government and the opposition is that a deal must be done THE figures are huge, and they never seem quite to add up. The debate is tempestuous, but above all confused. The positions seem thoroughly entrenched, and the differences between the negotiators enormous. The only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that a deal must be done, and urgently. The stage is thus set for today's opening of a two-day, or possibly three-day closed-door conference between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the 16 prime minister's of Germany's federal states. The negotiators hope to agree a 'solidarity pact' for east Germany: a deal between the federal government, the 16 Lander, the opposition Social Democrats, and - somewhere hovering in the wings - the business community and the unions, on future financing of the soaring cost of unification. Many notable politicians believe it will decide the future of federalism in Germany. A clear outcome will counter the growing mood of gloom in the German economy. However, failure to reach agreement will compound the sense of political drift which is reinforcing the current recession. The reason the issue is so complex is that it seeks not only to finance the huge cash transfers needed (around DM150bn (Pounds 63.5bn) a year from west to east) to revive the collapsed east German economy, but also to integrate the eastern states into the overall system which shares out tax revenues between central, state and local government in the west. The debate is therefore not simply about how much cash the eastern Lander need, but far more about who will pay for it. It is a question of the Bund (central government), the Lander or, most probably, the taxpayer. Can cash for the east be provided by savings in the west, by raising taxes, or by borrowing? And who will take the blame? At the heart of the negotiations will be the so-called Landerfinanzausgleich: the financing 'equalisation' system which divides up tax revenues and underpins the basic federal relationship between the central government and the powerful Lander. They do not have any power to raise taxes, depending on the central government to do it for them. The equalisation system first allocates tax revenues between Bonn and the Lander, and then divides them again to ensure that the poorest areas of the country do not lose out to the richest. The main tax where the division is reasonably flexible is value added tax, currently shared 63 per cent for the Bund, and 37 per cent for the Lander. The question is who gets what in future. The system has creaked along ever since the foundation of the Federal Republic, transferring cash from wealthy states like Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and Hesse, to the poorer states like the Saarland, Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein. The trouble is that the advent of the five new states has brought not only a vastly increased financial requirement, without a healthy tax base, but also five much poorer regions into the system. So the poorest western states look like suddenly losing a big slice of their previous income, and having to pay more in direct transfers to the east as well. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has come up with a tax-and-savings package to bridge the DM110bn financing gap identified for 1995. He wants DM60bn to transfer directly to the Lander in the east to run their budgets; DM40bn to service an estimated DM400bn in debts inherited from the old East Germany and the Treuhand privatisation agency; and DM10bn to finance continuing industrial restructuring to pay off housing debts and to maintain subsidies for the poorest states in the west - the city of Bremen and the Saarland. Mr Waigel has agreed to pay the full DM40bn debt service from federal funds. As for the rest, he wants the western states to finance some DM32bn, while the central government would shoulder the balance - estimated at some DM38bn. His plan will almost certainly be unpicked over the coming days. It has caused consternation among the Lander: the easterners say DM60bn is not enough to keep them going, and the westerners say they cannot afford to pay anything like DM32bn as their contribution. In spite of their differences, the Lander have agreed on a strategy: to get Mr Waigel (the central government) to pay the lion's share. Instead of getting just 37 per cent of VAT receipts, the states want 45 per cent, an increase of some DM20bn. Then the eastern states can have the whole increase, they say. They will agree to a modest package of spending cuts, while the government will have to raise taxes to bridge the remaining gap. If they cannot agree on adequate savings, then the public sector deficit may have to increase a bit further, the states propose. It all sounds painful for taxpayers who would be asked to cough up a new 'solidarity surcharge' in the coming months, and for Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel, who have promised no tax increase before 1995. Yet if Mr Kohl wants a deal, it may be close to what he will have to accept: a willingness for the central government to take on most of the DM110bn burden, and raise income taxes, if not this year, then in 1994. He can always blame the Lander, and the opposition Social Democrats, when it comes to the next elections at the end of the year. For at the end of the day, he knows that an inadequate solidarity pact will be better than no pact at all.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Branson buys out Japanese partner MR RICHARD Branson has reinforced his control of Virgin Atlantic Airways by buying out the airline's Japanese partner, Seibu Saison, for about Pounds 40m-Pounds 50m. Seibu Saison, the Japanese hotel, retailing and leisure group, has held a 10 per cent stake in Virgin Traveller, the airline's parent company, since 1989. It had an option to buy an additional 10 per cent stake to bring its holding in Virgin Atlantic to 20 per cent. The Japanese company was planning to exercise this option this month, but Mr Branson decided to buy them out to regain 100 per cent control of the airline. Virgin also confirmed yesterday that Mr Branson was investing an additional USDollars 150m (Pounds 102m) in his airline operations to finance fleet expansion, development of new long-distance routes to Hong Kong and San Francisco next year, and the introduction of electronic entertainment equipment on his airline services. Mr Branson appears to have felt the Japanese company was no longer the best partner to help him develop his airline business. Instead, he is considering negotiating new marketing agreements with other big international carriers in the US and Asia while consolidating his ownership. Two years ago, Mr Branson considered selling up to 40 per cent of his airline to outside investors, but he has now shelved these plans. Since the Pounds 560m sale of his Virgin music business to Thorn EMI in March, 1992, he has refocused his business interests on computer game activities in retail operations and his airline. The Dollars 150m he is investing in the airline from the proceeds of the Thorn EMI sale will go towards financing an offer for two Boeing 747-500 jumbo jets he is taking on lease from the Californian-based ILFC aircraft leasing group, and for four Airbus A-340 long range airliners he is acquiring through lease-purchase agreements from the European Airbus consortium. These lease-purchase agreements give him the option of buying the equity in the A-340 aircraft when the lease expires. Virgin is also investing heavily to upgrade the electronic entertainments on board its aircraft, including the introduction of electronic gambling.</p>

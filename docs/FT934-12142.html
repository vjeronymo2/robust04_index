			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Decrease forecast for cereal harvest THE Ministry of Agriculture's first estimate of the UK cereals harvest is 19.7m tonnes, down 2.4m tonnes (11 per cent) on last year's 22.1m, mainly as a result of set-aside. The figure is based on the provisional results of the first 1993 farm-based Cereals Production Survey of England and Wales and on preliminary production estimates from Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

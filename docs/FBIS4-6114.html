			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 15 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- According  to the public opinion poll conducted by the Movement for  Renewing the Union of Mongolian Students (UMS) with embracing  some 650 students from six largest universities and colleges of  the country, the majority of them are accusing the UMS of  over-politicization regarding its activities which does not  correspond to its rules. The UMS is actively participating in  the political struggle supporting the MDA [Mongolian Democratic  Association] and other oppositional parties who is blaming the  government for corruption and incompetence and stands for its  resignation. The political situation in the country is becoming  heated and lasting for three daylong is the hunger strike of a  group of representatives of the opposition at the main square of  the capital. The most of respondents are in favour of  renovation of activities, structure and composition of the UMS  considering the leadership of the organization fails to express  and protect the fundamental interests of the student youth.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Clinton takes message straight to the people IF Mr Bill Clinton wanted to demonstrate that there are more ways of communicating a message than via the Washington press corps, then his first televised presidential 'town meeting' in Detroit on Wednesday night was, on balance, a success. The president made little hard news as such, beyond confirming such known trends in his thinking as the likelihood of higher corporate and personal income taxes for the more profitable and affluent. Sacrifice, he argued, had to be shared fairly. The fact that he had inherited a federal budget deficit Dollars 50bn (Pounds 35bn) higher than he had been led to believe meant that sacrifice, in higher taxes and spending cuts, was unavoidable. But he again displayed his singular talent, much in evidence throughout the election campaign last year and in the economic session at Little Rock in December, for ex-plaining complex policy issues in easily understandable terms. The best example of this came when he was asked by a teenager suffering from systemic lupus, a chronic ailment, how people with similar conditions could be assured of acquiring the sort of long-term health insurance cover that was being denied her. Mr Clinton sympathetically answered that the key was the size of the insurance pool. If small, like the 60 or so people in the TV studio, then it only took one or two people with long-term illnesses to bankrupt the pool. But, if the community pool was big enough, 'the risk of your care is spread across large numbers of people and insurance companies make money the way grocery stores do - a little bit of money on a lot of people instead of a lot of money on a few people.' Other presidents have used this folksy approach to good effect - notably Franklin Roosevelt in his radio 'fireside chats' of the Depression era and Ronald Reagan in his regular Saturday morning broadcasts, also on radio. Mr Clinton is continuing the Reagan custom, as did President George Bush, though to much less effect. Intended to focus mostly on economic and related social policy issues - and involving studio audiences in Detroit, Seattle, Atlanta and Miami  - the town meeting covered much other ground, including the admission of homosexuals to the US military and the latest US initiative in Bosnia. However, the only question on the controversy of Mr Clinton's failure to find an attorney-general came from one of the media interlocutors. The media reviews yesterday morning were mixed-to-favourable. The Washington Post said Mr Clinton had been put on the defensive by sharp general questioning about his breaking of campaign promises ranging from middle-class tax cuts to policy on Haiti. But the New York Times found that he seemed at ease in the familiar format and successfully got his key messages across. The Wall Street Journal said: 'With his strong presence, he appeared to be resuscitating his fortunes after a period of heavy criticism.' The Washington press corps is becoming agitated in that Mr Clinton has yet to give a formal presidential press conference, though his staff insist, with some justification, that there have been plenty of opportunities to question him. It is a fair bet, however, that the town meeting format will be used again and again.</p>

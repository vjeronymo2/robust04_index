			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFACEMENT SUIT AGAINST PRIEST  </P> <P> A recent article by Bob Secter ("Priest Fights Liquor, Cigarette Billboards,"  Part A, Aug. 18) calls into question The Times' longstanding policy of printing  balanced, unbiased news stories.  </P> <P> Secter presents the case of Father Michael Pfleger who will stand trial for  vandalism and battery.  </P> <P> Father Pfleger has been accused of defacing outdoor signs and throwing paint on  the owner of a billboard company.  </P> <P> The article cites his actions as "an echo of a civil-rights theme from the days  of lunch counter sit-ins and bus boycotts." Nonviolent protests of the '60s are  far from the premeditated defacing of property and battery charges served on  Father Pfleger.  </P> <P> With all due respect for Father Pfleger, the fact that he is charged with  defacing public property and battery must not be downplayed nor made to seem as  acceptable behavior. Both cigarettes and alcohol are legal products and  companies have the right to advertise. One may not use or even like the product  being advertised, but that doesn't excuse criminal conduct.  </P> <P> Protest is one thing, but extremist activities displayed by Father Pfleger sets  the wrong kind of example for communities to follow. What has happened to the  process of negotiation, of sitting down with the involved parties and reaching  a solution?  </P> <P> JOHN R.

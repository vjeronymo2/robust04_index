			<p>SUMMARY                                   A set of labor regulations Pyongyang has recently decreed  provides for the pervasive presence of North Korean bureaucrats  in any special economic zones on North Korean territory, for the  ostensible purpose of protecting North Korean workers from  potential foreign exploitation.  The new regulations seem  designed more to address conservative misgivings about such zones  than to attract foreign businesses and could even serve to  discourage foreign investment in North Korea.                                END SUMMARY     The regulations, decreed on 30 December and carried in full by  the North Korean news agency KCNA on II January, give what  amounts to  supervisory powers over "foreign funded enterprises"  to North Korean government organs and "trade unions."  Under the  regulations, foreign-funded enterprises--joint-ventures and  foreign-owned establishments--which would presumably operate in  the Tumen free trade zone now under construction, will be subject  to the following controls:     + Foreigners may be employed only with Pyongyang's approval.     + North Koreans must be hired under the supervision of the local  "labor administration" to assure that they are hired through  local "labor service agencies" and that "primary attention" is  paid to securing "safe, cultural, and hygienic" working  conditions in order to "protect and promote" workers' "lives and  health."  In this regard, foreign enterprises are required to  "organize and operate nurseries and kindergartens."  They "can"  also run "sanatoriums and holiday homes," sponsor "mass culture  and sports" activities, and fund unspecified welfare facilities-  -all in addition to providing workers with "labor protection  tools, working necessities, and nutritious food."     + North Korean workers may not be dismissed without a month's  notice and approval by "trade unions "--over which the regime  presumably exercises some control--and by the local labor service  agency, and under the penalty of fines.     Conservative Voice     The regulations seem primarily designed to  mollify conservatives whose ostensible concern about the specter  of foreign exploitation of North Korean yorkers have been  indirectly raised in North Korean media.   Signs that some in the  North Korean leadership continue to harbor misgivings about  special economic zones surfaced publicly three days after the  KCNA announcement of the new labor regulations.  In a commentary  criticizing ROK President Kim Yong-sam's economic policies,  Pyongyang radio on 14 January ridiculed the South Korean economy  as consisting of "the vulnerable colonial subjugated economy"  capable only of "bonded processing trade with others' capital,  technology, facilities, and materials"--precisely the type of  arrangement that the Tumen basin project is aimed at.     1 See the Trends of 28 October 1992, pages 31-34.     Implications     While it is possible that those in the DPRK  leadership pressing for foreign capital investment have  overestimated the attractiveness of North Korea's cheap labor, it  is more likely that they found that the stringently restrictive  provisions were the only way to enlist the conservatives to go  along with the special economic zone plan.  Either way, the new  labor regulations may discourage foreign enterprises from  investing in North Korea even after the nuclear issue is  resolved.  (AUTHOR:  YIM.

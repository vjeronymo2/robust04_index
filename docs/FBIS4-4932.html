			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- The construction of the  express highway stretching more than 120 kilometres from  Pyongyang to Hyangsan, where scenic Mt. Myohyang is situated, is  progressing at a high speed in the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea.    The project has been undertaken by soldiers. They have  completed road-bed building in many sections, and are  accelerating the construction of bridges and structures.    The soldiers of the Sin Il-nam unit of the Korean People's  Security Forces carried out over 50 percent of the projects  assigned to them, excavating hundreds of thousands of cubic  metres of earth and tamping tens of thousands of cubic metres of  concrete in the first three months of the year.    The Yun In-ok unit is these days transporting more than  5,000  cubic metres of earth every day by raising the utility rate of  rolling stock and excavating equipment to the maximum. They  have carried out over 65 percent of earth work in recent several  months.    The soldiers of the Kim Hyong-guk unit in charge of bridge  building are increasing the speed of construction while saving  large quantities of steel and cement, by introducing new  building methods.</p>

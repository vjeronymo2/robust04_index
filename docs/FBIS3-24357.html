			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Dialogue between Petr Romanov and Aleksandr Prokhanov; </F> place and date not given: "A Russian Engineer, I Was Forced To  Become a Politician..."]    [Text] [Prokhanov] In the definition of a political friend  of mine, you, Petr Vasilyevich, are a rapidly rising political  star. I heard about you long ago, but we met only this winter,  bitter and formidable, when I came to Siberia, to your native  Krasnoyarsk. The center of Siberian industry was dying, like a  beached whale. And only your plant--it is hard to call it a  plant, it is a small civilization, a city within a city--was  continuing to live, struggle, breathe, and fight. We exchanged  our values, our ideology, for the first time then.    You are a technocrat. This is a rarity, a find, for the  patriotic movement. Members of the opposition are liberal arts  figures, philologists, legal scholars, and historians, as a  rule. You, though, are the bearer of immense production  engineering knowledge and organizational experience. You are  linked with modernity, with industry, with the idea of  technotronic development. Your activity in the Russian National  Assembly and proximity to the top opposition leaders have  created for you a firm reputation as a state absolutist and  Russian patriot.    You became a politician. You became a member of this hastily  formed institution of power--the Federation Council. You  essentially won the fight with Shumeyko for in order to  forestall you he had to accumulate all the influence of the  president and the prime minister backing him.    What do you, a Siberian, a plant director, an industrialist,  feel, having found yourself in this cauldron of new Moscow  politics? Your feelings from interaction with this environment?    [Romanov] I never previously felt myself to be a politician.  This is now the most dangerous period of my life. Military  pilots say: "Watch out for them winging you during takeoff."  They did not. Figuratively speaking, I am as yet gaining  cruising speed. Then it will be time for the plans which I  brought with me here and which I would like to embody via the  Federation Council. Decent people have been elected. I will  contribute to their philosophy the spirit of the  military-industrial complex.    When, prior to the vote on the candidates for the position  of  chairman of the Federation Council, I was asked whether I had  any experience of parliamentary business, I replied honestly  that I did not. I have now built up some such experience. It is  negative: The political forces with which I have come into  contact and the institutions I have entered are not all that  disposed to work for national unification. I mean by this the  mutual understanding and interaction of all who wish to survive  in Russia and make it great. Political persons and the conflicts  connected with them are ultimately transient. How many there  have been.... And if the country stands, has not crumbled, state  instincts are still, consequently, alive. It is simply that they  just cannot become policy and ideology.    Unification is occurring as yet merely within institutions  and parties and groups of politicians. Even recently the  patriots were sharply criticizing the State Duma for  amorphousness and conciliation. But the Duma, without even  touching on the subject of the amnesty, has shown that the most  diverse politicians are disposed to act together in strategic  areas. Were this unification to go beyond the framework of  parties and institutions, I would feel better in Moscow politics.    As far as my technocratic experience, as you put it, is  concerned, I met with many plant outfits in Krasnoyarsk and  heard one and the same thing everywhere: "We have to work." The  plants are buckling under the arrears, and wages have not been  paid for months--and people are working, they want to work. This  cannot be said of Moscow politicians.    A Russian engineer, I was forced to become a politician.    [Prokhanov] You speak about unification, the composition of  the efforts of the parties, the composition of the tendencies of  politicians, each of whom has his own vector, his own political  pace, his own experience of catastrophe or victory. I, and not  only myself, am tormented by one question. For three or four  years we patriots have been attempting to compose a party of  national interests, a patriotic party based on the national idea.    It cannot be said that these attempts appear absolutely  barren. Small political formations: the Russian Revival Party,  the Russian Party of Mikhail Korchagin, have been formed. The  Slav Assembly has been created. Among the most dynamic is  Russian National Unity. There was the attempt to create the  Russian National Assembly, in which you actively participated.  The National Salvation Front was squashed. All other attempts  are coming to naught. Everything is confined to a conference, a  congress, at which declarations are made, then organizational  apathy sets in, all movements come to a halt....    Why are we unsuccessful here? Is it not because unduly  blurred, unduly archaic political formulas such as  "Orthodoxy-autocracy-national character" or "Russian solidarity"  are made the basis of them, these parties and their ideology?  Today's Russia is a multidimensional pulsating structure, in  which each region has its own version of the Russian idea.    In addition, the present Russia does not have a traditional  look. It is oriented toward the future. Perhaps none of these  pariahs has a future image, all their values are too tied to the  past, and they are unable to adapt tradition to history and  actual policy?    [Romanov] But in just the same way it has not been possible  to create a "presidential" party either. Comminution is a  feature of Russian politics. The communists are fragmented, like  the democrats also. What significance have all these Moscow  parties for the ordinary man? Go to the periphery, as they say  in Moscow, call in at a shop or a cowshed, and ask if only:  "What is the Constitutional Court, who is on it?" It is not  known. Even less is anything known about patriotic politicians.    I see as the solution for the patriots the creation of a  supra-party bloc based on the center parties with a negligible  tilt to the left, but under no circumstances to the right. The  leaders of parties and movements should step beyond party  ambitions, sit down at the table, and come to some agreement.  This supra-party bloc of politicians should go to the people  with an intelligible program of national salvation. I do not  believe that its success would depend on how far it operated  with outmoded ideologies and how it modernized the  "Orthodoxy-autocracy-national character" principle. It would  depend on whom it persuaded: the Moscow "mass meeting" or those  who have their hands on the levers of the economy and power.    Such a program is a latent need of both the opposition and  the authorities. I heard and read the president's speech in the  Federal Assembly. Even he, having become, according to the new  constitution, the head of state, is now uttering words  inconceivable from his mouth three or four months ago. He has  willy-nilly been forced to size up the situation in the country  and to construct his--albeit deficient, hypocritical--program in  conformity with it.    The president spoke in sufficient detail about what needs to  be done. But everyone knows this, as it is, I believe. Were an  opposition supra-party bloc to explain how it should be done, it  would have a chance to win.    The politicians who are a part of the bloc must necessarily  identify stages and arrange landmarks en route to the  goal--promise-landmarks. After all, Khrushchev's "the present  generation of Soviet people will live under communism" was not  fortuitous. It showed that these authorities understood the  importance of the possession, in your definition, Aleksandr  Andreyevich, of a future image, albeit "incorrect." They, the  politicians, must not be afraid to take on themselves--to the  extent of their influence--economic assignments also. Set them  six months ahead, say, providing them with resources....    [Prokhanov] I listened to the president's speech with a  double feeling, catching in his vocabulary all the words and  ideas that we patriots have over three years formulated and  offered society and for which we have acquired the title of  "conservatives" and "red-browns." He outlined distinctly, in  party and oblast party committee fashion, the contours of the  catastrophe that has struck Russia. He omitted just one thing:  who created the catastrophe. Or was it these "red-browns" who  brought the country to disintegration, the stoppage of the  plants, the exorbitant prices?    Each day on my way to work I pass the Frunzenskaya  Embankment, I see daily the enormous Buran--the Russian  spacecraft--reminiscent of a once beautiful, but now dead,  creature. I was at Baykonur when Buran, having accomplished an  unmanned space circuit, landed on the scorching pad. I remember  the exultant face of Oleg Baklanov, I remember my own  exultation: my state ruled in near-Earth space....    And now Buran has been trotted out posthumously as a  laughing-stock. What will be made from it: a bordello, a  restaurant, a public restroom? It is like spoils taken on the  field of battle from the vanquished USSR.    So let us be told who the author of this catastrophe is. Let  us be told that it was wrought by Gaydar and Yeltsin, Fedorov  and Shumeyko.    Two symptomatic blabbings have been agitating minds as of  late. On the eve of Clinton's visit the following political  formula appeared in the American press and was relayed to Russia  by CNN: "America will have to choose between the shock therapy  of Gaydar, which, of course, would weaken Russia to the United  States' advantage, and a new, more moderate policy, which would  preserve Russian potential to some extent, but would protect  Russia against a social explosion which could sweep away the  supporters of reforms."    And recently Gavriil Popov, the superdemocrat, published a  program perceived as an attempt to crawl from beneath the rubble  of the present political period. He acknowledges in this program  that Gaydar's shock therapy was thought up by the Americans to  destroy Russia's military-industrial complex.    This was said when our submarines stand fast at the piers,  when the missile and tank plants are at a standstill, and when  the test ranges are dying, military supertechnology is  disintegrating, and young intellectuals are going into commerce  and pimping. This was said by Popov, whose contribution to the  collapse was immense.    So why do you members of parliament not name publicly the  culprits of the catastrophe before embarking on the restoration  of Russia?    [Romanov] Why are we not delivering angry philippics against  the "regime"? Well, we ourselves, the corps of directors, are to  blame for what has happened. And now we face the prospect of a  shutdown of production--not random, not partial, but total. This  would signify the collapse of the economy and statehood and  national catastrophe.    Yes, Gaydar and Fedorov have gone. Were we to shout curses  after them, we would have to back them up with action also. Stop  the plants? Trigger a directors' strike? What's the use....    Our real fault is that we are today, now, not saying, not  venturing to tell Chernomyrdin, Soskovets, and Gerashchenko:  "Stop. Let's take a look. We acknowledge that on account of a  number of Russia's geographical and geopolitical circumstances a  market economy may be created even theoretically only in  European Russia, along the Trans-Siberian Railroad, at that. We  acknowledge that we need a transitional period, that we will not  crawl out of the present pit without emergency economic  measures. And for this reason the present inflationary drift,  when only the idle are not managing to shake money loose from  the cabinet, is intolerable. A realistic program of salvation  and reconstruction of the dying economy is needed."    [Prokhanov] I know that you, Petr Vasilyevich, are working  on  a multitude of program documents. Could you not briefly give us  the essence of this transitional period and these emergency  measures and the methodology with which it is possible to halt  the catastrophe and undertake the plastic transformation of our  tormented economy into a new quality connected with development.    [Romanov] Russia has two paths, in my view.    The first is to "pupate," to go into isolation, and to  tackle  all problems, technological and structural modernization  included, thanks only to our own internal resources, becoming a  strong national state. Russia should imbibe, figuratively  speaking, the umbilical cords, protruding from its body, of the  defunct empire, lines of communication, and infrastructure that  linked it only recently with the former Soviet republics. But  this would take, considering the scale of the present collapse,  60-70 years.    The second is to accept the role of "raw material" state  being imposed by the "world community," making in this sense a  temporary concession. Russia would export raw material and  import technology and would one day once again become a strong,  but not isolated, national state, slowly once again assembling  the empire.    Unless a benign political miracle occurs, the actual  development of Russia will choose a path between these two not  all that optimistic options.    What emergency measures are possible in these contours?  Regardless of the forms of property, it is necessary to  administer in centralized fashion in conjunction with the  territories all the extractive sectors, power engineering,  transport, and foreign economic activity.    It is essential to introduce strict price control of the  economy via a lowering of outlays in the production sectors and  differentiated tax rates for brokerage, commercial, financial,  and banking services. A consolidated government contract by  sector is needed simultaneously. We would in this way  immediately be giving the Russian manufacturer priority. He  would henceforward know precisely what profit he would make in  production, and what, in commerce, and how much he would lose in  taxes.    All investment funds, banks, and other similar financial  institutions should be adroitly oriented toward investment in  efficient works with a necessary government guarantee in the  event of a failure to achieve the contemplated efficiency.    It does not need to be said that the activity of the State  Property Committee and the Antitrust Committee of the Russian  Federation would be suspended for the period of the emergency  measures.    It is essential to sharply limit, to "suppress," imports of  consumer goods, primarily durables, if, of course, these  prohibitions do not entail the danger of starvation. Each bottle  of Italian mineral water on the Krasnoyarsk shelves means a  dollar not invested in the Russian economy. And investments have  declined in Russia by a factor of six or seven since 1991 as it  is. This, incidentally, is a special problem barely soluble  within the framework of emergency measures alone.    It is necessary also to establish sectoral wage  differentiation, movement beyond the framework of which should  entail severe penalties.    Finally, for the Russians coming to us from the near abroad  we need to create jobs in the agro-industrial zones which are  promising from the viewpoint of the market economy. The move  should, of course, be undertaken in planned fashion, with the  simultaneous closure of works that have no future.    [Prokhanov] This is akin to a plan for the restoration of  the  national economy after a war. It creates an ideological field,  toward which the people are predisposed. The people must  understand that they have been bombed to destruction. And that  we will have to restore the devastated cities and lines of  communication and also human relations by way of the injection  in the restoration of the surplus quantity of our own calories.    [Romanov] Yes, belt-tightening once again, for the umpteenth  time.... Agrarian problems were discussed recently in a  committee of the upper house of parliament. I said that no  government financial injections would in themselves save the  situation. We need a program of salvation of the agrarian  complex--as specific as possible, for a year or 18 months to two  years. And for the sake of it, this program, we would tighten  our belts. And the people would understand were there at least  some changes for the better in two years.    [Prokhanov] You have spoken about the creation of a national  political alliance, a congress of politicians, and have drawn  its boundaries, in which tremendous political potential is  condensed. It means, most likely, not only politicians and their  parties and allies but also vast social groups and classes. The  working class, peasantry, technical and liberal arts  intelligentsia, and even the new bourgeoisie to some extent. On  what kind of base do you conceive of the creation of this  alliance? On the basis of the State Duma or in the garb of a new  political super-organization?    [Romanov] We need to think sooner about ideology than about  organization and to find comprehensible, plastic slogans  explaining reality and outlining--once again I avail myself of  your term, Aleksandr Andreyevich--a future image, an image of  the near future.    After all, whatever one's attitude toward the Bolsheviks, it  has to be admitted that ideologically they operated very  dexterously in 1917. They did not say that they had appointed  Russia "to set alight the fire of world revolution." They said:  "Peace to the peoples, the land to the peasants, the plants and  factories to the workers!"    We should be understood by all: from the nationally oriented  "bourgeois" to the retirees who are living by begging. The  "bourgeois" need to be told that if they begin to build national  industry, they will be exempted from taxes. And they do not need  to be told what this means. If, however, they start simply to  "turn over money," the financial inspector will have them in his  clutches. And only this way, not the other way about. We will  offer retirees selective social programs. And so forth.    So if such a program is taken up, I am prepared on my  responsibility to formulate and put into practice what my city  and my sector need. Not debate, it is necessary, I repeat, to do  something and to know how to do it.    [Prokhanov] You are a general director. You should lead a  technocratic train into this political bloc. You have the  authority of a man and the subtle internal laws and tendencies  of the corps of directors. I have, I confess, long ceased to  understand what is happening in it....    [Romanov] The same as in the country.    [Prokhanov] In the good old days I knew this very stratum of  directors. I saw their tragedy, the smashing of the corps of  directors in Gorbachev's times. At first they came to elect  them, the directors, gave them over to be torn to pieces by the  mob....    [Romanov] Remember how Gorbachev on many occasions said in  public: Let's fall on the bureaucracy together, we, from above,  you, the people, from below?    [Prokhanov] Yes, this was the first blow at the base stratum  of the Soviet state. The directors then came to be persecuted,  and they were declared the "principal conservatives" and the  exponents of the "communist conspiracy." They were defamed as,  virtually, the "second structure after the KGB impeding  perestroyka." While having sustained heavy losses, the corps of  directors withstood these two blows, nonetheless.    Subsequently, against their wishes, the directors awoke one  day as multi-millionaires, virtually. The oblast property  committees appointed for them super-high salaries, and they were  permitted via easily obtainable licenses to engage in the  commercial exportation of products overseas.    [Romanov] But, despite this, the directors held the work  force together and prevented it disintegrating. Nor do they all  have such super-high salaries--in my circle, at least.    [Prokhanov] But as of late many of the directors whom I know  have had the constant feeling that this "small social world" at  the enterprises is on the verge of disintegration. The directors  are cringing beneath the sullen looks of the workers....    [Romanov] They are right to have this feeling, possibly.  After all, for the past eight years the authorities have done  everything to keep the directors out of politics and to ensure  that they not perceive their responsibility for the enterprise  on the scale of the association, the main administration, the  sector, or the economy as a whole and that they get used to  feeling that they are "on their own."    I remember Kremlin meetings under Gorbachev and Silayev.  Even  then we directors were speaking at the top of our voices about  the crisis, about how to get out of it. There was a great deal  of talk, but nothing was done. Subsequently various forces on a  multitude of occasions attempted to place the directors beneath  the most diverse political banners. Ultimately they threw up  their hands and concentrated on the problems of their own  enterprises. And it was at this moment that they ceased to be  for the workers representatives of the state at their  enterprise, and they have not yet become regular capitalist  bosses.    Nonetheless, you are right: The corps of directors is still  a  real force incorporating also an organized structure, possession  of the keys to technology, and a social infrastructure. And for  this reason the struggle for it will continue.    [Prokhanov] Volskiy's attempt to capture the affections of  the corps of directors, accumulate it in the Party of  Industrialists, and create a political battering-ram from the  directors is the best known. Against the background of  Tizyakov's aborted attempt, it appeared successful for some  time. Tizyakov was dislodged from politics after August 1991.  Volskiy evaporated in October 1993.    Quite recently Skokov held in your parts, Krasnoyarsk, a  congress of the Federation of Commodity Producers of Russia. I  saw him after this. He is a strong politician and a connoisseur  of the corps of directors, but he is by no means certain of the  success of his mission--the national consolidation of the  technocrats.    Is it possible, in your view, to consolidate the directors  politically and teach them to uphold the political interests of  their corporation, not only of the economic lobbies? And who  could do this? The directors have been rejecting one leader  after another....    [Romanov] Permit me to disagree: First of all, it is not a  question of leaders but of ideology. Only ideology drives the  army, only thanks to ideology do the lines of communication run,  only it consolidates the classes. But the directors cannot have  their own, "directors'" ideology. But there is formally no  official ideology either. It is not known whether statehood  itself exists or not.    It seems to me that we need only say the word, the main  word.  Pose the problems on whose resolution the corps of directors,  sober-minded government officers administering territories and  fearing a social explosion, and national entrepreneurs could  consolidate.    A mobilization plan is needed for the salvation of Russia.  And it is in it, in this plan, that an "informal" official  ideology, an official instinct, should be manifested. And I am  afraid that if in the coming weeks what I have attempted to  formulate is not stated publicly, this initiative will have been  intercepted.</p>

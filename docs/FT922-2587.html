			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Navy to scrap tactical nuclear weapons BRITAIN is to scrap its seaborne tactical nuclear weapons, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said yesterday. Royal Navy ships and carrier-borne aircraft and Royal Air Force maritime patrol aircraft will no longer carry bombs and nuclear depth charges. Britain's strategic nuclear deterrent of Polaris submarines, and their replacement, the Tridents, that are due to enter service in the mid 1990s, are not affected. The RAF keeps its nuclear bombs on Tornado aircraft. Plans for a successor to the existing bomb are unaffected by yesterday's decision. The announcement comes on the eve of a visit by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to Washington to discuss arms reductions as well as economic aid. Mr Rifkind said the timing of the announcement was not related to Mr Yeltsin's visit. Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Moscow periodically demanded that British and French strategic nuclear weapons be included in any further reductions in nuclear arms by the US and the Soviet Union. These demands were rejected repeatedly by the British and French governments. The two governments argued that they would allow their strategic nuclear forces to become part of an east-west arms deal only when the US and the Soviet Union had sharply reduced their own nuclear weapon stocks. Less has been heard of this matter since the break-up of the Soviet Union, which has been succeeded by Russia as the main nuclear power in the Commonwealth of Independent States. But there can be little doubt that yesterday's announcement by the government can only help London to resist any further demands of this nature by the Russians. The move means that the government has announced reductions in the UK's non-strategic nuclear defences of more than half since last September. 'This is a further indication that we live in a changed world,' said Mr Rifkind. He said the cuts were not part of any treaty obligation. 'It is a decision that we ourselves have taken.' The cuts affect more than the weapons. Training of crews and detailed certification of equipment will end. The UK-built weapons will be returned to the Atomic Weapons Establishment near Aldermaston in Berkshire and dismantled. Those built in the US and deployed by the RAF will be returned to the US. Some of the weapons, carried on Lynx and Sea King helicopters, have not been deployed since last autumn, when Mr Tom King, Mr Rifkind's predecessor, said they would no longer be on Royal Navy ships 'in normal circumstances'. The US-built bombs, which are deployed on RAF Nimrod surveillance aircraft, were not part of that announcement. Scrapping the seaborne weapons is unlikely to result in short-term cost savings because of the increased workload in dismantling the weapons. The decision follows a rethink by Nato last autumn on the balance of nuclear and conventional forces. At the time, it announced cuts in nuclear forces including the withdrawal of US nuclear depth charges from Nato maritime patrol aircraft.</p>

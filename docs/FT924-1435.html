			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Trade News: EC says Japan must open up legal and financial services MR Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, said yesterday Japan should not regard agriculture as 'the only issue' in the Uruguay Round of trade talks and should be ready to make concessions in areas such as legal and financial services. The controversy within Japan over a likely relaxation of the rice import ban as part of a Uruguay Round settlement has dominated Mr Andriessen's two-day visit to Tokyo, but he sought to draw attention to a range of other outstanding issues. Mr Andriessen said Japanese banking and insurance regulations still unfairly limit the activities of foreign institutions. He said import controls should be lifted on foodstuffs, leather and footwear as part of the multilateral negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'Financial services have always been a key area in the Gatt agreement,' he said. 'In Europe, we have the most open financial services market in the world, and we want others to give us fair treatment.' On rice, Mr Andriessen yesterday met Mr Masami Tanabu, agriculture minister, who defended Japanese farmers' interests. While other Japanese ministers indicated that the government will be 'flexible' on rice, Mr Tanabu said a market opening was unlikely. But Mr Andriessen's general impression after his round of the ministries was that the 'mood is there' for a market opening, but that the Japanese government must act quickly on rice, and other issues, to ensure the momentum of the talks is maintained. Meanwhile, officials of the US trade representative's office and Japan's justice ministry yesterday held talks in Tokyo on improving business opportunities for foreign lawyers in the heavily regulated Japanese market.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXTS LABELED MORBID, EVIL WILL GO BACK TO PUBLISHER;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: EAST WHITTIER SCHOOL DISTRICT SAYS IT DID NOT RECEIVE THE BOOKS THAT  WERE ADVERTISED BY THE PUBLISHER. SCHOOLS ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIND REPLACEMENT  READING TEXTS.  </P> <P> East Whittier School District officials gathered cardboard boxes Tuesday to  ship a controversial series of elementary school reading texts, labeled morbid  and evil by some parents, back to the publisher.  </P> <P> The district has also directed its lawyer to demand a $160,000 refund for the  texts from publisher Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston of Canada Ltd., Supt. Dorothy  Fagan said.  </P> <P> The actions came after the school board met Monday night and decided during a  long, closed-door session that the publisher breached its contract by sending  the district books that were different from what it had advertised last spring.  </P> <P> Officials for the publishing company said they would not comment on the matter  until the firm's president returns from a business trip today and reviews the  issue.  </P> <P> According to Janet Hoyt, curriculum coordinator for the 7,000-student district,  many of the controversial stories -- including tales about monsters who  decapitate children and about excrement-eating pigs -- were not in the sample  editions district officials reviewed and approved.  </P> <P> District administrators said they did not realize that they had received the  wrong books until the controversy surfaced several weeks ago in the Hacienda La  Puente Unified School District, where educators also received books different  from those they had ordered.  </P> <P> The Hacienda La Puente school board temporarily banned the books last month  until the issue can be studied. The board is expected to hear a report at its  Dec. 7 meeting.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, teachers and administrators in east Whittier are scrambling to find  alternative texts. The district no longer has the books teachers used before  the series, titled "Impressions," was purchased last spring, Hoyt said.  </P> <P> The mix-up, school officials said, caught them by surprise.  </P> <P> "It's like buying a Cadillac and getting a Ford," Fagan said.  </P> <P> "Now we don't have a text, and there's no money for new books," John Fulford,  the president of the East Whittier Teachers' Assn., said. "Pulling the  textbooks messes up every teacher's curriculum, and it will keep us dangling in  the wind next year. This will take years to settle. They should have just left  us alone to do our jobs."  </P> <P> Some schools are using library books and reserve resource books, officials  said. Other schools are trying to raise enough money to buy paperbacks.  </P> <P> "The board made the decision and we respect that," Jenifer Mac Lowry, a  third-grade teacher, said. "The teachers now are looking for ways to make the  best out of it."  </P> <P> Mac Lowry said a special book-selection committee, including teachers and  district officials, spent three years reviewing texts before choosing the  "Impressions" series. Starting over, she said, will be difficult.  </P> <P> Some parents in the Hacienda La Puente and the East Whittier districts have  said the texts evoke devil worship and a curiosity in witchcraft. But some  educators say the series stimulates children's interest in literature.  </P> <P> During heated debates in both districts, the books have raised a conflict  between 1st Amendment rights and parents' rights to censor what their children  read.  </P> <P> "I'm a teacher and a parent," said Olivia Ramirez, who attended the  standing-room-only school board meeting in east Whittier Monday night, "and I'd  like to see the series banned. Stories like that are frightening for children.  They have a hard time separating imagination from reality."  </P></p>

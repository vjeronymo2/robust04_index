			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> 3 TOP CITY OFFICIALS OPTING OUT OF OFFICE  </P> <P> In a series of resignations described as coincidental, three top city officials  announced in the past few weeks that they will be leaving their posts.  </P> <P> Director of Public Works Bill Murphy and City Clerk Mary Ann Hanover have  retired, effective today.  </P> <P> Tom Baker, the director of community services, will leave in the next three to  four months, said Assistant City Manager George Scarborough.  </P> <P> Murphy, 57, a San Juan Capistrano resident and city employee for 17 years, said  he will work as a contract employee for the next three months. After that, he  will remain active with the city as needed, he said.  </P> <P> Murphy added that he plans to help the city finish two long-term projects: the  extension of Stonehill Drive across the Capistrano Valley from Dana Point to  the Interstate 5 Freeway that is expected to begin in the fall, and the  construction of the new bridge where Rancho Viejo Road crosses Trabuco Creek.  Bids are now being submitted on that project.  </P> <P> Hanover, a San Juan Capistrano resident and the city clerk for the past 16  years, will not stay on in any advisory capacity. Scarborough will serve as  acting city clerk.  </P> <P> "I'm going to Europe," Hanover said. "When I come back, maybe I'll think about  what I'm going to do."  </P> <P> Hanover has served nine different mayors in her time as clerk and is credited  with creating the city's organizational system and installing its employee  training program.  </P> <P> "When I came here the filing system was a rubber band around a council packet,"  she said.  </P> <P> Baker, who could not be reached for comment, has been making the transition to  private business "for the past few months," Scarborough said. Baker has  established a photographic firm that he will make a full-time business,  Scarborough said.  </P></p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK television LWT would swallow an effective poison pill by linking up with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. Such thinking is clearly uppermost in LWT's mind as it scrambles to evade the predatory Granada. Anglia, too, may be thinking similar thoughts given its own vulnerability to a bid. Shareholders would be right to reject such manoeuvres if that was their companies' sole intent. A merger between all four stations could make real industrial sense but that presupposes a further relaxation of the franchise rules. Mr Peter Brooke may have fondly imagined he had just solved the ITV ownership conundrum. Clearly not.</p>

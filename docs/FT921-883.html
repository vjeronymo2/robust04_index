			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Cricket stops trade THE market was subdued during the day, with several dealers suggesting the low levels of trade in the morning were driven by the distraction of the world cricket cup being played in Australia, writes Andrew Jack. One dealer said the match had driven many traders into pubs with televisions where they could watch the proceedings in Melbourne. The UK opinion polls continued to inject an element of uncertainty into the market, with the latest suggesting a hung parliament. One dealer argued that much of the effect of the election had already been discounted, with upward shifts in the long end reflecting the uncertainties surrounding either a Labour victory or coalition government. The overnight rate held at around 10 1/4 -10 per cent in the morning before rising slightly to 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent by the end of the day, at the same level as Tuesday's close of trading. Three-month money ended at 10 7/8 -10 3/4 , which represented a further easing of  1/16 per cent on the previous close, while one year stood at 11-10 7/8 per cent. The June sterling contract finished at 89.14 on a volume slightly above that of recent days at 29,911. That compared with an opening price of 89.01, down 4 basis points from the close on Tuesday. It fluc-tuated between 88.98 and 89.15 in transactions during the day. The Bank of England anticipated a shortage of Pounds 400m in the morning, driven mainly by Pounds 420m in bills for repurchase by the market and Pounds 269m in treasury bills and maturing assistance, offset by Pounds 395m in exchequer transactions. The Bank did not operate in the market during the morning, and revised its shortage to Pounds 250m at midday. In the afternoon it purchased bills totalling Pounds 79m in Band 1 at 10 3/8 per cent. It provided late assistance of around Pounds 30m. German call money remained at the high levels already seen earlier this week in spite of an injection of DM6bn at the securities repurchase tender. The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM11.5bn of 28-day repo funds, allocated at mostly 9.55 per cent. Call money was quoted at 9.65/70 per cent, unchanged from Tuesday. The US Federal Reserve refrained from any operations as expected since the issue of three-day system repurchase agreements on March 23.</p>

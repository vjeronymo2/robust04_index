			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelyov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- Russia has put forward a  new initiative suggesting to completely cease fire in  Nagorno-Karabakh, beginning from February 1, 1994, for a minimum  period of two-three weeks.    The Russian proposal to this effect was conveyed several  days  ago by a special representative of the Russian president,  Vladimir Kazimirov, to the Azeri President Geydar Aliyev,  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Nagorno-Karabakh  leader, Robert Kocharyan.    Depending on the reaction to this proposal by the sides  concerned further steps are envisaged to cease combat operations  in Nagorno-Karabakh. It is not ruled out that a meeting between  the warring sides will take place in Moscow during this week.    Heavy fighting with alternative success have been going on  around Nagorno-Karabakh since the second half of December, 1993.  As a result of the bloodshed, several thousands people were  reported dead and thousands others were injured, predominantly  on the side launching an offensive.    New escalation of military operations is even more pointless  because leaders of all warring sides admit that the conflict  cannot be resolved by military means and come out in favour of  its political settlement, a source from the Russian Foreign  Ministry said. The repetition of the bloodshed seriously  hampers peace-keeping efforts made both by Russia and  international organisations, the same source said.    Russia, as a mediator, seeks to bridge the gap between the  warring sides and convince them that they should immediately  sign an agreement on the cessation of armed confrontation and  prevent further destabilisation of the situation in the region.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev met with the head of  Azeri foreign policy department, Gasan Gasanov, his Armenian  counterpart, Vagan Papazyan, and a representative of the  Nagorno- Karabakh leadership, Arkady Gukasyan, in Moscow in the  second half of December, 1993.</p>

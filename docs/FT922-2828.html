			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on Irish vote Ireland's referendum on European union, which takes place on Thursday, is certain to dominate the attention of the foreign exchange markets this week, writes James Blitz. Trading in European currencies has been more volatile than usual in the fortnight since the Danes voted 'No' to the Maastricht treaty. Dealers believe that the growing troubles over the treaty make the D-Mark a more attractive currency in which to invest, because it is seen as the anchor of the European Monetary System. There may be more D-Mark buying in the run-up to the vote. If, against expectations, dealers wake up on Friday and find that the Irish have voted Maastricht down, several currencies will pay a heavy price. Among the most vulnerable are the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta and sterling. Dollar trading will continue the uncertain tone of recent days as the markets remain unsure about the scale of the US economic recovery. Last week's poor retail sales figures for May, showing a 0.2 per cent rise when 0.7 per cent was expected, will continue to hang over the market. The US trade figures for April, due out on Thursday, may influence sentiment: the market expects the March deficit of Dollars 5.8bn to narrow. The market may be too bearish about the US overall. 'There is a contradiction between the market's sentiment and fundamental analysis of the US economic figures,' says Mr Chris Dunis of Chemical Bank. 'Underlying everything, there has been an increase in demand met by de-stocking in the first quarter.' Sterling holders face a busy week of statistics. First quarter balance of payments are due out today and industrial production on Wednesday.</p>

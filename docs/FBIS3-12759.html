The  deputies, about 30 of them, believe that the Turkish Army is  waging an undeclared war on the Kurdish people by burning and  destroying their towns and villages. In a memorandum, a copy of  which was obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the deputies said that  the Turkish special forces were "hunting, persecuting, and  killing Kurdish patriots," and that "successive Turkish  governments since the Ottoman reign have continuously ignored  the existence of the Kurdish people in a foolish policy that has  failed to obliterate the Kurdish national identity."    The Syrian deputies also called on the Turkish Government to  work for a just and peaceful solution to the issue of the  Kurdish and Turkish peoples and establish links of coexistence  between them. The Syrian parliamentarians accused the Turkish  Government of imposing a terrorist fait accompli in the Kurdish  areas.    The Syrian deputies addressed their memorandum to Turkish  President Suleyman Demirel, National Assembly Speaker Husamettin  Cindoruk, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. It was handed to the  Turkish ambassador in Damascus at the embassy premises. In that  memorandum, the deputies said that reports carried by news  agencies and the Turkish media about the military operations  carried out by the Turkish Army in the east and southeast of  Turkey (Kurdistan) confirm that "what the Army is doing is  tantamount to an undeclared war against the Kurdish people and  that the police and gendarmerie forces are imposing an  unbearable situation of terror in the Kurdish areas where  patriotic and social figures are liquidated in broad daylight in  public."    The memorandum added that "this chauvinistic military and  political campaign by the Turkish Government is producing  terrifying results for the Kurdish population, a matter which  arouses extreme concern among members of the Syrian People's  Assembly and all peace- and justice-loving people. It runs  contrary to the principles of democracy and human rights which  Turkish officials claim to respect and abide by."    The memorandum urged Turkey to stop the military operations  and work for a peaceful solution because that would save it  money and blood and would enhance the links of coexistence  between the two peoples, and it would also place Turkey among  the civilized states and strengthen its role and position in the  eyes of the world public opinion.    The deputies added: "The only way to resolve peoples' issues  is dialogue and mutual understanding on the basis of recognition  of the national rights of the oppressed people."    It is worth noting that Syrian-Turkish relations often  passed  through political crises because of the position of the Kurdish  fighters and the water issue which is still pending between the  two countries. Turkey has always hinted at using the water  weapon because of what Turkey claims to be Syrian support for  the fighters of the Kurkish Workers Party, but Syria has  repeatedly and categorically denied these charges.    In their official statements, however, the two countries  reaffirm their satisfaction with the rapid and positive  development of their relations and their intention to further  expand these relations in all fields. The two sides have also  expressed satisfaction with the positive developments over the  past months regarding security issues pertaining to the long  borders between them, as a result of the spirit of cooperation  which has been confirmed and enhanced by the exchange of visits  between the interior and foreign ministers of the two countries  during which it was reaffirmed that any activity on the  territory of either of them harmful to the security of that  country would not be allowed.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Patience is the virtue - What the Financial Advisers Say AMID THE passionate arguments about the broader economy, personal financial advisers are reassuringly unanimous in the advice they are offering to savers. Virtually all of them warn that investors should be patient before reacting to this week's turbulent events in the financial markets. 'If the UK and the EC can't buck the market, I fail to see how the private investor can do so without an extraordinary slice of luck' says David Harris, of Chantrey Vellacott. 'Therefore, if you haven't taken any precipitate action, you shouldn't' John Cole, of Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, agrees. 'We are advising clients in such difficult markets to sit it out for a day or two. Missing the bottom is less dangerous than going in and seeing your capital base reduced.' A similar line comes from Peter Smith, of Hill Martin, who says: 'The crisis has shown the difference between strategy and tactics. If you have the right strategy, you shouldn't be too bothered by one day's turmoil.' Still more caution comes from Peter Hargreaves, of Hargreaves Lansdown, who says that those with funds to invest should make fixed interest their first port of call. By this he means National Savings, gilts, and guaranteed income bonds. He is not totally negative about equities but he feels private investors should not try to make a killing because the timing is so difficult. He adds: 'I always think the people who are pleased with equities are those who buy them slowly.' Cole takes a similar line. 'We are looking out for fixed-interest opportunities; the international bond market has some attractions. We see the longer-term appeal of equities, but we are attracted to the phased investment approach.' Robert Noble-Warren, of Murray Noble, also is recommending fixed-interest products. But Noble-Warren is worried that equities will continue to go through a rough patch while economic instability continues, and so is removing some clients from zero-dividend preference shares of investment trusts. These normally are regarded as very safe, but he now feels that the level of cover for their final redemption value might not be adequate in many cases. Instead, Murray Noble is buying those zeros which benefit from the strongest cover, plus guaranteed income bonds, gilts and National Savings. One adviser expects a very rapid decline in rates. Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, says: 'I would expect to see interest rates declining to between 6 and 7 per cent within a very short term. Debt distress will remain high and credit relatively expensive when inflation is taken into account. As a result, credit demand will remain scarce, probably forcing interest rates lower in the long term. 'It is doubtful whether house prices will rise, as consumers will remain unwilling to saddle themselves with large house debts. The market still has considerable overhang from repossessions.' Boyton concludes: 'I believe we are entering a new era of risk-averse investment. This will favour bonds and gilts.' One real gilt enthusiast is Stephen Hallett, of Pentre-Vere, who says: 'Gilts are as attractive now as a week ago, if not more so. The enormous deflationary pressure in the UK economy will take a long time to unwind and, if policy had been unchanged, it would have increased. Given the state of the economy, the little inflation that might be imported will only slow down the further build-up of deflation, let alone reverse it.' What about areas apart from investment? Smith points out that there are still very high real interest rates on borrowings and consumers should reduce any excess accordingly. Given the still-troubled UK economy, Smith adds: 'People are less secure in their jobs and should make sure that their pensions are properly funded.' On mortgages, Cole thinks that a fixed-rate loan 'does have a place around the 10 per cent level, especially those who are taking out a big loan. But he cautions: 'I would personally expect interest rates to fall.' Graeme Barnes, of Wilfred T. Fry, the Sussex-based firm which specialises in advising expatriates, says this week's developments have been good news for those with earnings in other currencies, or with sensibly diversified portfolios. For others who have kept their funds in sterling deposits, he recommends protection against falling interest rates by going into fixed-rate investments. So the experts' view seems clear - just as at the end of last week, a portfolio with a large share of gilts and fixed interest, plus regular savings into equities, is favoured overwhelmingly.</p>

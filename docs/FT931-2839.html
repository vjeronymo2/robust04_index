			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Engineering companies expect further decline MECHANICAL engineering companies, western Germany's leading export earners, believe output and employment will fall further this year before recovery starts in 1994. Production, which fell 6 per cent in 1992, will decline by another 5 per cent, and around 80,000 jobs will be lost, according to the VDMA industry association. Some specialist sectors, such as textile machinery and construction equipment, have started to recover from the international recession, Mr Jan Kleinewerfers, association president, said yesterday. However, much of the industry will have to wait for signs of recovery - at least in exports - until the second half of this year, he said. Mr Kleinewerfers found grounds for optimism in the falling trend in long-term interest rates, appreciation of the dollar and the yen against the D-Mark, revival in the US economy, and continuing growth in Latin America and Asia. As the worldwide 'investment recession' came to an end, the industry would exercise its growth potential, he said. Despite the slowdown, western German engineering is well-equipped for recovery after an extraordinary burst of capital investment before and during the unification boom. Meanwhile, orders have continued to fall and the number of employees working short-time, which doubled to 112,000 last year, reached 180,000 last month. The sector shed 5.5 per cent of its workers last year, bringing the number of jobs lost since the onset of the economic decline in early 1990 to 90,000. Capacity utilisation fell from 85.4 per cent to 78.7 per cent in the course of the year. Industry turnover fell 4.6 per cent to DM220.5bn (Pounds 93.4bn) while exports slipped 3.4 per cent to DM113.9bn. At the same time, unit labour costs increased 7.5 per cent and average return on sales fell by a third to 1.2 per cent. This was 0.4 per cent down on the previous post-war low of 1.6 per cent recorded in 1980 and 1981, and less than half the 1989 peak of 2.7 per cent. Worst-hit branches included machine tools, the single biggest engineering sector, which last year saw new orders tumble by 23 per cent to around half the level booked in 1989. Manufacturers, which export 58 per cent of output - 70 per cent to Europe - were particularly affected by the D-Mark's appreciation against other European currencies.

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / The Lex Column: The rising cost of inflation FT-SE Index: 2,538.4 (-6.6) In the usual heartless way of the markets, yesterday's headline figure of 2m unemployed in the UK might have been received as good news. But the market is also a political animal. Not only is a perilous figure of 2.5m now on the cards by the year end; an unnerving 43 per cent of the last month's new jobless also came in the Tory territories of London and the south-east. Taken with yesterday's reported sharp drop in industrial output, the figures are suggesting that the recession is worse than imagined. About the only bright spot was the 9 1/4 per cent rise in average earnings, the lowest figure for more than a year. At the same time, the 12.1 per cent rise in unit labour costs was a sharp reminder of how slow inflationary pressures are to respond to economic downturn. There can be little doubt that the mechanism will work eventually; with unemployment rising at an average of about 100,000 a month and headline inflation plunging, wage inflation ought to be coming down sharply in the near future. The worry is rather the degree of pain it takes to achieve the desired effect. It is scarcely a good omen for the behaviour of the UK economy under the still untested disciplines of the ERM.</p>

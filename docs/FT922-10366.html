			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Chrysler held back in quarter by launch costs CHRYSLER, the financially stretched US motor manufacturer, yesterday reported lower first-quarter losses, but its results were held back by the cost of this year's crucial new product launches. Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US motor manufacturers, reported losses before accounting changes of Dollars 231m, down from Dollars 341m in the same period of last year, on sales which rose from Dollars 5.85bn to Dollars 8.19bn. Earlier this week its Detroit rivals, General Motors and Ford, both reported modest returns to profit. However, both lost money in their North American motor operations and Chrysler lacks the extensive, profitable international operations of the other two. Mr Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said: 'The industry is starting to show some signs of recovery but it's not coming back as fast as we'd like. We couldn't overcome the cost of several new product launches and other unusual events during the quarter.' Mr Iacocca cited the cost of launching the new Jeep Grand Cherokee sports utility vehicle and the Dodge Viper sports car during the quarter, as well as preparations for the launch of the company's new LH series of mid-range saloon cars. The LH vehicles, which have won enthusiastic reviews from the motoring press, are the group's first new car model range in many years and are seen as crucial to the fate of the business. Mr Iacocca said results had also been held back by the start-up of production at Eurostar, the company's new Austrian plant, which is making mini-vans for the European market. Mr Iacocca said that on the positive side the company's cash position had been helped by an infusion from an Dollars 836m private equity offering and the sale of part of its stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors, which produced a net after-tax gain of Dollars 88m. Chrysler also sold a more profitable mix of vehicles in the quarter; reduced its heavily discounted sales to the bulk fleet market; retained its domestic market share; and increased overseas retail sales by 17 per cent. After a change in tax accounting rules, and a Dollars 63m loss on Canadian property investments, the net loss worked through at Dollars 13m, or 7 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 598m, or Dollars 2.66, after additional accounting changes a year ago. Chrysler Financial, its financing arm, contributed Dollars 60m of profit, or Dollars 111m after the tax accounting change, compared with Dollars 77m a year ago.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Reagan joins Bush to build up fighting spirit for campaign PRESIDENT George Bush and his predecessor, Mr Ronald Reagan, last night launched their effort to inject a fighting spirit and poll-winning confidence into the Republican party at the opening of its presidential convention in Houston, Texas. Scorning polls showing him 20 points behind Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic challenger, Mr Bush told cheering supporters at a rally that he was going to make as big a comeback as Harry Truman in 1948. Mr Reagan, in a speech prepared for the convention, praised Mr Bush as 'a steady hand on the tiller' who would steer the US through a turbulent time of change. Their attempts to rouse Republican spirits came after the convention opened in hesitant fashion, still with half an eye on the simmering crisis in Iraq and concerned to settle its own internal battles - especially over abortion  -without bloodshed. The convention avoided a potentially divisive public debate on abortion when abortion rights advocates conceded they did not have the votes to force discussion of the issue. After flying in to Houston, Mr Bush told supporters he was itching to take on his opponents. He noted that Mr Clinton had said he was already planning his transition into the White House. 'I half expected when I went over to the Oval Office to find him over there measuring the drapes,' he said. 'Let me say as the first shot out of the barrel: Put those drapes on hold. It's going to be 'curtain time' for that ticket.' Mr Bush also pledged to turn his attention to US domestic problems in a second term. 'We have changed the world and now we will change America because America is the land of eternal strength.' He pledged to produce an economic revival plan which would cut government spending and use tax incentives 'to get this country moving again'. To cheers, Mr Bush said: 'Houston, get ready for . . . the most stirring political comeback since Harry Truman gave'em hell in 1948 . . . It starts right now.' Mr Bush also gave one the strongest defences of Vice President Dan Quayle since some Republicans appealed to him to dump Mr Quayle from the Republic ticket. 'He has been a super vice president and he will be for another four years,' Mr Bush said. In his prepared speech, a combative and nostalgic Mr Reagan said the stakes were high in the November 3 presidential election and 'we cannot afford to take a chance.' 'We know President Bush. By his own admission, he is a quiet man, not a showman,' Mr Reagan said. 'His is a steady hand on the tiller through the choppy waters of the '90s.'

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWEETHEART, GET ME JERRY WEINTRAUB'S AGENT  </P> <P> I am grateful to Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Terry Semel  for helping to redefine the criterion by which one gets a good executive  position in the entertainment industry, "Jerry Weintraub Quits His Firm, Joins  Warner" (Sept. 25).  </P> <P> I hope it's not too late for those of us who are crying all the way to the  poorhouse to learn a lesson from Mr. Weintraub. (Weintraub Entertainment, about  $175 million in debt, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.)  </P> <P> If we could just arrange to lose $175 million of other people's money, we would  become eminently employable.  </P> <P> I wonder if this is the same system that worked so well in the deregulated  banking industry. What was it again? Putting a fox in the henhouse?  </P> <P> Thanks for a hilarious read.  </P> <P> SUZANNE GOOD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

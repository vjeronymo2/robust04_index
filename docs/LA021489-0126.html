			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DONALD KARCHER AND FAMILY TO PAY STOCK-CASE PENALTIES  </P> <P> Donald F. Karcher, president of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, his wife and  four family members have agreed to pay $187,560 in fines and penalties to end a  federal lawsuit accusing them of insider stock trading.  </P> <P> In signing the agreements, which were approved by a federal judge Monday,  Donald Karcher and his family did not admit or deny the insider-trading  allegations made in a civil lawsuit filed in April by the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> But the six defendants consented to permanent court orders prohibiting them  from future violations of insider trading laws.  </P> <P> The agreements by Donald Karcher and his family do not affect insider trading  accusations pending against his older brother, company founder Carl N. Karcher,  seven of his immediate relatives and Alvin DeShano, director of general  accounting at Carl Karcher Enterprises in Anaheim.  </P> <P> The SEC lawsuit accused Carl Karcher, who is chairman and chief executive of  the company, 14 family members and DeShano of avoiding stock market losses of  at least $310,000 in 1984.  </P> <P> Late that year, according to the lawsuit, Carl and Donald Karcher and their  wives tipped other family members through a series of phone calls and  discussions to upcoming news about a 50% drop in profits at Carl Karcher  Enterprises.  </P> <P> The SEC's civil suit seeks more than $1 million, including treble damages, from  the remaining defendants. It is scheduled to begin a four-week to six-week  trial on April 11.  </P> <P> All the defendants have consistently denied the SEC's charges of insider  trading.  </P> <P> But in September, one of Carl Karcher's sons, Carl Leo Karcher, was found  guilty of insider trading without a trial after a federal judge ruled that he  had made admissions to investigators that clearly established his guilt in the  case.  </P> <P> The younger Karcher was required to repay $10,500.  </P> <P> The SEC announced the consent agreements Monday, the same day that they were  signed by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The end of the civil lawsuit against Donald Karcher and his family does not  preclude the possibility that the U.S. attorney's office could also bring  criminal charges of violating insider-trading laws.  </P> <P> The U.S. attorney's office and SEC attorneys declined on Monday to say whether  the civil settlement includes an agreement that Donald Karcher and his  relatives will not be targets of a later criminal prosecution.  </P> <P> But Irving Einhorn, SEC regional administrator in Los Angeles, said it is  common for his office to negotiate tentative civil settlements that hinge on  the U.S. attorney agreeing not to prosecute.  </P> <P> In addition to Donald Karcher and his wife, Dorothy, those who signed  settlement agreements are Doneta Ann Thomason, daughter of Donald and Dorothy  Karcher, and her husband, David R. Thomason, as well as Rosemary Bruns, the  sister of Dorothy Karcher, and her husband, William T. Bruns.  </P> <P> Doneta Thomason, who worked in the company payroll department, and her husband  have agreed to repay $47,125, the amount of potential losses they allegedly  avoided by selling their stock based on inside information. In addition, they  have also agreed to pay a one-time penalty of $47,125.  </P> <P> The Brunses, who live in Huber Heights, Ohio, have agreed to repay $15,395 that  they allegedly saved by selling stock they owned or controlled before adverse  information was made public, plus a one-time penalty of the same amount.  </P> <P> Donald Karcher and his wife agreed to pay a one-time penalty of $62,520 under  the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984. That amount is equal to the  potential losses allegedly avoided by the Thomasons and the Brunses. The SEC  contended that Carl and Donald Karcher and their wives had violated insider  trading laws because they tipped their relatives, not that they had avoided  losses by selling stock.  </P> <P> Donald and Carl Karcher could not be reached Monday for comment.  </P> <P> Don Smaltz, the lawyer for Donald Karcher and his wife, said the one-time  payment of $62,520 "is significantly less than what would be required to take  the case to trial." Smaltz added that his clients "certainly" still maintain  their innocence.  </P> <P> Einhorn, the SEC's regional administrator, hailed the settlement as a victory  for the commission.  </P> <P> "The SEC considers this to be a vindication of its case. We got everything we  asked for," Einhorn said. "You would think there must be some doubt on their  part (about) whether they'd prevail at trial because these are people that have  the money, the wherewithal, to prosecute the case."  </P> <P> Under the settlement, the company will have to disclose in public documents  that Donald Karcher is under an injunction from the court for insider trading,  Einhorn said, "but they can also disclose (that the order) was entered by  consent without admitting or denying the allegation."  </P></p>

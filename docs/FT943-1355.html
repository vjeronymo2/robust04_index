			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firmer trend at the close of a nervous week - Market Report The UK stock market ended a difficult week on a slightly steadier note with the help of an improvement in the stock index futures and bond sectors. But trading volume remained unimpressive and nerves were taut ahead of next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee which is expected to review US interest rates. In early trade, the FT-SE 100 Index plunged by 22 points to 2,999.2 and dealers looked distinctly nervous at this loss of the psychologically important 3,000 mark. Equity chartists see the next support levels in the FT-SE 2,970 area if the market continues to slide. However, a good recovery was made and the FT-SE 100 Index closed at 3,028.2 for a net gain of 7 points, having touched 3,035.8 at the day's best. The Footsie has fallen by just over 1 per cent this week as interest rate concern has focused on the Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve and also on trading statements from leading British companies. Nervousness over the outlook for UK company profits forecasts heightened yesterday after reports that shares in Hanson had been downgraded by the company's own stockbroker. There were heavy falls among food retailers after analysts marked the sector a sell on fears prompted by the latest evidence that the price war is reviving in markets already faced by severe price competition and tighter profit margins. Kleinwort Benson Securities this week became the first UK securities house to sharply reduce its forecasts for UK corporate profits for this year and next while BZW warned yesterday that faith in strong earnings growth 'might be misplaced'. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, with a range extending to second line issues, steadied yesterday, closing 1.2 firmer at 3,560.9. But traders said there was little substance behind the equity rally. Seaq volume of 547.7m shares was little changed from Thursday. Bond prices, uneasy at first, moved ahead in the wake of regional cost of living data from Germany indicating that inflation pressures were more subdued last month. However, UK bonds remained cautious ahead of next week's auction of British government securities. With US bonds uncertain in early trading, London gilts finished below the best. Long-dated gilts closed around  3/16 better on the day but the shorts were only a touch above overnight quotations. Sentiment was also helped by comments from the Governor of the Bank of England that it may be some time before the effects of the latest base rate hike are known; the market took this as favourable for near-term rate prospects. Statistics on second quarter gross domestic product and balance of payments had little lasting impact on either gilts or equities, and there was little immediate reaction to the latest survey of monthly business trends by members of the Confederation of British Industries. The improvement in the stock market was largely a matter of recoveries in sectors badly hit earlier in the week by interest rate worries. Banks, stores and construction companies were all better on this account, with the builders additionally boosted by the strong response to excellent half-time figures from RMC in the previous session. But many of the heavyweight blue chips, including the oils and pharmaceuticals, lacked supporters and the market closed on a cautious note ahead of the equity final trading week of the third quarter of the year. The FT-SE Index has fallen by nearly 8 per cent since the end of last month and traders noted that retail, or genuine investment activity in equities has remained high throughout the period.</p>

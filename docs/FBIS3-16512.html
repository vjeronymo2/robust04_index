			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Kozhanov: "Vladislav Ardzinba's Press </F> Conference: Abkhazia Will Not Yield to Coercion"]    [Text] Abkhaz Supreme Soviet Chairman Vladislav Ardzinba's  meeting with the press yesterday was awaited with particular  interest. Questions about how the Abkhaz leader evaluates the  decree adopted a few days ago by the Georgian parliament on the  dissolution of the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet, and the extent to  which this action will reflect on the progress of already  difficult talks on a peaceful settlement to the Georgian-Abkhaz  conflict, became the focus of attention immediately.    In this connection V. Ardzinba read out a statement from the  republic Supreme Soviet conclusively emphasizing the total  political and legal bankruptcy of the Georgian parliament's  action. Sukhumi believes, moreover, that this action is a  blatant provocation aimed at sabotaging the talks and returning  to attempts at a forcible solution to the conflict. How else  can it be interpreted, if the decree adopted in Tbilisi not only  abolishes the parliament of a sovereign state but also provides  for the criminal prosecution of the parliamentarians themselves?  With just whom exactly does the Georgian side intend to  continue talks after this? With an "abolished" authority? With  "the defendants"?    And you know, the quest for a peaceful solution, which has  been going on since last November, was close to success. As a  result of three rounds of talks conducted under the UN aegis in  Geneva and New York the sides had in point of fact reached  agreement both on stationing peacemaking forces on the Inguri  river and on restoring interstate relations. Nor did the Abkhaz  side object to the return of Georgian refugees, with the  exception of those who had participated directly in military  operations against Abkhazia and carried out military and  criminal acts on its territory.    It is not impossible that it was the close prospect of a  peaceful solution that alarmed the Georgian authorities. After  all, legal documents can hinder aggression. In this connection  V. Ardzinba sharply criticized Shevardnadze's efforts to turn  world public opinion against Abkhazia and his statements during  a U.S. visit maliciously distorting the facts. Take, for  instance, the blatant lies about genocide in the republic and  about the number of Georgian refugees. Shevardnadze brazenly  cited the figure of 300,000 as the number of Georgians who had  allegedly fled from Abkhazia and repression at a time when the  total number of Georgian inhabitants on the republic's territory  never exceeded 220,000-240,000 people, a significant proportion  of whom, incidentally, remain in the country even today. All  the actions of Shevardnadze, who came to power as a result of a  forcible coup, the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet chairman noted, bear  the hallmarks of an international political adventurer. He  already sees NATO "peacemaking" forces on the southern Russian  border along the Psou river, with himself under their cover as  the full-fledged master on Abkhaz soil. But adventures, as we  know, end in failure sooner or later. The people of Abkhazia  will never yield to coercion. They seek peace and tranquility,  they thirst for a speedier revival of their war-torn and  occupied country, and they are entitled to expect world  understanding and support in this.</p>

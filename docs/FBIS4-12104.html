			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nasir Ahmad al-Rimawi] </F>   [Excerpt] Ramallah -- A statement issued yesterday by the  Palestinian People's Party in Ramallah on the recent Cairo  agreement stressed that this agreement will not achieve  confidence or liquidate settlements and that it ignored the  provisions of Security Council Resolution 904.    The statement said that just as the Security Council tried  to  cover up the the crime, the second Cairo agreement came to  complete the cover-up, ridicule the existing painful realities,  recognize the status quo in Hebron, and affirm Israel's  intention to sustain the settlers through the international  presence and the Cairo agreement itself.    The statement said that the recent Cairo agreement does not  provide any protection for the residents of Hebron and the  occupied territories.    The statement noted that the removal of the settlers from  Hebron is a necessary prelude to instilling a sense of  confidence in the town's residents. This should be followed by  negotiations over the dismantling of settlements in all the  occupied Palestinian territories in respect of our people's  right to their land and in conformity with international  resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids the  confiscation of lands and the establishment of settlements on  them.    The statement called for continued action to remove the  settlers from Hebron as a prelude to liquidating the visible  danger against the Palestinian people's security and their  national rights epitomized by the presence of settlements and  the Israeli occupation.

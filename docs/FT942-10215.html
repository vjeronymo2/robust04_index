			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A rally in European bond markets led to strong trading in the derivatives sector, which in turn pulled the cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, dealers had expected a slow start to trading in the June contract on the FT-SE 100. However, buying from a US house and a leading independent trader helped it open strongly at 3,112. The reduction in the German interest rates, together with the renewed strength in European bonds, only served to fuel the rise in the June future, and sent the cash market higher. June reached the peak of the day at around 1pm when it stood at 3,171. Profit-taking after lunch saw it ease off the top but further buying was seen following a firm opening on Wall Street. June ended at 3,144, up 43 from the previous close and around 9 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 3 points. Volume was 16,662 contracts. The June Mid 250 future closed at 3,755 after volume of 101 lots. The traded options were also busy and turnover rose to a hefty 49,203 lots. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 14,251 contracts and 5,919 were dealt in the Euro FT-SE. Among the stock options, Tesco was the most active with a day's turnover of 3,042 lots. It was followed by British Gas at 3,039 and BT at 2,391. Hanson and Lasmo were also busy.</p>

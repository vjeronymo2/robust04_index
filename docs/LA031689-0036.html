			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $9.5-MILLION PLAN OKD TO REFURBISH CIVIC AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> After years of deliberations, the Glendale City Council on Tuesday unanimously  approved a $9.5-million renovation plan for the Civic Auditorium.  </P> <P> Plans call for revamping the city-owned building, adding three meeting rooms  adjacent to the structure, constructing a three-story parking garage and  improving traffic circulation.  </P> <P> The Spanish colonial revival-style auditorium was built as a public works  project in 1938. It is home to such community events as antique shows, high  school dances and beauty pageants.  </P> <P> In recent years, the cavernous structure had begun to decay. Council members  grappled for years over whether to preserve the structure at Verdugo Road and  Mountain Street or to build a new one. They voted last year to undertake the  restoration.  </P> <P> While the building is not considered of great architectural value, community  leaders and neighborhood associations have led efforts to preserve it. Many  longtime residents say the auditorium carries memories they cherish.  </P></p>

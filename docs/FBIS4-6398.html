			<p>BFN     [Text] Skilled Thai workers are welcome in Israel, Israeli  Ambassador to Thailand 'Uzi Manor said yesterday, as part of an  Israeli government campaign to recruit an international  workforce to replace Palestinian workers.    "We [Israel] would be glad to have more Thai workers in our  country," the ambassador told The Nation during a telephone  interview.    According to the ambassador Israel has experience with Thai  workers and considers them skilled and reliable.    Earlier this month Israel said it was looking for more than  20,000 foreigners to work in place of Palestinian workers,  following attacks by militant Palestinians which left 8 Israelis  dead and 50 wounded in a 24 hour period.    Under a proposal put to the Israeli cabinet, some 15,000  foreign construction workers, and 3,250 to be employed in the  agricultural sector would join 3,000 others whose arrival has  already been scheduled.    The occupied territories, inhabited largely by Palestinians,  have been officially sealed since the end of March 1993  following a wave of killings, but the restrictions were greatly  relaxed in the months before the Hebron massacre.    Authorities tightened the ban after the February 25  massacre,  in which 30 Arab worshippers were gunned down by a Jewish  settler, in a bid to prevent revenge attacks.    Before the March, 1993 ban 100,000 Palestinians worked in  Israel, many in farming and construction.    The total ban on Palestinians entering Israel is believed to  throw thousands out of work.    The ambassador said his country would welconne skilled  workers from any nation.    Meanwhile, a senior Foreign Ministry official hailed the  Israel decision as good for Thai workers.    He said security would have to be taken into consideration  before sending Thais there, however.    "First, we have to know where they (the workers) will be  sent, and if these areas are safe enough for our people," the  anonymous official said.    He said Thailand would not risk the safety of Thai labourers  by allowing them to work in areas considered insecure.    "We don't want Thai workers to be kept hostage should  anything happen there," he told The Nation.</p>

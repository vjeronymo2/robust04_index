Thwaites was apparently angry about the failure so far  to appoint a director of elections. A terse statement from  Thwaites said the committee was "unable to find a candidate for  the post of director of elections acceptable to all members...."    Thwaites, an insurance executive, was reported to be upset  at  the refusal of ruling People's National Party (PNP)  representatives on the EAC to approve the application of Major  Anthony Robinson, head of the Jamaica Manufacturers Association  (JMA), for the job of director of elections.    The PNP is said to have objected to Robinson because he once  served as an assistant to former commerce minister Douglas Vaz  during the opposition Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) administration  of the 1980's. Robinson in more recent times has been one of the  more vocal critics of the government's economic policy. The JMA  head has repeatedly ridiculed the P.J. Patterson government's  high interest rate policies, meant to encourage savings and curb  inflation, but which has also dampened investment and  discouraged manufacturers.    Both the PNP and JLP are said to have supported the  application of another military man, Major Winston Sutherland.  But the High Command of the Jamaican Army has apparently refused  to accommodate the application for Sutherland's release.    Jamaica has been without a director of elections since the  middle of last year when Noel Lee was dropped at the insistence  of the JLP. The JLP accused Lee of inefficiency in the run-up to  and during the March 30 elections last year which was flawed by  administrative mix- ups as well as fraud and thuggery in some  mainly urban constituencies.    In a bid to attract high-profile applicants for the job, the  EAC has offered a salary said to be close to a million Jamaican  dollars per year (one Jamaica dollar = just over 3.10 U.S.  cents).    Both the PNP and JLP expressed regret Friday at Thwaites'  resignation. The PNP said he had been a "positive force" on the  committee, while the JLP described him as "energetic and  forthright." The governor general, meanwhile, says he intends to  meet with Thwaites, apparently in a bid to influence a change of  mind.</p>

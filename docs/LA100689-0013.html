			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAD IMMIGRATION PARADOX  </P> <P> The long lines of people seeking immigration applications at the U.S. Embassy  in Moscow testify to the Soviet Union's new readiness to allow its citizens  greater freedom of movement, and to the eagerness of so many of them to leave  while the political climate allows it. Most of those waiting, however, are  destined to be disappointed. Of the 300,000 Soviet citizens who are expected to  apply for U.S. entry visas in the coming year, no more than 80,000 will get  them.  </P> <P> After years of U.S. pressure, the Soviets have finally dropped many of their  barriers to emigration. But the United States at the same time has been forced  to erect barriers of its own to control a prospective flood of arrivals. A U.S.  diplomat describes the situation as a moral quandary. To those most affected,  it is a human calamity.  </P> <P> The majority of Soviet immigrants to be admitted in the coming year will be  given refugee status if they have close relatives in the United States and if  they are found to be victims of persecution. These persons are eligible for up  to $7,000 in resettlement aid. As many as 30,000 more applicants who have  relatives in the United States but who aren't considered by Washington to be  facing persecution will be admitted as parolees. They will have permission to  live and work in the country, but they won't be entitled to federal help.  </P> <P> That leaves several hundred thousand more would-be emigrants with no hope of  gaining U.S. entry visas. Many of these people are Jews, Armenians,  Pentecostals. Most argue that they face abuse or persecution for what they are  or for what they believe. On the official level, they say, abuse has diminished  but on a social level it is worse because of increasing popular outbursts of  ethnic and religious bigotry. In a country that has a dark and bloody history  of pogroms and that faces growing outbreaks of intercommunal strife, those  fears aren't to be scorned.  </P> <P> It would be unreasonable to accuse the United States of being uncaring in the  matter of Soviet immigration. Accepting 80,000 Soviet citizens in the coming  year on top of 50,000 who arrived in the last year speaks for a humane and  generous policy. The ceiling on Soviet immigration seems to be strictly  cost-dictated. Only so much money is available to cover the expenses of refugee  resettlement, and the Soviet Union is only one of a number of countries from  which the threatened and the persecuted will be arriving. Equity demands that  the needs of other immigrants be considered.  </P> <P> What can be done? U.S. officials say that other Western countries must do their  fair share to welcome Soviet emigrants, and within their absorption capacity  some others are. Israel actively encourages migration by Soviet Jews, though so  far only a small number of those who have been able to leave the Soviet Union  have chosen to settle there. The prospect of mass immigration to Israel,  however, raises a fresh question of how resettlement would be paid for. Israel  has already said it will need hundreds of millions of dollars in help to  provide for a wave of Soviet immigration. If the United States has trouble  finding money to settle more Soviet refugees here, it seems unlikely it will  find the money to settle them in Israel.  </P> <P> The tighter U.S. policy on Soviet immigration is understandable, but it remains  disturbing nonetheless. Long years of agitation for freer Soviet emigration  have at last paid off, but the budgetary costs of victory are now seen as  prohibitive. With luck, perhaps many among the hundreds of thousands of Soviet  applicants who can't get into the United States will find new homes elsewhere.  What still has to be asked is why American policy planners failed to adequately  consider what would happen if one day the Soviets did as they were bid on  emigration. Had there been more forethought and better planning, perhaps the  lines at the Moscow Embassy that the U.S. government now points to as a sign of  political success wouldn't also have the discomfiting look of a major moral  embarrassment.  </P></p>

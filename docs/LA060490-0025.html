			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Booked: The authors of a book about the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over  Lockerbie, Scotland, are mailing a copy to Ahmed Jibril, identified in the book  as the architect of the bombing. Steven Emerson and Brian Duffy inscribed "The  Fall of Pan Am 103" with the phrase "In the interest of truth and justice" and  mailed a copy to Jibril's Paris contact. Emerson said they are sending the copy  without the dust jacket, which contains their pictures.  </P> <P> * M Is for Mistake: The book "E Is For Elvis" calls James Kingsley "a friend of  Elvis Presley" and "a reporter for the Memphis Commercial Appeal" who "died of  a self-inflicted gunshot wound" on Feb. 22 last year. But reports of Kingsley's  death were greatly exaggerated; he's still alive. His reaction to the book: "I  didn't know what to think." An unrelated movie stuntman named James Kingsley  did die of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on that date. An editor for the  publisher said last week he was trying to sort it out.  </P> <P> * Higher Appeal: A petition was sent Friday to the U.N. Commission on Human  Rights asking that a representative attend the trial of Washington, D.C., Mayor  Marion Barry. The United Nations has not responded, said attorney Mary Cox, who  filed the request. The petition claims the U.S. government violated Barry's  human rights in the sting operation Jan. 18 that led to his arrest and trial on  perjury and drug charges, which is scheduled to start today.  </P> <P> * The Show Goes On: Oglethorpe University in Atlanta has come to the rescue of  a Soviet circus troupe that ran out of money last month on its U.S. tour and  was kicked out of a hotel. About 40 performers will stay in a dormitory on the  campus. "They agreed to do it out of the kindness of their hearts," said Great  Circus Bim Bom spokesman Bob Liberman.  </P></p>

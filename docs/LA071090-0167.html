			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> JETS DRAFT MOORE OF SYRACUSE  </P> <P> Rob Moore, the Syracuse wide receiver, was chosen today by his hometown team,  the New York Jets, in the NFL's supplemental draft.  </P> <P> Moore, who grew up five minutes from the Jets' training camp in Hempstead,  N.Y., was taken in the first round of the weighted lottery.  </P> <P> The league would not say if he was taken with the first pick, but he was chosen  in the first tier, made up of the teams with the poorest records.  </P> <P> Moore, who had one year of eligibility remaining at Syracuse, graduated in June  after catching 106 passes in three years and setting school records with 2,122  yards and 22 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Two other players are available for the supplemental draft: tight end Willie  Williams of LSU, who caught 13 passes for 183 yards and one TD in three years,  and Ricky Martin of Grambling, who filed as a defensive back but did not play  college football. The draft was continuing through later rounds to determine if  they would be selected.  </P> <P> By drafting a player, a team forfeits a 1991 regular draft selection.  </P></p>

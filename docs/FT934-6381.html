			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Leading Article: ITV futures The proposed changes to Independent Television ownership rules are a cause for neither joy nor anguish. While a flurry of takeovers between the regional groups should not harm viewers' interests, the timid liberalisation announced yesterday will do little to enhance the competitiveness of UK broadcasting. The absurdity of stopping large ITV companies acquiring each other has been rammed home by the fact that hostile bids will be allowed from elsewhere in the European Union from next year. Viewers will be protected because regional programming commitments are enshrined in the ITV franchises. Concerns that mergers could reduce competition are best dealt with by the standard competition authorities. Nevertheless, the arguments used to justify the new takeover regime give cause for concern. On the one hand, ministers decided to go for modest rather than total deregulation out of fear that the system could be put under 'unnecessary strain'. The danger with such talk is that the ITV companies may think it OK to huddle together in defensive mergers. This would merely perpetuate the weakness of groups which have grown up in a monopolistic culture. The sooner the ITV companies realise they are operating in the world of business, where strain and challenge are the daily reality, the better. On the other hand, the reason for allowing any mergers at all is a belief that ITV companies are too small to be effective on the international scene. The equation of size with effectiveness in world markets is suspect. A sleepy erstwhile monopoly double its previous size will not necessarily be any better at winning business overseas. The more likely consequence is that it will waste shareholders' funds on foreign escapades, as has been the case with some privatised utilities. The future of UK broadcasting needs to be understood in a wider context. Though the industry wishes to cling to its monopoly past, events are fast moving out of its grasp. Changes in technology mean that broadcasting is not governed by the need to share a limited supply of frequencies between ITV companies and the BBC. Rivalry from satellite and cable TV is growing rapidly. In future, digital broadcasting and the ability to pump TV pictures down telephone lines will provide further sources of competition. There is also a powerful, if rather unfocused, trend to integrate different media - the so-called multi-media revolution. At present, the UK media sector is hampered by a criss-cross of regulations, of which the restriction on ITV takeovers is just one. It is moderately encouraging that ministers yesterday promised to examine the rules preventing newspaper groups owning ITV companies. But if Britain's full broadcasting potential is to be unlocked, a strategic review rather than a piecemeal approach will be needed.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Arts: Avant-garde hero worship - A celebratory exhibition of Marcel Duchamp THIS FULL study of the life and works of Marcel Duchamp continues the series of important and enlightening exhibitions that has been occupying Fiat's Palazzo Grassi, on the Grand Canal at Venice, since 1986, taking modern, old master and broader cultural subjects turn and turn about. But if the usefulness - indeed the importance - of this exercise is beyond doubt, it may be so after rather a different fashion to the one intended by the organisers. It cannot be said too often that serious critical study may be justified quite as much by a sceptical as by a celebratory approach to its subject. Yet with the fine and plastic arts, most especially with modernism and the contemporary avant garde, the approach is invariably one of insistent justificatory celebration. Marcel Duchamp, one of the great guru figures of 20th century art, was born in 1887 and died in 1968. By the 1960s, by then long isolated from the immediate engagement with Cubism, Futurism and Dada that had once given his work at least a context and contemporaneity of sorts, he had become a singular hero to the post-war generation of the avant garde. Since then, through his ideas and practical example, he has exerted a greater influence on the currency of modernism than any other artist. To say, with Pontus Hulten and Jacques Caumont, respectively director and curator of the exhibition, that 'There are no works of art today which are not related, in one way or another, with the ideas developed by Duchamp', is patent nonsense. What is true is that the enthusiasms of the international curatorial establishment of modernism, and the orthodoxies of the avant garde these 30 years past, owe everything to him. And, in England, art education itself was remodelled in the mid-1960s on half-baked Duchampian ideas, with such forcing-houses as Goldsmith's College refining the product today as never before. Should they ever think about it, the only thing that would perplex these latter-day acolytes, guardians of the sacred flame, from the Richards, Hamilton and Long, to Damien Hirst and Marc Quinn, is Duchamp's own self-denying ordinance: that a single idea should receive but a single expression. The art-educational application of Duchamp's ideas is of particular relevance, for as experimental exercises in perception, analysis and response, albeit anarchic and ultimately nihilistic, there is something to be said for much of what he demonstrated, up to a point. With the metres etalon of 1914, for example, by all means play the little game, once: 'If a horizontal thread one metre long falls straight from a height of one metre on to a horizontal plane twisting as it pleases and creates a new image of the unit of length.' How long is a piece of string? How many ways are there to break an egg? In just such a way, what had never been considered before enjoys a momentary frisson of discovery and at once sinks back into the obvious and the banal. In just such ways may the youthful sensibility be honed and sensitised. Would that it had been left at that: but Duchamp preserved his threads as they fell, froze their profiles in wooden templates, called them '3 standard stoppages = canned chance', and put the whole lot together in a special box. He devised colour-wheels and cones, some with texts after the fashion of prayer-wheels, and as they whizz round, what pretty patterns and rhythms they make. Touch up the art-work: make perfunctory etchings after the works of others, Courbet, Rodin, Ingres, Cranach: put a moustache on the Mona Lisa: keep copious notes, keep every scrap and jotting and put them in a case that becomes at once a portable museum: just pick up anything you like and call it art - oh, what fun, and how easy to do. The ready-mades are Duchamp's most notorious and most characteristic works, that combine immediacy, practical opportunism, wit and mischief. A bottle-rack, a crown of coat-hooks, a urinal, all become sculpture and art at Duchamp's decree that they are so, and up to a point, why not? To see things and to know them for what they are is one of the great gifts the artist offers the layman, and unself-conscious formal qualities and imaginative possibilities are qualities and possibilities nonetheless. But into the museum they all go, with the deadening, pseudo-critical validation of the perpetrator's own ramblings: 'Specifications for Readymades, by planning for a moment to come . . . to inscribe a readymade. The readymade can later be looked for (with all kinds of delays). The important thing then is just this matter of timing, this snapshot effect . . . a kind of rendezvous. - Naturally inscribe the date, hour, minute on the readymade, as information . . . ' The early work as so often, gives the game away. For here was the young Duchamp anxious to follow the example of his elder brothers, Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, and become an artist. To be an artist is a great thing, his is a seductive vocation, glamorous and romantic. But painting itself is very difficult, and so often a matter of the greatest frustration to the intelligent man who yet cannot make his hand and materials accomplish what he would wish. Surely there must be an easier way? Aha, perhaps there is. The secret is to elevate content, that is to say the animating idea, above form and technique: and if it should be so elevated, why not detach it altogether? Duchamp was no painter, and his great if questionable legacy to the art of our time is that, if you cannot do it, you do not have to do it. The thought, the concept, is the thing. It is the nicest irony that his very demonstration of the conceptual principle should render all the conceptual art that has followed, that we know and love, in the strictest sense, unnecessary, redundant, otiose.

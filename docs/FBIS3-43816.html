			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 17 SAPA -- The government has proposed  boosting security force manpower in strife-torn townships as  part of a composite peace plan to be announced later this week,  State President F W de Klerk said on Monday. He told reporters  after talks with African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson  Mandela at the Union Buildings in Pretoria that no final  decisions had been reached. Solving the violence was an  all-inclusive process which could not be accomplished on a  "quick-fix" basis.    All parties which had a direct or indirect bearing on the  violence, including Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom  Party, had to be consulted, said Mr de Klerk. The government had  a specific role to prevent violence. Its plan to maintain law  and order was being discussed with Mr Mandela. Further  discussions would also take place with the Transitional  Executive Council, Mr Buthelezi and peace structures.    Referring to Mr Mandela's reported call for the withdrawal  of  the Internal Stability Division from East Rand townships, Mr de  Klerk said: "Specific steps to ensure the strengthening of  (security force) manpower, especially the levels of the South  African Defence Force's role, are being looked at."    Socio-economic problems such as housing and education would  also be addressed effectively to further stabilise the East Rand.    Mr de Klerk also held talks with French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe, informing him about the negotiation process, the  run-up to the elections and the challenges facing a government  of national unity. He expressed confidence that the  complications arising from "significant parties" still being  outside the process and threatening to boycott the elections  would be overcome.    "We will continue to draw in the other role players and  through negotiations and agreements search for a solution," he  said. There was no turning back on the April 27 election date,  Mr de Klerk added.    Mr Juppe said France stood ready to increase its financial  assistance to South Africa "two-fold" and would step up  bilateral aid for technology and cultural activities.    He invited South Africa to the Franco/African summit to be  held soon and said France would play a substantial role in  monitoring the election process.    Responding to a question, Mr de Klerk said he was "highly  critical" of the ANC's economic plans which critics have  slammed as being tantamount to nationalisation, and would relay  this message during his election campaign. The plan showed the  ANC had not made sufficient progress in terms of economic  realities, he said.    He hoped the ANC's decision-making body would steer away  from  the calamities which would result if such policies were applied.</p>

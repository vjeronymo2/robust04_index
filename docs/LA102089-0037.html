			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNER SEEKS TO BAN SONY FROM HIRING GUBER, PETERS  </P> <P> In a legal move that casts new doubt over Sony Corp.'s staffing plans for  Columbia Pictures, Warner Bros. on Thursday filed a motion for a preliminary  injunction to prevent the Japanese electronics giant from hiring producers  Peter Guber and Jon Peters.  </P> <P> If a Los Angeles Superior Court judge grants the motion at a hearing set for  Nov. 2, Sony could be forced to look elsewhere for top talent to run Columbia,  which the Japanese firm is now buying through a $3.4-billion tender offer that  expires Oct. 31. Sony is also acquiring Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for  $17.50 a share, or about $200 million.  </P> <P> A Warner attorney said the studio is seeking a preliminary injunction to speed  up resolution of the Warner-Sony dispute. Last week, the two companies filed  suit against each other in the same court, but that litigation could drag on  for years while Sony pursues its plans for Columbia, said Warner attorney  Stuart Robinowitz.  </P> <P> "We want to make sure they continue rendering services for us on all projects  in the works," Robinowitz said. "We don't want to wait a year or two. We also  feel we have a very strong case."  </P> <P> But an attorney for Guber-Peters dismissed Warner's motion as relying on  speculation. "I don't think it's real," attorney Terry Christensen said. "It's  a further attempt to hammer Sony." Warner, he added, filed the motion "for  publicity and bargaining purposes."  </P> <P> A key issue in the Sony-Warner litigation is whether Warner executives ever  gave Guber and Peters oral assurances that they could break their five-year  exclusive production deal with Warner to pursue executive posts at other  studios. Christensen said Warner President Terry Semel provided such an  assurance, while Warner calls the alleged oral agreement "a transparent fairy  tale."  </P> <P> In a declaration filed in court and signed by Semel, the Warner president said  he first learned about Sony's advances to the producers at a Sept. 25 meeting  with Guber, about one week after the Japanese firm first approached the pair.  "Guber told me that the package of financial incentives offered by Sony would  allow him and Mr. Peters to make more money than anyone in the history of the  motion picture industry," Semel said.  </P> <P> At that meeting, Guber asked for a written release from their five-year  agreement with Warner. "I told him I could not sign the release," Semel said.  Then he called Warner Bros. Chairman Robert A. Daly and they arranged a  conference call with Steven J. Ross, co-chief executive of parent Time Warner  Inc.  </P> <P> "We all expressed shock that Guber and Peters had secretly made a deal with  Sony," Semel said. "When I asked Mr. Guber why he had not discussed this matter  in advance with me, he told me that he had chosen not to inform Warner earlier  . . . because he was concerned that Mr. Ross would call Mr. Akio Morita, Sony's  chairman, and tell him that Warner would not surrender its rights under the  1989 agreement."  </P> <P> According to Christensen, however, Guber's initial meeting with Semel -- a  close friend -- ended with hugs and congratulations. It was Ross who put up a  roadblock to letting Guber and Peters out of their deal, according to industry  sources and Christensen.  </P> <P> The following day, Peters made a personal plea to Ross to let the pair out of  their contract, according to a declaration made by Ross. "I explained that we  could not release them in view of their great importance to the company," Ross  said.  </P></p>

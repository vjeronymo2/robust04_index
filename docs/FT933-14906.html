			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / People: GWR boosts its board Great Western Resources, the UK-quoted oil, gas and coal company which last year suffered an unwelcome torrent of publicity over its flamboyant former chairman Dan Pena, has named two non-executive directors to its already 10-strong board. Donald Clayton and Joseph Reid will be among a team of eight non-executive and four executive directors. Howard Wolf, the company doctor who replaced Pena as chairman in 1991 following a shareholder rebellion, says the appointments mark GWR's move from 'the whisky and society columns to the business pages'. Clayton, 56, is better known to observers as the driving force behind the development of Meridian Oil, owned by Burlington Resources of the US, since 1987. In February, Wall Street was taken aback by Clayton's abrupt and unexplained departure from Burlington, just eight months after being promoted to president of Meridian's parent company. Reid, an oil and gas consultant in his early 60s, was Clayton's predecessor as chief executive of Meridian Oil. He was also president and chief executive of the natural gas company Superior Oil, taken over by Mobil Oil in 1984. GWR, which had been in dispute with one of its largest customers, recently came out of Chapter 11, a form of protection from creditors supervised by the courts. The group reported an interim loss of Dollars 2.03m in May, against Dollars 13.6m the previous year.</p>

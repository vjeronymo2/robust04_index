			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: A FEW MILLION IN HAND MIGHT REFRESH HIS MEMORY  </P> <P> There's nothing like $42 million to make a person forgetful. "Like everyone  else, we'd mapped out what we'd do if we won," said William Madigan, winner of  a $42-million lottery jackpot in Illinois. "But today I can't remember a single  thing we talked about. My mind's a blank." Madigan, 50, and his wife, Kathleen,  38, appeared at a Chicago news conference after claiming Illinois' biggest  single-winner lottery jackpot from Saturday's drawing. The Madigans, who live  in suburban Hometown, will receive 20 annual payments of $2.1 million. Madigan,  a supervisor for a security company, plans to keep his job for now. Mrs.  Madigan, a gift shop clerk, said she will quit. The Madigans' three children --  Jennifer, 13, Lori, 11, and Steven, 10 -- have very definite spending plans.  "I'd like my own room." said Lori, who now shares a room with her sister.  Jennifer said she would like to buy some new clothes. "I like clothes and boys,  but I can't buy boys," she explained. And Steven said he would buy baseball  cards.  </P> <P>  -- President Bush's daughter, Dorothy, has separated from her husband, William  M. LeBlond, family friends said. Dorothy LeBlond, the only daughter of the  President and his wife, Barbara, celebrated her 30th birthday Aug. 18 with her  vacationing family at Kennebunkport, Me. Her husband did not attend. The  LeBlonds have two children, Samuel, 5, and Nancy, 2. Mrs. LeBlond, who is  called Doro by the Bush family, works for the Maine Tourist Bureau. Her  estranged husband is in the construction business in Maine. "I cannot confirm  it and I won't," said Anna Maria Perez, the First Lady's press secretary. "It's  Doro's private life. I can't talk about it. It's Doro's business." The  President and his wife also have four sons.  </P> <P>  -- The makers of the film "Heart of Dixie" had a little problem when they  tried to spell out their gratitude to Mississippi's governor. The closing  credits thank a variety of people for making the movie possible, but in  thanking the Mississippi Film Commission, the closing credits list Gov. Ray  "Maybus." Actually, the governor's name is Ray Mabus. "Heart of Dixie" was  filmed largely around Oxford, Miss., and the antebellum mansions of Holly  Springs. It opened last week around the country.

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Finance minister tries to squash economic fears MR Michel Sapin, France's finance minister, yesterday attempted to squash fears about the implications of the Maastricht treaty for the French economy by saying that long term interest rates could come down if France voted Yes in this month's referendum to ratify the treaty. The finance minister was careful not to specify when they would do so. He warned of the economic consequences of France rejecting the treaty. 'I am not one of those who say it would be Maastricht or chaos,' he said. 'But it would be very bad for the French economy.' Mr Sapin' statement helped to boost the Paris financial markets. The CAC 40 Index rose by 4 per cent during the day to close at 1,780. The economy has emerged as a central issue in the referendum debate. The anti-Maastricht lobby has fuelled French public concern about the power of Germany within the European Community by arguing that, as part of a unified Europe, the Germans would be able to wield greater influence over the French currency and interest rates. Interest rates are a source of concern for Paris given the cost of borrowing  -with an annual inflation rate of around 3 per cent and bank base rates of 9.85 per cent - is among the highest in Europe and is one of the main causes for the recent sluggishness of the economy. However, the government's hopes of reducing rates have been scuppered by the high level of German rates. Last autumn Mr Pierre Beregovoy, now prime minister and then Mr Sapin's predecessor at the finance ministry, was forced into an embarrassing volte face when he briefly tried to hold French rates below those of Germany only to be forced to raise them again when the franc came under pressure on the currency markets. Mr Sapin has continued Mr Beregovoy's rigid economic policy of continuing to countenance relatively high long term interest rates in order to protect the franc. Yesterday he argued that the ratification of the Maastricht treaty would create a stable economic environment in which France would have the necessary flexibility to reduce rates again. He refused to be drawn on what would happen to interest rates if the French rejected the treaty. However, he warned that such a result would create tension within the European Monetary System and would have a 'negative' effect on the French economy.</p>

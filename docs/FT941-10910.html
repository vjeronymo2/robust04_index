			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (18): New sparkle to market image  -Chile The Chilean stock market has, for the moment at least, shaken off its image as being 'safe but dull' after a year-end surge compensated for months of sluggish activity, producing real annual gains of 50 per cent on the IPSA selective price index. More than 18 per cent of that rise came in December alone as traders reacted positively to firm economic indicators, smooth presidential elections and the upgrading of Chile's risk rating by Standard &amp; Poor's to triple B plus, the highest in Latin America. That new-found confidence, also spurred by hopes of an early free trade agreement with the US, has been sustained in 1994. Daily volumes, at Dollars 20m-Dollars 30m, remain high by Santiago standards and by mid-January the IPSA had already posted gains of more than 10 per cent. Market capitalisation is now approaching Dollars 50bn, compared with Chile's gross domestic product of around Dollars 40bn. Of this, Dollars 1.55bn is held by foreigners through 17 registered funds, one way of by-passing foreign investment regulations which prohibit the repatriation of capital for one year. Investments through registered funds pay capital gains tax of 10 per cent. An increasingly popular way of investing in Chilean stock is through the purchase of American Depositary Receipts on the New York exchange. Eight Chilean companies, all of which have overcome rigorous guidelines laid down by Chile's central bank, have issued ADRs. Chilean paper is heavily sought after, though a further 12 companies are planning issues this year. The Santiago exchange, underpinned by private pension funds (AFPs) which have accumulated around Dollars 15bn since the early 1980s, is one of the most solid and best run in Latin America. Trading, more than 30 per cent of which takes place on an electronic bolsa where transactions are instantaneous, is regulated by the securities and exchange commission. The commission has the power to investigate unusual share price movements, which it can refer to court where necessary. Mr Michael Harcombe, a Kleinwort Benson representative in Santiago, says: 'The way things operate here is fairly close to how a market would work in any European capital, only on a smaller scale.' New capital markets reform, which has been dragging its way through congress for the past year, should tighten up regulations still further. Among proposed reforms are measures to discourage the sometimes incestuous relationships between large companies and powerful institutional investors.</p>

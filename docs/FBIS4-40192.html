			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Border Guards Acquire Their Own </F> `Alfa'"]    [Text] As MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned, recently yet  another antiterrorist unit has been created in Russia. Now the  task of freeing hostages captured on the border will be handled  by specially trained border guard groups.    There will be no conscripts serving in this special task  force. At present work is under way to select graduates from  border guard schools and reenlisted men for this unit.  Antiterrorist groups will not be very large: 15 to 20 people.  So far it is planned to create five groups based in different  regions of Russian, as a rule near the state border. They will  be geared toward securing the release of hostages taken on the  country's territory and taken abroad; that is to say, actions on  the territory of other states. The special force will be used  primarily to free Russian servicemen, including border guards.  The decision to use the special unit will be made at a level  not below Russian border guards commander.    According to some reports, these groups will be trained by  the Alfa force and its regional subdivisions.</p>

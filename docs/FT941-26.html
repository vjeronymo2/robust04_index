			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders call for VAT changes Grain and soft commodities traders are lobbying the European Commission for the amendment of proposals put forward for excluding commodity transactions from the levy of value added tax. The commission drafted proposals to try to remove uncertainty caused in the commodities trade over complex VAT rules. In spite of single market regulations that came into force at the beginning of last year exempting from VAT sales of goods between registered traders in each member country, commodity transactions were still subject to VAT levies in a number of EU countries. Some member countries were applying VAT to the 'paper' transactions so prevalent in the commodities trade. This often involves a series of sales and purchases without physical delivery taking place. The commission is proposing that the sale of commodities located in a so-called 'fiscal' warehouse will be able to benefit from VAT suspension until the goods are removed from the warehouse. But the commission specifies the commodities must be placed in a separate building. Commodity traders object to the commission's suggestion as shipments of grain or rice, for example, may be sold while on board ship or on storage at a port. Taking the cargo out of the ship and placing it in a special silo so that it can avoid VAT on subsequent transactions would be uneconomic as the cost would be more than the VAT saved. UK grain traders are hoping to organise a special conference to outline the problems involved. The commission's proposal would have to be passed by EU finance ministers which could take about six months.</p>

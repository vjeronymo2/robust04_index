			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Banacci posts earnings up 9% FINANCIERO Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest financial group, reported an equivalent of net earnings of 663m pesos (Dollars 211m) in the second quarter, 8.9 per cent up from the same period in 1992. However, earnings at Banamex, the group's bank, dropped by 18.7 per cent to 526m pesos, and at Accival, the brokerage, by 46.3 per cent to 37m pesos. Banacci's earnings would have fallen by 11.4 per cent if a revaluation of assets had been excluded. Most Mexican financial groups exclude revaluation of assets from net earnings. Banacci reported a revaluation of 29m pesos, compared with a large deficit in the second quarter last year. It said a significant portion of the surplus was due to an appreciation of securities held by its subsidiaries, which if realised, would have been reported as trading income. The group blamed the sharp fall in Banacci's income on the slowdown in the Mexican economy and the stringent monetary and credit policies of the government.</p>

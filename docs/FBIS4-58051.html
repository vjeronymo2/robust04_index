			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, </F> speaker of the Yemeni House of Representatives and leader of the  Yemeni Reform Grouping, by Hammud Munsir in Sanaa; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Munsir] Although more than two months have  elapsed since the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, the  crisis has seen nothing but further escalation and dispute, and  the accord still has not been implemented. Why?    [Al-Ahmar] I believe that the brothers in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] are responsible for the continuation of  the crisis, especially over the document. Because after the  signing, all officials were supposed to return to their work in  Sanaa, whether in the Presidential Council, the Council of  Ministers, or any other institution, so that all bodies could  perform their official duties, and in order to implement the  document. But regrettably, they began to flee from Amman.    [Munsir] Would you call that a rebellion?    [Al-Ahmar] Undoubtedly the position of some YSP leaders has  been considered a rebellion since the crisis began. [passage  omitted]    [Munsir] Did your signing of the document mean the end of  your reservations about it?    [Al-Ahmar] The reservations still stand but it does not mean  that we reject the document as a whole. We have reservations  about some points in it until an understanding is reached on  them.    [Munsir] Can you specify some of these points?    [Al-Ahmar] They are known to and understood by everyone.  [passage omitted]    [Munsir] Who is behind the military tension and clashes that  took place in Abyan, Harf Sufyan, Shabwah, and Ma'rib?    [Al-Ahmar] When there is a crisis or a dispute between two  forces, two parties, or even two states or tribes, complications  are bound to emerge, whether through someone's actions or as a  result of psychological tensions leading to that.    [Munsir] But it was noted that the clashes occurred after  the document was signed and then escalated in an unprecedented  manner. Do you believe forces opposed to the document were  behind these military developments?    [Al-Ahmar] That is not ruled out. I believe that that  action was designed to abort the signing of the document. On  that day it was said that the YSP had sent military  reinforcements from Aden to Abyan, violating the decisions of  the dialogue committee, the Presidential Council, and the House  of Representatives and the military committee's instructions.    [Munsir] The YSP persists in accusing what it terms the  "influential military family in Sanaa" and influential forces or  elements in the General People's Congress [GPC], and sometimes a  third party -- apparently a reference to the Yemeni Reform  Grouping [YRG] -- of being behind these attempts and explosions.  What is your opinion?    [Al-Ahmar] These accusations are absolutely untrue. The YSP  represents half of the authority, and it is now demanding that  others implement the document, even though its implementation  requires a unified political will.    [Munsir] The YSP moved a step ahead of you at the foreign  level. Its leaders intensified their visits to most Arab  states, especially in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. It  was said at the time that the YSP was occupying your traditional  positions at the regional level. How do you view and what is  your position on these visits?    [Al-Ahmar] The visits the YSP paid to fraternal states,  near and far, are illegitimate moves which prompted the people  to see them as separatist moves aimed at separation. This is  the people's interpretation and opinion. [passage omitted]    [Munsir] YSP leaders have said that there is a "political  Islam" scheme or a "fundamentalist scheme" obstructing the  national democratic unionist plan. Some people interpret this  as a clear reference to the YRG. What truth is there in reports  of the existence of extremist fundamentalist elements in Yemen?    [Al-Ahmar] I am surprised by the allegations of the YSP and  those helping it to promote these lies. I am also surprised  that the Egyptian brothers should listen to these lies and  believe them, hence viewing us as they view Islamic groups in  some Arab states.    We in Yemen are a Muslim people. We do not have religious or  ethnic minorities among us. Since the dawn of history Yemen has  been ruled by the Islamic Shari'ah, which is dominant and the  basis on which Yemeni cases are settled, including political,  commercial, and other cases. Thus there is nothing to prompt  the Yemeni people or any religious group or element to resort to  violence in order to demand what Islamic parties in Egypt or  elsewhere are demanding -- the application of the Shari'ah.  [passage omitted]    [Munsir] The YSP accused YRG militias of fighting alongside  the al-'Amaliqah forces in the clashes that occurred in Abyan.  What truth is there in these accusations?    [Al-Ahmar] The YRG has no militias. It is a phrase they  level at any cadres or elements capable of carrying weapons and  defending themselves. YRG "cadres" in Abyan defended themselves  with their own arms. [passage omitted]    [Munsir] What have Arab mediations achieved so far with  regard to achieving a solution to the crisis?    [Al-Ahmar] We in the YRG reject any Arab, foreign, or even  Yemeni mediation that proposes any initiatives or solutions  outside what is mentioned in the Pledge and Accord Document. We  are working to reinforce and safeguard unity. [passage omitted]    [Munsir] There have been reports that delegations from  hard-line movements, including the Muslim Brotherhood  International Organization and the National Islamic Front led by  Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, arrived in Sanaa recently, and that they  met with YRG and GPC officials with a view to setting up an  Islamic alliance in Sanaa to confront a "secular" south  Yemen-Egyptian alliance. What truth is there in this?    [Al-Ahmar] That is a lie and absolutely untrue. No  delegations from Arab or non-Arab Islamic organizations have  arrived in Yemen. If a delegation visits us, we do not receive  it secretly, because we do not consider that a conspiracy or  something to be ashamed of.    We will warmly, publicly, and fraternally receive any  Islamic  delegation that visits us. It is an honor for us to be visited  by an Islamic preacher from any Arab or Islamic state, because  we in Yemen are a Muslim people. [passage omitted]    [Munsir] There have been numerous reports of the existence  of camps in Yemen to train terrorists, and a committee has been  formed recently to investigate the matter. What truth is there  in this, and what does it mean to you as an Islamic party?    [Al-Ahmar] Before the committee comes back with its report,  I say that that is untrue and merely a lie. There is nothing to  prompt the Yemenis to resort to setting up camps to train people  in the use of arms. All Yemenis carry and are trained in the  use of arms, hence there is no need to set up secret camps.  [passage omitted]</p>

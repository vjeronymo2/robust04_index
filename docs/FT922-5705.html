			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Bond faces jail after dishonesty conviction MR ALAN BOND, the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur, was in prison last night after a Perth jury convicted him of dishonestly inducing a businessman to take part in a ADollars 370m (Pounds 155m) corporate rescue. Mr Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, was remanded in custody overnight to await sentence today. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine of ADollars 20,000. The jury took nearly six hours to consider the events surrounding Mr Bond's part in the rescue of Rothwells merchant bank after the global stock market crash in October 1987. Mr Bond denied inducing Mr Brian Coppin, a millionaire insurance broker, to sub-underwrite a rights issue without revealing that Bond Corp would receive a ADollars 16m success fee. Mr Bond admitted going to Mr Coppin's home to complete details of the sub-underwriting, but claimed he was unaware that a fee would be paid until two weeks later. Mr Ian Callinan, defending, said Mr Bond was 'a very debased individual'. He had fallen a long way from the dizzy heights of five years ago, when Bond Corp was a major international brewing and media group. Mr Callinan also urged the jury to not to make Mr Bond a scapegoat for the failure of Rothwells. It collapsed a year after the rescue at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to Western Australian taxpayers. But the jury accepted the prosecution case that Mr Bond and Mr Laurie Connell, chairman of Rothwells, agreed the fee before the completion of Mr Coppin's sub-underwriting agreement. Mr Bond's lawyers are expected to consider an appeal after he is sentenced. He was declared bankrupt last month with debts and contingent liabilities of ADollars 700m. He resigned as chairman of Bond Corp in September 1990, two days before the group announced a record loss of ADollars 2.2bn. It is now being restructured. Bond loses licence to overkill, Page 4</p>

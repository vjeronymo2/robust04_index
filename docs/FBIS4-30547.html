			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The difficult promotion  of peace process in Angola is a fruition of the sincere and  strenuous efforts of the Angolan Government to solve the  internal issue of the nation in the interests of the nation and  in conformity with the cause of peace, says NODONG SINMUN in a  by-lined article today.    The article says:    The Angolan Government set forth the principle of settling  the present political crisis through dialogue and negotiation  in the spirit of national reconciliation and has made consistent  efforts to carry it into practice.    The government made arrangements for peace talks with UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola], took an  initiative step for ceasefire and has striven to end the  domestic revolt, cooperating with the international community.    The government side is striving for national reconciliation,  territorial integrity and unity, showing a top patience and  generosity at the talks. The good faith and generosity of the  government side in transferring many seats of the regional  government over to the UNITA, returning UNITA parliamentarians  to the People's Assembly, and other matters show part of the  honest efforts of the government to put an early end to the  internal troubles lasting nearly 20 years at any cost.    The Korean people express solidarity with the Angolan people  in their just struggle.    The master of Angola is the Angolan people themselves. If  the sides at the talks, deeply conscious of this, make efforts  for national interests and peace, the internal troubles would be  ended and a bright vista be opened ahead of the Angolan people.</p>

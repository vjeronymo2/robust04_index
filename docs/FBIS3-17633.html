			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 36: Compiled </F> by Sergey Logachev, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Mircea Snegur "has a contingency plan" if  the parties advocating integration into Romania score a success  in the February 27 elections. A source in the president's  entourage says that the president keeps his plans to himself  because he thinks that the probability of an electoral success  for those parties is merely theoretical.    The source told INTERFAX that parties that had recently  advocated integration into Romania tried to win electoral  support in the runup to the election by saying they wanted  Moldova to stay independent.    The source also said that the president intended to hold a  poll on 6 March so as to determine what the country's residents  were thinking of its independence.    The president is sure that the 27 February elections and the  poll will confirm that his independence course is supported by  the population. Even though the poll results would not be  legally binding, Snegur did not doubt that they would endorse "a  policy of true independence" to be pursued by the president and  the new parliament. The president hopes that the elections will  return a solid majority of centrist-minded deputies who will  work with him in a coordinated and constructive way.    Indeed, sociological polls taken in Moldova recently  forecast  that over 30 percent of seats in parliament will be won by the  Agrarian Democratic Party (ADP) which will be followed by  socialists and social-democrats. The ADP leaders Petru  Lucinskiy, Andrey Sangheli and Dumitru Motpan will offer the two  other parties an alliance in parliament.    According to the source, Snegur is in a good position to  discuss the status of Transdniestria with the leaders of that  area. Snegur has recently received a letter from Russian  President Boris Yeltsin, saying that Russia is prepared to  continue to act as a mediator in negotiating a settlement. The  Moldovan authorities are prepared to discuss with Transdniestria  a number of compromise options leading to solution of problems  on which the two sides differ.    "Transdniestria could enjoy maximal self-government, going  as far as legislative autonomy, while staying in the Republic of  Moldova as its integral part," Snegur believes.    Meanwhile, scores of people from the left bank of the  Dniester (the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic  -- IF) have arrived in electoral stations set up for them. (The  Central Election Commission had decided that residents of  Transdniestria could vote from 21 February to 27 February -- IF).    Victor Puscasu, Deputy Chairman of the Moldovan parliament  told INTERFAX that an exception was made for the residents of  Transdniestria so that they "express their views independently  of the Tiraspol leaders." He said that they would be allowed to  vote even if they did not have a mark in their passport saying  that they were Moldovan citizens.    Officials of the Central Election Commission say that  hundreds of Transdniestrians have voted on 21 February. The  elections are reported to run into difficulties, however.  Voting ballots were still unavailable in some voting stations  and Transdniestrian guardsmen who patrol bridges over the  Dniester harass the voters.    Activists of some parties are said to tell the voters  approaching the voting stations who to vote for. They abuse  their right to continue campaigning.    Snegur's headquarters are engulfed by telegrams from the  south of Moldova. A source in the president's entourage told  Interfax they protest the ban on opening electoral stations in  areas where Gagauzi reside, effectively barring over 100,000  people from voting.    Snegur has reportedly decreed that voting stations be opened  there.</p>

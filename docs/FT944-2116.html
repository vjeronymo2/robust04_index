			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs spark up Bid speculation drove the utilities forward, with the latest twist being talk that some leading regional electricity companies (recs) may seek to protect themselves by bidding for water companies. The government's golden share in the water companies expires at the end of this year. Meanwhile, Yorkshire Electricity took the market by surprise with the timing of a special 90p dividend. Market watchers had predicted that the distributor would follow East Midlands Electricity in paying a special dividend, but the move was not expected until some time in the new year. The group also reported a 32 per cent increase in half-time profits to Pounds 97.6m and a 15 per cent rise in the dividend. The shares climbed 30 to 687p ex-dividend. Mr Nigel Hawkins at Hoare Govett said: 'Yorkshire's sector rating is likely to improve following the reassertion of shareholder value and impressive interim results.' Yorkshire has been mentioned as a possible 'white knight' for Northern Electric, for which Trafalgar House has said it is considering a bid, but several brokers said the group could itself be a bid target. US broker Salomon Brothers was said to have taken this view. East Midlands, which reports figures on Monday, gained 12 at 810p, and Northern finished a penny ahead at 985p. Trafalgar edged  1/2 forward to 74p. Merchant bank SG Warburg recovered from the shock of rejection as the market looked ahead to the next contender to replace Morgan Stanley, of the US. The US investment bank was not prepared to pay above the odds for Mercury Asset Management (MAM), Warburg's 75 per cent-owned fund arm. And after the market closed yesterday, Warburg said it was not soliciting other approaches. However, analysts are convinced that change will come, and while the shares were off their best by the close they were still up 14 at 713p. MAM, revealed as the ambition of Morgan Stanley's affections, jumped 46 to 724p. Insurance issues, which are big investors in equities and thus geared to outperform a rising market, moved ahead sharply. They were further boosted by an enthusiastic recommendation and the hope factor now in the FT-SE 100. Credit Lyonnais Laing removed its cautious stance on the sector in a note published yesterday. Specifically it took Sun Alliance off the sell list and the stock rose 8 to 307p. Laing's change of heart is part of a market-wide review of the sector that concentrates on recent slides in the stocks rather than fundamental considerations. Earlier in the week UBS argued that the sector was undervalued and focused on General Accident. Yesterday GenAcc, helped by pressure from short positions in the market, rose 22 to 531p. Commercial Union moved forward 17 to 527p. News of Vickers' choice of partner for its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars division could emerge early next week following a meeting between the company analysts on Monday. Vickers was unchanged at 177p in nominal turnover. Best bets in the City point to a straight race between the two German groups, BMW and Daimler-Benz. The former has existing links with Rolls-Royce, but on Friday the informed money was leaning more towards Daimler. Caradon was the star of the construction sectors, surging 14 to 254p in 2.7m turnover following the recent buy recommendation from UBS. The stock has rebounded almost 10 per cent this week. Barratt Developments and Beazer kept the recent recovery in the housebuilders ticking over, with Barratt up 6 at 156p, and Beazer adding 2 1/2 at 131p in 2.4m turnover. Oil majors BP and Shell Transport rose on heavy turnover that reflected the expiry of the FT-SE 100 December contract. The removal of pressure in the derivatives market sent BP 7 higher to 421 1/2 p with 20m traded and Shell up 9 1/2 to 691p on turnover of 11m. However, the most heavily traded stock of the day was British Gas, the shares ignoring popular criticism over the company's disparate pay policy and rising 2 1/2 to 307 1/2 p with 21m shares changing hands. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel bounced 15 to 273p on optimism over the car shuttle service, which was priced yesterday. Boosted by early morning futures activity, the heavily traded telecoms sector notched up big volumes but limited price movements. BT traded 15m shares to rise 3 1/2 to 376p and Cable and Wireless added 6 1/2 at 361 1/2 p in 8m turnover. Vodafone was 2 1/2 higher at 200p in 8.9m volume. Land Securities jumped 22 to 586p after announcing the Pounds 76.5m sale of the lease on the Milton Gate building in London. The sale was to AP Fonden, the national Swedish pension fund. News of a 49 per cent acquisition in a Mexican sugar cane business saw shares in Tate &amp; Lyle harden 7 to 418p. Shares in Dixons eased 1 1/2 to 177 1/2p in trade of 2.9m as the market digested the Office of Fair Trading's report into the sale of extended warranties on electrical goods.</p>

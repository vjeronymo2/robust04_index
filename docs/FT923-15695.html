			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / Letter: All fired up, but not sure where to go Sir, The conferences and exhibitions advertisements in the FT (June 29) announce under the International section a conference on 'The future of the Yorkshire Coal Field', to be held in the well-known continental resort of 'Rotherdam'. This could either be the famous international trading port, or the Yorkshire town well to the south of Neuchateau, to where coals have been taken before now. Take your pick] Bernard Everitt, Yorkshire Bank Retail Services, Melton, North Humberside</p>

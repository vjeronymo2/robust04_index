			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Strobe lights derive their effectiveness more from their intensity and characteristic flash pattern than from their relative spacing. The effectiveness of omni-directional strobe lights can be enhanced by mounting them at the highest point on the locomotive cab roof. In order to accommodate such mounting on some cabs with flat top sections narrower than 60 inches, the minimum spacing between adjacent strobe lights is reduced to 48 inches, as set forth in IR&hyph;2 at &sect;229.133(b)(2)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Vertical Dimensions (&sect;&sect;229.133(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(iii) and (b)(3)(i))  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The most common placement of ditch or crossing lights on a road switcher locomotive is directly above the front platform. The headlight is commonly located on the front cab wall, just below the roof line. The front platform is typically between five and six feet above the rail; the cab roof line, 14 feet above the rail. Allowing a conservative placement of one foot from the surface of the front platform to the centerline of the lower lights, and two feet from the edge of the cab roof to the center of the upper headlight unit, the vertical spacing between the lower lights and the headlight would be five feet, or 60 inches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Height above the rail is a factor in the visibility of a light for several reasons. Increased height has several advantages. First, the light will be less obstructed by objects or vertical curves on or in the track. Second, the light will be less affected by accumulations of snow or foreign material thrown up by the pilot, plow or wheels. Third, the light is less likely to be damaged should the locomotive strike a foreign object. There is no reason to limit the maximum height above the rail for crossing or ditch lights, provided that they meet the criteria for horizontal or vertical spacing as discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The minimum height for ditch lights was specified in IR&hyph;1 as 36 inches in &sect;229.133(b)(1)(i), and as 48 inches for crossing lights in &sect;229.133(b)(3)(i), in order to accommodate mounting below the front platform, if necessary. There is no reason for inconsistency between the dimensions for ditch lights and for crossing lights; ditch lights could become crossing lights after modification of control circuitry. Thus, the minimum height for crossing lights in IR&hyph;1 at &sect;229.133(b)(3)(i) is revised from 48 inches to 36 inches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 36-inch minimum height requirement will permit maintenance of the 60-inch vertical dimension on locomotives with the headlight mounted in a low front hood. This height requirement also aids the observer's sight distance. The maximum vertical curve recommended by the American Railway Engineering Association for main track has a rate of change of grade of 0.2 percent per 100 feet. On this vertical curve, a light three feet above the track will be visible to an observer at a distance of 1,095 feet, provided the observer's eyes are three feet above the track. A reduction in height of one foot, of either the observer or the light, reduces the sight distance by approximately 100 feet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The one comment requesting a lower height above the rail applied only to cab control cars in suburban passenger service. If those cars have suitable conspicuity while operating on their specific routes, the final rule may permit their light configuration in that service. However, the 25-inch height requested is not suitable for general railroad service, owing to the reduced visibility on vertical curves, susceptibility to snow, and damage from foreign objects. FRA therefore concludes that the minimum height of 36 inches for ditch lights, crossing lights and strobe lights will be retained in IR&hyph;2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  IR&hyph;2 at &sect;&sect;229.133(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(iii) and (b)(3)(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Strobe Lights (&sect;229.133(b)(2)(i))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Flash Technology commented that one forward-facing, focused strobe light could be more effective than two omni-directional strobe lights described in IR&hyph;1 at &sect;229.133(b)(2)(i). If any railroads are presently using the former type of system, none commented or requested its inclusion in the interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of both IR&hyph;1 and IR&hyph;2 is to encourage the installation of currently available effective systems. FRA was not provided with any information indicating that one forward-facing, focused strobe light has been in service or proven effective to date. Such technology may be considered in the final rule. The authority for expedited issuance of IR&hyph;1 did not contemplate the inclusion of systems not in current use. Therefore, IR&hyph;2 will continue the requirement for two strobe lights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Flash Rates (&sect;&sect;229.133(b)(2)(ii), (b)(3)(iii) and New &sect;&sect;229.133(b)(2)(ii), (b)(3)(v))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Flash Technology commented that the limits of flash rate of strobes should be broadened to incorporate units used by Amtrak which flash at a period of 0.5 seconds. This rate is used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for runway lead-in lighting, and does not cause problems with flicker vertigo. Research conducted for FRA by the Transportation Systems Center in 1974 and 1975 shows that a flash rate as rapid as three per second effectively improves conspicuity, and does not produce flicker vertigo. In view of this research and comment, the flash rate for both strobe lights and crossing lights is broadened in IR&hyph;2 at &sect;&sect;229.133(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3)(v), respectively, to permit rapid flash rates up to three per second, or 180 per minute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE ARE STARTING TO BUY SKI RESORTS IN UNITED STATES;  </P> <P> RECREATION: THEY PLAN TO BUILD GOLF COURSES ON THE TROPHY PROPERTIES THEY ARE  ACQUIRING -- SO THERE WILL BE YEAR-ROUND BUSINESS. SOUTH LAKE TAHOE'S HEAVENLY  VALLEY IS THE LATEST PURCHASE.  </P> <P> After picking up seaside golf courses, Hollywood studios and New York  skyscrapers, the Japanese have added ski resorts to their shopping list of  American investments.  </P> <P> Not long ago they arrived on the California slopes, agreeing to buy Heavenly  Valley, one of the state's choice ski areas. It is nestled amid the casinos and  hotels of South Lake Tahoe. Sapporo-based Kamori Kanko Co. grabbed the  20-square-mile resort, which is valued between $80 million and $100 million.  </P> <P> Japanese investors already own such premier ski resorts as Breckenridge and  Steamboat in the Colorado Rockies and Stratton in Vermont.  </P> <P> The Japanese love skiing almost as much as golf, and their investments come at  a time when U.S. resorts are striving to attract skiers from overseas to make  up for meager growth in the domestic market.  </P> <P> While the Japanese have purchased only about a half dozen winter resorts, "any  time you own a Heavenly Valley, a Breckenridge or a Steamboat, you have made  yourself a major player in the ski market," said Charles R. Goeldner(, a  marketing professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  </P> <P> Their deep pockets and strong yen have made them a formidable force in the  industry, allowing them to outbid Americans for choice properties and to  develop the winter resorts into year-round vacation spots.  </P> <P> "We can't afford to compete with the prices they are paying at this point,"  said Larry Jensen, director of business development at S-K-I Ltd., whose  properties include Bear Mountain resort near Big Bear.  </P> <P> But investors from Tokyo are not expected to swamp the nation's approximately  600 ski resorts with offers. Japanese acquisitions of ski resorts mirror their  purchases of select, high-profile U.S. golf courses, such as Riviera in Los  Angeles and Pebble Beach near Monterey, Calif.  </P> <P> "They are looking for big names," said Walter Elander, vice president of  Sno-engineering, a Littleton, N.H.-based resort planning firm. "It's just like  the guy who wants to own his own baseball team. If he wants recognition, he  wants the best. These Japanese entities want to be associated with the name."  </P> <P> The names represent a lot of potential value for the two Japanese companies  that have spent the most on U.S. resorts. Both Victoria Inc., which owns  Breckenridge and Stratton, and Kamori Kanko Co., which owns Steamboat and is  acquiring Heavenly Valley, have substantial interests in the Japanese sporting  goods and leisure industries.  </P> <P> "They could use the Breckenridge name for a line of consumer goods or ski  apparel," said Jack Barthell, managing partner of the Los Angeles office of  Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., which tracks Japanese investment in the United  States.  </P> <P> Besides getting valuable names, the Japanese gain a finite resource. Soaring  land and development costs and tighter environmental regulations are likely to  severely limit the number of new ski resorts. "As with any scarce resource,  they will only become more valuable with time," Goeldner said.  </P> <P> But ski resorts will take more time and investment than golf courses to yield  substantial rewards, investment experts say.  </P> <P> "The returns are thin, and the question is where are the future buyers for it,"  said David A. Eisner, a managing partner in the real estate consulting group of  Price Waterhouse. "We think this is going to be one of the few transactions  like this."  </P> <P> "It's very seasonal," Barthell said. "It goes great guns during the ski season  -- if there is good snow. A lot of the Japanese will look to put golf courses  in these areas."  </P> <P> Many Japanese ski resorts are as busy in summer as in winter. Kamori Kanko's  resort boasts a ski area, golf courses and an amusement park.  </P> <P> "One of the things that (Kamori Kanko) said that they wanted to improve is the  summer product -- that definitely includes building golf courses," said Rod  Hanna,  </P> <P> spokesman for the Steamboat Ski &amp; Resort Corp.  </P> <P> So far, however, the Japanese owners seem more concerned with winning over  longtime residents and resort workers than building golf courses. The Japanese  have kept American managers and, in the case of Kamori Kanko, has helped build  affordable housing for employees.  </P> <P> "There is some worrying because (Heavenly Valley) is now owned by someone who  isn't local," said Duane Wallace, president of the South Lake Tahoe Chamber of  Commerce. "We'd like to keep the local flavor. But I don't think you will be  able to tell that this is a business owned by the Japanese."  </P> <P> Like other resort-area officials, Wallace looks forward to more visitors from  Japan. But visions of jumbo jets arriving with loads of Japanese skiers have  yet to become a reality.  </P> <P> At the Sports Stalker ski rental shop in Steamboat Springs, manager John  Nicholson said only a handful of people have ever used the shop's Japanese  rental forms. T-shirts that say "Ski Town USA" and "Steamboat" in Japanese are  more popular. "We sell them to the Americans," Nicholson said.  </P> <P> "They are not trying to bring in busloads, carloads and planeloads of Japanese  skiers," said Bob Roberts, executive director of the California Ski Industry  Assn. "They have gone out of the way to downplay the Japanese connection."  </P> <P> "Japan is a market (for skiers visiting the United States) that presents a lot  of promise and considerable obstacles in tapping," said Jim Felton, spokesman  for Breckenridge Ski Corp., which counts Britain, Australia and Mexico as its  top three foreign markets.  </P> <P> Felton said it is difficult to persuade the Japanese to visit a new vacation  spot. U.S. ski resorts are about 20 years behind their Canadian counterparts in  wooing Asian skiers, he said.  </P> <P> But "skiing in this country is languishing," he said. "It's foolish for anybody  to exclude" the international market.  </P></p>

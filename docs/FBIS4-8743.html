			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska </F> republic, by Branislav Bozic in Banja Luka on 16 April --  recorded]    [Text] [Bozic] Mr. Karadzic, it was announced in  Washington today that the Serbian forces had entered Gorazde?    [Karadzic] They have not entered Gorazde. I do not know  what they call Gorazde, but they have not entered the town  itself. We are restraining ourselves here, but as far as  strategic points are concerned, almost all of them are in our  hands. Washington probably needs this [information that the  Serbs have entered the town] in order to launch a new attack.  The Muslims are currently activating mines around Gorazde by  means of remote control, in order to convince the international  public that we are targeting the town itself. It looks as if UN  observers, some of whom have been evacuated last night -- I  ordered a cease-fire which was a complete success on our side  and the observers were evacuated by helicopter shortly before  nightfall -- [changes thought] but it seems that they left an  observer or two behind in order to have cause to attack us in  case they are shelled. The only reason, the only justification  for an attack on Serbian positions would be our intentional  endangering of the lives of their people, which has never been  the case so far.    [Bozic] What is your assessment, will there be more bombings  of Serbian positions?    [Karadzic] We believe that there will be, we believe so  because they are very dissatisfied with the effects [of the  earlier air strikes], they are highly dissatisfied with the  degree of fear among the Serbs. The Serbs are not displaying  any fear at all. On the contrary, we are very decisive. Both  the decisiveness and the morale of both our army and the  leadership are rising. Whenever we are treated unfairly, we  always draw great moral energy from this. Therefore, we are  resolved to protect our interests. For us, Gorazde -- even if  we had taken it, we would have been right -- is not a safe haven  but a military stronghold. We believe that they have an entire  corps there, some 15,000 troops. Well, we have an entire corps  there to keep an eye on them. This corps of ours was supposed  to go and do its work in factories, but we have to (?keep it in  position) in order to ensure that the Muslims do not attack us.  That is unacceptable. The international community must be  clear on this point. It either is or is not a protected area.  If it is a protected area, the Muslims must hand over their  weapons. If they do not hand them over to the United Nations, we  will force them to hand the weapons over to us.    [Bozic] This afternoon you contacted Mr. Akashi by telephone  from Banja Luka. Can you reveal a few details of this  conversation?    [Karadzic] Well, he again received information that the  Serbs were fiercely shelling the town center. I contacted my  generals, and was told -- even by those generals who have a view  of the town, who can see the town -- that there were explosions  in the center of the town and that they resemble explosions of  remotely activated mines, but that the Serbs were certainly not  shelling the town. Nothing launched by the Serbs was landing on  the town. Moreover, the generals told me that is was possible  that this was pressure on the observers, that the observers were  actually hostages of the Muslims and were forced to send reports  that were dictated to them.</p>

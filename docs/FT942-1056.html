			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Buyers take advantage - Directors' Transactions Whenever the market experiences some slow-down, directors tend to use the opportunity to buy shares. This is proving to be the case at present. Over the past six weeks or so, there has been a steady level of buying across all sectors. Computing company ACT Group announced results the day before directors bought stock on the market. Following an additional announcement warning that profits in the present year were going to be affected adversely by product development costs, the price fell sharply. At the lower share price level three directors - Roger Foster, the chairman, Michael Hart, the managing director, and Dr Gwyn Jones, a non-executive director, bought a total of more than 129,000 shares at prices between 130p and 131p. Porter Chadburn, the leisure goods distributor, also announced final results during the week. The group recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.2m compared to a loss of Pounds 3.6m for the same period last year. Nevertheless the chairman, Patrick Barrett, remained confident about the future and three directors, including himself, and the chief executive, Tony Philipson, all bought stock at 32p. Phillip Kaye is the largest single shareholder on the board of City Centre Restaurants. Prior to this recent sale, he held more than 2 per cent of the company. This stake has now fallen to about 1.6 per cent with the sale of 1m shares at 82p.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / N-plant's removal in 130 years proposed Nuclear Electric is proposing that Trawsfynydd nuclear power station in Snowdonia will not be completely removed from the national park for more than 130 years, Roland Adburgham writes. The state-owned company yesterday published its strategy for decommissioning the Magnox station, which stopped generating electricity three years ago. It said that, after local consultation, it had agreed to lower the two 179ft reactor buildings to 104ft to ease the visual impact. 'Safestore' structures to seal the buildings would be created as speedily as possible, starting in 1996. Dismantling of non-radioactive plant would start that year but the work of removing the safestores would not begin until 2128, with completion eight years later. Nuclear Electric put the additional cost of its revised plan - yet to be approved by the industry regulator - at Pounds 22m, with the total cost of decommissioning at Pounds 138m. Kingsnorth Power has won government approval for a Pounds 500m plan to build a 600MW power station on the Medway estuary in Kent.</p>

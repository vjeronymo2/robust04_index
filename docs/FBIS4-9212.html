			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Emil Constantinescu, president of the </F> Democratic Convention of Romania, by Irinel Radulescu; place and  date not given: "The Opposition Cannot Trigger Early Elections"]    [Text] [Radulescu] Professor, you are the president of a  political force that achieved good ratings in recent public  opinion polls and has great chances to gain access to power.  How would you assess, from that new position, the current  political, economic, and social situation in our country?    [Constantinescu] From the political angle, I believe that a  simple qualitative and quantitative analysis of the current  balance of forces could not be conclusive if it is done by  ignoring the economic and social context. Currently the fact  that three separate public opinion polls reached the same  conclusions raises two issues: the CDR [Democratic Convention of  Romania] is leading, closely followed by the PDSR [Social  Democracy Party of Romania], and, contrary to all expectations,  the audience for the extreme left parties has proved to be  limited. I believe that the growth of the CDR occurred owing to  mutations within the opinion of the workers while we also  managed to keep our traditional electorate. That shift was  caused by the fact that beginning in December 1993 the CDR  accepted the trade unions' proposal to establish a real social  pact that should be guaranteed by a coalition government set up  by the major political forces in the country. The CDR did so  while the PDSR delayed making a decision merely to opt, after  four months, for a monochrome government pursuing a harsh policy  with respect to the trade unions. The second issue concerns the  number of the PRM [Greater Romania Party] and PSM [Socialist  Party of Labor] followers and it consists in the fact that the  aforementioned parties were unable to gain in their ratings  because they could not use their principal weapons --  demagoguery and populism. Those weapons pulverized from the  outset, in the very moment they decided to support a government  that is distrusted by 70 percent of the population. Under such  circumstances I believe that in the future a major role in the  changes we all wish will be played by the peasantry.    [Radulescu] You said that the program you presented last  week offers solutions and stages that have to be completed over  the next 18 months. How should one interpret that deadline --  is it signalling that you have given up the idea of early  elections, is it an offer made to the current ruling party, or  is it neither of them, but rather a third solution found by the  CDR?    [Constantinescu] We pondered all possible variants because  Romania's current situation is so grave that one cannot afford  to hesitate or perform experiments. The deadline of 18 months  was believed to begin the moment a new government begins its  activity. That government should be an anti-crisis one and if it  were to be set up by the opposition alone, it might well be a  sacrifice government with a mandate that is limited in time to  18 months. But even in such a case agreements should be reached  with the PDSR and the unions. No serious policy can be  conducted without dialogue and agreements based on mutual  respect and trust.    [Radulescu] This means that there is no firm CDR option to  hold early elections...    [Constantinescu] The opposition cannot trigger early  elections. That can be solely achieved by the president of the  country in cooperation with the parliamentary majority. The  opposition should be prepared for elections. I would like to  point out the PDSR's cynical way in which they approach this  issue, on the one hand, by saying that early elections would be  a catastrophe for the country, and, on the other, they launch  the electoral campaign. Probably, they want to trap us by luring  us into an electoral campaign in which the material means and  the possibilities are unequally distributed and thus distract  the attention of public opinion because currently they cannot  offer them bread so they offer them circus shows. In the short  run the opposition will continue to protect the interests of the  citizens, while in the long run it will protect national  interests. Our priority is not to gain victory, as a political  force, but rather to halt the decay of the economic and social  situation.    [Radulescu] The CDR, as an alliance, is currently facing a  number of internal difficulties, such as the recent problems  with the PAC [Civic Alliance Party], the "convulsions" of the  liberals within and outside the CDR, and, generally, the  multitude of ideologies condensed within the alliance. Is this  formula still viable?    [Constantinescu] Over the last one and a half years everyone  has been predicting the disintegration of the CDR. However,  that event has not occurred and now it is hard to anticipate  that any political grouping belonging to the CDR could afford,  despite lesser fits of vanity, to secede from the alliance. Of  course, life is not easy inside the CDR, but reality has proved  two things: We managed to elaborate a program that suits all  doctrinal and ideological tendencies and we managed to have all  our documents adopted by consensus. My creed and my role is to  maintain our unity.    [Radulescu] Mr. President, about a month ago the "battle"  for Transylvania also began. The PDSR and the PD [Democratic  Party] have conquered very important positions in that area.  What is the CDR's offer regarding its national policy and its  policy with respect to its ally, the UDMR [Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania]?    [Constantinescu] All that agitation has been generated by  the weakness of the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], by its  erosion caused by its long cooperation with the current rulers  and its participation in gambling schemes. As far as the CDR's  relations with the UDMR are concerned, things have not always  evolved smoothly, but eventually most of the disputed issues  could be settled. I believe that the national issue is a very  serious one, but one should also keep in mind that merely 8  percent of the population is concerned over the inter-ethnic  issue, whereas a much larger percentage focuses on economic and  social issues. As a matter of fact, running on separate lists  in the last elections, the CDR obtained the most votes in  Transylvania.    [Radulescu] How do you assess the future evolution of the  CDR's relations with the state power?    [Constantinescu] The CDR's intention, which was also  expressed in the manifest published a fortnight ago, is to  replace general and theoretical discussions by talks intended to  spot practical solutions to overcome the crisis situation.  However, the PDSR is currently blocked by its electoral pledge,  namely implementing a reform that does not hurt, as well as by  its nature of being a party of cadres, which makes it be the  defender of a group of interests made up of the political,  economic, and administrative bureaucracy, which is not  interested in reform. This makes it difficult for us to give it  a blank check in the form of a PDSR government enjoying the  support of the opposition. Cooperation is still possible, but  first we have to conclude very precise agreements regarding a  number of concrete measures to be taken before exact deadlines,  as solely this could make us selectively support them in  Parliament.    [Radulescu] You are the personality that obtained the best  ratings among the opposition. However, within the CDR there are  also strong pro-monarchy tendencies. Is that not a  contradiction?    [Constantinescu] The pro-monarchy options of some of the CDR  member parties do not contradict the constitution. Abiding by  the constitution, there is a complicated procedure to change the  state order, the whole process requiring at least two  referendums. The whole campaign that was waged against me and  the CDR was based on allegations that we want to change the  constitution. However, no one in the CDR has raised that issue.  The largest part of the percentage of votes obtained by the  PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] might  coincide with the one of the pro-monarchy option, but one has to  respect the freedom of opinion of a certain part of the  population.</p>

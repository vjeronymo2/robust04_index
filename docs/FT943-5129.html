			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Batam chosen for air maintenance centre Companies from Singapore and Indonesia are setting up an aircraft maintenance centre on the Indonesian island of Batam. Singapore Aerospace, a listed company which has traditionally focused on military maintenance and overhaul, and Nusantara Aircraft Industry (IPTN), Indonesia's state-owned aircraft manufacturing company, will each hold 25 per cent in the project. A company controlled by Mr Liem Sioe Liong, Indonesia's richest businessman, is also involved in the venture. Batam island, which in recent years has been developed into one of Indonesia's key industrial zones, is about 20 km south of Singapore. The project's backers say the initial cost of the Batam facility will be Dollars 10m. The facility will concentrate on Indonesia's fast expanding aerospace sector, but is likely to undertake other regional work in the future. Singapore's aerospace industry, faced with rising wage costs and constraints on land use, has been expanding overseas. Last year Singapore Engineering, the wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, announced it was taking a 10 per cent stake in a Dollars 63m aircraft maintenance and repair facility being set up in Xiamen in China. Last month Singapore Aerospace and other Singapore companies said they would be taking a 46 per cent share in another aircraft repair centre at Shenzhen in southern China.</p>

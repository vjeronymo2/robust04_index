			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any solution to the Navy's solid waste problem in special areas must consider the types of missions that the Navy is directed to carry out in special areas and the constraints and challenges inherent in operating warships at sea. These considerations include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Navy must be prepared to carry out duties assigned by the President to protect the nation's interests around the world. Most of the designated special areas include locations of great strategic and economic interest, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and the Baltic. Navy missions in such areas often require that ships remain on station at sea for prolonged periods of time. For example, surveillance and tracking missions for drug interdiction or for enforcement of economic sanctions would be compromised if ships were required to leave station and steam to port to offload waste. For another example, Naval ships maintaining combat air patrol over a crisis area like Bosnia often must remain on station at sea for months at a time to prevent a break in coverage. Navy ships have also often been ordered to remain for weeks or months off the coast of nations in turmoil so that U.S. forces can evacuate U.S. citizens if necessary. In other circumstances, Navy ships may be required to remain offshore to provide access to sophisticated medical care in case of injury or wounding of peacekeeping troops. Some Navy ships, especially submarines, necessarily must operate without underway logistic support from other Navy ships. Thus, the special area compliance plan must consider any impacts that it may impose on mission effectiveness and operational flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The special area compliance plan must be compatible with warship design. Navy ships are designed to maximize their ability to perform their missions, especially combat missions. Ships are self-contained units with severe limits on space, weight and power requirements for their equipment. While naval architecture and ship design always require compromise among competing priorities, Navy ships must be equipped, manned and constructed to function effectively and survive in far more rigorous circumstances than commercial ships. Navy ships must devote considerable space and weight to specialized combat systems equipment and damage control features. They have far larger crews than commercial vessels because more systems must be operated, and most routine equipment maintenance must be done by the ship's crew at sea.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many classes of Navy ships are already classified as ``space and weight critical,'' which means that any equipment added to the ship (for example, to manage solid waste) must be compensated for by removing other equipment already devoted to some other portion of the ship's mission. Many ships also have only modest additional power available to drive additional equipment and would have to turn off other important systems to use a waste control system with high power requirements. Thus the Navy's special area compliance plan must carefully address the size, weight and power requirements of any additional equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The crew size on Navy ships, an important factor in determining the size of the waste stream, varies tremendously. Submarines have crews of approximately 120. Cruisers have crews of approximately 380. Large amphibious ships have crews of approximately 2000. Aircraft carriers have crews approaching 6000. The Navy's special area compliance plan must address solutions that can be adapted successfully to several different capacities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because they operate independently in a dynamic, often physically hostile marine environment, Navy ships and the equipment on them must be designed to withstand stresses and operating conditions not encountered on shore. The Navy has experienced difficulty with some ``off the shelf'' equipment not specifically designed for shipboard use. Shipboard equipment must also be reliable, maintainable by Navy crews, and capable of being logistically supported by the Navy supply system. The Navy's special area compliance plan must address reliability and maintainability of any new equipment in a marine environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Navy faces a fiscal environment where many meritorious programs must compete for a declining total amount of resources, in terms of both funding and personnel. Development, acquisition, installation and operation of new equipment, therefore, must be cost efficient. The Navy's special area compliance plan must address the resources needed to implement it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Meter promises to track software use COMPUTER software vendors lose an estimated 40 per cent of their potential revenue to software theft, euphemistically called 'under-licensing.' That particularly happens when customers, who usually pay a fixed fee for using software on designated hardware, run it on other machines. Now US-based Proginet, a software developer for IBM mainframe host systems, has unveiled Software Meter, the first product that enables software vendors to record precisely how frequently and where their mainframe software is used. Software Meter automatically monitors a customer's applications software use and produces a report listing the software product name, customer identification number, units of usage, frequency of use and platform size and type. The information is relayed back to the vendor, by a telephone network link, and the vendor can then charge the customer accordingly. Proginet; US, 516 228 6620.</p>

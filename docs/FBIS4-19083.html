			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirela Kalostipi--recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] Ambassador of new Yugoslavia [as heard] Milan  Milutinovic in fact visited the Maximos Palace last night and  had an approximately one-half-hour meeting with the prime  minister. Mr. Mulutinovic also visited Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias at the Foreign Ministry this morning. According to a  government spokesman's statement at noon today, the subject of  discussion was developments in Bosnia. Despite all this, and  although Mr. Milutinovic was asked last night what he discussed  with the prime minister, and he said that he had conveyed a  message, when we asked government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos  what the message was about he said that the important thing is  that the developments in Bosnia were discussed and that there is  nothing more that can be released. In addition, Mr. Venizelos  described as extremely unpleasant the fact that there is war in  his area. The spokesman made this statement in response to a  question on whether the fear that the war will expand to the  south is justified. Mr. Venizelos reiterated that it is  Greece's opinion that neighboring countries or countries with  historic relations in the region should not become involved in  the areas of tension. [passage omitted]    Concerning the tension created in Greek-Albanian relations,  this tension escalated after Tirana declared the Greek consul  general in Gjirokaster persona non grata. Mr. Khristos Iakovou  was told by the Albanian authorities to leave Albania within 48  hours. This move followed the well-known incident at a military  camp guard post in the Gjirokaster area [words indistinct] and  the Albanian insistence on accusing Greece openly through  letters to international organizations, the United Nations,  European Union, and the CSCE of being responsible for this  incident.    The government spokesman said once again in this connection  that these accusations are unfounded and, in any case, our  country reacted to the Albanian Government's decision to expel  the consul general in Gjirokaster Khristos Iakovou. Our country  reacted by declaring Kastriot Robo, first secretary at the  Albanian Embassy in Athens, persona non grata. He was asked by  the Foreign Ministry to leave our country within 48 hours.  Despite all this, the Greek Government expresses its regret for  these developments for which, according to a Foreign Ministry  statement, the whole responsibility is born by the Albanian  side. Albania, because of the recent criminal incident on its  territory by unidentified elements, is trying to create a  climate of bilateral tension. The Foreign Ministry statement  further notes that the government has not spared any effort to  support the Albanian people's efforts for the reconstruction of  their country and expects the Albanian side to demonstrate the  necessary responsibility to overcome the current tension to the  benefit of security and stability in the region.</p>

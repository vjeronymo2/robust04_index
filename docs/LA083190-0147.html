			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Shelter Island -- The Times incorrectly reported that Shelter Island was  created in 1961 as a result of dredging in San Diego Bay. Shelter Island was  actually created during the early 1950s. Harbor Island was formed in 1961 when  the Navy dredged the bay to accommodate large ships like aircraft carriers.  </P></p>

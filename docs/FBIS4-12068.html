			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew on 3  April carries several reports by legal affairs correspondent  Mira Amsalem on the testimonies heard today by the Shamgar  commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre.    At 0700 GMT, Amsalem reports on the testimony of Tzvi  Katzover, head of the Qiryat Arba' Council. "Katzover warned  that more acts of despair by individuals should be expected if  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] continues to desert the  settlers, leaving them to fend for themselves. He denounced  Goldstein's deed, saying that most residents of Qiryat Arba'  disapprove of it, even if they understand the reasons that drove  Goldstein to it.    "Commission member Moshe Levi, a former chief of staff,  asked  Katzover whether the Qiryat Arba' Council had taken any action  to get rid of people whom he suspects might carry out acts of  despair. Katzover explained that the council had no authority to  expel people, but that he had approached the commander of the  Central Command and given him names of dangerous people."    At 1100 GMT, the radio reports that "sewage truck driver Eli  Ganon denied allegations that he had entered the Cave of the  Patriarchs carrying an M-16 rifle and had thus confused  witnesses trying to identify the weapon used by Barukh  Goldstein."    Ganon told the Shamgar commission that "he was not carrying  a  rifle on the morning of the massacre, but was only armed with a  pistol. He added that he normally kept an Uzi submachine gun at  home," and noted that "he did not see Goldstein on the morning  of the massacre."    At 1400 GMT, Amsalem reports on the testimony of Brigadier  General David Agmon, the chief of staff's adviser on intifadah  affairs. "His testimony centered on the question of how Barukh  Goldstein entered the Cave of the Patriarchs and whether it was  reasonable to assume that he had an accomplice. Agmon stated  that in his first debriefing to the chief of staff he had noted  that Goldstein walked into the cave through the main entrance,  and not through a side door. In Agmon's opinion, Goldstein  operated alone and was armed with a Glilon rifle which was found  in the hall after the massacre. Nevertheless, Agmon said he had  heard from soldiers that they were used to seeing Goldstein with  an M-16 rifle. He rejected the theory raised by Justice  al-Zu'bi that Goldstein's accomplice was carrying an M-16 rifle  and a bag to collect spent bullets. Justice Shamgar also  remarked that such a possibility did not appear reasonable to  him.    "Earlier, the commission heard the testimony of four of the  10-man group of worshipers Goldstein used to pray with. They  confirmed that only shots, not explosions, were heard in the  cave at the time of the massacre. A discrepancy was found  between the testimony of one of the worshipers, Yosef Nagar, and  his deposition to the police over the question of the place  through which Goldstein had entered the Muslim's prayer hall.    "Goldstein's widow, Miryam, failed to appear before the  commission."</p>

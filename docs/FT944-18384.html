			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Arts: The Slab Boys Trilogy - Theatre After months of critical vilification for a clutch of misconceived projects, the Young Vic's artistic stock stands in pressing need of a fillip. Tim Supple's production of John Byrne's greatest theatrical hits goes part of the way to that end. Byrne's semi-autobiographical trilogy follows his surrogate Phil McCann, first seen in The Slab Boys as a callous 19 year old in 1957, harbouring fierce ambitions towards the Glasgow School of Art while enduring the workaday grind (literally) in the slab room of a carpet factory. He and his drain-pipe trousered comrade, Spanky, play often savage tricks on the slab room runt Hector, pinch sticky buns from the tea lady's trolley, lust after the statuesque Lucille, give lip to all and sundry, and just occasionally pulverise paint pigments for use by the carpet designers outside whose desks they covet. The Slab Boys remains a marvel of switchback language and moods. Byrne routinely brings several different vernaculars together within a single sentence to create linguistic crossbreeds with the head of one idiom, claws of a second and wings of a third. Phil and Spanky's exchanges are sharp as a tack and, just as they career between the vocabulary of teddy boys and mock public school banter, so the emotional register can switch instantly from superficial mirth to its darker underside and back again without missing a beat. The ability to deal with personal tragedies and everyday oppressions without subordinating the comedy of the script to this darker vein, or vice versa, is one of Byrne's greatest strengths, and the first play of the trilogy is its most ebullient manifestation. Its follow up, Cuttin' a Rug, is set at the factory's staff dance on the evening immediately following the action of The Slab Boys. Its attempt to locate itself in a different style from the earlier play are, frankly, too laboured. The first act, set in parallel women's and men's cloakrooms before the 'staffie' begins, seems little more than a 45 minute prologue; the frequent asides of characters' inner thoughts to the audience feel uncomfortably Godberesque. The verbal and emotional sensitivity are still in evidence, but if seen on its own this play would be robbed of more than half its strength. Still Life - taking place in a cemetery, its two acts ten and 15 years after the other plays - is another kettle of fish again. It sees Byrne giving in either to the impulse to effect a lengthy and comprehensive closure to the trilogy, or to vicarious wish-fulfilment in re-writing his own past, or both. He so immerses himself in the play's heart-to-heart dialogues, in finally laying bare the characters of Phil, the struggling artist, and Spanky, the rock muso, that he goes on a good 20 minutes too long. Despite this over enthusiasm, the play contains moments of brilliantly understated emotion, and seemingly casual recapitulations of earlier motifs. Still Life has the feel of a coda, but does possess the dramatic strength to stand on its own. Supple's direction is sure footed and unobtrusive. He serves the scripts admirably; none of the potentially awkward mood collisions come a cropper. As Phil, Paul Higgins feelingly conveys both the character's manic larking around and the defensiveness in which it is rooted; more crucially, he does not overplay the element of 'author's proxy' in Phil until it emerges naturally in the final play. As much attention is given to Spanky who, in Stuart McQuarrie's portrayal, is astute enough to keep up with Phil but never quite gets ahead of the game. Katy Murphy, the acerbic Miss Toner in Byrne's 1986 television serial Tutti Frutti, brings the same down-to-earth suss to her performance as Lucille. Byrne's own set designs are naturally adroit. His costume designs are more questionable, obviously the author knows what he wants, but the women's costumes in particular often look less concerned with authenticity or evocation of a particular style than pandering to contemporary notions of flash. At any rate, whether or not the plays look right, they indisputably look good. Supple presumably hopes that audiences will opt to see the entire trilogy (either on separate nights or over 11 mercifully ungruelling hours on a Saturday) rather than settle for one play (which, in all candour, would have to be The Slab Boys). It remains to be seen whether his calculation will pay off. In any event, the knives which had been drawn in the Young Vic's direction are likely to be sheathed again for a while. At the Young Vic until November 12 (071 928 6363)</p>

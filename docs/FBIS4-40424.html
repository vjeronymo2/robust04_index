			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 15 June TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk has proposed making Vitaliy Masol, 66, Ukraine's new  prime minister. A member of the Ukrainian parliament, Masol was  the last head of the Ukrainian Government under communists.    Earlier he worked for 20 years at the Novokramatorsk  machine-building plant, rising from assistant foreman to general  director. He later worked on the state planning committee and  headed the Ukrainian Government until October 1990 when he  resigned in protest against the political and economic course  approved by the then parliament under pressure from national  democrats.    In the present parliament Vitaliy Masol has no party  affiliation, although he says he remains "a communist at heart."  The former premier has a good chance of regaining the post,  because the communist majority in the parliament is expected to  back his candidature.    Vitaliy Masol will present his programme to the parliament  within the next few days.</p>

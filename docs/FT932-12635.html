			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares hit again by nervous selling FRESH evidence of economic recovery in the UK proved no help yesterday to a UK stock market overshadowed by renewed firmness in sterling, which depressed the blue chip international stocks. Second line issues suffered only minor losses but the FT-SE 100 Index fell a further 20 points towards the lower end of its trading range. London's financial district spent the day coming to terms with the damage to property and confidence inflicted by Saturday's huge bomb explosion in the City. Securities trading appeared little affected, however, in spite of at least one bomb scare which prompted temporary evacuation of a leading financial house. Confidence in the outlook for equities was challenged by further demand for gold. In the past, this has often indicated a flight from currencies and paper securities because of inflation fears, but London traders refused to believe that such views are credible at present. Nervousness was compounded by a fresh slide in the Footsie futures contract, which at the close was challenging an important support level. The FT-SE 100 Index ended the day 21.5 down at 2,822.3, now around 24 points below the level at which it started the year. Market analysts admitted that if the Footsie fails to hold at around 2,790, then it could be vulnerable all the way down to 2,700. The fall in the Footsie would have been greater but for another spate of bid speculation in United Biscuits, as the shares responded to widespread hints of an impending takeover offer either from Cadbury Schweppes or another food industry leader. Strategists fear that the UK stock market, currently valued on more than 14 times this year's prospective earnings, may have already discounted too much recovery in the economy and in corporate profits and dividends. Such fears appeared supported by a cool reception from equities yesterday to news of a 0.2 per cent rise in UK gross domestic product in the first quarter of the year. While this was hailed both by market analysts and Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, as convincing evidence that the recession in the UK economy is over, it brought no perceptible recovery from early losses in share prices. Although off the top at the close, sterling made further progress against both the US dollar and the German D-Mark, and falls in shares of Britain's overseas earnings companies reflected the forced rise in their selling prices. At the same time, firmness in the pound is now thought unlikely to bring further reductions in UK base rates. The second line stocks, however, continued to avoid selling pressure. At 3,133.8, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed only 2.4 points. Trading volume decreased sharply yesterday, with the Seaq total reaching only 491.9m shares compared with Friday's 700.6m. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up about 61 per cent of total business yesterday, maintaining the average of recent trading sessions. Customer, or retail, business in equities has remained at comfortably profitable levels for the securities houses since the middle of September, when sterling's departure from the ERM triggered the recovery in share prices. On Friday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.23bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 30 Jan (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says  that the U.S. decision to supply the Zionist entity with  sophisticated assault warplanes exposes Washington's serious  course of handling international issues and flash points all  over the world.    In an article published today, the paper, which speaks for  the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds that the Zionist entity is  known for its expansionist course, for its use of force and  military aggression to consecrate its occupation of Arab and  Palestinian territories, and even for military aggression  against Arab countries not adjacent to Palestine, as happened in  its aggression on Iraq and other Arab states.    The paper wonders how Washington can convince the Arabs that  it can be an honest broker in Middle East peace talks when it  makes moves to consecrate the Zionist aggression and ensure its  superiority over the Arabs.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: Washington is talking of  democracy and human rights at a time when it wages wars and  kills tens of thousands of people in various parts of the world  every year in the name of democracy. It has continued to  provide the Zionist entity with unlimited military support  despite this entity's criminal record, which is replete with  repression and human rights abuses. The United States has chosen  to overlook the Zionists' criminal record, their demolition of  Palestinian homes, and their detention every day of hundreds of  Palestinians. It has continued to provide the Zionists with  additional sophisticated weapons. It is committed to aiding  their military superiority at a time when it is stripping the  Arabs of the requirements of self-defense.    The paper says: The United States would not have gone to  excess in this course had it not seen a willingness on the part  of some Arabs to squander the Arab nation's funds in return for  U.S. crumbs, in return for useless and obsolete weapons and  aircraft.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Those who followed U.S. arms sales to Saudi  Arabia over the past two decades must have realized that the  United States has plundered tens of billions of dollars in  return for obsolete weapons used in World War II. Nobody knows  for sure whether or not these weapons have actually been  received by Saudi Arabia. For, after all, the U.S.-Saudi arms  deals might have been fictitious. Nonetheless, what is certain  is that Washington has received billions of dollars just to  maintain the Zionists' military edge over the Arabs.    The paper concludes by saying: The big powers, particularly  the United States, are required to take more balanced positions  in their relations with world states, and also in their handling  of issues related to world security and peace. It should be  unreasonable for them to continue to work to perpetuate the  unfair embargo imposed on Iraq although it has honored all its  commitments as enshrined in UN Security Council Resolution 687.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NLRB CANCELS LABOR HEARINGS; BLAMES BUDGET  </P> <P> All unfair labor practice hearings have been canceled by National Labor  Relations Board officials because of a budget shortfall that has hampered the  federal agency and threatened its employees with temporary layoffs.  </P> <P> The cancellations affect every NLRB field and regional office in the nation,  including the office in San Diego. William Pate, NLRB deputy regional attorney  in Los Angeles, said the shortage of funds has caused the cancellations of 10  hearings in the region and one in San Diego that began on Monday.  </P> <P> The San Diego hearing resulted from unfair labor practice charges that were  leveled against the Union-Tribune Publishing Co. by the San Diego Newspaper  Guild during a bitter and lengthy contract dispute that ended earlier this  year.  </P> <P> Guild administrative officer Bill Knight said he was "disappointed and shocked"  by the sudden cancellation on the same day the hearing began. The hearing was  scheduled to continue Tuesday and Wednesday.  </P> <P> County labor leaders reacted with anger Tuesday when told that NLRB  investigators were instructed by agency officials in Washington to curtail  their queries into charges of unfair labor practices lodged by labor unions and  employers.  </P> <P> "This means the whole process (investigating allegations of unfair labor  practice) will be delayed," said Joe Francis, executive secretary-treasurer of  the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council. "It's not the swiftest process  to begin with."  </P> <P> Francis, who is the top labor official in the county, said any hearing delays  or cancellations caused by the NLRB's budget woes will favor employers.  </P> <P> "Essentially, most of the charges presented to the NLRB are made by labor,"  said Francis. "Delays have been a standard tactic of employers. This will only  help employers. This will have a tremendous effect on labor relations."  </P> <P> Claude Marston, resident officer of the San Diego NLRB office, said he and his  fellow workers were ordered Monday to cancel all hearings on calendar for  September and not to schedule any new ones.  </P> <P> He said it's uncertain if any hearings will be scheduled in October.  </P> <P> Marston said Tuesday that he was not sure how many local hearings would have  been scheduled in September.  </P> <P> Pate, from the NLRB regional office in Los Angeles, said he does not know the  size of the budget shortfall or what caused it.  </P> <P> "I don't know the details for the reason for the shortage of funds," Pate said.  "But there has been a shortage that requires a curtailment of our activities  until the end of the fiscal year."  </P> <P> The federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Marston said that travel to investigate allegations of unfair labor practice  was also "severely limited," forcing NLRB investigators to ask witnesses to  drive to downtown San Diego to be interviewed.  </P> <P> "We can still investigate unfair labor practice charges, but that's about all  we can do for the moment," said Marston.  </P> <P> The eight employees of the San Diego NLRB office have also been notified that  they will be laid off for eight days in October, Marston added. Six of the  employees are investigators and attorneys.  </P></p>

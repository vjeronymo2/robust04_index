			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Boots to appeal on dispensing rebuff BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday said local Family Health Services Authorities had refused to give it permission to dispense National Health Service prescriptions at outlets in two J. Sainsbury superstores. It intends to appeal against one of the refusals. It said the outlets, each of about 200 sq m, would continue to dispense private prescriptions as well as Boots' range of toiletries, cosmetics, baby products, special foods and film-developing services. Boots set up outlets in Sainsbury stores in July as part of a trial. It said at the launch that, if successful, the scheme would be extended nationally. Last month the company also announced it wanted to open 240 new high-street chemists stores by 1997. The company insisted yesterday the operations in superstores were viable without NHS prescription business. In spite of the rebuff from the authorities, its shares closed 5p up at 494p on a broker's recommendation. Boots said prescription business typically represented 20 per cent of its stores' sales and healthcare made up 30 per cent. Sainsbury, which proposed the collaboration, already stocks several of these product lines in its stores. The two companies said they expected to compete on price promotions and special offers. The applications to dispense NHS prescriptions were turned down at Sevenoaks, Kent, and Poole, Dorset. Boots plans to appeal over the Poole decision but believes it would not be successful at Sevenoaks. Applications at Sainsbury sites at Camberley in Surrey, Dulwich, south London, Hemel Hempstead and St Albans in Hertfordshire and Ipswich in Suffolk have not yet been made or are still outstanding. Family Health Services Authorities, which license pharmacies, assess applications on the basis of needs and effect on the local community.</p>

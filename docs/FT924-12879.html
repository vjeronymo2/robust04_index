			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Labor party steels itself for WA Inc fall-out: On the eve of a report on corruption in Western Australia Kevin Brown assesses implications for federal government AUSTRALIA'S governing Labor party is bracing itself for the release tomorrow of a report into the party's involvement in large-scale corruption in Western Australia (WA). Dr Carmen Lawrence, the state's embattled Labor premier, commissioned the report nearly two years ago in the face of rising public anger about improper dealings between the state government and local entrepreneurs. The scandal, known as 'WA Inc', centres on the loss of more than ADollars 1bn (Pounds 400m) of taxpayers' money in a series of deals with businessmen including Mr Alan Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, Mr Laurie Connell, head of the collapsed Rothwells merchant bank, and the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court. The 18-month inquiry has also heard allegations of illegal wire tapping, corrupt land and property dealing, political manipulation of public servants, and the sale of political favours for campaign donations. Most attention is likely to focus on the inquiry's conclusions about the integrity of the leading Labor figures who ran the state, particularly Mr Brian Burke, premier from 1983 to 1988, who was widely regarded at the time as a potential future prime minister. A stream of witnesses told the inquiry extraordinary tales about the Burke government's methods, which were said to have included illicit bank accounts, tampering with government records, and envelopes stuffed with money kept in ministers' offices. The government, the inquiry was told, was more influenced by the Australian phenomenon of 'mateship,' or political cronyism, than by policy commitments. Dealing with Labor, one witness said, was like dealing with the Mafia. The report could prove to be a death blow for Dr Lawrence's government, which has already lost its parliamentary majority. The loss of power in WA would be a serious psychological blow to Mr Paul Keating's federal Labor government. But the federal government may also be damaged by allegations that some of the illicit money raised in WA found its way to Canberra to help finance national election campaigns in 1987 and 1990. Evidence given to the inquiry suggested that Mr Burke raised more than ADollars 6m from a dozen or so business donors over about seven years, not all of which has been accounted for. Inquiry staff say the report will address the issue of whether the federal party benefited from the WA fund-raising, or whether the money remained in Perth, as the federal party claims. The conservative opposition parties have attempted to link the federal government to the WA fund-raising by drawing attention to a lunch in Perth at which Mr Bob Hawke, the then prime minister, discussed campaign donations with Mr Bond, Mr Connell and others. Much has been made, too, of a fishing trip hosted by Mr Connell in which he was joined by Mr Hawke and Senator Graham Richardson, then a senior federal cabinet minister and Labor power broker. Little hard evidence has emerged to link Canberra to illicit activities, which have been strongly denied by Mr Hawke and other cabinet ministers and Labor officials. However, the opposition will be quick to exploit any suggestion that the federal party's ties to WA were not entirely above board. The report is expected to recommend sweeping changes to the system of government in WA, mainly to increase parliamentary scrutiny and prevent the appointment of cronies to sensitive public service positions. The parliamentary system of government, inherited from British colonial rule, is expected to survive. But the inquiry will probably call for a Freedom of Information Act, protection for public service 'whistleblowers,' disclosure of politicians' financial interests, and an anti-corruption commission. The inquiry may also recommend criminal charges against individuals. Charges have already been brought against Mr Bond, Mr Connell, Mr Burke and several others, including Mr David Parker, the lawyer who preceded Dr Lawrence as premier. Mr Burke, who became Australian ambassador to Ireland and the Vatican after stepping down as premier, was forced to resign last year, a month after beginning to give evidence to the inquiry. He continues to deny any wrongdoing. Dr Lawrence, who is not personally embroiled in the scandal, has promised to implement all the inquiry's recommendations in the hope of distancing her administration from its predecessors. However, the signs are that the report will mark the beginning of the end for the state government, and possibly for the federal government, which must do well in WA to win the next federal election, due by June. Labor cannot even hope to get all the bad news out of the way in one fell swoop. At least three other inquiries are being held into various aspects of 'WA Inc,' including one by the Australian Securities Commission, the national corporate watchdog. All are likely to prove equally embarrassing.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PARK DEL AMO NOT SO BAD COMPARED TO SURROUNDINGS  </P> <P> I read with interest opinions regarding the Park Del Amo development (Times,  Feb. 12). It truly appears that the concern for the Madrona Marsh distracted  city officials from the density issue.  </P> <P> As a new resident of Torrance who moved from Orange County to be near my job, I  can tell you that while the project is far too dense, it is hardly ugly when  compared to the rest of Torrance. My short drive to work takes me past the  picturesque Mobil refinery, countless post-war cracker-box tract houses, a  seedy-looking trailer park, bland office parks, oil wells, mini-malls -- an  architectural smorgasbord compared to other communities I have known.  </P> <P> The industrial facility right outside Summerwind's front gates is an eyesore  and the city-owned warehouses next to Wilson Park are a disgrace. What about  the abandoned, burned-out building across from Fire Department headquarters?  Torrance is convenient, well-run, prosperous and I'm happy to call it home. But  beautiful it's not.  </P> <P> I purchased in Park Del Amo because the alternative was an overpriced  1,000-square-foot 45-year-old tract house with one bathroom and half a garage.  Though dense and architecturally indistinct, Park Del Amo provides up-to-date  housing with a manicured, unified appearance. Some of the adjacent property  should look so good.  </P> <P> I'm sure that longtime residents who purchased spacious Hollywood Riviera homes  for five figures miss the sight of farmers tilling these fields. I would, too.  But the remaining marsh can hardly be described as an "oasis" with its trash,  rusty fence, drainage sump and ugly cinder-block building. I can hardly believe  all the fuss. Too bad city officials didn't see this coming. They could have  made something really nice out of all this.  </P> <P> MIKE MICHELS  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

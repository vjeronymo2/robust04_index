			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Schumann Manuscript Gets Top Dollar: A 150-year-old manuscript of Robert  Schumann's only finished piano concerto sold at auction in London on Wednesday  for a record $1.38 million. Oxford book dealer Albi Rosenthal, who beat two  rival bidders, said the signed manuscript will go to a library in West Germany  where music scholars will have access to it. The concerto, started in 1841, was  written by Schumann for his wife, Clara Wieck, a piano virtuoso, who first  performed it four years later in Dresden. The previous record for a single  music manuscript, $471,000 for Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," was broken at the  start of the sale when an anonymous bidder paid $673,000 for a Bach Cantata.  But the record lasted for less than two hours before Rosenthal made his bid for  the Schumann work. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

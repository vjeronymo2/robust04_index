			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Mayor of Tehran prompts bitter debate over taxes BITTER public controversy has erupted in Iran this week over the policies of the mayor of Tehran, a close associate of President Hashemi Rafsanjani who will be seeking re-election in June. Ayatollah Abolqassem Khazali, a member of the Council of Guardians which reviews parliamentary legislation, has accused Mr Gholamhossain Karbaschi, who was appointed mayor in 1990, of behaving like a tyrant. In a speech he said the mayor should be tried and jailed for raising taxes unjustly and wasting public money. 'He charges people exorbitant sums which he uses to build water fountains and plant flowers in squares', said the ayatollah. 'The nation will one day bring him to trial and jail him for 10 to 15 years.' This is not the first time Mr Karbaschi has been under fire for his efforts to improve living conditions in the capital. He is one of the few senior Iranian officials to admit having enemies, not least among the city's powerful bazaar merchants and industrialists. Most of the criticism centres on his tax collection methods, ranging from levies on property development to charges on shops advertising foreign products. Merchants complain teams of assessors impose arbitrary fees. The mayor has also sought to check the population growth of Tehran by forcing companies to relocate factories some distance from the capital. Asked during a recent interview how he achieved this when companies were reluctant to move, he responded: 'We simply cut off the water and electricity.' The most visible results of Mr Karbaschi's efforts has been the improvement in traffic flows by banning private cars from the commercial area during business hours and the building of fountains and creation of green areas around the edge of Tehran. Mr Karbaschi's success in riding out earlier criticism appears to have owed much to the political support of Mr Rafsanjani who is almost certain to be re-elected as president by a massive majority. But with inflation rising and a shortage of hard currency resulting from a heavy programme of imports in the past two years, opponents of the government's economic reform programme will step up their attacks during the election campaign.</p>

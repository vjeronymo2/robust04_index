			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Jottings" by Yang Huasheng (2799 5478 0581): </F> "Russia and NATO Do a Tango"]    [Text] On 21 June, NATO and Russia signed a joint  statement on their future bilateral relations. In Brussels on  22 June, Russia's Foreign Minister officially signed the  "Partnership for Peace" accord with NATO. Did this indicate  that the previous twists and turns in the relationship between  Russia and NATO finally had come to an end?    In the last few months, Russia shilly-shallied over the  issue  of joining NATO's "Partnership for Peace" scheme, and things in  this regard underwent many twists and turns. The Russian  military, government, and foreign affairs leaders continued to  chop and change in their relevant statements, and often made  things very confusing. The fundamental reason for Russia's  chopping and changing lay in the fact that its strategic  relationship with NATO would directly concern its status as a  big power and the future strategic pattern of Europe. In  addition, this was also because Russia and NATO had their own  calculations and understandings on the issue of forming the  "Partnership for Peace."    The "Partnership for Peace" scheme was adopted by the NATO  summit meeting last January, and its central point was to adapt  NATO to the new, post-Cold War situation by replacing the  previous "containment strategy" with the "expansion strategy."  NATO will be expanded, from the current 16 members in Europe  and America, to the east; it will include former Warsaw Pact  members and other members of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe. At present, 20 non-NATO countries have  joined the partnership, and they include some Central Asian  countries in the former Soviet Union. In fact, NATO's force and  influence have stretched to the fence of Russia.    Undoubtedly, being a big power, Russia's mentality was  complicated when deciding to joint the West's peace partnership.  It had a lot of doubts and misgivings. Russia was worried that  there were "overtones" in the scheme designed by NATO. While  safeguarding its dignity and status as a big power, Russia did  not want to bring its relations with the West to a deadlock, nor  could it touch the sensitive nerve of the former Soviet Union  and the East European countries on safeguarding their national  sovereignty and independence. Some veteran diplomats said that  if Russia did not promptly adjust its relations with NATO on the  issue of the "Partnership for Peace," it would face a dangerous  situation of siege and isolation. It was against this  background that Russian Defense Minister Grachev, who used to  maintain a tough attitude, announced to NATO on 24 June that  Russia would unconditionally join NATO's "Partnership for Peace"  scheme. In early June, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev made a  statement in Paris, particularly stressing that Russia and NATO  should set up a cooperative relationship that would make the two  sides "not antagonistic toward each other, nor launching sudden  attacks on each other." He said that Russia would "not subject  its political and military actions to NATO's orders, nor plan to  oppose NATO's actions."    So far, NATO has not made any substantial concessions to  Russia's special demands; at least, NATO has not done this  verbally and openly. However, through repeated consultations  over more than one month, while adhering to its established  principles, NATO has expressed a certain degree of understanding  and compromise toward Russia's wishes. For example, NATO Deputy  Secretary General Balansino said at the opening session of the  foreign ministers' meeting on 9 June: "Russia is not only at  present, but will continue to be in the future, the sole most  powerful country in Europe"; therefore, "without Russia's  participation, it is impossible to build a new security system  in Europe."    A German newspaper said: The present relationship between  NATO and Russia is something like that between two strange  partners doing a tango. They may not coordinate each other's  pace by tacit agreement, and sometimes one may step on the  other's foot or hit the other's leg. Some experts predicted  that because of the differences in conceptions, positions,  policies, and interests between the two sides, frictions and  conflicts may still be unavoidable between NATO and Russia in  the future.</p>

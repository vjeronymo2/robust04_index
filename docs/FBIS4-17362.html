			<p>BFN     [Text] On Friday Russian Finance Ministry presented  explanations regarding the principles of foreign investment  taxation. On April 19 the American Trade-Industrial Chamber made  up of about 180 companies functioning in Russia recommended to  its members to suspend allocation of credits to Russian legal  entities due to an incorrect interpretation of the country's  legislation on the part of several tax bodies of the Russian  Federation.    The explanation of the Russian Finance Ministry says that in  accordance with Russian tax law value added tax and a special  tax are imposed on funds received from other enterprises and  organizations. Exceptions are made for funds transferred to  authorized funds of enterprises by their sponsors and funds  intended for joint activity. VAT and special tax are not  imposed on operations connected with issuance and transfer of  loans and operations related to the circulation of securities  (shares, bonds, certificates, promissory notes, and others.)    Foreign investments channelled to Russia for the creation of  joint ventures and payment for securities of Russian enterprises  procured by foreign individuals and legal entities are not  liable for VAT or the special tax, indicates the Finance  Ministry. Loans and credits granted by foreign banks and credit  offices are also exempt. In addition, taxes are not imposed on  funds which foreign states grant to enterprises and  organizations free of charge in the form of a grant for specific  projects.    The Finance Ministry also drew attention to the presidential  decree dated December 22, 1993 "On Changes in Taxation and in  Mutual Relations between Budgets of Different Levels."  According to this document, VAT and special tax are not imposed  on goods and technical equipment imported to Russia in the  framework of free technical aid which foreign states render in  accordance with inter-governmental agreements.</p>

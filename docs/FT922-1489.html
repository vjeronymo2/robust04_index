			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / International Company News: Corning takes Dollars 16m charge on implant business CORNING, the US specialty glass group, will take a second-quarter charge of Dollars 16m after-tax, or 9 cents a share, Karen Zagor reports from New York. The charge covers costs at its Dow Corning venture relating to its discontinued silicone breast implant business. Dow Corning is a 50-50 venture between Corning and Dow Chemical. ***** Upjohn, the US drug company, has had its contraceptive drug Depo-Provera, recommended for approval by an advisory panel of the US Food and Drug Administration, Reuter reports from Washington. The panel said its concerns about breast cancer risks were allayed by a World Health Organisation study showing little increased risk. ***** Toronto Stock Exchange has postponed by at least six months plans to replace its trading floor with a fully-automated trading system, Bernard Simon reports from Toronto. The exchange now expects to make the change in the fourth quarter of 1993. It needs more time to test the computerised system and train staff. ***** Shell Oil, the US unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo Dutch oil group, is selling its Shell Mining coal-mining subsidiary to Zeigler Coal for an undisclosed sum, Karen Zagor reports. Shell Mining had 1991 revenues of Dollars 600m, or less than 3 per cent of Shell Oil's Dollars 3.4bn. Zeigler, which is privately held, quadrupled sales by acquiring BP's Old Ben Coal unit in 1990. ***** McDonnell Douglas, the US aircraft maker, has cut a further 1,650 jobs from plants in Long Beach and Torrance because of slow sales of commercial airliners, AP-DJ reports from California. Since July 1990, McDonnell Douglas has cut about 16,000 jobs, including about 6,000 this year. An additional 2,000 jobs are expected to be cut by next year.</p>

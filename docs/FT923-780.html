			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Flat-fee Pep MARTIN CURRIE has followed Foreign &amp; Colonial in launching a flat-fee investment trust personal equity plan, writes Philip Coggan. It is linked to four trusts managed by the group, Securities Trust of Scotland, Martin Currie Europe, Scottish Eastern and St Andrew. The initial fee is Pounds 50 plus annual membership of Pounds 60, at Pounds 5 a month. The charge for transferring an existing Pep is Pounds 15, plus the initial fee. Subsequent investments, or withdrawals, cost Pounds 20. The plan is most beneficial to those who can invest the annual limit of Pounds 6,000. At that level, a higher rate taxpayer investing in the Securities Trust of Scotland (yield 6.6 per cent) would save Pounds 158.40 in income tax, earning back the charges within a year. But a basic rate taxpayer investing the minimum of Pounds 2,000 in Martin Currie Europe (yield 0.4 per cent) would save just Pounds 2 in tax a year. It would take 55 years merely to earn back the first year's charges.</p>

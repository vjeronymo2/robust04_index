			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> EXTRA $11 MILLION NOT REALLY A SURPLUS  </P> <P> A year-end accounting adjustment shows that Ventura County has $11 million more  in revenues than expected, but most of the money is already earmarked for  programs and services, officials said.  </P> <P> Today, the Board of Supervisors will consider a request by the  auditor-controller's office to officially recognize the $11 million, but  Assistant Auditor-Controller Tom Mahon said the action is routine and will not  provide more money for the county's coffers.  </P> <P> "This does not mean all of the sudden we are $11 million richer," he said.  "This just shows that we underestimated at the beginning of last fiscal year  the amount of revenue we would have coming in from various sources."  </P> <P> The money will be added to the county's fund balance as officials complete the  proposed 1990-91 fiscal year budget. The chief administrator's office is  proposing a balanced $653-million budget. KAREN McKEAN  </P></p>

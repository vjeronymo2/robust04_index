			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Magna advances but warns of pressure MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, reported a 26 per cent gain in fourth-quarter profits but warned that margins are being affected by customer pricing pressures. Net profit for the three months to July 31 was CDollars 39.6m (Dollars 30m), or 70 cents a share, up from CDollars 31.3m, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 649m against CDollars 625m. Earnings for fiscal 1993 were CDollars 140.4m, or CDollars 2.55, up 43 per cent from CDollars 98m, or CDollars 2.08, on sales of CDollars 2.6bn against CDollars 2.35bn. Univa, Canada's second biggest food distributor had higher profits for the second quarter and half-year before special items, helped by gains in efficiency and a 1992 acquisition. But the northern California subsidiary continued to lose. For the three months ended August 14 net profit was CDollars 11.5m, or 11 cents a share, against CDollars 3.8m, or 3 cents, a year earlier on sales of CDollars 1.9bn, against CDollars 2.1bn. The volume decline was due to an asset sale. After special items profit equalled 11 cents a share against 21 cents. First-half profit after special items was CDollars 15m, or 13 cents, against CDollars 24.5m, or 26 cents. Sales were CDollars 3.3bn against CDollars 3.6bn.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ann Marsh: "Western, Czech Interests Compete for </F> Control of Oil Refineries"]    [Text] Managers of the Czech Republic's oil  refineries are fighting to keep control over their operations,  while four Western companies have banded together with a  proposal to spend over $500 million modernizing the local  plants--in exchange for a 49 percent stake.    Four Western oil companies have mounted a half-billion  dollar  bid to revamp the outmoded Czech oil industry, but they face  stiff competition from Czech refinery owners who want to keep  operations in their own hands.    Calling themselves International Oil Companies (IOC), Agip  of  Italy, Total of France, the Dutch-English concern Shell, and  Conoco, offspring of the U.S. firm DuPont, are awaiting word  from the Czech council of economic ministers on the future of  their proposal. In return for a 49 percent stage in the  industry, they are pledging 15 billion Kc ($520 million) over  five years toward restructuring and modernizing. Depending on  regional demand for oil, that investment could more than double  over time, according to IOC Project manager Gert J. de Bruin of  Total. If approved, it would be among the largest investments in  Central Europe to date.    Approval, however, is far from certain. Although the IOC  expects word sometime this week, the economic ministers have  delayed past meetings, possibly to allow time for development of  the so-called "Czech way" counter proposal. Dusan Nepejchal,  general director of one of the two largest Czech refineries,  Chemopetrol, believes the whole basis of negotiation may be  changed, in part because of what he perceives as oversights in  the IOC plan.    The IOC proposed merging operations of the two main Czech  oil  refineries, Chemopetrol in Litvinov and Kaucuk in Kralupy. Both  plants would undergo modernization to meet environmental  requirements, increase safety measures and compete more  effectively abroad. The plants would receive Western know-how  and sell through Shell, Conoco, Agip and Total gas stations here  and in neighboring countries.    "If the Czech oil industry really wants to survive, then  these small refineries should not compete one against the other,  but be strong together," de Bruin said. Fuel producers abroad  already undercut Czech oil with less expensive, higher quality  fuels.    Nepejchal claims no argument with this principle. "We  realize  that our market is very small and we must save it for our  companies," he said. He believes, however, that integration  should include not only Kaucuk and Chemopetrol, but also the  country's two smaller refineries, Koramo in Kolin and Paramo in  Pardubice.    The "Czech way" proposal goes beyond oil-refining  activities.  Litvinov also has petrochemical operations and produces  fertilizers. Kaucuk manufactures plastics and rubber synthetics  for tires. The Czech refineries hope to modernize these sectors  as well.    Petrochemistry is of scant interest to IOC members. Although  their proposal includes technical support and contributions of  know-how to these sectors, it is not a focus for investment.  "All four companies have said their interests are in refining  and not fertilizing or petrochemistry," de Bruin said. "[They]  do not have experience in petrochemistry."    Given this fact, Nepejchal would like to see the refineries  take their own lead, while using domestic and foreign capital to  finance an industry overhaul.    "It is not such a big problem for us to get the necessary  know-how," Nepejchal said. "And there are investors, both from  Czech and foreign banks, who are interested in giving us credit."    The Czech industry will need help, however, in securing  access to global markets. For Nepejchal, this portion of the IOC  plan is the most attractive. He would like to see joint venture  agreements concluded farther down the line.    The IOC has high hopes for its vision of the future of Czech  oil refining, especially since its proposal was designed in  cooperation with the government. Several Western concerns  responded last year when Vladimir Dlouhy, minister of trade and  industry, asked for proposals to modernize the Czech oil  refining industry, de Bruin said. Shell proposed modernizing the  Kaucuk refinery, while Agip, Total and Conoco together proposed  combining Kaucuk with Chemopetrol. At the ministry's behest, the  two proposals were combined.    Keeping in mind that market access is a key selling point of  the plan, the Western oil companies are offering support for  financing the long-planned Ingolstadt pipeline, stretching from  the Italian port of Trieste through Germany to both Litvinov and  Kralupy. It would bring new sources of oil to the Czech  Republic, replacing the country's dependence on low-grade oil  from the Russian Druzba ("Friendship") pipeline. In the planning  stages for about five years, the pipeline is expected to cost DM  700 million ($421 million) to build.    Frantisek Kubelka thinks the IOC proposal is a good one. As  general director of the industrial section at the ministry of  trade and industry, Kubelka has overseen negotiations with IOC  members about the project. Still, neither Kubelka nor anyone  with the IOC would venture a guess as to what the government  will decide.    "That is difficult for anyone to say," Kubelka said.</p>

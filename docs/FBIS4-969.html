			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Inter-ethnic clashes last  week between two communities on opposite sides of the border  between Cross River and Benue States in southeast Nigeria  reportedly have left 10 persons dead and more than 15 seriously  wounded, the independent daily newspapers GUARDIAN and TRIBUNE  reported today.    These same sources point out that, during the clashes  between  the Obudus of Cross River State and the Vandeikya of Benue  State, more than 550 houses were burned and some 2,000 Obudu  villagers fled for fear of new attacks from their neighbors.    Most of the wounded suffer from wounds inflicted by firearms  and machetes. The military administrators of the two states,  Captains Joshua Obademi of Benue State and Ibrahim Kefas of  Cross River State, held a meeting over the weekend, after which  they sent a strong warning to anyone who is found responsible  for new outbreaks trouble between the two communities.    Funds have been allocated by the two administrators to come  to the aid of the victims. The drawing of the border between  the two states at the time of the British protectorate, which is  contested by the Vandeikya, is said to be the cause of the  clashes between the Obudus and Vandeikya, according to evidence  collected by the GUARDIAN.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FAIRE TO REMEMBER  </P> <P> Revelers and carousers in motley, with the wind in their faces and ribbons in  their hair, can dance a jig and rejoice: The annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire  is back, starting this weekend and continuing weekends through June 25. After a  long search for a place to relocate the elaborate 16th-Century setting, a home  was found near Devore in San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> So, m'lords and ladies, freemen and women everywhere, 'tis time again to pull  out your leggings and leather vests, the long skirt and peasant blouse and your  desire for a Renaissance good time.  </P> <P> For more than 15 years, the Faire was held in the soft, oak-shaded hills of  Agoura at the old Paramount Ranch. When that site was tentatively approved for  a single-family home development, the search began for a new location. In late  March, the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors gave permission to hold  the event at Glen Helen Regional Park, site of the 1982 and 1983 U.S. Festival,  which drew 175,000 a people a day. (The Faire is expected to attract about  12,000 people a day.)  </P> <P> The new site, several acres larger than the previous one, has two lakes (aptly  named Willow Pond and Lake Elizabeth, which the Faire will surround on three  sides), ample shade from a plethora of trees and cool grass instead of dust and  straw to stroll over as you appreciatively eye the handmade wares for sale.  And, like the previous Faire, to keep the mood Elizabethan, the parking will be  out of sight behind Faire structures.  </P> <P> The setup will remain pretty much the same personable yet grungy affair, what  with hawkers, buskers, men and maids of "questionable reputations" strolling  and entertaining through the crowds, bright banners and flowered garlands  overhead, and many, many places to part a soul from his coins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coins From Metal  </P> <P> Booths that show as much character as their owners will once more display  handmade ceramics, glass, clothes, jewelry and perfumed oils.  </P> <P> New this year in the crafts area is a coin striker who will demonstrate the  production of finished coins from raw metal. Also new is a woodworker who will  make lathe-turned vases from hardwood. In its second year is a bronze foundry,  where the smith casts goblets and sometimes face masks (your face can be done  -- from a plaster mold, of course).  </P> <P> You also can have your fortune told, your body massaged, your runes cast and  your aura read, but it's those "past" entertainments, and not so much the  future, that are so engrossing in this little bit of the 16th Century.  </P> <P> New on the agenda also is a rounders tournament (a predecessor to baseball)  organized by Wells Twombly, sports director for Community Outreach for the  Living History Center, producers of the Faire.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Renaissance Rules  </P> <P> "We have 14 teams signed up (with 12 members each; though only eight play at a  time)," Twombly says. "In rounders, there are eight outs because there are  eight players, so a whole inning entails 16 outs. On top of everything else,  there are no strikes and no balls.  </P> <P> "Outs occur by catching the ball in the air, catching the ball on one bounce  with one hand or hitting the runner with the ball as he's running," Twombly  says. "Everyone has to get a hit. Just touching the ball with a bat constitutes  a hit. The only foul area we recognize is hitting a ball into the stands."  </P> <P> The game was the predecessor to a game played in the United States in the early  1800s called "townball" (played on the town green). The tournament will be  played every day at 4:30 p.m. until the Faire closes at 6 p.m. There will be  feature games earlier in the day and pickup games with Faire-goers joining the  teams. See the schedule board at the horse-tournament area for specific games.  </P> <P> There also will be demonstrations of battledore (predecessor to badminton,  played with leather paddles), goff (the old version of golf, played with a 4  1/2-foot club) and football -- sort of a combination of Rugby and soccer, from  which both games actually were derived.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Time to Eat  </P> <P> In the delectable, savory, mouth-watering and messy food stuffs, one may wander  and make a splash with a turkey drumstick dripping with sauce, or attempt to  keep sherbets and ices from running down the chin. There are cookies and  artichokes and baklava and piroshki, Turkish coffee, English ale and lemonade.  </P> <P> A new catering booth, aside from its a la carte service, has set up a feast you  may join (for $12.50 and a reservation). You sit at a communal table, are  served by costumed performers and partake of a grand meal consisting of a  Cornish hen in nutted wine sauce, pork baby-back ribs, steamed vegetables with  cheese sauce, fresh baked loaves of bread and your choice of a poached pear  filled with carob cream or baked apple, all washed down with iced tea. Beer and  wine are extra.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reservations Required  </P> <P> Keep in mind that reservations are required in advance (taken the day you are  there only if there's room). The number for reservations: (714) 642-0262.  Seating for 30, twice a day.  </P> <P> But more than all the food, crafts and extravaganzas, mummers, jugglers and  belly dancers, it's the ambiance, the whole fragrance, color and swash of the  Faire that make this event so special. Take a moment to sit somewhere and watch  the Faire-goers and players. Take a moment to really drift back and imagine  yourself in the 16th Century.  </P> <P> It's better than beer and much more soul-satisfying than an amusement park.  </P> <P>  From downtown Los Angeles take Interstate 10 (San Bernardino Freeway) to  Interstate 15 north. Follow the signs to Interstate 215 south and exit  immediately at Devore Road. From the east, take Interstate 215 north to Devore  Road. Follow signs to parking. Tickets are available at Ticketmaster or May  Co., by telephone (800) 52-FAIRE and at the gate. Admission: adults, $14.50;  children 3-11, $7.50; seniors and students at the gate, $11.50. Children under  3, free.  </P> <P> </P></p>

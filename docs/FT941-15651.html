			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Balladur loses case on private schools France's constitutional council yesterday slapped down the conservative Balladur government's private school finance reform, in a move which the Socialist opposition hailed as a victory for public education. The nine-member council ruled that the bill's controversial removal of an 1850 limitation on public funding of private, largely Catholic schools, infringed the constitutional equality between public and private education. 'Article 2 of the law on investment aid to private education institutions by local authorities is contrary to the constitution,' the council said. But it threw out Socialist objections that the government had improperly rushed the bill through the Senate just before Christmas. Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist party leader, said the ruling was 'a victory for all those who are attached to public education'. The schools row has galvanised the Socialist party, shattered in last March's elections, into helping to organise a big Paris protest this Sunday against government education policy. Evidently aware that the council's ruling might reduce attendance, Mr Rocard still urged 'all defenders of lay education' to turn out on Sunday. An opinion poll published in the weekly magazine Globe-Hebdo earlier this week said 60 per cent of voters backed the protest, while only 33 per cent opposed it. The Socialists have argued that the law would have created discrimination and a two-tier system. The prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, facing his first test on an issue for which the opposition has popular backing, refused any immediate reaction to the council's ruling. But earlier, on a trip to Bordeaux, he commented that criticism of his school funding plan was motivated 'less by hostility to private education than by worries about public schools'. The 1850 law stipulates that regional and municipal authorities can fund no more than 10 per cent of private schools' infrastructure, though for the past 35 years the French state has paid teachers' salaries and running costs of private schools which undertake to follow the state syllabus and exams. Mr Balladur has this month tried to appease his opponents, who argue that any more public funding of private schools will be at the expense of state education, by promising an extra FFr2.5bn (Pounds 280m) to improve physical safety in public schools. But yesterday's ruling will not stop his own backbenchers, particularly in his UDF coalition party, from railing against the 1850 restriction which many right-wing councils are anyway flouting.</p>

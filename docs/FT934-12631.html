			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): When cash is a factor Factoring and invoice discounting, both ways of raising cash against a business's invoices, have increased in popularity in recent years as companies have realised the limitations of the overdraft. A factor will take over the administration of his client's sales ledger, provide credit protection and advance cash against invoices. An invoice discounter only provides cash. But how does a company choose a factor? Cash Flow Solutions, a consultancy*, makes the following suggestions: Check the financial strength of the factor and find out who are the backers. The large bank-owned factors are all members of the Association of British Factors and Discounters but there are many sound factors outside the association. Obtain the names of one or two of the factor's clients in your industry sector and ask them about the speed of service provided. How quickly are requests for increases in credit lines met? How helpful are the staff? Could the factor provide an export service if you started selling overseas and does he have an invoice discounting service if you outgrow factoring? How generous will the factor be in providing funds against invoices? One company was offered pre-payments of 33 per cent and 65 per cent by two different factoring companies. Are the credit limits offered by the factor adequate for your business and your customers? Check which fees the factor will charge. Is there a cost for transferring funds in addition to the administration fee? Are there any arrangement, commitment or renewal fees? Choose a factor which is within easy travelling distance. Although most contact will be by telephone or computer link-up, it helps to maintain personal contact. What happens if you want to end your agreement? The notice period required varies. Some agreements only allow notice to be given on the anniversary of the agreement; others permit termination within three months of written notice. *Tel. 0273 692567.</p>

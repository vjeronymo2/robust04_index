			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Setback to US hopes for domestic recovery THE Bundesbank move comes as a severe disappointment to the US administration, which has based its own hopes of a domestic economic recovery largely on a policy of pressing the Federal Reserve to make repeated cuts in its discount rate. Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, has tried for some time to urge his opposite numbers in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations for a more concerted effort to boost world economic growth, and claimed some success in this direction at the Munich economic summit this month. The Munich agreement, however, relied heavily on the premise that Germany's promise to rein in its budget deficit would pave the way for interest rate cuts. Senior Treasury officials have until now been careful not to blame the Bundesbank for Germany's relatively high interest rates, criticising instead the German federal budget deficit and heavy borrowing by quasi-governmental organisations such as the state railway and telecommunications companies. Although yesterday's German move was not unexpected on Wall Street, economists and foreign exchange analysts said it would put the already shaky dollar under further pressure. Mr Steve Giovanis, a forex dealer with Merrill Lynch, said during a midday break from hectic trading: 'It feels as though short-term the pressure is not off (the dollar), particularly with these other rate increases in Europe today. The rate differentials just continue to be enormous' - referring to the gap between the 3.25 per cent yield on US short-term Treasury bills and the near-10 per cent yield on comparable German securities. The latest German rate increase could not have happened at a worse time for the dollar, coming barely two weeks after the Fed slashed domestic interest rates to stimulate an ailing economic recovery. Economists said there was little the Fed could do over the short term to protect the dollar, except to try to hold it up through intervention in the foreign exchange markets. Mr Joe Taylor, foreign exchange analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said: 'The Fed is certainly in no position to tighten (monetary policy) given the politically sensitive time period we're in and the state of the economy.' Mr Taylor warned that the dollar could fall further against the D-Mark over the next few days and weeks, testing its most recent low against the German currency of DM1.44.</p>

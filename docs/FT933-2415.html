			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: China fund FLEMINGS is launching what will be only the second specialist China investment trust in the UK. The Fleming Chinese Investment Trust aims to take advantage of high growth rates and the rapid development of a free market in China to produce long-term capital growth for UK investors. The fund will aim to raise between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m from institutions and investors. The number of companies with shares listed on mainland Chinese markets is very small - a total of 30. Therefore initially a large proportion of the fund will be invested in smaller Hong Kong companies, with a market capitalisation of less than USDollars 300m, which derive a substantial part of their revenue from China. The fund will also buy 'H' shares, issued on the Hong Kong exchange by mainland Chinese companies. However, a significant amount will be invested from the start in the 'B' shares open to foreign buyers on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and, as opportunities arise with new issues, the proportion of the fund invested directly in China will be increased. Small proportions will also be invested in Taiwanese and Korean companies with strong China connections. The investment portfolio will be managed by Jardine Fleming, which is based in Hong Kong but has offices in Shanghai, Taipei, and Seoul. Jardine Fleming already runs two China funds, listed in New York and Hong Kong. The offer price for the new trust is 100p a share. There will be one warrant issued with every five shares, which can be exercised at 100p on dates between 1998 and 2004. The fund's life is unlimited, but there will be a continuation vote after ten years. Expenses for the issue will be capped at 3.5 per cent, but should be closer to 2.8 per cent if the full Pounds 50m is raised. Annual management fees and administration costs will add up to about 1.45 per cent. The shares will not pay a dividend. The public offer opens on September 22, and closes at 10am on Friday October 8. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,500, the maximum that can be invested in this kind of fund via a Pep. However, investors who make use of this route will have to use a self-select Pep. It will also be possible to invest through a monthly savings scheme once dealing in the trust's shares has started on October 19. Minimum investment is Pounds 40 a month.</p>

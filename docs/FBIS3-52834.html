			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El  Hamra and Rio de Oro [Polisario] obviously did not expect the  visit of French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua to Layoune,  capital of Western Sahara, on Friday. In a communique released  last night, Saharawi leaders made no secret of the fact that  they were surprised. Jerome Bastion reports:    [Bastion] Twenty-four hours after Charles Pasqua's brief  visit to Layoune, the Polisario Front in Algiers expressed the  surprise and the total dismay of the Saharawi people regarding  this most serious gesture. According to the communique, this  first visit by a leading foreign official to Western Sahara is  in blatant contradiction with the responsibility of France, a  member of the UN Security Council.    France recently offered its good offices to set up a direct  meeting in Paris between Moroccans and Saharawis, after  Polisario leaders had criticized France's wait-and-see policy in  connection with the settlement of the conflict in Western  Sahara. The visit by the French interior minister, although  unofficial, has thus caused frustration and disappointment, I  quote, among the Saharawis, all the more so because it was to be  followed by that of his Saudi counterpart.    At the same time, the UN representative for Western Sahara,  Yaqub Ali Kahn, is touring the region. He is visiting the  refugee camps of Tindouf today. He said yesterday in  Nouakchott, in Mauritania: The issue of the Sahara is in a  critical state.    The referendum on self-determination was to take place at  the  end of 1993 under the aegis of the UN. The UN secretary general  has just announced that it could be organized next June. The  issue is still in deadlock. It was to be at the core of the  talks which took place yesterday between the Algerian foreign  minister and Saharawi President Mohamed Abdelaziz together with  his minister of defense and of foreign affairs.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Observer: Revolutionary marriage It seems Yassir Arafat, who had always claimed the Palestinian revolution was 'my woman, my family, my life', has secretly wed his youthful secretary Suha Tawil, in Tunis. While Middle East capitals have been buzzing with rumours that the 62-year-old had succumbed to marriage at last, it was left to the bride's mother, Raymonda, to speak first. 'I cannot deny it, but it is Chairman Arafat's right to declare it officially,' she said. More Delphicly, one of Arafat's top aides told Observer's man on the spot that it was not something he had discussed with his boss, since he did not concern himself with Arafat's internal affairs. Nevertheless, Arafat's private life has long been the subject of all manner of speculation - one recent rumour had him married to his Egyptian biographer Rashida Mahran. The bride is certainly well connected; she is 28 and comes from a prominent Christian family on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Her journalist mum is a well known Palestinian activist, and longstanding friend of Arafat's; her brother headed the Palestine Information Office in Washington. Suha Tawil is said to have converted to Islam. Arafat himself is a Sunni Moslem. Palestinian friends are speculating that the peripatetic Arafat, who has been spending more time in Tunis, may have decided to slow down. In any case, fewer countries welcome his visits since he supported Iraq in the Gulf war.</p>

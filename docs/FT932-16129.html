			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Steering committee approves new figures for FT-SE indices THE FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices Steering Committee yesterday approved the calculation of total return figures for the FT-SE 100, FT-SE Mid 250, FT-SE Actuaries 350, FT-SE SmallCap and FT-Actuaries All-Share indices. Daily publication of these figures in the FT will start on July 1. Extracts from the committee's announcement follow: 'The total return figures will be able to take account of both price performance and income received from dividends and will provide a way for investors to judge more accurately the return on their investments. The new figures will be calculated gross of tax and will assume that the dividend and tax credit are reinvested immediately on the ex-dividend date. The published ex-dividend data will also allow investors to calculate the figures net of tax. 'The figures will be calculated at the close of each trading day, and will be published in the Financial Times and on Topic. 'Donald Brydon, chairman of the committee, said: 'Investors, both professional and private, will now be able to compare the overall performance of their investments with a recognised standard for the first time. The performance of fund managers is measured in terms of total return on investment, rather than purely in terms of price movements in the market, and the new figures reflect this.'' The method for calculating the total return indices was recommended by a working party set up by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries, chaired by Mr David Wilkie of R Watson &amp; Son.</p>

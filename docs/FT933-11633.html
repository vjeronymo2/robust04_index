			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Broker emerges from retailer's umbrella - Dean Witter Discover is prospering in its independence DEAN Witter Discover, the securities brokerage and credit services company, is enjoying new-found independence after 12 years as a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck, the large US retailer. Last week, the company, which went public in February, announced a record profit of Dollars 157m for the second quarter, which pushed its stock up to Dollars 38 5/8 , close to its high. The decoupling of Dean Witter from Sears, part of a strategy by the retailer to concentrate on its core businesses, began in February when 20 per cent of the company was sold to investors via an initial public offering. Four months later, the remaining 80 per cent was distributed to Sears shareholders in the form of a dividend, and on July 1 Dean Witter Discover began life as a 100 per cent publicly-owned company. Dean Witter has emerged from under the Sears umbrella as a curious, but highly profitable, hybrid. A company with a big presence in the retail stockbroking and asset management that happens to be the largest single issuer of credit cards in the US. Dean Witter's credit services division, through its Discover credit card, last year contributed more than half the company's annual profit of Dollars 410.5m. At the end of 1992, the Discover card was the largest single-issuer credit card in the US with 39m members. It ranked second (after Citibank) in outstanding receivables, and third (after American Express and AT&amp;T) in dollar transaction volume. The Discover card, launched nationally in 1986, was initially seen by many industry observers as a foolhardy diversification by Sears. At the time, says Mr Philip Purcell, Dean Witter's chairman and chief executive, 'everybody thought that it was a mistake'. Sears was determined to expand its financial services operations, and invested Dollars 200m, after-tax, in Discover over the first two years. By the third year, it was producing a profit. The decision to aim the card at value-conscious consumers and build a large base of merchants who took the card (1.7m as of 1992), quickly paid off. The card attracted 6m holders in each of its first two years. New cardholder growth has slowed, most notably last year, when only 800,000 net new accounts were reported. The sharp drop has concerned analysts and investors. However, Mr Purcell blames the slowdown on two exceptional factors. First, the mailing of pre-approved applications to potential customers was halted for nine months last year because of a mistake in the mailing process. Second, Dean Witter is purging inactive accounts to save servicing costs, a move which accounted for 700,000 cardholders last year. Mr Purcell says account growth will improve this year, and pick up in 1995 when the purging of inactive accounts is complete. Dean Witter is trying to cut its Discover costs as competition between card issuers becomes hotter than ever. 'I think there are things going on in the market place that we are concerned about. You have now got a number of competitors offering value-oriented products,' Mr Purcell admits. The company has responded by lowering the interest rate it charges favoured customers, by targeting mailings more efficiently, and by building its merchant base further. As a result margins have been squeezed. On the positive side, the move to variable interest rates on cards means the company has access to cheaper variable funding. Dean Witter plans to issue its own Visa card, called Prime Option. However, those plans are foundering on opposition from Visa, which disputes Dean Witter's right to issue Visa cards under its Discover label. The dispute rests in the courts, and Dean Witter knows it is in a legal battle that could drag on for years. 'They're trying to keep us out of the business, we're trying to get in the business. We're in a hurry, they're not. As long as they can drag the process out, they win,' Mr Purcell says. On the securities side, Dean Witter continues to consolidate its position as a retail broker with a strong asset management business. The firm has Dollars 65bn of client assets under its control, and continuous fee income from managing that money covers 71 per cent of the brokerage's fixed costs. Its focus on broking, and selling the retail customer financial products such as mutual funds, plus its decision to steer clear of more volatile businesses such as proprietary trading and investment banking, means Dean Witter's revenue growth has been the most consistent of any Wall Street securities house. In 1990, for example, the firm posted a hefty profit and a 19 per cent return on equity while the rest of the industry racked up large losses. Although Mr Purcell says running two businesses as different as securities broking and credit services is not a strain on management, some observers worry that if a serious problem develops in one business, it could hurt the other. Mr Michael Flanagan, securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical in New York, cautions: 'There is no commonality between securities brokerage and credit cards, and one management is running two businesses, which has got firms into trouble before. I see two disparate organisations as a possible Achilles heel.' In spite of these concerns, industry analysts are upbeat about Dean Witter's immediate prospects, particularly while the boom in asset management and retail broking lasts. However, now that it is no longer part of Sears, Dean Witter is finding its own funds, and its businesses are expensive to run. Sears was keen to sell because financing the credit card business was increasingly costly. Mr Flanagan says: 'Now that it's on its own, the company is aggressively securitising its (credit card) receivables. Plus, continued growth in managed assets requires continued growth in reserves, and thus capital, which will come from public markets.' Analysts do not envisage any problem in that department, with sentiment about the company among the investment community still strong. On the debt side, financing should be available, because Dean Witter's debt ratings have improved since it went public.</p>

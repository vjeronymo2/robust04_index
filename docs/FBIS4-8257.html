			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 9 (CTK) -- Richard Falbr, 54, has  been elected chairman of the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of  Trade Unions (CMKOS), it was announced officially at the CMKOS  1st congress shortly after midnight.    Until now CMKOS deputy chairman, Falbr received 943 out of a  total of 1,362 valid votes in the first round of the vote. He  is replacing Vladimir Petrus who was elected CMKOS chairman in  April 1990.    Cyril Zapletal, chairman of the Union of Mining, Geology,  and  Oil Workers won 150 votes, Bohumir Dufek, chairman of the  Bohemian and Moravian Agriculture and Food Trade Union, received  84 votes, and Karel Macura, deputy chairman of the strongest  Kovo (metallurgy) union was supported by 61 delegates.    Immediately after the election, the CMKOS Assembly,  comprising representatives from individual unions  proportionately to their memberships, met at its constituent  session. It is to elect four CMKOS deputy chairmen.    After the November 1989 "velvet revolution", Falbr became  the  chairman of the Bohemian-Moravian Trade Union of Service  Workers. He briefly held the post of deputy chairman of the  Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and was the last  head of Czechoslovakia's largest union organization, the Czech  and Slovak Confederation of Trade Unions (CSKOS).    He held the post even after Czechoslovakia's split on  January  1, 1993, as the CSKOS continued its operation to help solve the  problems of the labor market and joint Czech-Slovak economic  relations. In November 1993 the CSKOS disbanded, and its two  successors, the independent Czech (CMKOS) and Slovak chambers,  were established.    Falbr continued his union activities. He contributed to the  integration of three trade unions, those of service area, gas  industry, and foreign trade workers, into the UNIOS trade union,  of which he was elected chairman in mid-February 1994.    Falbr, a doctor of law, was born on September 29, 1940 in  Chester, Great Britain, where his father served in the Czech air  force unit. Falbr's mother was Spanish, which may have  contributed to Falbr's good knowledge of foreign languages.    From 1968 to 1970 Falbr was a member of the Communist Party  of Czechoslovakia. From 1963 to 69 he taught Spain and English  at the Interior Ministry's School of Languages. Falbr is  married and has a son and a daughter.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Observer: Knowledge gaps Where would you expect to find the following: Adam Smith Society, Alchemists (Elizabethan Studies), Association for the Historical Study of the English Revolution, Association for the Study of Modern English Law? They are four of the first five names listed in a directory of British Studies Societies in Japan, compiled by the British Council. The second on the list, which would have given the game away, is the Agatha Christie Fan Club of Japan. The 113 societies' interests also include Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, the Brontes, Browning, Chaucer, D H Lawrence and so on down to Yeats - who might be counted as British for at least the earlier part of his life. According to Tadashi Yamamoto, president of the Japan Centre for International Exchange, the list shows Japanese intellectuals' awareness of Britain's literary and artistic heritage. By contrast, he told the UK-Japan 2000 Group's latest meeting, 'there are very few scholars or experts in Japan well versed in the current political dynamics of the UK or its policy process'. The group hopes to put that right by promoting educational exchanges between the two countries. When its members met Prime Minister Major, however, his special concern seemed to be to spread knowledge of cricket - and not only to the East. Thanks to the Japan Festival, he said, there were now thousands of British schoolchildren who knew more about sumo wrestling than about their own national summer game.</p>

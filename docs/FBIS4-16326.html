			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Simferopol April 14 TASS -- The appointment of a  Ukrainian presidential representative to the Crimea and the  recent seizure of a Black Sea unit by Ukrainian paratroopers in  Odessa are "links in one and the same chain. They are designed  to destabilize the situation and could be used as a  justification for introducing Ukrainian presidential rule into  the Crimea", according to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov.  Meshkov complained to ITAR-TASS that the Kiev administration's  actions are preventing Crimea's new leadership from getting down  to work. "We have not been given even the least bit of  breathing space so that we could start working on economic  decisions under normal conditions", he said.    Commenting on the recent elections to the new Crimean  parliament, where the electoral bloc "Russia" holds a majority  of the seats, Meshkov noted that the administration and  parliament had the same goals, which "gives us the possibility  of working constructively". In reply to a question about the  relations between the Crimean and Russian leadership, Meshkov  said, "let me put it this way: The Crimean president does not  feel isolated, and the "climate" of Russia's Crimean policy has  become significantly warmer".</p>

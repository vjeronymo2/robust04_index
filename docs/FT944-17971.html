			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (19): New network plans gather speed - European transport / The drawing board is now firmly in place to help provide Europe with a vastly improved transport system by the start of the new millennium TRANSPORT: Integrated projects such as the Channel Tunnel, new high speed rail networks and motorways will help ease Europe's transport bottlenecks Big growth in freight traffic in the Single Market has put the European Union's infrastructure under increasing strain. From 1985 to 1990, road tonnage on internal EU journeys increased by 26 per cent from Denmark to around 50 per cent from most other countries to a massive 110 per cent from the UK. The only country for which figures showed a decrease for that period was West Germany, down 8 per cent. The economic slowdown which characterised the early 1990s is certain to have slowed down the rate of growth since, but according to Simon Chapman, economist for the Freight Transport Association, 'now we are out of recession there will be growth again, especially as more companies continue to exploit opportunities in eastern Europe.' His views echo those held by the EU, and plans for what has now been dubbed the Trans-European Transport Network are gathering speed. Last December, Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, set up a group of transport experts under Danish commissioner Henning Christophersen to look at 40 proposals mooted for the network. Their brief was to identify 10 priority projects that should be put under way as rapidly as possible. Among other criteria needing to be considered, a Brussels White Paper set out that each one had to 'have a positive economic impact, including improvements in the Community's competitiveness and technological performance; contribute to important Community objectives such as economic and social cohesion; allow scope for private investment in a broad sense; and be 'mature' so that they can be realised quickly.' Henning Christophersen has now reported back, and work on the following is said to have either begun or is 'likely to begin within two years': The Brenner axis (high speed train/combined transport). A high speed train linking Paris-Brussels-Cologne-Amsterdam-London (the Channel Tunnel is part of this scheme). A high speed train between Madrid, Barcelona and Perpignan, which will also link Madrid with Victoria and Dax. A high speed train going east from Paris to Metz and Strasbourg. There will also be junctions joining Metz with Luxembourg and with Saarbrucken and Mannheim. In Germany itself, a similar service will run between Munich, Nuremberg, Erfurt, Halle/Leipzig and Berlin. A combined transport/conventional rail system from Rotterdam to the German border and the Rhine and the Ruhr. A high speed rail/combined transport system between Lyon and Turin. A motorway between Patras, in Greece, and the Bulgarian border, together with a west-east motorway corridor via Ignatia, Igoumenitsa, Thessaloniki and Alexandroupolis. A motorway between Lisbon and Valladolid. A rail link between Cork, Dublin, Belfast, Larne and Stranraer. An airport at Malpensa, Milan. The total cost of these projects is estimated at Ecu68bn, (Dollars 84.32bn or Pounds 53.51bn) of which the EU will provide between Ecu 15bn and Ecu 20bn from regional funding. The remainder will be raised through private investment. Martin Richards, director, Brussels, for the Freight Transport Association and the association's Permanent Representative to the Community, said the EU had both the desire and the will to create an integrated infrastructure. It recognised the importance of this not just because of the needs of the Single Market, but also because of the liberalisation of eastern Europe. There was a likelihood that several countries from that region would join the Union. But, even if they did not, there would still be a big increase in trade as the eastern region looked more towards the west, said Mr Richards. The EU also had a strong desire to encourage the development of inter-modal systems - which is the movement of goods by a variety of means. One of the principal aims was to make more use of rail and waterway systems to reduce the numbers (and effects) of lorries on the roads. But this, said Richards, should not be confused with what was termed the 'network routes.' The latter was about integration - that is, if a new port was built, then both a road and a railway should link up with it and there should, if possible, be an airport nearby. He added that the Commission was taking a particular interest in the resurgence of coastal shipping, which, as well as freeing crowded roads from traffic, could be used for feeding inland waterway systems. Although the EU itself does not get involved in inter-modal projects as such, some years ago it started a funding programme to encourage private and state enterprise to pursue projects believed to be worthwhile. Called PACT (the Programme of Assistance for Combined Transport), it pays for studies, market research and trials for approved projects. One recent PACT funding has been for a comprehensive study looking at piggy-backing - the loading of trailers (rather than containers from trailers) on to trains. To win approval, a project must be genuinely inter-modal and pan-European. Several advances towards increasing inter-modal transportation have taken place recently, including, of course, the Channel Tunnel. Two other projects considered particularly significant have been the UK government's agreement to allow an increase in weight (38 tonnes to 44 tonnes) for lorries feeding railheads; and the start of a twice-weekly train service between Rotterdam and Verona, where there is a large terminal for onward movements. The Freight Transport Association is, says Martin Richards, in favour of inter-modal systems - 'but,' he points out, 'it's not the panacea that many environmentalists believe. As laudable as the aims are, the vast majority of journeys, apart from in large countries like France, are only about 40 miles. 'Clearly, such short trips are not worth the effort and cost of double handling; and, in some cases, and in the UK in particular, railway networks are not extensive enough - they don't go where they used to, or where they ought to.'</p>

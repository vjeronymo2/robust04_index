			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Huntsman-Packer venture buys Texaco chemicals TEXACO, the US oil group, yesterday sold of most of its chemical operations for Dollars 1.06bn (Pounds 680m) as part of the restructuring of the petrochemicals industry in Europe and the US. The business is being acquired by a joint venture between Huntsman Financial Corporation, a subsidiary of Huntsman group, the US's biggest private chemical company, and Consolidated Press Holdings, Mr Kerry Packer's Sydney-based media and investment group. Huntsman Corporation, the 50-50 venture, will be managed by Mr Jon Huntsman, the chief executive and founder of Huntsman Financial Corporation, and his family. Mr Huntsman said the deal showed his and Mr Packer's determination to expand their global chemical operations. Last year the companies jointly acquired the Chemplex petrochemical complexes in Melbourne, Australia. The deal boosts the annual revenues of the Huntsman companies from Dollars 1.8bn to more than Dollars 3.1bn. Huntsman also announced it was acquiring the expandable polystyrene operations of Elf Atochem at Ribecourt in north-east France for an undisclosed sum. The plant has an annual capacity of about 75,000 tonnes, although it is operating at only 52,000 tonnes a year because of overcapacity in the European market. The business had a turnover last year of more than FFr400m (Pounds 45m). In a separate deal, Elf Atochem announced it was acquiring the French low density polyethylene activities of Enichem, the troubled Italian group. The plant, attached to Elf Atochem's petrochemical facilities at Carling Saint-Avold in eastern France, has a capacity of 210,000 tonnes a year and a turnover of about FFr900m. Terms were not disclosed. Texaco's chemicals operations generated a trading loss of Dollars 49m last year on turnover of Dollars 1.4bn. The business acquired by Huntsman Corporation employs more than 2,600 employees and almost 2,500 contractors. It includes six plants in the US, as well as facilities in Canada, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia and the UK. The Huntsman-Texaco deal includes an option for Huntsman Corporation to acquire either half or all of Texaco's giant Dollars 400m plant at Port Neches, Texas. Details, Page 24</p>

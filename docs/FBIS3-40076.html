			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tian Qiyu (3944 2601 3768), vice minister of </F> public security: "Strengthen Public Security Secrecy Work During  the New Era"]    [Text] On 5 September, the fifth anniversary of the  promulgation of the PRC Law Governing Safeguarding of State  Secrets, Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng composed the  respective dedications "Carry On and Elaborate the Party's Fine  Tradition and Strengthen Secrecy Work During the New Era" and  "Serve Economic Development by Strictly Enforcing Laws and  Regulations on Secrecy," and Comrade Ren Jianxin [0117 1696  2450] added "Strengthen Awareness of the Need for Secrecy and  Conduct This Work Properly." These inscriptions demonstrate the  great emphasis leading comrades of the party Central Committee  and the State Council place on secrecy work during the new era  of reform and opening up, chart the tasks and direction of this  work for our near future, reflect the earnest hopes those  comrades place in cadres involved in secrecy work and in public  security personnel, and will provide tremendous impetus to this  work during the new era.  <H3>  Secrecy Work Has Always Formed an Important Component of  Public Security Work </H3>   Secrecy work has always been important to the entire party.  As early as the revolutionary war, Mao Zaodong, Zhou Enlai, and  other leaders of that era repeatedly emphasized the importance  of strictly safeguarding secrets. Comrade Mao in 1941 dedicated  the inscription "One Can Never Be Too Careful in Protecting  Party Secrets" for the Confidential Affairs Office of the  Military Commission and reiterated at a meeting of the Politburo  just after Liberation: "We must be extremely attentive to  secrecy work; 95 or even 99 percent will not do; we must be 100  percent." On 14 July 1950 Comrade Deng Xiaoping stated in a  preface to the inaugural issue of JIYAO GONGZUO [CONFIDENTIAL  WORK]--an armed forces publication: "The situation today is even  more complicated than before, and protecting our party's secrets  is even more important now than at any time in the past." The  victory of the revolution is liable to make us careless and  lower our guard, giving the enemy opportunity to exploit us.  This warrants vigilance by all responsible comrades and cadres  engaged in sensitive work.    Public security organs are vital components of party and  state, so secrecy is especially important for them. From the  outset, we established a strict system and discipline for and  viewed secrecy as the key to and lifeblood of national security  work and vital to the fate of the party and the revolutionary  regime. Following the founding of the PRC, party and state  leaders continued to attach great importance to secrecy and  continually instructed us to stress this in public security  work. With everyone's political vigilance so high, we developed  the habit of consciously protecting secrets and good practice in  this work. In 1958 we incorporated this issue into the Eight  Great Disciplines for and Ten Points Requiring Attention by  public security personnel. Public security organs' fine  tradition of keeping secrets played an important role in  ensuring smooth implementation of public security work and in  winning victory for the revolution.  <H3>  The New Situation Created by Reform, Opening Up Presents New  Needs Regarding Secrecy in Public Security Work </H3>   After the 3d Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, a  strategic shift occurred in the focus of the entire party's  work, and seizing the moment to accelerate China's socialist  modernization became the party's overriding task. The new  situation created by reform, opening up, and the establishment  of a socialist market economy created new and even greater  requirements regarding secrecy in public security work.    First, there has been readjustment in the guiding ideology  thereof. In the decades preceding the plenum, "class struggle"  was the guiding principle for all our effort, and secrecy work  inclined toward mysticism and conservatism, which developments  were concretely manifested in the tendencies to broaden the  scope of secrecy, raising its degree, making it perpetual, and  so on. This shackled people's thinking, exchange and  dissemination of advanced science and technology, and  improvement in productivity. Today secrecy work must pursue  economic development and make the "three facilitations" its  criteria.    Second, there has been major change in the environment  surrounding secrecy work. China's external contacts have  expanded greatly since reform and opening up began. The figure  for exits and entries alone shows how widely our door has  opened, as the figure rose nearly ten-fold between 1979 and  1992. Domestically, while pursuing development rooted in public  ownership, we allowed all sorts of wholly foreign-owned  enterprises, joint ventures, and foreign capitalized firms to  burgeon, change has occurred in the operational mechanisms of  state enterprises, and economic entities of all stripes have  mushroomed. After peasants undertook responsibility contracting,  surplus labor flooded cities and formed the bulk of the floating  population, which, according to statistics, has reached 50  million nationally. Literary and artistic output is booming as  "a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought  contend": Registered publications alone number over 1,000  nationally. Thus the environment secrecy work confronts is much  more complicated than it was before reform and opening up began,  and this makes the work more difficult.    Third, change has occurred in the administrative mechanism  for secrecy work. Public security organs used to be responsible  for handling most routine secrecy work throughout the country.  Once the State Secrecy Bureau was established, that agency  assumed charge of the work and has discharged the functions  accorded it by law, subject to unified guidance provided by the  Central Secrecy Commission. In the areas of preventing,  investigating, and handling leaks and in combatting theft of  state secrets, various administrative, legal, and other related  agencies perform their respective duties in cooperation with the  bureau and each other. Thus a new administrative mechanism for  secrecy work has begun to emerge.    Fourth, there has been change in the focus of this work.  With  the conclusion of the cold war, the prolonged stress on stealing  military secrets began to change; more and more countries now  recognize that science and technology form the most important  productive force; and intelligence agencies in various  countries, especially Western industrialized ones, have begun to  emphasize collection and theft of economic, scientific,  technological, and trade intelligence. To respond to the  international situation and struggle, departments engaged in  secrecy work must make appropriate readjustments in their  thinking, work assignments, organizational structures, and  staffing, and place greater emphasis on economics, science, and  technology.    Fifth, there has been marked change in the way in which  secrecy work is conducted. On 5 September 1988 China promulgated  her first relatively complete law on secrecy, the PRC Law  Governing Safeguarding of State Secrets, development of which  signified that her secrecy work had reached a new stage in which  that effort is conducted according to law. The Enforcement  Regulations for that law were issued a year later, and another  10-odd supplementary measures have since followed, thereby  progressively completing legislation on secrecy and enabling all  such work to be conducted in accordance with law.  <H3>  Public Security Organs Must Continue To Serve as Exemplars  of Strict Safeguarding of State Secrets </H3>   Our ability to carry on and enhance the party's fine  tradition and to strengthen secrecy work during this new era  will affect overall performance in reform, opening up, and the  four modernizations. Public security organs, the mainstay of the  people's democratic dictatorship, and the people's police,  staunch defenders of the party and state, play roles in the  protection of state secrets that no other agencies or  individuals can match. Thus, conscientious emulation of the  dedications presented by Jiang Zemin and Li Peng and further  strengthening of secrecy work are important tasks for public  security organs and personnel at all levels and will enable this  effort better to serve maintenance of social order and economic  development.    We must conscientiously summarize and carry forward public  security organs' fine tradition of strictly protecting state  secrets; perfect the legal system for this work; stop all leaks;  maintain appropriate vigilance in external relations; make  combatting theft of secrets an important component of crime  fighting; closely cooperate with state agencies administering  secrecy work, national security organs, and other related  departments; and conscientiously protect state secrets.    We must constantly study and strictly enforce all laws and  regulations concerning secrecy. It is especially important that  we go down and initiate study and enforcement of the Secrecy Law  and its Enforcement Regulations among public security personnel  so that they learn the basic provisions of these important  pieces of legislation and act in strict accordance with law;  that we overcome arbitrariness and old habit in secrecy work;  and that we strive to ensure that in this work we have laws to  follow, abide by those laws, enforce them strictly, and punish  violations thereof so that this work is conducted in legalized  fashion and public security organs continue to serve as  exemplary protectors of state secrets.</p>

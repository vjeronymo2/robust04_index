			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Lloyd's agency agrees to buy rival AJ ARCHER, one of two Lloyd's agencies listed on the stock exchange, has agreed in principle to acquire the Lloyd's agency businesses of Cuthbert Heath Holdings, creating one of the largest businesses at the London insurance market. This year the Archer and Cuthbert Heath managing agencies administered the affairs of 16 separate syndicates with a combined capital base  - or stamp capacity  - of Pounds 500m. The two members' agencies handle the affairs of more than 500 Names  - the individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's. Mr David Hazlewood, chief executive of Cuthbert Heath, said: 'The report of the Rowland task force underlined the need for the Lloyd's market to restructure itself into larger, more economic units. We believe our proposed combination is one of the most significant moves in this direction to date.' One of the attractions of the deal for Archer is that it gives it control of Service Motor, one of the biggest motor insurance syndicates.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BISHOP AMAT SORTS OUT ANGELUS RACE  </P> <P> Bishop Amat High School gave some clarity to the Angelus League football race  Thursday and left Mater Dei grasping for some sort of consistency. The Lancers  overwhelmed a listless Monarch offense for a 21-7 victory in front of 7,000 at  Santa Ana Stadium.  </P> <P> The victory leaves Bishop Amat (7-1, 3-0 in league) in sole possession of first  place with one game remaining. The Lancers need only to defeat Loyola next week  to win their ninth consecutive league title.  </P> <P> And the Lancers can thank Jason Patterson for their lofty position.  </P> <P> Patterson, a senior defensive end/fullback, dominated the Monarchs' offense and  ran over their defense.  </P> <P> With two minutes left, the Monarchs faced a fourth-and-two situation at the  Bishop Amat 13. Quarterback Billy Blanton attempted a bootleg but was brought  down from behind for a one-yard loss by Patterson, giving the Lancers the ball  and the game.  </P> <P> "Patterson is an animal," Bishop Amat Coach Mark Paredes said.  </P> <P> The Monarchs already knew that. Patterson had four sacks and teamed with  defensive end Peter Gomez for two more. In all, Blanton was sacked seven times  for losses totaling 37 yards.  </P> <P> "We worked all week on stopping their defensive ends from crashing," Mater Dei  Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "They (Bishop Amat) didn't do anything that we  didn't expect."  </P> <P> The Monarchs' problems weren't limited to their passing game.  </P> <P> Mater Dei (4-5, 1-1) has become more and more dependent on running back Derek  Sparks. However, he was held to less than 100 yards for the third consecutive  week. He gained 78 yards in 22 carries.  </P> <P> Mater Dei had 189 total yards. The Monarchs have scored only 21 points in the  last three games.  </P> <P> Things may not get much better, either. The Monarchs lost wide receiver Leland  Sparks, who was taken to the hospital with a knee injury.  </P> <P> Patterson set up the Lancers first touchdown by recovering a Sparks fumble at  the seven. Three plays later, quarterback Zach Zertuche threw a one-yard  touchdown pass to Eoghan Gallagher in the second quarter.  </P> <P> But Patterson's performance wasn't limited to defense. He also had 115 yards  rushing in 19 carries. He gained 22 yards on the Lancers' second touchdown  drive, which ended in a four-yard run by Jess Holguin.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Zertuche threw a flat pass to Scott Fields, who spun  away from one defender and went 15 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> "Our defense did the best job they could do," Rollinson said.  </P> <P> The offense?  </P> <P> Well, Mater Dei avoided the shutout when Blanton threw an 11-yard touchdown  pass to David Gonzalez with three minutes left.  </P></p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / One-day strike provokes tough British Coal reaction BRITISH COAL reacted strongly to yesterday's one-day strike by miners and transport workers by stopping the 'check-off' system, under which employers deduct union dues from pay, at pits which had joined the strike. The company also revealed it had decided to defer a payment of Pounds 109m into the staff pension fund, which has a Pounds 1bn surplus. BACM, the mine managers union, said the Pounds 109m payment could not be stopped unilaterally and it would consider legal action against the move. However, the main coal, rail and bus unions hailed the strike as a 'success' in their fight against job losses, though most of Britain, outside London, worked normally. The protests affected almost the entire rail network, 38 out of 50 pits and some London bus services. Coal and rail unions threatened further action. Mr John Major, the prime minister, described the strike as 'perfectly pointless'. The RMT rail union will meet in the next few days to decide whether to take further action, although it has agreed to meet British Rail for talks some time next week. ASLEF, the train drivers union, which did not take part in yesterday's action, is already balloting its members on industrial action. BR officials warned privately that any further one-day strikes would provoke a much firmer reaction. That could include recourse to the law on the grounds that the strike was 'secondary action' taken on behalf of mineworkers. Other possibilities include following British Coal by withdrawing the check-off service. This would would be likely to hit RMT finances and membership. 'If we do nothing again the British Rail management will be discredited in the run-up to privatisation,' said one official. Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, said it had been an 'extremely successful' day. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal's employee relations director, said such action would consign the UK coal industry to history. Most collieries in Nottinghamshire, dominated by the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers, worked normally. BR shut down almost totally apart from a few driver-only trains.

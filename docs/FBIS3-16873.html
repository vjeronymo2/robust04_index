"Why did Iranian pilots who knew that medium altitudes over  a  combat zone (of Nagorno-Karabakh) are mortally dangerous still  flew towards Stepanakert and further headed towards the  strategically important Lachin corridor (connecting the enclave  with Armenia)", the experts told TASS on Monday.    They added that neither the special commission investigating  the crash, nor the simultaneous statements of Armenians and  Azeris denying their involvement in the crash will give an  answer to the main question -- why the C-130 appeared in the  airspace of Nagorno-Karabakh and why did the crew choose the  course right over the combat area?.    The experts stressed that the crew of the plane had an  unusually big number of members and that the craft did not need  any emergency landing even if the cockpit was depressurised.    The plane could have landed in Gyandzha or Shamkhor in  Azerbaijan where runways of former Soviet military airfields are  big enough for all types of heavy planes.    The experts do not rule out that one of the warring sides  shot down the plane mistaking it for an enemy one. It is quite  possible the transport craft was attacked from a mobile  anti-aircraft missile which are in big numbers in the combat  zone, they added.</p>

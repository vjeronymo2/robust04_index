			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: SAKANA: ELEGANCE IN WHITE GLOVES  </P> <P> The Sakana Club, 11600 San Vicente Blvd., Los Angeles (213) 447-7777, ignores  the local bistro-trattoria trend and gives Los Angeles something not often  found in new restaurants: elegant dining. White-gloved waiters set the tables  with pricey crystal, silver and china.  </P> <P> The dining room -- gutted and remodeled three times until the owners were  happy, a waiter confided -- is modern and discreet, with an expensive Diva  light carefully placed to hang over each table. Set in one wall are three glass  panels of silently bubbling water -- it's like a giant-size executive toy from  the Sharper Image catalogue.  </P> <P> A glass panel in another wall reveals Sakana Club's pristine kitchen. The chefs  working inside prepare elegant Japanese-French food. There are several delicate  fish preparations, blood-rare duck breast with peppercorns and a few beef  dishes, including a steak appetizer. The chef, Shigefusa Oku, ran several  restaurants in Japan, and the pastry chef, Elmer Azuma is known to L.A. diners  from his food at Truffles and Chabuya.  </P> <P> Prices are at the high end, but at lunch there is a mini-kaiseki meal for $18  (actually it's more like a bento-box lunch) that is a bargain considering the  variety and quality of the food you get. If you call ahead, the chef will  customize a seven-course dinner that will run $35 to $75 per person. LAURIE  OCHOA  </P></p>

Selivanova, KRYMSKAYA  GAZETA correspondent; place and date not given: "Attention and  Support Given"]    [Text] As has already been reported, a working group  of the Government of Crimea was in Kiev from 15 to 19 February  to examine implementation of the instructions of the president  of Ukraine in accordance with the results of his meeting with  the president of the Republic of Crimea.    Our correspondent asked A.R. Franchuk, the leader of  this working group and acting chairman of the Council of  Ministers of Crimea, about the outcome of the trip.    [Franchuk] I will begin with the fact that the conference  and meeting in Kiev took place in a businesslike and friendly  atmosphere and at a high level. We were received by Deputy  Prime Minister of Ukraine V.N. Shmarov, who had invited to the  meeting the ministers of power engineering and electrification,  justice, agriculture, and machine-building, the deputy minister  of the economy, the chairman of the State Property Fund, the  first deputy chairmen of the board of the National Bank, and the  managers of state committees and departments of Ukraine. Our  working group also comprised ministers, chairmen of state  committees, and directors of enterprises and associations. A  number of questions that we had prepared for this meeting were  discussed and resolved.    In accordance with the findings of our group, on 19 February  Ye. L. Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister of Ukraine, signed a  protocol on the conference, conducted under his chairmanship, on  issues regarding implementation of instructions on the results  of the meeting of the president of Ukraine and the president of  the Republic of Crimea. Its first point is the budget. The  issue of implementation of the agreement on mutual budgetary  relations between the Government of Ukraine and the Republic of  Crimea for 1994 was decided positively by the minister of  finance of Ukraine, and appropriate instructions were given  concerning the procedure for mutual settlements.    [Selivanova] Anatoliy Romanovich, let us consider this  question, please, in more detail. What advantages were gained  in the formation of the budget?    [Franchuk] In the approval of the budget of Ukraine for  1994, Crimea was left with an income in the amount of 43 percent  of the sums received on its territory. The remaining 57 percent  was subject to withdrawal for the state budget of Ukraine.  Simultaneously, the allocation of subsidies from the state  budget of Ukraine to Crimea was planned. It would have been  very difficult to acquire them. Now, in line with the results  of the trip, all taxes, collections, and mandatory payments  received on the territory of the Republic of Crimea (except  Sevastopol) will be entered into the Republic of Crimea budget.  We, in turn, must pay back 4.3 percent from the budget to an  account for general state programs of Ukraine (2.7 trillion  karbovantsy). Now, above-plan income revenues will remain in  Crimea. And additionally found incomes will not be confiscated  for the budget of Ukraine. Hence, there is no longer a need to  send money to Kiev and back to Crimea. And what I especially  want to note is that an opportunity will present itself to  balance the rural and settlement soviets more accurately. The  conditions are created for ensuring the timely financing of  budget expenditures. Thus, it is necessary to form a budget of  Crimea on new principles and approve it at a session of the  Supreme Soviet. The main task remains the receipt of a maximum  sum of income. But for this, everyone has to work well.    It should be noted that the issue of allocation of resources  to pay off last year's debt to Crimea was also resolved.    [Selivanova] How was the debt formed, and what does it  amount to?    [Franchuk] The debt was formed as a consequence of an  insufficient transfer of resources in 1993 to finance programs  for the economic stabilization of Crimea and measures associated  with the return of Crimean Tatars and other deported people.  The sum is 110 billion karbovantsy, taking today's indexation  into account. The Ministry of Finance of Ukraine is obligated to  establish before 30 March the sources for paying off the debt  and also to resolve the question of allocating $1.5 million for  the payment of debts for the acquisition of imported equipment  in the first half of the year for the Fiolent Plant.    I would also like to dwell on this very important question.  The State Property Fund of Ukraine was instructed to prepare a  draft decree of the Cabinet of Ministers by 1 March concerning  the transfer to the property of the Republic of Crimea of  facilities located on the territory of Crimea that are subject  to privatization according to existing legislation of Ukraine.    [Selivanova] It is known that a number of enterprises in the  Crimea need currency expenditures. How was this resolved?    [Franchuk] The Ministry of the Economy of Ukraine, on a  representation of the Council of Ministers of the Crimea and  pertinent ministries and departments, was ordered to prepare a  proposal on the inclusion of our individual enterprises on the  list of those that have a right to acquire hard currency  resources. A period up to 30 March was set for an examination  of the question on the priority sale of $4 million for the  purchase of spare parts for imported trolleybuses, according to  a request of the Council of Ministers of Crimea.    Questions concerning the allocation of additional capital  investments for the completion of construction of the most  important water supply and sewage facilities of the cities of  our republic, Sevastopol's water supply, and also the allocation  of additional quotas on capital investments and grants to  finance the reconstruction and operation of land reclamation  facilities and water management, and others were discussed.  There was discussion of ensuring the uninterrupted work of  departmental boiler houses of  military health centers and rest homes.    [Selivanova] We are on the threshold of spring. What kind  of support has been promised for Crimea's agriculture?    [Franchuk] Taking into account the difficult conditions of  the past year and the volume of spring sowing work, our republic  will be allocated 20,000 tonnes of gas and 30,000 tonnes of  diesel fuel in February-May. The requirement for spare parts  and imported agricultural equipment will be satisfied. Mineral  fertilizers and spring crop seeds were provided. Other  questions were also resolved.    The question of canceling the restrictions for the entry of  citizens of Ukraine in Sevastopol was presented for examination.    [Selivanova] Is it possible to draw the conclusion that all  the points entered in the conference protocol can realistically  be implemented?    [Franchuk] Everything that is defined by the protocol and  signed by Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy is realistic and has specific dates  for completion in the first half of the year, starting in March.  I had a conversation with President of Ukraine L.M. Kravchuk  about the aims of the trip of our working group. And despite  the difficult situation in Ukraine's economy, we were given  attention and support by everyone we met at the very highest  level. The ministries and departments of Ukraine jointly with  the National Bank of Ukraine and the Council of Ministers of  Crimea will have to continue work on implementation of the  instructions of the president of Ukraine in accordance with the  results of the meeting of the president of Ukraine and the  president of the Republic of Crimea.</p>

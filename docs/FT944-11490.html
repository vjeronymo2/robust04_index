			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Institutions get tougher - New issues Pulled flotations, over-subscriptions and healthy trading premiums this week have illustrated the stark contrast in the receptions accorded to different companies in the new issues market. New Look, the women's wear chain, confirmed many a sceptic's view that the market has overheated when on Wednesday - the afternoon before the share pricing was due to be announced - it postponed its flotation plans. The following day, however, TLG - the holding company for Thorn Lighting Group - said its flotation was three times over-subscribed. And there was good news from Calluna: shares in the disk drive manufacturer leapt 42 per cent on Monday, its first day of trading. Schroders, the adviser to New Look, trotted out the well-worn 'adverse market conditions' excuse. But City analysts are taking a different view. They point out that after the flood of new issues this year, the market is returning to a form of equilibrium with new issues again being judged on management, prospects, track records, margins and other fundamentals Most of all, the fall in demand from institutional investors has prompted a re-rating: prices are being forced down. In the case of TLG, for example, the shares originally were offered to institutions at a figure 10 per cent higher than their eventual price. In New Look's case, retail analysts say that with institutional share buying at a seasonal low, the Budget looming and retailers gloomy over the outlook for Christmas, launching a shopping company at this time was always going to be tricky. New Look has more than tripled operating profits and turnover in the past three years. Profits of Pounds 11m last year were almost matched by the near-Pounds 10m posted for first six months of this year, while operating margins of 16.9 per cent are double those of its nearest rival, Etam, and well ahead of the market's retailing doyen, Next. 'With margins like those, where would any expansion come from?' asked one fund manager. The success of TLG and Calluna shows the new issues market is still a place for healthy business. New Look's postponement demonstrates a more rigorous attitude from institutional investors.</p>

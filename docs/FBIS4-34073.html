			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 14 Jun (EFE) -- The Chilean Investigative  Police arrested Sergio Buschmann today at the international  airport. Buschmann, who has been a fugitive since 1987, returned  voluntarily from Nicaragua.    More than 200 peple were waiting at the airport for  Buschmann, who arrived from Costa Rica after a three-hour delay.  Among those waiting for him were leftist opposition leaders who  went to the airport to express their solidarity with him.    Buschmann, a 51-year-old theater actor and one of the  founders of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR), was  arrested during the past military regime. He was accused of  leading an operation to conceal weapons the FPMR had smuggled  into Chile in 1986.    The following year he escaped from prison and left the  country clandestinely. Today he is returning to exercise, as he  said, his legitimate right to defend himself and to resume his  life legally.</p>

In a letter to President Bill Clinton, Olmert said he was  disappointed that the U.S. did not veto the Security Council  resolution, which contains references to East Jerusalem as part  of the occupied territories. The United States voted in support  of the resolution, but abstained on citations referring to the  status of Jerusalem.</p>

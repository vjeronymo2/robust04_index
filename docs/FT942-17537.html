			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Pioneers of pensions - Insurance for life Provident Life and Professional Life pioneered the concept of non-commission personal pension plans and provided a blueprint for the modern pension contract. So far, they have been joined by two recent entrants to the individual pensions market: Mercury Life and Invesco MIM. But when life offices are forced to reveal full charges and commissions from January 1995 onwards, more will join them. Provident Life and Professional Life are backed by heavyweight parents - both Winterthur and Skandia are among the European top-20 life offices. Winterthur has an impressive top rating of AAA from Standard and Poor's. As this series has revealed, most major providers are prepared to sell their commission-loaded plans on a nil-commission basis. Under this system, though, it is difficult to check how much of the commission actually is re-invested in your plan. With a genuine non-commission plan, if the adviser's remuneration is deducted from the client's premiums, this will appear as an explicit charge on the client agreement. And the flexibility of non-commission products compares well with standard commission-based plans, since the charging structure is explicit and there is no penalty for reducing or stopping premiums. A distinguishing feature of the two companies' plans is that, in addition to internally managed funds, they offer access to external fund managers. This allows the client to switch investment managers without the cost of changing to another provider. Professional Life's charges include an annual administration fee of 0.75 on the first Pounds 5,000, reducing in stages to 0.25 per cent. The annual charge of the external fund manager ranges from 0.2 per cent (BZW) to 0.95 per cent (Morgan Grenfell). There is also an establishment fee of Pounds 2.50 a month for five years. The plans normally are sold on a commission-free basis, but Professional Life will deduct a flat rate adviser's fee from the first premium if that is the method preferred. The company offers a series of managed funds (invested in a range of sectors) and sector funds (such as UK, US, European equity) run by six external managers. Most of these funds were launched in 1990, so they do not yet appear in the five-year performance tables. Over three years, however, Fidelity and Morgan Grenfell achieved excellent managed fund returns followed closely by Gartmore, with performance consistently in the top 25 per cent. Professional Life's money fund is a leading performer for the three years since launch in 1990. The bulk of Professional Life's personal pensions are used as transfer plans, although a few are transfers of benefits from occupational schemes. Most clients switch from other providers to gain access to the range of external investment managers. Provident Life's initial charge depends on the premium size: for example, 2 per cent up to Pounds 19,999. The annual fund management charge is low: 0.5 per cent. There is also a set-up fee of Pounds 150 on regular premium plans, and a service fee of up to Pounds 2.50 a month. Last July, following a disappointing period of in-house investment, Provident Life appointed Schroder to manage all but one of its equity-based funds. The impact of the external management has yet to be seen - but Provident Life's non-equity funds (property, fixed interest, index linked and money) are run in-house and have an excellent record.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FACT FILE 9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Name: Professional Life Status: Proprietary Founded: 1982 Market position: Subsidiary of Skandia Life, 19th largest insurance   company in Europe by premium income Financial strength: Parent Skandia has 'adequate' Standard &amp; Poor's   assessement Funds under management: Pounds 73m (at 31/12/93) Premium income 1993: Pounds 46m (life &amp; pensions) Number of personal pension plan clients: 2,951 Number of transfer plans sold: 2,544 Sales outlets: Consulting actuaries, chartered accountants and   independent advisers Commission paid: Either nil commission or explicit amount deducted from   first premium Recurring single premium contracts?

Provident Life and Professional Life plans are structured on a nil-commission basis but naturally they do impose other charges for administration. To reveal the impact of these charges we asked for illustrations for a man age 45 who expects to retire at age 65 (ie a 20 year contract), paying (a) pounds 200 per month and (b) a stand alone single premium of pounds 10,000. The final figures show a theoretical value where no charges were deducted.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The breed identification information used by APHIS in preparing the FY 1993 report mentioned by the commenter placed Holstein and Holstein cross-bred cattle together in one category. Because such a high percentage of tuberculosis-infected Mexican cattle had been identified as Holstein or Holstein cross-bred cattle, our proposal included both categories. However, animal health officials of the Mexican Government have informed APHIS that Holstein cross-bred cattle are raised under different conditions than Holstein cattle, and thus are much less likely to have a comparable rate of tuberculosis infection. According to those animal health officials, Holstein cross-bred cattle in Mexico are not raised in dairies, as are Holstein cattle, but are usually raised in pastures, often in states where no dairies are located. Given those significant environmental differences, it appears that Holstein cross-bred cattle present less of a risk than had been thought. Additionally, APHIS animal health personnel involved in conducting tracebacks of tuberculosis-infected cattle from Mexico have confirmed that Holstein cross-bred cattle do not appear to present the high level of risk presented by Holstein cattle. Therefore, in response to the comment, we have removed Holstein cross-bred steers and spayed heifers from this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the proposed rule, APHIS stated that the importation of Holstein and Holstein cross-bred breeding cattle would not be prohibited because the tuberculosis testing required of breeding cattle appears adequate to detect infection in breeding cattle. If the testing procedure is adequate to allow the importation of breeding cattle, it seems that the procedure should also be adequate to allow the importation of steers and spayed heifers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The testing requirements for breeding cattle are different from the testing requirements for steers and spayed heifers. Under the regulations in &sect;92.427(c), breeding cattle offered for entry into the United States must be accompanied by a certificate stating that they have been tuberculin tested within the last 3 to 12 months. The breeding cattle are then detained at the port of entry under the supervision of the port veterinarian until tested for tuberculosis with negative results. The testing requirements for steers and spayed heifers, on the other hand, call for only one test, performed either in Mexico no more than 60 days prior to entry, or, if the importer so elects, at the port of entry. Given the large number of steers and spayed heifers imported into the United States_approximately 1 million in an average year_we cannot, as the commenter suggested, apply the same testing requirements to breeding cattle and steers and spayed heifers; APHIS simply does not have the resources to test every steer and spayed heifer offered for entry from Mexico. Consequently, we are making no changes in response to the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule with the changes discussed in this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the approximately 1 million Mexican cattle imported from Mexico into the United States during 1991, the most recent year for which complete data are available, we estimate that nearly 12 percent were Holstein steers (in the 1991 data, spayed heifers were counted as steers). During the same year, the U.S. cattle population totaled 99.4 million head. Thus, imported Mexican Holstein steers accounted for less than 1 percent of the total U.S. bovine population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total value of imported Mexican Holstein and Holstein cross-bred steers was close to $45 million in 1991, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the 1991 value of the U.S. live cattle inventory, which was estimated at more than $64 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 48,000 cattle feedlots were operating in the United States during 1991. Of those, 620 feedlots concentrated in western States regularly handle Mexican cattle. Approximately 67 of the feedlots handling Mexican cattle have a capacity of 1,000 head or fewer; such lots can be considered small entities. They account for less than 1 percent of all domestic feedlots. We do not expect this action to significantly affect U.S. importers because they can replace the Holstein steers and Holstein spayed heifers that they may currently import from Mexico with other breeds of feeder cattle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Animal diseases, Imports, Livestock, Poultry and poultry products, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 9 CFR part 92 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 92_IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN ANIMALS AND POULTRY AND CERTAIN ANIMAL AND  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> POULTRY PRODUCTS; INSPECTION AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN MEANS OF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CONVEYANCE AND SHIPPING CONTAINERS THEREON  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

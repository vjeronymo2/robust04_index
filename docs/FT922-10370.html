			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: ENI profits halved to L1,081bn ENI, the Italian state energy and chemicals group, saw consolidated net profits halved in 1991, falling to L1,081bn (Dollars 868.9m) from L2,072bn the previous year. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, ENI's chairman, blamed the lower profits on a sharp rise in depreciation and amortisation costs resulting from increased investment, plus extra expenses incurred in minerals exploration. The group was also affected by slack demand in the main industrialised countries, a 2.3 per cent drop in Italian industrial production and the problems of the chemicals business, especially in fertilisers. ENI is still in the process of digesting its 1990 purchase of Montedison's stake in Enimont, the chemical group renamed Enichem. Political difficulties in agreeing a restructuring of the chemicals industry have delayed the introduction of rationalisation plans for Enichem. Last year Enichem's losses were L700bn, but this excluded a further L300bn attributable to fertilisers hived off to the subsidiary, Enichem Agricultura. Total ENI sales rose only marginally from L50,033bn to L50,883bn, of which L18,500bn was overseas. Cash flow was L9,513bn against L9,607bn the previous year; net operating profits fell from L4,711bn to L3,765bn. Mr Cagliari predicted another difficult year in 1992 given continued uncertainties in both the domestic and main international economies. He said ENI was concentrating on preparing for its transformation into a joint stock company as part of government plans to privatise state holdings. He expected Agip, the group's oil exploration and distribution subsidiary, and Snam Progetti, its civil engineering subsidiary, would be ready for floating up to 20 per cent of their stock in the autumn. ENI intended to concentrate on its core energy business, he said, indicating activities such as hotels and media ownership (the Naples daily Il Mattino) might be sold off. ENI's 1991 results showed it had been lessening its dependence on state funding, with only 17 per cent of working capital coming from the Treasury. In spite of a 36 per cent jump in investments to L9,327bn, net indebtedness increased under 2 per cent to L23,298bn. This compared with a 20 per cent jump in borrowing the previous year, essentially the result of financing the purchase control of Enimont.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Eradicating the hazards of waste - The new strategy adopted at Shanks &amp; McEwan Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste services company which yesterday ann-ounced provisions totalling Pounds 20m, is returning to its Scottish roots, says Mr Gordon Waddell, its Glaswegian chairman. 'We are trying to change a culture,' said Mr Waddell. 'There will be no more free newspapers, no five star hotels. They will have to become Scottish.' The Shanks review which has prompted the further provisions, following the Pounds 19.3m announced in June, was greeted with relief in the market. The shares moved ahead by 6p to 87p, against the trend. Investors were further encouraged by Shanks's guardedly optimistic statement on trading. Substantial progress had been made in solving some of the technical difficulties which hit capacity in the third quarter at Rechem, the hazardous waste incinerator. However, some questions remained, particularly over the dividend. Analysts speculated that this was likely to be cut under the new, stricter, regime. Nor was Rechem out of the woods, with considerable uncertainty arising from European Union regulations which come into force on May 8. From that date Britain has the power to ban all imports of hazardous wastes. 'Should it choose to exercise that power,' said Mr Waddell, 'it would bring into serious question the viability of high temperature incineration in this country.' Rechem depends on imported hazardous waste for about 50 per cent of its sales by value. Mr Waddell said that if the government chose to implement its power to ban all hazardous wastes, at least one of its two plants would have to be closed down. This, he said, could result in a further substantial write-down. The two plants are valued at Pounds 31m. The real horror story, however, was last year's performance from the construction division, which has prompted two of the three profits warnings in the last three years. Disputes over payments for large road-building contracts have led to a total provision of Pounds 28m for bad debts. Shanks has now admitted that Pounds 17m of last year's provisions should be recognised as losses. So far this year it has managed to recover only Pounds 3.3m of the total Pounds 41m claimed, a substantially lower figure than was expected at the interim stage, with a further Pounds 2m to come. Yesterday the picture worsened, with further construction debt write-offs of Pounds 11m. Mr Waddell said Shanks could be confident about recovering only a further Pounds 8m to Pounds 9m. One analyst at the company's briefing was prompted to question whether the civil engineering division had been building roads for free over the past 18 months. Mr Waddell does not dodge the accusation. 'They did bid at very uncompetitive margins,' he says. Construction now has new management and Mr Waddell is optimistic that it will turn the corner this year. 'I would be astonished if it is not in profit,' he says. Management has been revamped throughout the group, leaving only one main job unfilled: that of chief executive. However, the company would say little more than that the search continued and an announcement is expected before the annual meeting in August. Some analysts suggested that Mr Mike Averill, recently appointed group operating officer, had been pegged for a second promotion. 'There might be few people in the industry qualified to do the job,' said one analyst. The company is keeping mum.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN has learned on 19 April that Ukraine  has not yet decided on a candidate for the post of its charge  d'affaires in Yugoslavia, with which it recently established  diplomatic relations. Yugoslavia has already appointed a charge  d'affaires in Kiev, (Milos Jovanovic), a full-time diplomat.    A high-ranking Ukrainian diplomat who asked not to be  identified said the decision to establish diplomatic relations  with Serbia and Montenegro, against which the United Nations had  introduced sanctions, had to do with the enlargement of  Ukraine's peace-keeping forces in the vicinity of Gorazde and  the possible conflicts this may involve.    "Ukraine's consulate general in Belgrade headed by Vadym  Prymachenko will hardly be able to solve all the possible  problems without representative powers at a senior level," he  said. The same diplomat believes that serious diplomatic work  will be required in the region following a political decision to  compensate the countries of the Danube area for their losses  incurred as a a result of the UN sanctions against Serbia.  Ukraine suffered huge losses because of the sanctions.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Goodwill plan for accounts attacked The Accounting Standards Board's proposals on goodwill may be complex, costly and subjective to apply, Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, warns today. It calls for intangible assets such as brands in acquired companies to be shown on the balance sheet, while other goodwill should be charged to a statement outside the profit and loss account over a long period, such as 40 years. The firm's views are in a booklet examining the options on the future accounting treatment of goodwill - the difference between the net assets and the purchase price of an acquired company. The board issued proposals in December offering several alternative approaches. Touche Ross broadly favours the board's option of allowing goodwill to be maintained on the balance sheet as long as it meets regular 'ceiling tests' to ensure it has held its value. But it warns that the test is not in line with the approach taken by international accounting standards; that there will be problems in applying it once acquired businesses have been integrated with existing ones; and that the amounts of goodwill written down will be substantial at a time a company may be least able to bear the loss.

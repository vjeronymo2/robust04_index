			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marie-France Cros: "Kivu Affected by Rwandan </F> Civil War"]    [Text] Will the Rwandan tragedy destabilize Zaire? Kivu is  taking in Rwandan refugees and may be the crossing point for  arms destined for the government camp in this country, despite  the UN arms embargo.    According to the account of a Rwandan refugee at Goma (a  Zairian town on Lake Kivu, opposite Gisenyi, a stronghold of  Hutu extremists in Rwanda), Rwandans are making incursions into  Zaire to carry off refugees and to take them back to the Rwandan  side. We have been unable to obtain confirmation of this news,  although rumors of such seizures are circulating among Goma's  Zairian population.    One of the refugees, on the other hand, told LA LIBRE  BELGIQUE that the Rwandans had come to Zaire to rustle cattle in  the Bukombe district. Hutus coming from Rwanda are also said to  have attacked three farms belonging to Tutsis in the Masisi  region of Zaire. The owners are said to have killed some  attackers and captured others. According to the same source,  attacks have also taken place in the area of Rutshuru (a Jomba  village) "but Ndeze, the Rutshuru's Hutu mwamui (editor's note:  Member of the Republican High Council, the Kinshasa  Parliament), is not letting these attacks develop, because he  wants to maintain the tranquillity of the region."  <H5>  Tension in Kivu </H5>   Readers are reminded that the Kivu (Zairian region on the  frontier with Rwanda and Burundi) has a native Rwandan-speaking  population consisting of Tutsis and Hutus. The region, linked  to the pre-colonial Rwandan kingdom, was annexed to the Belgian  Congo by the colonizers, who also subsequently encouraged, in  the '30s, an immigration of workers from Rwanda. Successive  waves of political and ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi  since their independence have added refugees coming from these  countries. In 1992-93, the Kivu was the scene of bloody  outbreaks of violence between Rwandan- speaking natives (Hutus  and Tutsis) on the one hand, and non-Rwandan speakers  (principally Behunde and Banyanga) on the other.    A Rwandan-speaking Zairian source indicates that South  Kivu's  Governor Keymbwa Walumona, who is a protestant pastor, has  driven back to their own country Rwandans fleeing the prefecture  of Cyangugu, where Tutsis and the Hutu opposition have been  massacred. Privately, the governor is said to have indicated  that these were instructions "from above," in other words from  President Mobutu. Certain people believe such an order to be  unlikely since North Kivu is welcoming refugees without  difficulty.    A Zairian source not from the region has indicated to LA  LIBRE BELGIQUE that tensions between Hutus and Tutsis, already  sensitive within the Kivu due to the ethnic clashes in the  neighboring countries, have grown with the present Rwandan  crisis, and that Kinshasa's policy was therefore rather to  receive Tutsi refugees in South Kivu (Bukavo, Uvira) and Hutu  refugees in North Kivu (Goma, Masisi, Rutshuru). A DSP (Special  Presidential Division) has been installed "between the two (Kivu  provinces)," in particular in the region of Masisi and along the  frontier, from Rutshuru to Uvira.    However, the welcome by South Kivu's governor to the Rwandan  Tutsis seems pretty reticent, judging from a European source at  Bukavu (capital of the province). This source added that  "trading in property stolen" from the victims of the anti-Tutsi  and anti-Hutu opposition pogroms in Rwanda was taking place in  Bukavu, where Rwandan military had received the governor's  "authorization to come and gather supplies," and was taking full  advantage of this.  <H5>  Arms Traffic </H5>   Another area of Zairian involvement in the Rwandan crisis:  arms trafficking. According to information gathered by LA  LIBRE BELGIQUE, an air cargo company landed a cargo of arms at  Goma airport "on a Thursday, one week after President  Habyarimana's death" (that would be 14 April). These arms were  transported on 10 trucks belonging to local traders (Zairians  and an Indian), and then escorted to Gisenyi, an area in the  hands of Rwandan Government forces. In early May, a Bulgarian  plane landed 42 tons of arms at Goma, which were immediately  loaded onto Rwandan military trucks. In general, these  transhipments are said to have taken place at night, at a rate  of one a week, and from aircraft of different origins, in  particular from Nigeria. Last Monday 23 May, a Zairian Army  C-130 and a cargo plane from the same air freight company as the  one mentioned above landed at Goma at 0000 GMT, according to  eyewitnesses. At 0200 GMT, the crates were loaded onto two dump  trucks and a Toyota truck belonging to the Zairian Army, en  route for Gisenyi. The load must then have been transported via  Lake Kivu as far as Cyangugu and, from there, by road toward  Butare and Gitarama, a region that could be the next objective  of the Rwandan Patriotic Front guerillas.    We questioned Zaire's ambassador in Brussels about this  trafficking. Mr Kimbulu told us that "Zaire is a mediator (in  the Rwandan conflict) and cannot therefore allow one of the  parties to be favored."</p>

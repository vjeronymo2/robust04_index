			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 15 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan  Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez today reasserted his  rejection of the creation of a Truth Commission to investigate  human rights violations in the country, because it would seek  "vengeance."    The chief of the Guatemalan Armed Forces (FAG) said in a  news  conference that, if an investigation is conducted on events that  occurred throughout the armed conflict which lasted three  decades, this would increase "social polarization" and divide  society. The Army cannot accept that option "because it would  not seek conciliation, nor would it be fair, because no  sanctions would be imposed on guerrilla fighters involved in  human rights violations," Enriquez added. He recalled that  countries such as El Salvador and Argentina, where civilian  groups sponsored the creation of Truth Commissions, are now  paying a high cost. "People are being killed in the former even  though the whole truth was not learned," he said.    The Mutual Support Group (GAM), made up of relatives of  missing persons, said on Tuesday the most repressed groups in  our society have the right to demand the creation of that  commission. The GAM issued a communique stating this is a  demand from 45,000 families whose loved ones were violently  taken away. The communique said no Guatemalan should question  the creation of a Truth Commission by arguing that no one is  "free of sin" to demand an end to impunity and injustice.    Relatives of Guatemalan Detainees and Missing Persons  (Famdegua) rejected the National Congress' intentions of  sponsoring an amnesty decree because "it would favor impunity  and protect criminals and corrupt persons." Guatemalan  legislators insisted on the need to establish a pardon for the  perpetration of common political crimes. According to Famdegua,  two amnesty bills were sponsored in June -- shortly before  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio was sworn in -- to prevent the  enforcement of justice against former President Jorge Serrano.    The former president, who sought asylum in Panama, tried to  dissolve Congress and the Supreme Court of Justice on 25 May  1993.    Another decree would favor members and collaborators of  subversive factions, and all those who had participated in acts  of repression or persecution.    In October Congress tried to modify Article 183 (Paragraph  U), which authorizes the president of the Republic to "commute a  death sentence for the next highest sentence, and to grant a  pardon in connection with common political crimes and related  crimes."    According to Famdegua, it is evident that pressure is being  exerted by groups which, "like the Army," are involved in human  rights violations, to decree an amnesty that would also favor  politicians and former officials. To establish an amnesty would  be tantamount to leaving "black pages of an authoritarian,  terrorist, and corrupt era" unpunished and shelved, it was added  by the organization, which struggles for the return of 45,000  persons.</p>

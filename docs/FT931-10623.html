			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Following the cuts FOREIGN exchange dealers will be coming to terms this week with the implications of last week's cut in the Bundesbank's officially posted interest rates, writes James Blitz. The 0.25 percentage point cut in the Bundesbank's Discount rate, to 8.0 per cent, was hailed by some analysts as the strongest indication yet that the German authorities would defend the European exchange rate mechanism at any cost. 'It was a sign to me that the Bundesbank is digging in its heels, perhaps avoiding an assault on the Franc by drawing a line at the Danish krone,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London. Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said that the Bundesbank would probably fail in its task. 'The Bundesbank has bought time but it has not solved the fundamental problem that France and Denmark have high interest rates in the thick of a recession,' he said. 'As far as I am concerned, the ERM is history,' he added. He predicted that there would soon be free floating currencies in Europe, for a limited period at least. The markets will have a chance to asses how quickly the German authorities are prepared to reduce rates at this week's money market tender on Wednesday. Last week, the lowest accepted money market bid was 8.57 per cent. With the Discount floor lowered last week, there is speculation that the repo rate will come down. Another factor adding to ERM tensions is that the dollar failed to break above DM1.67 against the D-Mark following a non-farm payroll figure on Friday that was worse than the market expected. This week's January retail sales figures in the US, due out on Thursday, should indicate whether there is any more scale to the economic upturn in the US. But a concern for European policy-makers must be that, if the D-Mark remains strong against the US dollar, the tensions in Europe will persist.</p>

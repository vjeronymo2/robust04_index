			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: L &amp; G results please THE Legal &amp; General share price outperformed the market throughout the day, responding positively to better than expected preliminary figures. Marked up to 374p immmediately after the preliminary results became known, the shares subsequently slipped back to finish unaltered on the day at 367p. Analysts, however, were broadly enthusiatic over the results, and especially the dividend total, which was raised by 5 per cent, at the very top end of the range. Profits of Pounds 11.3m, although well down on last year, were towards the best of analysts' forecasts. Mr Youssef Ziai at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, a long-time bull of the shares, described L &amp; G's performance as 'the best of the general insurers to date', and said that in view of the difficult trading endured during 1991, he saw no reason why a similar dividend rise could not be achieved this year. Mr Trevor May, insurance specialist at Nomura, said the shares looked good value, pointing out the asset backing of 450p a share. Guinness sold In the drinks sector, Guinness fell 27 to 575p on turnover of 4.1m. The shares became a target for profit-taking following the rise prompted recently by suggestions that Mr Warren Buffett of Salomon Brothers had built a stake of around 2 per cent. This, coupled with the company's relative immunity to developments in the UK brewing industry, had pushed the stock to a premium of about 20 per cent to the sector. However, Mr Mike McCarthy, at Smith New Court, warned of a recent fall in the value of whisky exports to Japan and the US, and suggested there could be short-term weakness in the shares. Other analysts agreed that the Warren Buffett hints had left the shares ahead of other major drinks companies, rendering them vulnerable in a market susceptible to pre-election profit-taking. Utilities steady late Utilities remained under downward pressure as marketmakers cut their dealing levels in an attempt to head off attempted selling prompted by political and regulatory fears. Confidence in the water stocks, however, was boosted after the Ofwat regulator rejected suggestions that it wanted to control dividends. The mark-down paid off at the end of the session when the regional electricity issues stabilised and the water stocks began to pick up. The latter were given a late boost from a utilities seminar hosted in Edinburgh by County NatWest, the stockbroker. At the seminar Mr Chris Bolt, head of economic regulation at Ofwat, the water industry watchdog, dispelled what he described as 'the myth that Ofwat is operating or would like to operate a system of dividend control; Ofwat does not want to introduce dividend control either directly or through the back door'. Of the Footsie stocks, Anglian ended 8 lower at 347p, Thames dipped 10 1/2 more to 350 1/2 p and Severn Trent lost 9 to 331p. The Electricity Package settled 65 down at Pounds 2658. BTR in demand Among the few firm stocks in the FT-SE 100 list, BTR stood out on re-evaluation of Wednesday's results. Having initially given up a penny as the market retreated, the stock attracted institutional bargain hunters which sent the price up 10 to 396p. The shares have declined in recent weeks on concern over the integration of Hawker Siddeley into BTR, acquired last November. Mr Ian Hilliker at County NatWest, which has returned the stock to its buy list, said: 'The shares have got terrific recovery potential and we expect them to outperform in the long term relative to the market.' Turnover was 4.4m. The best individual performance from the Footsie constituents came from RTZ  -up 16, or almost 3 per cent, at 555p, after 560p, after the group unveiled better than expected preliminary figures. The stock was also viewed by the market as one of the best defensive plays in the Footsie, with around 90 per cent of its assets outside the UK. Market fears over Enterprise Oil's final dividend payment were proved wrong as the group increased the payout by 0.25p to 9.25p, thereby increasing the total payment by 5 per cent. Nevertheless, the shares dipped to 362p before stabilising and ending the session a net 2 off at 367p, with a number of analysts still fretting about the group's gearing level and high production costs. Lasmo, meanwhile, bore the brunt of some more aggressive selling from the big integrated London brokers, the shares closing 9 1/2 weaker at 186 1/2 p, their lowest level since March 1988. BP was the most heavily traded stock in the market with turnover approaching the 20m mark. US funds were said to have moved back in to pick up the shares, which retain a high rating across the Atlantic on the belief the dividend is secure. Influential US brokerage CJ Lawrence was reported as reiterating its buy stance on the stock. At the close BP was only 2 easier at 261p, having rallied from an earlier 256p. Reaction to United Biscuits' higher dividend and better than expected profits was muted as the company gave little indication of when it expects an improvement in markets on either side of the Atlantic. Mr Eric Nicoli, group chief executive, said: 'We are hopeful of seeing an upturn this year, but we are not seeing any signs yet.' The shares held up well, against a weak trend, rising a penny to 413p as the company lifted its final dividend to 9.8p from 9.1p, giving a total of 15.3p for the year, against 14.4p. Profit for 1991 rose to Pounds 211.3m from Pounds 195.1m, above market forecasts of around Pounds 208m and proving the company's ability to boost profits in difficult trading conditions, according to analysts. Among supermarket groups, Tesco slipped 12 to 252p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 9m shares, hit by a sell note from County NatWest, while J. Sainsbury lost 5 at 389p on 1.9m traded, on a similar recommendation from Kleinwort Benson. Kingfisher lost another 14 to 489p and WH Smith 'A' fell 9 to 461p on continued worries about a DIY price war. The sale, via stockbroker Hoare Govett, of a block of 2.6m Steetley shares, equivalent to a 1.67 per cent stake in the brick manufacturer, was believed to have come from the Electricity Board Pension Fund. The stock was thought to have gone to arbitrageurs and is expected to end up in the Redland camp. Redland shares, upset in line with the rest of the sector by diminished hopes of a base rate cut, receded 8 to 451p. Steetley was 6 off at 381p. Profit-taking depressed selected leisure stocks which had risen in advance of the Budget in anticipation of a boost to consumer spending. Ladbroke, down 7 1/2 to 228 1/2 p in good volume of 3.4m, was also out of favour on consideration of the group's recent figures, with property worries remaining a niggling doubt with some in the market. Hotel group Forte encountered profit-taking and dipped 7 to 224p on 1.6m traded. So did Euro Disney, which has surged in the past fortnight on news that it is to join the CAC 40 index in Paris. The shares retreated 23 to 1653p. There was further nervousness in MTM, the speciality chemicals producer, whose shares have collapsed following two profit warnings and board resignations over the past fortnight. Most worrying, however, was that, after all the bad news and a plummet in the share price, investors still wanted to sell - prompting some in the market to speculate that there could be worse news to come. MTM's delayed accounts are due to be published at the end of the month. The stock fell 8 to 88p in active trading of 700,000 shares. A gloomy statement accompanying results which revealed an 18 per cent profits setback to Pounds 96.3m, the bottom of market expectations, sent TI Group falling 14 to 614p. Mr John Goldschmidt at Charterhouse Tilney believes the company will put in a better performance this year. But he has trimmed this year's forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 115m.

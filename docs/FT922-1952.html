			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Telephone union to enlarge 2.9% stake in Telmex THE HEAD of Mexico's union of telephone workers has denied reports his group planned to sell its stake in Telmex, the Mexican telephone utility. Mr Francisco Hernandez Juarez said yesterday the union would instead enlarge its 2.9 per cent holding. 'In the next two months we will be seeking to buy an additional 2 per cent of the company, and are looking for credits to make the purchase,' he said. Telmex shares have fallen sharply over the past week on the rumours. Banacci, which owns Mexico's largest bank, appears ready to make a planned new equity offering.</p>

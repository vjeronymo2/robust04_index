			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Brigadier Jose Manuel </F> Jota, FAA spokesman, in Luanda, by correspondent Armando Pires  in Lisbon; date not given--recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The spokesman for the Angolan  Armed Forces [FAA] stated that the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA], by attacking Cuito and Malange,  aims to condition the Lusaka talks:    [Jota] UNITA wants at any cost to change the future of the  talks to its advantage. By putting pressure on the government,  you understand, by putting pressure on the government through  military action.    [Pires] Do you not believe that a cease-fire may lead to a  better climate at the Lusaka peace talks?    [Jota] I fully agree with you.    [Pires] And why is that cease-fire not being achieved?    [Jota] Well, a cease-fire is being discussed. The cease-fire  must be discussed and agreed in Lusaka, you understand? It is  in Lusaka where we must agree on a cease-fire. Subsequently, we  can continue negotiations, in a less tense climate.</p>

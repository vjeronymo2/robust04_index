			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank decision fails to lift continent THE Bundesbank's decision to leave German interest rates alone did little for continental equity markets, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's DAX index finished 7.66 lower at 1,621.15, but off a low of 1,614.96. Turnover rose from DM5bn to DM6.1bn, and there was talk that futures trading had depressed blue chips after lifting them on Wednesday. Dealers talked hopefully of rate cut prospects after the drop in west German industrial orders in June and rising unemployment figures in east and west Germany. However, Mr Reinhard Fischer, head of equity research at Paribas Capital Markets, said that his bank was still underweighting the German market, given that more disappointing company results were in the pipeline. Douglas, the retailer, stood out painfully with a loss of DM20 to DM510 taking this year's drop in the shares to 23 per cent, against a 17 per cent gain for Kaufhof over the same period. Douglas reported lower first half profits, although it said that it expects earnings to improve in the second half. PARIS eased in dull trading, as the CAC 40 index failed to hold above 1,800 and closed 4.14 lower at 1,793.84 in turnover of FFr1.5bn. News that BP had suffered its first-ever net loss of Pounds 812m on a replacement cost basis for the second quarter, and halved its dividend weighed heavily on Elf which dropped FFr11.20 or 3.3 per cent to FFr333.30. Peugeot lost a further FFr18 to FFr649 following its disappointing first half turnover. Euro Disney gained FFr3.65 or 4.1 per cent to FFr92.75 for a gain of 9.1 per cent this week on reports that the theme park has been operating at full capacity recently. Bancaire jumped FFr17 or 5 per cent to FFr358 but traders were unable to give a reason for the rise. Accor was suspended before news that it will have to pay FFr950m to minority shareholders in Belgium's Wagons-Lits following a Brussels court ruling on its bid for Wagons-Lits. Later, Accor fell to FFr620 before closing steady at FFr638. AMSTERDAM fell on disappointing second quarter results from Philips and Royal Dutch. The CBS Tendency index lost 1.2 to 116.9. The electronics group reported a 56 per cent drop in second quarter earnings, below most analysts' forecasts. The consumer products division remains the most serious problem and Mr Jan Timmer, the chairman, said that he did not expect a recovery until 1994. The shares lost 80 cents or 3.2 per cent, to Fl 24.30. Royal Dutch shed Fl 1.40 to Fl 145 after announcing lower second quarter net income which reflected the weak dollar. MILAN was enlivened by some corporate news but trading remained thin. The Comit index rose 1.74 to 421.37 in turnover estimated at near Wednesday's L95.9bn. There was some interest in the telecoms sector, as Stet rose L38 to L1,638 on news that it had won a Dollars 160m licence to develop cellular phone systems in Greece. Benetton added L481 to L11,470. After the close United Optical, a subsidiary of the Benetton family holding company, Edizione, said that it planned to raise its share capital. Fiat rose L34 to L4,638 but there was some nervousness ahead of the car sales data for July, following the poor numbers in France earlier this week. Several shares were suspended temporarily for excessive losses, including the cement and construction group Calcestruzzi, which dropped L1,710 or 17.6 per cent to L8,000, and Euromobiliare, which closed down L305 at L2,400. STOCKHOLM declined on worries about interest rates and the banking sector. The Affarsvarlden General Index fell 3.7 to 859.4 in low turnover of SKr192m. The ball-bearings group SKF bucked the downward trend ahead of its half-year earnings report today as its B shares rose SKr1 to SKr97.50. TEL AVIV closed sharply higher in active trading, the blue-chip share index gaining 2.48 or 1.7 per cent to 155.23 in turnover of over Shk100m to register a gain of 5 per cent on the week, recouping the losses of the previous week. OSLO's all-share index slid to a new 1992 low, losing 5.73 to 366.20 in turnover of NKr172m. Norsk Hydro shed NKr3 to NKr136.5. VIENNA closed at a record low. The ATX index lost 19.84 or 2.6 per cent to 744.21. Leykam, the paper manufacturer, fell Sch10 to Sch305 after announcing a first half loss of Sch66m.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1082.10  1081.16  1080.99  1079.15  1079.13  1078.70  1077.94  1078.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1082.40    Day's Low  1077.60  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         Aug 5       Aug 4       Aug 3       Jul 31      Jul 30        1081.21     1076.44     1069.17     1067.77     1068.92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

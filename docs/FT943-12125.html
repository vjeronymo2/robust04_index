			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Halal meat row divides community: Alison Maitland reports on an attempt to prevent abuses in the Moslem food trade Mr Zahid Qureshi runs his halal meat shop in south-west London with religious passion. He is disgusted at what he regards as widespread abuse of the Islamic system of ritual slaughter. 'I'd rather have less meat to sell, and fewer customers, but at least be selling genuine halal,' he declared. Mr Qureshi, 27, is at the cutting edge of a new system to regulate the halal meat trade introduced last week by the self-styled Moslem Parliament of Great Britain. He said the Asian community in Tooting Bec, where he works, was fed up with non-halal meat being routinely sold as halal. He joined the certification system, even though it has pushed up the price of his meat, to avoid being 'tarred with the same brush'. 'The response has been unbelievable,' he said. 'Many customers from other shops have been coming to my shop and saying this is a fantastic system. They're saying they prefer to pay extra to know the meat is halal.' In halal slaughter, a Moslem must slit the animal's throat with one stroke of a very sharp knife while the name of Allah is recited. The animal is then completely bled. No other animal must be allowed to witness the slaughter. The Halal Food Authority, which runs the system, has not met universal approval from Britain's estimated 2.5m-strong Moslem community. Some see its intervention as divisive because it is acting without the blessing of all Moslem groups. Others in the meat business accuse the Moslem Parliament, led by the pro-Iranian Mr Kalim Siddiqui, of trying to raise money by cornering the market. Yet Mr Ahmed Versi, editor of the monthly Moslem News, said: 'Some people might not like the Moslem Parliament, but at least they've done something for the community. Why has the rest of the Moslem leadership done nothing about this problem?' Mr Muhammad Ghayasuddin, chairman of the authority, said it was set up this spring because more than 80 per cent of the meat being sold as halal was in fact 'haram', or forbidden meat. Much comes from poor quality carcasses picked up by traders for 'knockdown prices'. 'What's happening as a result of this plentiful supply is that the genuine halal trade is slowly contracting and is about to disappear,' he said. Mr Ghayasuddin said the authority's inspectors would supervise slaughter in abattoirs that join the scheme and would check warehouses, trucks and shops at least once a day. The inspection scheme would be similar to that of the Jewish kosher trade. To pay for the inspectors, the authority is levying 8p a pound on red meat and 15p per chicken sold by approved retailers. Mr Ghayasuddin admitted the halal trade was resisting the scheme and the bigger slaughterhouses had refused to join. 'A prolonged struggle between the bulk of the trade that prefers its unregulated state and the HFA is certain,' he said. One halal abattoir manager, who did not want to be named, said the levies were unnecessary and the trade was already regulated by local authorities. While accepting that 'a certain amount of meat sold is not halal', he argued there were enough Moslem-owned abattoirs in Britain to supply the community's needs for genuine halal meat. The authority's insistence on traditional ritual slaughter also worries vets who supervise abattoirs. The Jewish and Moslem communities are exempt from legislation requiring animals to be stunned before slaughter. But Mr Martin Cooke, vice-president of the food hygiene division of the British Veterinary Association, said most Moslem abattoirs have nevertheless been prepared to accept pre-stunning. Since the creation of the Halal Food Authority, however he said he knew of one abattoir that had been told by local Moslem leaders to stop stunning animals or risk losing its business. The abattoir management agreed, he said, because 'they were being put in an impossible situation'.</p>

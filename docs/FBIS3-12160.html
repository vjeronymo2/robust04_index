			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Menashe Raz] </F>   [Text] Just like yesterday's session, tomorrow's cabinet  session will be held under the grave impression that the Hebron  massacre might leave an eternal mark on the State of Israel.  Ministers have compared the dreadful impact of the incident with  similar incidents in the past, such as the Dayr al-Yasin  massacre.    There will be two main issues on tomorrow's cabinet's  agenda:  immediate action to be taken against the hard-core of the  extreme settlers in Hebron and Qiryat Arba', and finding a  long-term formula in response to the international pressure  focused on Israel. In this context, setting up a state  commission of inquiry to investigate yesterday morning's  incidents in the Cave of the Patriarchs is under discussion.    According to the justice minister and the attorney general,  these two issues are fully covered by state laws, emergency  regulations, and legislation applying to the territories. As  for the immediate moves against what is called the Brooklyn gang  and its Israeli supporters -- all from the school of Rabbi  Kahana -- the steps discussed are: distancing them from the  territories; deporting them; preventing their presence in  Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza; and applying administrative  detentions. The authorities will deal with familiar  individuals, whose names and places of residence are known.    All the cabinet ministers agree on those steps, some even  expect them to be taken within hours. In the session tomorrow,  they will be briefed about action taken. As for the closure on  Qiryat Arba', several ministers urged clamping a curfew on  Qiryat Arba', and not to settle for a closure. Observing  closure is not very problematic on a Sabbath. The question is  what will happen at the end of it, this evening and tomorrow  morning. Most of the ministers made determined and clear  remarks today on this issues as well. The principle theme is to  prevent friction between Jews and Arabs in Hebron for fear of  revenge.    Currently, not all the ministers agree on establishing a  state commission of inquiry. Until this time, and in  yesterday's cabinet session, the prime minister has not taken a  stand on this issue. Justice Minister David Liba'i is leading  the move to set up the inquiry team. It is the duty of the  Government of Israel to document the massacre at the Cave of the  Patriarchs; from the historic point of view, there is no other  way, those favoring the move have said. The government should  not allow a situation in which such a commission is set up in  response to public or international pressure. It should be  initiated by the government.    Ministers in opposition to this move have said that Israel  is  not concealing the facts. Everything that had happened in  Hebron was initiated by a single person. Punitive measures  taken by the security forces, will add to the understanding that  the State of Israel is handling the Hebron incident without  hiding anything.    There is no intention to disarm the settlers. The ministers  have rejected this outright. Another issue the government will  be briefed about is the release of the Palestinian prisoners.  Jerusalem sources said this morning that this issue has been  agreed on in talks with the PLO, regardless of the Hebron  incident. According to the sources, the incident will probably  speed up the process.    [In a recorded passage later in the same newscast, Faysal  al-Husayni says in English: "If the Israelis are going on  thinking that in the interim period there will be a possibility  of leaving the settlers on the ground and keeping their army to  protect the settlers, as they are saying, it is nonsense."]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 26 February  adds: "Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu today warned against  the government readiness to make far-reaching concessions to the  Palestinians because it is under pressure." The report adds  that "Netanyahu stressed that he opposes taking unjustified  steps against the settlers who constantly suffer from the Arab  terror."</p>

This action is being conducted in accordance with the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, and the specific 1993 base closure and realignment decisions approved by the Congress in September 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action to be evaluated in the EIS/EIR is the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of MCAS Tustin for subsequent reuse. The Marine Corps and City of Tustin intend to analyze the environmental effects of the disposal of MCAS Tustin based on the reasonable foreseeable reuse of the property, taking into account uses to be identified by the City of Tustin Base Closure Task Force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Task Force has developed a Specific Plan/Reuse Plan to guide the reuse of MCAS Tustin in a variety of uses, including public and private housing, commercial, light industrial, and recreation uses. Some of the existing structures and facilities, including housing, are anticipated to be reused. A number of facilities, including the airfield operation facilities, are proposed for removal. Agricultural and vacant areas on MCAS Tustin are proposed to be developed with urban uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Full buildout of the proposed land uses will result in a maximum of 4,601 dwelling units and about 12.3 million square feet of non-residential uses such as commercial business, light industrial, and recreational uses (about 2.1 million square feet is existing floor area on the base, and 10.2 million square feet is potential new floor area). It is also currently estimated that about 25 percent of the site would be used for public uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The project also will include the extension of major arterials through the base including Tustin Ranch Road to Von Karman, Warner Avenue from Red Hill to west of Jamboree Road, and creation of a secondary interior loop roadway and local roadways to facilitate local circulation. The Specific/Reuse Plan will also address possible variations to the Tustin Ranch Road and Warner Avenue extensions in the event the southerly blimp hangar is removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives to be addressed in the EIS/EIR can be characterized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Arterial Grid Pattern/High Residential_land uses are driven by a grid pattern of major arterial extensions. This alternative has the greatest number of residential units. This alternative also has no community core land use flexibility. The alternative could pose limitations in responding to market absorption and soil clean-up phasing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Ideal Interior Loop Pattern/Low Residential_the alignment of arterial highways and the proposed looped system would be modified to show its optimum alignment if the southeast blimp hangar could not be reused, and would include possible variations to the Tustin Ranch Road and Warner Avenue extensions. This alternative would have the fewest number of residential units and would result in the highest commercial retail and office square footage, particularly at the southerly portion of the site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. No action_retention of the property by the Marine Corps in a caretaker status. However, because of the process mandated by the Base Closure and Realignment Act, selection of the no action alternative would be considered impracticable for the Marine Corps to implement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major environmental issues that will be addressed in the EIS/EIR include land use, housing, utilities, noise, transportation/circulation, public services, airfield operations, hazardous materials, water resources, air quality, biological resources, and cultural resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Marine Corps and City of Tustin will initiate a scoping process to determine the extent of issues to be addressed and identifying the significant issues related to this action. The Marine Corps and City of Tustin will hold a public scoping meeting on July 20, 1994, beginning at 7:00 p.m., at the City of Tustin Community Center located in the Tustin Civic Center, 300 Centennial Way. This meeting will be advertised in area newspapers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A brief presentation will precede the request for public comment. Marine Corps and City of Tustin representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern to the public. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed during the preparation of the EIS/EIR. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit oral comments to 5 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment on scoping issues in addition to, or in lieu of, oral comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which the author/speaker believes the EIS/EIR should address. Written statements and questions regarding the scoping process should be mailed to: Christine Shingleton, Assistant City Manager, City of Tustin, 300 Centennial Way, Tustin, CA 92680, telephone number (714) 573&hyph;3116. All comments must be received no later than August 5, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lewis T.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mate Granic, "Croatian foreign minister and </F> vice president," by Maria Isabel Seguel; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Seguel] What is a foreign minister of a nation at  war doing visiting a small country the other side of the world?    [Granic] Croatia is no longer just a country at war. Only 25  percent of our territory is still occupied, to be more precise  under the control of the United Nations. We signed cease-fire  agreements with the local Serb authorities and we expect to hold  the second round of negotiations regarding economic issues and  the return of refugees, and then begin political negotiations.    Croatia is a very stable and democratic country. It has the  most stable economy in the entire region. Our inflation will not  go over 12 percent. Croatia expects a reasonably good tourist  season. We are also in a full process of privatization.    [Seguel] I am even more confused over why you are in Chile.    [Granic] Because Chile was one of the first countries to  recognize Croatia. Also because our economic relations are very  good. The most important reason is to explain the current  situation of my country which could be and wants to be the door  to Eastern Europe and an opportunity for investments. Some  Chilean-Croats have already bought companies in Croatia, like  Mr. Luksic who bought the second largest brewery in our country.    [Seguel] While there is a conflict, it is cheap to buy. Are  you saying the war will end soon?    [Granic] That is not easy to say. The most important thing  will be future negotiations regarding a final agreement, and all  the economic issues that will certainly be discussed with the  local Serb authorities.    [Seguel] How difficult was it for you to negotiate with the  Serbs taking into account their terrible image as aggressors,  according to the international media?    [Granic] It has been very difficult right from the start but  still the negotiation continues to be the cheapest way for the  peaceful reintegration of the zones under UN control in  Croatia's legal system.    [Seguel] What was your most difficult moment during the  negotiations?    [Granic] There were two difficult moments. The negotiations  with the local Serb authorities and the negotiations with the  Armed Forces of the former Yugoslavia for exchanging prisoners.    [Seguel] Why do you believe the Serbs continue the policy of  occupying the territory? Will it be costly to them in terms of  image in the future?    [Granic] It is an unreasonable policy in the long-term and  in  the short-term it is also costly because its economy is in  ruins. Serbia is absolutely isolated and it believes the more  territory it has at the time of the negotiations the stronger  its position will be.    [Seguel] What is your basic rule for negotiations?    [Granic] The main thing is that the zones under UN control  return to Croatia. We are ready to discuss the rights of the  minorities, the ethnic communities, and local autonomy. We are  willing to accept international supervision. Croatia will accept  negotiations with Serb-Croatian authorities regarding future  local autonomy as well as guarantees for minorities, but we are  not willing to negotiate our borders.    [Seguel] There seems to be more people who want the war to  continue than those who advocate peace.    [Granic] The future negotiations will include talks on the  demarcation between the Bosnian Federation (Muslims and Croats  together) and the Serbs, and the type of association between the  Serbs and the federation because we will ask the Serbs to join  the federation. I believe the Serbs will refuse. I believe the  problem of demarcation relates to the percentage of the  territory we talked about. The Serbs now have control over 70  percent of it and we have proposed 51 percent for the federation  and 49 percent for the Serbs.    [Seguel] And what did they answer?    [Granic] They proposed no more than 47 percent for the  federation and the Muslims proposed 60 percent. Another  important problem here will be the corridor the Serbs will  probably attack soon. It is also very important to prevent that  Serbian offensive.    [Seguel] So you already know how the war will continue....    [Granic] It is simple. But let us go on, the Serbs have  placed some conditions on signing a total cease fire and the  start of negotiations, such as lifting economic sanctions. This  is why it is necessary more than ever to keep the pressure on  the Serbs very firm.    [Seguel] Why does it seem that when the aggressor is so  clearly identified, the international community cannot act or  does not want to act with more force?    [Granic] This is the question the people on the streets in  Croatia ask. There are two basic reasons. On one side there were  the different interests of the great powers and on the other  side there is the brutal Serbian aggressiveness. Probably, there  has never been anything similar in the history of Europe. The  decisions by both the European and international community came  late and they did not serve or they were not implemented with  enough decision. The Serbian aggression should have been stopped  and prevented in Vukovar, when a Croatian city that was under  siege for two full months was continuously bombed. At that time,  2,000 people were killed. And in the harshest 72 hours, 2,500  people were killed. Had the international community acted then,  it is possible that the conflict would have developed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Seguel] Did you expect or were you surprised by the attack  on Gorazde?    [Granic] I was only surprised at its brutality. This was  unreasonable for the Serbs to do because, looking at it from a  reasonable manner, the only path the Serbs have ahead is the  path of negotiations and to seek a peaceful end to the war in  Bosnia.    [Seguel] If you were not surprised by the attack on Gorazde  and if you could predict what the Serbs will do, what other  surprises can the international community expect?    [Granic] The plans of the Serbs are quite clear. Their  strategic interests are, first, to widen the corridor in the  Brcko zone. Other interests include the Muslim settlements in  the eastern part of Bosnia and in Bihac. All this depends  exclusively on the international community. In other words, if  the international community shows enough firmness in its  decision to get the Serbs to negotiate and also to get the  Muslims, who are the most threatened, to join in. Regarding the  Republic of Croatia, we will support the agreements signed in  Washington and this means the installation of the Federation of  Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will support  solutions leading to cease-fire in the region. We will support  the pressures exerted on the Serbs to make them join the  negotiations.    [Seguel] Do you like to negotiate, or are you tired of it?    [Granic] Yes, I like it. In addition to the negotiations  that  I have already mentioned, in which I was the chief Croatian  negotiator, I also headed the group that negotiated with the  Muslims. The are still plenty of negotiations to carry out and  it is tiring work. I believe the Washington agreements were the  best success so far. I would be the happiest person in the world  if I could finish everything this year because I would prevent a  lot of human suffering. So many atrocities have been committed  and there have been so many victims that I believe we should all  do everything possible to end it.    [Seguel] Has this war helped you to understand matters that  made no sense during Tito's Yugoslavia?    [Granic] During the Tito years, especially in 1974 when the  current Constitution was proclaimed, he was strongly sensitive  to the topic of nationalism in Yugoslavia. He kept Serb  nationalism under control, and he also controlled the economy.  All types of contradictions emerged after Tito, like the  aggressive Serb nationalism that sought a great Serbia, and of  course the resistance of the others.    The presidents of Slovenia and Croatia proposed a  confederation before the war. This was rejected by the Serbs.  Now there is absolutely no chance of any type of union between  the Serbs and Croats. We can only be neighbors.    [Seguel] What will you do after the war? Will you return to  being a doctor or continue as a negotiator?    [Granic] I have become so deeply enmeshed in political life  that it will be very difficult for me to return to the medical  profession. The end of the war is currently my motivation, as  are the development of democratic institutions, European  relations and integration, and participation in the creation of  a modern democratic state.    [Seguel] Are all parties in Croatia in agreement regarding  the progress of negotiations?    [Granic] All parties agree regarding the negotiations with  the Muslims. As for the Serbs, the opposition parties do not  agree because they are against any type of negotiation unless  Serbia publicly recognizes the Republic of Croatia. We also want  Serbia to do this, but it is our belief that it must be a mutual  recognition, and this can be achieved step by step. There is  also the matter of economic cooperation, but for this to occur  there must be a restoration of communications by road, rail, and  the restoration of the oil pipeline system. The return of  refugees, or displaced persons, and that of "the external  states" are also important.    Talking about the opposition, they are convinced that they  could carry out privatizations much better than the party that  is in power. But this is a part of democracy, and we are aware  of some errors we have made, but we believe Croatia is a stable  country.    [Seguel] Could you put on a doctor's smock and diagnose the  sick patient in front of you (Yugoslavia)?    [Granic] Without resolving the complex situation in which  Yugoslavia finds itself there can be no peace solution for  Croatia. A peaceful solution cannot be achieved without strong  and firm assistance from the international community. Then there  is the question of how, at the same time, to resolve the problem  of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the zones in Croatia that are  protected by the United Nations. These are two fundamental  problems. Of course, the international community still has the  problem of resolving stability in Macedonia, it still has to  ensure the autonomy of Kosovo, human rights problems, ethnic  problems, and the rights of the national minorities that live in  Serbia, especially those of the Croats. It must also solve the  question of the system of regional security.    In sum, a sick patient that needs a multipurpose team to  help  it recover, including a long convalescence.</p>

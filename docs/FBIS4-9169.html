			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The following items on the employment of  Albanians in internal security units in The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, were published in recent issues of  Skopje FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, the most widely circulated  Albanian-language newspaper in FYROM.  <H5>  Competition for Police Openings Announced by Ministry </H5>   In a notice aimed at ethnic Albanians who are FYROM  citizens,  the Interior Ministry announced openings for 150 police officers  (both male and female) in Skopje, Kumanovo, Tetovo, Gostivar,  Ohrid, Struga, Kercovo, Debar, and Resnje. The applicants must  be under 25 years of age and physically fit, and must not have  any criminal record. They also must have completed their  military service. The notice makes no mention of nationality.  According to the notice, successful candidates are to be  assigned to internal security units in the regions mentioned,  regardless of their place of residence. The competition was  scheduled to end eight days after the announcement was  published. (FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, 6 March 94)  <H5>  PDP Spearheads Drive To Get Albanians Into Police Jobs </H5>   An appeal by the ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic  Prosperity, PDP, urges "all candidates interested in employment  in the Interior Ministry" who have recently filed documents at  the "Headquarters" branch of the PDP in Skopje to retrieve these  documents, complete them in accordance with the competition's  requirements, and present them at the regional units of the  Interior Ministry -- the police stations. (FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT,  11 March 94)  <H5>  Albanians Object to Treatment by Kercovo Internal Affairs </H5> Units    At the request of PDP council members, a meeting was held  with representatives of the Directorate for General Juridical  Operations and the Sector for Internal Affairs in Kercovo to  discuss the mistreatment Albanians have encountered when they  request legal documents, according to an article. The PDP  representatives demanded the employment of more Albanians in  these organizations. "Albanians in the northern part of Kercovo  are not at all satisfied with the service of the Macedonian  employees in the internal affairs offices of the country.  Citizens must wait for days to get ordinary documents or  certificates, while Macedonians are able to get them with just a  telephone call," the PDP representatives are cited as saying.  Because of such delays, the representatives asked that the  offices in Osllome (Oslomej) and Zajas be staffed by Albanians,  as more than 9O percent of the residents of these areas are of  Albanian nationality. Even though the new passports are written  in the Latin alphabet, some letters are replaced by Cyrillic  letters, causing some ethnic Albanians employed outside the  country to demand new passports, the article notes. It goes on  to point out that the representatives of the Directorate General  and of the Sector for Internal Affairs declared that the  appropriate ministries would be informed of these controversies,  but they also asked that citizens not request documents that are  not needed, pointing out, for example, that new identification  cards are not required because the existing ones will be valid  until the law is approved. There was also a discussion of the  need to train Albanian youths for the police force, the article  concludes. (FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, 25 February 94)  <H5>  Struga Interior Ministry Unit Urged To Hire More Albanians </H5>   A group of PDP council members met with Stefan Perdulloski,  head of the regional unit of the Interior Ministry in Struga, to  urge that the procedure for registering the population be  accelerated and facilitated, another article reports. They also  called for the proportional employment of Albanians in the  Interior Ministry unit in Struga, for the acceptance of  Albanians into the police force in proportion to their  percentage of the population, and for more Albanian students to  be admitted to the Interior Ministry secondary school, the  report notes. In addition, PDP representatives presented a  demand for the employment of Albanians in offices in places such  as Veleshte, Ladorisht, Drasllajce, and Struga to Faruk  Qazimoski, chief of the Officers Service.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Petition Relating to Adoption of Geometric Visibility Specification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph S5.7.1.4.2(a) of Standard No. 108 specifies that, at the location chosen for conspicuity treatment, ``the strip shall not be obscured in whole or in part by other motor vehicle equipment or trailer cargo.'' TTMA asked that the words ``trailer cargo'' be deleted and that obscuration of the strip be determined ``when viewed within&blank;&blank; +/^30 degrees horizontally or perpendicular to the sheeting 15m (50 feet) away and at a height of 1.25m.'' In justification of its petition, it argued that trailer manufacturers should not be responsible for the possible obscuring of sheeting by cargo, and that ``[t]here is not a similar prohibition of obscuring lamps by cargo in FMVSS 108.'' TTMA supplemented its August 1993 letter on September 24 with the example of a container chassis whose gooseneck connector to a tractor trailer is obscured when an intermodal container is secured to it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although paragraph S5.3.1.1 of Standard No. 108 requires that lamps and reflectors be mounted on a vehicle so that they are visible at the test points specified in the SAE Standards and Recommended Practices, this section does not apply to conspicuity sheeting because no SAE standards regarding conspicuity sheeting materials are incorporated in Standard No. 108. Furthermore, it would be undesirable to impose geometric visibility requirements on conspicuity sheeting or reflectors because the practicability constraints on long strips of conspicuity material and reflectors used in lieu thereof are different than those on lamps and reflectors. While it is possible to move lamps and reflectors to locations that achieve geometric visibility, the locations available for conspicuity materials on some trailers, such as the container chassis, may be too limited to permit optimization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to obscuration of conspicuity materials, NHTSA considers that strips or reflectors are obscured by cargo or equipment only if they are not visible when viewed perpendicular to the conspicuity material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential for obscuration by cargo should not be difficult to foresee. NHTSA considers that trailer manufacturers are in a reasonable position to anticipate where cargo will be placed in or on their trailers because they have designed the trailers to accommodate specific cargo types and loading techniques. For example, with respect to the container chassis cited in TTMA's supplementary letter of September 24, the manufacturer of a container chassis knows that the gooseneck connector will be obscured when the load is in place, and may apply conspicuity treatment that allows for the load. Assuming an overall chassis length of 53 feet, the manufacturer is required to mark at least half of that (26.5 feet) with conspicuity marking. Assuming a gooseneck length of 9 feet, Standard No. 108 thus requires that the minimum of 26.5 feet of conspicuity material be applied in the 44 feet of trailer length that is behind the gooseneck. The manufacturer is not prohibited from affixing the material to the gooseneck as well if it chooses, but in such a location this material is considered surplus and, because it will be obscured when the load is in place, cannot be included in the manufacturer's 50 percent determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Denial of TTMA Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has completed its technical review of the TTMA petition for rulemaking under 49 CFR part 552, and has determined that there is not a reasonable possibility that the amendments requested in the petition will be issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding. Therefore, the petition by TTMA is denied in its entirety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  15 U.S.C. 1410a; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: April 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8625 Filed 4&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

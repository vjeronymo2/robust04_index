			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary: "The Center has Lost its Credibility by </F> Changing Positions on the Kashmir Issue in International Forums"]    [Text] Bombay, 24 February (NP)--Panun Kashmir, the  organization of Kashmiri pandits, says that the government of  India, in changing its stand on the Kashmir issue repeatedly,  has lost credibility at the international level. The position of  our government has been weakened ethically.    Dr. Ajay Charungoo, spokesman for Panun Kashmir, told  reporters today that the government is beginning to blame  Islamic fundamentalism for the Kashmir problem. Before, the  government blamed Pakistan's internal policy and drug smugglers  for the problem.    Dr. Chrungoo returned on Monday after taking part in the  human rights meeting in Geneva. In addition, Mr. Moti Kaul,  president of the Kashmiri Pandit Association's Bombay branch,  and Dr. Vijay Sazawal, president of the Indo-U. S. Kashmir  Forum, participated as representatives of Panun Kashmir at the  conference.    The Panun Kashmir spokesman said that the Indian government  accused Pakistan of spreading unrest all over the country. It  claimed to have proof of this. Why does not it sever diplomatic  relations with such a country? The organization said that there  is no sense in asking the United States to declare Pakistan a  terrorist nation. According to the spokesman, this task should  be done by the government of India.    Dr. Ajay Chrungoo said that the government had not explained  the Kashmiri pandits' situation to other countries; that is why  Western nations have learned only of Pakistan's side. He said he  was doing the government's job. According to him, the government  is giving too much importance to Asia Watch and Amnesty  International. There are other human rights organizations;  however, the government does not invite them.    Panun Kashmir has blamed all parties, including the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party], for the Kashmir problem. The spokesman  said that the BJP should handle the Kashmir problem by rising  above Article 370. He said that leaders like Vajpayee and  Jaswant Singh are sitting on the same platform with the National  Conference leaders, while the stand of the conference is clear.  They want autonomy for Kashmir.  *</p>

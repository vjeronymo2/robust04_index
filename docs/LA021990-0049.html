			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKEOFF ABORTED; SMOKE CHASES 193 OFF PLANE AT LAX  </P> <P> A TWA jumbo jet aborted its takeoff at Los Angeles International Airport late  Sunday afternoon, and crew members evacuated the nearly 200 people aboard after  smoke and steam filled the cabin, fire officials said.  </P> <P> The crew aboard TWA Flight 8, an L-1011 Tristar en route to New York City,  initially reported fire in the back of the main cabin at 4:22 p.m., a spokesman  for the Federal Aviation Administration said.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles city fire officials said firefighters found no blaze once they  boarded the plane that carried 181 passengers and 12 crew members.  </P> <P> The jetliner was in its takeoff roll when a pneumatic air duct beneath the  floorboard of the plane's cabin ruptured and started to fill the compartment  with a combination of smoke, hot compressed air and steam, TWA spokesman Jim  Faulkner said in St. Louis.  </P> <P> The duct takes in air from an engine "and supplies air to run various  components of the plane, such as de-icing systems," he said.  </P> <P> After aborting the takeoff, the pilot pulled off the runway onto a taxiway  where those on board were evacuated using inflatable slides, fire officials  said.  </P> <P> Four flight attendants and one passenger complained of smoke inhalation and  were taken to area hospitals for observation, Faulkner said.  </P> <P> Fire officials said at least three passengers also reported minor injuries such  as twisted ankles after coming down the slides.  </P> <P> Two firefighters were also injured -- one in the eye and the other sustaining a  fractured rib, when a high-pressure water hose burst and whipped into them.  </P> <P> TWA officials said passengers were being offered seats on later flights.  </P> <P> The cause of the plane's trouble was being investigated by federal officials.  </P></p>

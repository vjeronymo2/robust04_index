			<p>BFN     [Text] After visiting Russian troops serving with the UN  Protection Forces in Sector East, Russian Ambassador to Croatia  Leonid Kerestedziyants told reporters that they discussed the  implementation of the Zagreb agreement and agreed that the  Croatian Army must withdraw the remaining weapons by 1600  tomorrow and the Serbian side must do the same by 2400 tomorrow.    The Zagreb agreement has to be fully implemented in all  protected areas by 2400 tomorrow, the Russian ambassador said.  If this does not happen further steps will be taken by both the  Russian and U.S. embassies and the European Union, for what has  been signed has to be respected. This is not a piece of paper  which has been signed and can then be forgotten, he said.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese retailer takes a surprise gamble on China - China, amid an austerity programme and resurgent political uncertainty, is reckoned by Kazuo Wada to offer the ultimate in risk and reward IN 1989, Mr Kazuo Wada made an unusual move for a Japanese businessman. He moved the headquarters of his Yaohan retailing group from Nimazu in Japan to Hong Kong. At that time, Hong Kong was struggling to come to terms with the political implications of the Tiananmen Square massacre, property was cheap and influential friends were easily made. Hong Kong was to prove a springboard for Mr Wada's growing ambitions in China. Later this month his timing will face a similar test, as he attempts to sell this story to investors by listing his holding company, Yaohan International, on the Hong Kong stock market amid a Chinese economic austerity programme and a resurgence of political uncertainty. In 1990, Yaohan had three department stores in Hong Kong; it now controls seven stores, three listed companies, and chains of restaurants, cake stores, games centres, leather boutiques and home appliance stores. By the end of 1994, Mr Wada says he will control eight stock market-listed companies in Hong Kong. But in spite of this spate of activity in Hong Kong, China has remained Mr Wada's great rallying cry. The 21st Century will be the era of China, he claims, and he plans to get in early, opening 1,000 supermarkets in the still-backward nation by the year 2,010. Mr Wada said: 'China is now where Japan was thirty years ago. Japan will still be a big market for Yaohan, but they already have a lot of merchandise. 'Yaohan has more potential in China, where people have nothing.' China remains a controversial choice. Other retailers have seen turnover slide in the face of Chinese vice premier Zhu Rongji's moves to curb speculation and excessive growth in consumer spending. As one analyst said: 'You see a lot of people walking around Beijing department stores, but you don't see them buying anything.' But Mr Wada disputes this view. Yaohan manages a department store in Beijing, which claims to have seen steady growth in sales since it opened earlier this year. Yaohan clearly understands one of the keys to business in China. It has built up connections with substantial Chinese corporations, including China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) and China Venturetec Investment Corporation (CVIC). CITIC's Australian subsidiary recently purchased 10 per cent of Yaohan International, while CVIC has a 5 per cent stake. CVIC owns the company's Beijing store, and Yaohan has also formed a joint venture with China's largest department store operator, Shanghai Number One department store to construct what will be Asia's largest department store. Yaohan has a 51 per cent stake in the project, which will cost USDollars 100m and will create a store with a sales area of 122,000 sq metres, equivalent to Harrods in London or Macy's in New York. When Mr Wada announced the deal in 1991, he said it would mark 'the beginning of the era of China'. But in a country that in 1992 had gross national product of USDollars 355 a head, compared with more than USDollars 1,800 in neighbouring Thailand, it is hard to imagine that China is ready for such an ambitious project. But China has substantial hidden resources and an extremely high savings rate, so disposable income is already significantly higher than the statistics suggest. Mr Wada is planning for the long term. He intends to build Yaohan's presence primarily through 'International Merchandise Marts'. These will circumvent China's inefficient wholesale system by acting as distribution centres for numerous Yaohan franchise stores, which would be primarily owned by local Chinese government. However, no meaningful contribution is expected from China until 1997. The flotation of Yaohan International will be sold to investors as a pan-Asian retailer that has skirted the Japanese recession, using a strong yen to move successfully into the broader South East Asian marketplace. But the underlying strategy for the flotation is to raise its profile and roughly HKDollars 600m (USDollars 77.6m) in capital to aid a push into China, which is would include vast chains of department stores, fast-food restaurants and cake shops. As the largest and least developed of the world's consumer markets, China is both the ultimate risk and reward for retailers. Mr Wada, for one, is confident that investors will accept the challenge.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Procter &amp; Gamble up 24% in quarter Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, reported a 24 per cent surge in underlying fourth-quarter profits, helped by a 7 per cent rise in the volume of goods sold and lower costs. Net earnings in the three months to June were Dollars 406m (Pounds 262m) compared with an underlying Dollars 327m last time - though the figure reported last year was a loss of Dollars 1.55m because of restructuring charges. Turnover was up 2 per cent at Dollars 7.5bn. The company said the rise would have been 4 per cent but for shifts in exchange rates and lower pricing. Earnings per share were 56 cents against last year's underlying 44 cents. Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected significant progress in cost reduction objectives, along with a unit volume growth of 7 per cent worldwide. For the year as a whole, net profits were affected by the Dollars 102m charge taken in April to cover losses on an ill-fated foray into derivatives. This left net earnings at Dollars 2.21bn, or Dollars 2.91 a share. The previous year, the company made net profits of Dollars 2.02bn, or Dollars 2.81 a share, before the restructuring charge. 'This was a good year, and if not for the derivatives loss, it would have been a great year,' said Mr Artzt. Soap wars may affect Hickson, Page 17</p>

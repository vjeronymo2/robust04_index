			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Air France and EBRD seek Czech carrier refund Air France and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are demanding financial compensation from the Czech government after claiming that they overpaid for their minority holdings in CSA, the Czech national airline. The Air France group, in partnership with the French state financial institute, Caisse des Depots, and the EBRD each acquired slightly less than 20 per cent of the Czech group's capital in 1992 for a total of Dollars 60m. The National Property Fund, a Czech institution set up to administer privatisations and oversee the state's shareholdings, is the largest shareholder with 49 per cent. Air France yesterday said it was in 'constructive conversations' with the Czech government but declined to give details. The French airline, which provided crew training and other services in payment for a large share of its own interest in CSA, and the EBRD are understood to be seeking a capital injection by the Czechs into CSA to compensate for the over-valuation of the airline at the time of the original deal. The discrepancy in the airline's valuation came to light in an internal audit report published last week showing it was overvalued by about Kcs746m (Dollars 25m). This was due in part to the original calculation having being made on the nominal value of tickets sold without taking discounted fares into account. The row will come to a head on Monday at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting in Prague, which will also attempt to resolve the Czech airline's growing financial crisis. Government officials expect CSA to make a Kcs1.2bn loss this year, following a loss of Kcs211m in 1992. According to Czech press reports, Air France is increasingly concerned by CSA's mounting losses. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, said recently the government would not provide any more finance for CSA until the roots of its crisis had been properly established.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 10 KYODO -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) overwhelmingly adopted a resolution on  Friday [10 June] suspending technical aid to North Korea for its  refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities  suspected of developing nuclear weapons.    The action represented the first punitive step by the UN  nuclear watchdog agency against North Korea, which promptly said  that it will order two IAEA inspectors still in the country to  leave the country.    The IAEA's technical aid to North Korea amounted to 270,000  dollars in 1993.    The IAEA board of governors voted 28-1 for the resolution  cosponsored by the United States, Japan and other countries,  which have expressed grave concern over Pyongyang's clandestine  nuclear program as a destabilizing factor on the north Asian  security scene.    Libya was the sole dissenting country. China, North Korea's  longtime ally, abstained, along with three other countries.    Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told reporters in  Istanbul that their countries will push for an international  conference on North Korea and a resolution of sanctions by the  UN Security Council against North Korea.    Moscow has proposed an international conference on North  Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program to help defuse tensions  on the Korean peninsula.    After the IAEA's historic vote, a North Korean diplomat in  Vienna said his country no longer guarantees the continuity of  nuclear safeguards.</p>

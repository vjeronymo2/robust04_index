			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE WORLD NEWS TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> MARINA SHOT DOWN IN SECOND HALF  </P> <P> San Bernardino High School spent most of the first half Friday night trying to  find a way to shoot over Cherokee Parks, Marina's 6-foot-11 center. The  Cardinals didn't have much luck.  </P> <P> But they found all kinds of routes around and over Parks in the second half for  a 58-56 victory against Marina in the championship semifinals of the Irvine  World News basketball tournament at Irvine High School.  </P> <P> The Cardinals (7-0) will meet Compton in the final at 7:30 tonight at Christ  College Irvine.  </P> <P> Marina (5-3) appeared destined for the final as Parks swatted away four San  Bernardino shots in the first half.  </P> <P> "We were intimidated by Parks in the first half," San Bernardino Coach Scott  Kay said. "At halftime I told them to try to go by him instead of going over  him."  </P> <P> Guard Quan Ha found the two easiest ways to get by Parks, who finished with 18  points, 13 rebounds and six blocked shots.  </P> <P> Ha made three three-pointers and scored all of his 12 points in the second  half, including two free throws with 13 seconds remaining that gave the  Cardinals a 58-54 lead.  </P> <P> "I have to give Quan a lot of credit," Kay said. "He's our best free-throw  shooter (80%) but he doesn't shoot them very often because he doesn't penetrate  and get fouled much."  </P> <P> Marina Coach Steve Popovich said he was impressed by Ha's outside shooting.  </P> <P> "Ha's three-pointers really loosened things up for them," Popovich said. "They  hit a lot of tough shots in the second half.  </P> <P> "They turned it up in the second half. It just came down to one last bucket."  </P> <P> One the Vikings couldn't get.  </P> <P> San Bernardino was leading, 54-52, when the Cardinals' Etdrick Bohannon missed  a short jumper. After the ball was tipped twice, Bohannon grabbed it and laid  it in for to give the Cardinals a 56-52 lead with 50 seconds left.  </P> <P> "That was the key to the game right there," Popovich said.  </P> <P> Popovich said another factor in the second half was Cardinal center Ray Owes, a  6-7 junior. He scored eight of his game-high 21 points in the third quarter as  the Cardinals turned a five-point halftime deficit into a two-point lead.  </P> <P> "Ray was a lot more active in the second half," Kay said. "He played well  inside and out. And our defense was much better in the second half, too."  </P> <P> It was Parks' presence on defense that kept the Vikings in front early. Besides  his four blocks, he pulled down 10 rebounds and scored 11 points as Marina  grabbed a 28-23 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "(Marina) really took it to us in the first half," Kay said. "It was their  tempo and they had control of the game."  </P> <P> But the Cardinals began feeding the ball to Ha early in the third quarter. He  hit two three pointers and forced Marina to extend it's defense.  </P> <P> "We're really not known for our three-point shooting," Kay said. "But they were  packing it in on Ray and Quan was wide open."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ku Pon-yong] </F>   [Text] North Korea is exerting all its efforts to increase  the production of clothes for export in order to earn foreign  currency, which it lacks, to solve its economic difficulties.    After the mid-1980's, North Korea began to build export  clothes plants independent of plants for domestic consumption to  earn foreign currency. There are an estimated 40 such plants,  20 of which are joint ventures or jointly managed, mainly with  companies owned by the General Association of Korean Residents  in Japan, Chongnyon.    The export clothes companies import basic materials and  export the finished products to Japan and Western countries.  Those with outstanding export records are Moranbong  joint-venture company, Nakwon Songhwa clothes company, and  Chindallae joint-venture company (women's clothes). Moranbong  joint-venture company, North Korea's largest export clothes  company, exported approximately 280,000 men's suits and jackets  in 1990.    There are reports, however, that North Korea's ambitious  plans to expand clothes exports are partly snagged. Chongnyon  businessmen are refraining from investing in North Korea due to  the North Korean regime's excessive control and closed policy,  which run counter to the changes in the international political  situation.    It has been learned that since the beginning of the  nineties,  consecutive Chongnyon companies have gone bankrupt or stopped  operations due to the North Korean authority's opportunistic and  stubborn attitude and now only 20 plants are in operation.    As a result, the North Korean authorities are actively  seeking joint-venture businesses with Western countries in the  clothes processing sector. In the meantime, it is also expected  that North Korea will show increased interest in expanding  processing trade with the ROK, despite the blocked North-South  relations.    However, ROK's processing trade is not expected to be  activated until the North Korean nuclear issue reaches a stage  of resolution.</p>

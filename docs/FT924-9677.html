			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green laws 'may cost refiners Dollars 50bn' EUROPEAN OIL refiners might have to invest Dollars 50bn by the end of the decade in meeting tighter environmental legislation, delegates at the Financial Times Petroleum and Gas conference heard yesterday. Mr Michael Brandt, manager of supply co-ordination and planning with Shell Internationale in The Hague, told the conference, which focused on new challenges for Europe's oil refining industries, that the cost to refiners of meeting environmental legislation over the next three years was likely to be between Dollars 12bn and Dollars 16bn. The eventual cost could be as high as Dollars 50bn. Mr Wilson Berry, managing director of manufacturing and marketing at Texaco, also told delegates that investment in upgrading refineries, improving the quality of products, and meeting tougher environmental standards could be as much as Dollars 40bn. Mr Berry warned that such investment would have to be made despite a continued pessimistic outlook for European refiners, who had been hit hard by worldwide recession resulting in a fall in demand for oil products. He said that only modest increases in demand for gasoline and middle distillates were likely through to the end of the century. The trend for cutting capacity, he warned, had recently been reversed, despite the excess of capacity in western Europe, and capacity was forecast to increase again by between 2 and 3 per cent by 1995. Mr Berry said new investment would have to be carefully-focused, and urged closer collaboration between industry, government, the academic world and public interest groups in tackling environmental issues. Mr Brandt agreed that total oil product demand in Europe was likely to remain fairly constant in the next ten years, as western economies became less energy-intensive and decreased their reliance on oil. But demand for lighter oil products of higher quality was likely to increase. Speakers also expressed concern about the possible impact of a carbon tax. Mr Saadallah al-Fathi, head of energy studies at the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, said the oil cartel was strongly opposed to European Community proposals for a Dollars 3 a barrel tax, rising to Dollars 10 a barrel. He warned that such a tax would cut Dollars 30bn from Opec's revenues by the end of the decade. 'Why should we develop new supplies if no one is going to buy them? Even if it is only on a European level, the impact will be tremendous on the organisation.' He added that the impact could be multiplied up to five-fold if a tax was adopted by all the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr al-Fathi also forecast that European reliance on Opec oil was likely to increase by the year 2000 to 9.6m barrels a day, from 6.32m b/d in 1990, as other sources declined. This would lift Opec's contribution to European oil demand from 44.5 per cent to 61.5 per cent. Mr Peter Gaffney, senior partner at Gaffney, Cline &amp; Associates, the energy consultants, said the petroleum industry was already heavily taxed, compared with coal and nuclear industries, which were often subsidised. He said on every taxable barrel of North Sea oil and sold for Dollars 20, total tax take by the UK government was Dollars 52 by the time all the oil products reached the consumer - made up of Dollars 17 upstream tax, and Dollars 35 downstream excise and tax on products.</p>

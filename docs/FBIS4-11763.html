			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dawud Talhami, the spokesman of the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine has described the  agreement on Hebron security as a submission to Israel's stands  and terms. The agreement did not tackle the presence of  settlers in Hebron, maintained the Qiryat Arba' settlement, and  has not put an end to settler terrorism, he added. The new  agreement watered down the international protection and confined  it to 160 observers, Talhami said.    The signing of the agreement on the international presence  in  Hebron will allow the resumption of the autonomy negotiations  next Monday [4 April], according to PLO ambassador to Jordan,  al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, who announced that the first units of  the Palestinian force will begin deployment in Gaza and Jericho  the next day and will complete deployment on 13 April. As for  the Israeli forces, they will redeploy in these areas. Our  correspondent Basim Abu- Sumayyah informs us of the general  conditions in the occupied Palestinian territories:    [Begin recording] Israeli military officials have said the  Israeli Army is prepared to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho and  redeploy within 72 hours of receiving orders. [passage omitted]  Former Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah, who is expected to  return to his post shortly, has welcomed the deployment of the  international forces in the town, regarding it as a good step if  the members of this force are capable of providing genuine  protection for the Palestinians. He emphasized the need to  disarm and evacuate the settlers to provide security and  stability for the Palestinians.    On the other hand, supporters of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] have rejected the agreement,  which fails to provide genuine protection for the Palestinian  people. 'Abd-al-'Alim Da'nah said that what is required is an  opportunity for a just peace and not reaching a truce between  the victim and the perpetrator.    Islamic law judge al-Shaykh Tayseer al-Tamimi expressed fear  that the deployment of the international force will help  consecrate the partition of the town which was imposed by the  Israeli forces.

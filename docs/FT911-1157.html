			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Quebec helps small business with stock savings plan QUEBEC is reviving its stock savings plan to help refinance small and medium-sized businesses after the ravages of Canada's long recession. The Quebec Stock Savings Plan was set up in 1979 but came into widespread use only after the 1982-83 recession when banks' prime lending rates touched 20 per cent. Quebec-resident investors could write off the cost of buying new stock issues by Quebec-based companies within certain limits. Between 1983 and 1987, underwriters arranged several hundred new equity issues, bringing scores of smaller businesses public for the first time. The underwriting boom coincided with fast economic recovery throughout North America. Altogether about CDollars 5bn was raised in new equity, and large companies such as Bell Canada and Canadian Pacific could take advantage of the system. Quebec investors went for the honeypot, and Nova Scotia and Alberta adopted similar plans to stimulate their small business sectors. The rules were tightened when the Quebec Liberals returned to power in late 1985. Then, after the October 1987 crash, the QSSP market dried up. The public would not touch stocks again and underwriters could not sell any new equity. Quebec's finance minister, Mr Gerard Levesque, this January was faced with new private sector demands for help in another deep recession. He has chosen to revive the QSSP, put new equity into smaller businesses and also buttress the Montreal Exchange with listings and trading activity. The exchange has almost 20 per cent of Canada's equity trading volume by value. His budget last week raises the 1991-92 deficit nearly 20 per cent to CDollars 3.5bn, but interest rates have fallen and stocks are well up from the 1990 lows and attracting new public interest. This year, the small Quebec investor can deduct half the cost of new QSSP shares issued by Quebec-based companies with total assets of CDollars 1bn to CDollars 2.5bn, with a ceiling of CDollars 2,500 per investor, up from CDollars 1,000. This means that shares of the largest companies are not now eligible. For shares of companies with assets of CDollars 250m to CDollars 1bn, the deduction is 75 per cent of cost and for companies below CDollars 250m assets it is 100 per cent, and in both cases without any dollar cap.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening from the Hotel Danube.  This is a direct relay of the discussion program "Pressclub."  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Health Minister Irena  Belohorska, and Minister of Labor, Social Affairs, and Family  Olga Keltosova are here to report on the results of the 84th  meeting of the Slovak Government today.    As you know, the government today followed an amended  agenda.  Most points were left out of the agenda, and the session  concentrated on the assessment and endorsement of privatization  projects and a statement on the current internal political  situation. We want to concentrate on both. [passage omitted]    What stance has been assumed by the government today on the  current situation, and what solutions can you envisage?    [Meciar] [passage omitted] The Government of the Slovak  Republic therefore proposes that this election period be  shortened by half and that it end by 30 June 1994. It is  submitting a bill of the constitutional law to the Slovak  parliament to this effect. The Slovak Government proceeds from  the proposals made within the movement [Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)], which state that, should the  government reject this date, it would be necessary to rely on  the citizens' decision in a referendum. If there is a delay in  solving this situation, this will have a negative impact on this  state with regard to its position abroad and its internal  economic and social situation. What is being prepared for  tomorrow and for the day after is extremely foolish and  irresponsible. Therefore, the government's stance is that the  crisis should be overcome by the citizens as soon as possible.    [Announcer] Mr. Prime Minister, you held talks today also in  parliamentary, groups where all this has been discussed. Do all  deputies agree that early elections should be held in June?    [Unidentified speaker] The chairman of the Slovak National  Party's parliamentary club, Miroslav Kona, said that early  parliamentary elections would suit them, too, but only in the  fall.    [Meciar] [passage omitted] Can we afford a provisional  government and instability for several months? Who would hold  talks with it, and what important decisions could such a  government make? What would be its time span?    The second problem: A number of economic issues are already  being worked on, such as loans, talks on transport lines, on  commerce and so on. [passage omitted]    Having a provisional government can have a serious impact on  commercial relations. [passage omitted] Everything will come to  a standstill.    Take the visit of Mr. Kozyrev, which was to be of key  importance and which is not going to take place for these  political reasons. This is a great loss for the Slovak Republic,  and not only in the political sense. It will, naturally, be  reflected elsewhere as well. Therefore a delay is not good for  us. [passage omitted]    If the governmental bill is not passed in parliament--and we  shall submit the proposal already at this parliamentary  session--we envisage that petitions will start immediately from  the coming Monday. Should 350,000 citizens sign a petition in  favor of early elections or in favor of changing the ratio of  deputies in parliament or in favor of two other questions,  which, according to our proposal, should be answered in a  referendum, a referendum is necessary. This means that all  citizens will make a decision in a pan-national vote. It is a  new institution, common in Switzerland, still not used in our  country but it is the most democratic one. [passage omitted]    We have been given responsibility by the people; we must  humbly and respectfully go to them and ask whether they continue  to want us and trust us. If they confirm us, we shall continue  to work. If they reject us it is their right which we have to  respect. In any case, however, things must be left to run  freely in this direction and till then the simplest thing is to  leave the government to prepare the elections in a democratic  way because any other change would mean enormous losses.  [passage omitted]    [Unidentified man] I would like to ask about a debate on  two amendments to the law on large-scale privatization. You  have said that you would like to connect it with a vote of  confidence in the government. Is it still true or have you  given up this intention? My second question: There have been  rumors that pressure actions are being prepared, and that coach  trips to Bratislava to support you are being prepared by the  districts. Do you know something about this?    [Meciar] [passage omitted] We are willing, with regard to  this bill, to make some concessions. For example, the finance  minister does not need to be the chairman of the supervisory  council. We will, however, not retreat on the point of the  government having influence on the Presidium of the [National  Property] Fund and being interlined with its personnel because  the proposal of the other side contains some badly thought-out  mechanisms. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified man] You have not answered my question: Will  you consider the vote of confidence in the government if the  privatization bill is not passed?    [Meciar] We have discussed it in the government. Part of the  cabinet was for connecting the two, the majority was against.  This means that the government will not link tomorrow the  privatization bill with the proposal of the vote of confidence  in the government. Should the Slovak parliament pass a law which  is not acceptable by the government, we should return it to  parliament in a constitutional way, through the president.    [Announcer] What about the pressure actions?    [Meciar] This is a novelty to me. If somebody wants to  change some structures, he cannot leave out the citizens because  consequently they have behaved without restraint. We have,  however, not organized it and I know nothing of it.    [Announcer] Is the government prepared, for example, for the  presence of several hundred people in front of parliament  tomorrow who would not behave in a very civilized fashion?    [Meciar] [passage omitted] Why should the government deal  with it if the public order is not in jeopardy? [passage  omitted] Until the citizens violate the public order the  government will not take any measures against them. [passage  omitted]    [Announcer] The president has also given a press conference  today: he asked his constitutional experts for opinion on the  question to be asked in a referendum with regard to  retroactivity. If 350,000 citizens sign a petition in favor of a  referendum he will submit the issue to the constitutional court  before the referendum is called.    [Meciar] [passage omitted] If there are 350,000 signatories,  the president is obliged to call a referendum within 30 days.  [passage omitted] The force of a referendum surpasses that of  the constitutional court. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] The constitution says that a deputy is to carry  out his duty according to his conscience. A referendum on this  issue would be about this basic human right. The constitution  says that there can be no referendum on basic human rights.    [Meciar] [passage omitted] A deputy cannot be free to the  extent that he can act independently of his original programm  and of the party on behalf of which he is elected. [passage  omitted] It is up to the citizens to decide whether they want to  be represented in parliament by Messrs Knazko and company, by  Messrs Cernak and company: if the citizens say that they do not  want them they will be replaced by people who will, on their  behalf, carry out their duties following from their original  programs. It is not possible to have part of a movement tear  itself away, for the intentions which might not be always be  that of common good, and then having them start to destroy the  party which has paid for them to be provided for for quite a  long time by an institution such as parliament. [passage omitted]    [Meciar] According to the Constitution, political parties  are independent of the state, and the state representatives have  no right to interfere in their internal affairs.    If the presidential castle had not been mentioning for  months  that Mr. Kovac or Mr. Moravcik were to be alternative prime  ministers, this crisis did not have to happen. [passage omitted]  Therefore the HZDS has decided: Either it will continue to form  a government--and we are sincerely willing to talk about  coalition--or it will be in opposition and nobody will force  upon it any prime minister. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] We are to discuss here the course of the  government session today. In the afternoon, this session was  closed but we presume that you decided about the further destiny  of Roman Kovac and Moravcik. They told Slovak Television today  that you asked them to leave while Lexa and Hanko said at noon  that they left on their own accord. What was the decision you  made this afternoon?    [Meciar] They went on their own accord. I recommended to  them to resign, but it is not the same thing as dismissing them.  Mr. Kovac said that they were leaving the cabinet session and  they left; it is their business. If somebody has the courage  for a political action, he must be able to face the  consequences. If somebody is preparing a new government, behind  the back of the existing government--and I have spoken to five  people who told me that Mr. Kovac had told them to be ready to  join the government this week and a sixth was being discussed by  somebody else [as heard]--this is an unfair action, to say the  least.    When we asked Mr. Kovac openly whether he acted in this way  he denied it. Mr. Moravcik did the same. When we asked them  whether they were preparing a fraction within the parliamentary  group, they gave their word of honor that they were not. When  we asked them whether they were conducting negotiations with  opposition parties, they claimed not only to me but before the  whole political board of the movement that this was a lie.    This is not an opinion of a minority; this is a political  construction which has grown into a destruction of the  parliamentary group of the HZDS, into almost conspiratorial  talks with other political entities and into the formation of a  new government without being asked to do so by the Movement, or  by the president, or by the legitimate constitutional bodies.    If this is called a normal or alternative activity, we  cannot  approve of it. Therefore we have said that the right thing is  for these gentlemen to leave of their own will. As they do not  want to do so, the government finds it natural that in this case  I have to submit to the president a proposal to have them  recalled because they lost the confidence of the Movement.  [passage omitted]    Now they rely on the positive attitude of the president  towards them. Meciar will propose their dismissal, and the  president will not accept it, they think. The government,  however, does not want to have them in its midst. [passage  omitted]    [Announcer] Does it mean, Mr. Prime Minister, that you are  going to submit a proposal to have them dismissed?    [Meciar] I am going to submit the proposal for their  dismissal tomorrow. I have informed the president about it on  Monday [14 February]; he asked for time to think it over. The  government was unanimous on this. The great majority of the  HZDS presidium has decided that they cannot be trusted in this  office. Then it is up to me to decide on what pretext to keep  them in the government: as representatives of the opposition  which they joined? And of what sort of opposition? On what  basis? This is against democratic principles and this is  another pretext for the creation of a new political problem.    [Announcer] The president has said today that you had  pointed out to you today that the dismissal of the deputy prime  minister and minister Moravcik could have a negative impact on  the international reputation of Slovakia.    [Meciar] I have told the president that this argument cannot  be accepted. What sort of foreign minister announces publicly  that the government of which he forms a part should be  overthrown? Is this a good signal for the world? Is it good  when Mr. Kozyrev is to come, and the government agrees with his  visit and decides which member of the government is to hold  talks with him and in the meantime, somebody else is holding  talks about cancelling this visit? This is working against the  government and its policy.    There have been also many specific objections to the work of  the foreign minister, which the government frequently  criticised. The foreign minister knew about them and also the  president knew about them. [passage omitted]    The president was looking for a pretext to justify what he  told me on Monday, and none of us accepted it. I and my  deputies, with the exception of Mr. Kovac, and Parliamentary  Speaker Mr. Gasparovic held those talks with him. The president  has the right to have his opinion and he has also the right,  according to that unfortunate constitutional court, to say that  he would not accept the dismissals. What will be achieved by  this? There will a minister in the government who will  represent nobody, who will be there against the will of all,  apart from the will of the president. But I am the one who is  responsible for the work of the government. Will I be assessed  on the work of the person who was forced upon me? [passage  omitted]    The world wants us to be stable, instead of having another  source of tension. I would therefore ask the president to solve  the situation speedily to stabilize the situation. [passage  omitted]    [Announcer] The Czech side has obviously been taken by  surprise that the Slovak customs officers have started to ask  for special certificates on the quality of [exported]  foodstuffs. Minister Dlouhy called it unfair; allegedly you had  informed them only 24 hours before the introduction of these  measures, and Prime Minister Klaus allegedly had a telephone  conversation with you yesterday morning and you promised him  that the government would be discussing this problem seriously  at its session today. According to the Czech press, he asked  us to halt these measures prior to the extraordinary session of  the Customs Union. What measures have you adopted?    [Meciar] The government has discussed it. It is not such a  big problem as it seems as these are usual [word indistinct]  norms which must be observed, and everybody who exports food  must submit a certificate that his goods are of the agreed  quality. The only change is that in the past, the quality  certificate was to be submitted to the customs office at the  destination and now it is demanded at the border because at the  destination this had not been done. Naturally it caused  problems for people who had neglected this obligation. Few  lorries--not too many--were stuck on the Czech side and this  created anxiety.    Therefore the government reassessed the situation and asked  Mr. Ducky, as chairman of the Customs Union Council, to convene  an extraordinary session of the Council tomorrow where  everything is to be discussed--not only the quality of goods but  also the balance of payment.

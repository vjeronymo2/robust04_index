			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BLACK EXECUTIVE EYEING YANKEES  </P> <P> J. Bruce Llewellyn, the chairman and chief executive officer of the  Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co., says he is interested in buying the New  York Yankees if George Steinbrenner is forced to sell the team, New York  Newsday reported today.  </P> <P> Llewellyn has previously tried to buy the Seattle Mariners and the Baltimore  Orioles.  </P> <P> If successful in purchasing the Yankees, he would become the first black owner  of a major league baseball club. Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. is the  third-largest black-owned business in the country.  </P> <P> "The Yankees would be a great property, and they have great potential,"  Llewellyn said. "But they've been abused for the last dozen years."  </P> <P> To succeed, Llewellyn would have to overcome a number of obstacles. First of  all, baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent would have to force Steinbrenner to sell  the team as punishment for his dealings with gambler Howard Spira.  </P> <P> Also, Steinbrenner has said that he will not sell, even if he's suspended from  baseball.  </P></p>

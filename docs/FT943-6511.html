			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Personal View: Strict agenda for jobs The current debate on full employment is in danger of starting off with the wrong agenda. Full employment cannot be achieved simply by deregulating the labour market or cutting labour costs. The basic problem has been the level of demand, not the cost of labour. If the demand for products were higher most firms could profitably produce more at the same price and wage levels, either by utilising existing capacity more fully or by installing new - and more efficient  - capacity. To restore full employment the first prerequisite is to reverse the deflationary bias of monetary and fiscal policy, which was the prime cause of the rise in unemployment in the first place. The fall in tax receipts and increase in social security costs during the recession has meant, however, that fiscal policy has become dominated by a desire to reduce borrowing, irrespective of whether further deflation is appropriate. This has now reached the point where it is being widely suggested that the government should cut taxes when recovery is well under way and revenue is higher, rather than during the recession when the economy needed a stimulus. But while higher demand is an essential condition for reducing unemployment, it is not in itself a sufficient remedy. The deflationary fiscal and monetary policies which raised unemployment during the 1980s were adopted to counter inflation. We cannot expect to reverse them without finding alternative means of avoiding inflation. Post-war experience, in the UK and elsewhere, shows that to avoid a wage/price spiral with low levels of unemployment some form of co-ordinated pay bargaining is essential. Only by taking a national, rather than a purely local, view will the common need to avoid inflation be taken into account. Despite the government's optimism about inflation, the increasing fragmentation of wage bargaining in recent years has made a renewal of the wage/price spiral more, rather than less, likely as recovery gets hold. Making pay more sensitive to market conditions may hold down wages when demand is weak, but it makes them more likely to increase rapidly again when recovery takes off. Far from being a means of securing full employment, decentralised and deregulated labour markets make continued mass unemployment the only means of keeping down inflation. The wage/price spiral is, however, only one source of inflation. The other is the danger of running up against shortages of capacity. The prolonged period of heavy unemployment has left us without sufficient capacity to employ the available labour force. The need today is for investment in additional capacity. The experience of the 1980s, however, is bound to make managers cautious, as the recent CBI and Bank of England surveys of target rates of return indicate. A more plentiful supply of equity capital and less reliance on loans and overdrafts could help smaller companies survive any temporary recessions. But with larger companies, it is primarily a case of the UK and other governments being able to demonstrate their determination to follow more expansionary policies. Only the US has as yet shown any signs of moving in this direction. As long as any recovery is likely to be halted in mid-stride for fear of inflation - as talk of higher interest rates suggests - companies will be reluctant to invest in new capacity. If the restoration of full employment is to be more than empty rhetoric, fundamental changes in attitudes are essential, with a greater willingness to adopt co-operative solutions to economic problems. The CBI and the TUC could make a big contribution by ignoring pejorative comments about a 'return to corporatism' and by sitting down together to thrash out an understanding on pay for the private and public sectors. If this is 'politically impossible', then so is full employment. The author is senior bursar of Robinson College, Cambridge.</p>

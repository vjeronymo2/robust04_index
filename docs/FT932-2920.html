			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (11): The telecoms revolution - Outsourcing One of the main tenets of modern management theory is that business organisations operate most effectively when they focus on those core operations where they have special expertise - and buy-in the other services which they require. Services ranging from catering to data processing and even manufacturing are now 'outsourced' by companies and increasingly by government departments on both sides of the Atlantic. Beginning in the 1970s, many companies built their own telecommunications networks for voice or data or a mixture of the two and installed complex private branch exchanges (PBXs). But today many large customers are either asking outsiders to manage their networks, or buying-in the sophisticated telecommunications facilities and network services which they need. Several other factors are also pushing companies towards the outsourcing solution for their telecommunications requirements in the 1990s. Among these are the growing complexity of telecommunications services, the rapid pace of technological change, the increasingly global nature of business, and the liberalisation of telecommunication regimes. Liberalisation is leading to increasing competition between established network operators and a proliferation of service offerings for corporate clients. These range from relatively simple value-added services such as automated facsimile 'exchanges' to complex full outsourcing contracts where a contractor is responsible for providing a wide range of flexible telecommunications services to a customer on a national or international basis in what is generally viewed as a 'partnership' arrangement. Sometimes these outsourcing arrangements will involve the customer transferring assets and staff to the contractor. There are several main categories of bought-in service on offer, although the dividing lines between them are blurred. They include: Centrex, where the features of a conventional company PBX - such as desk-to-desk dialing - are provided by the network operator who partitions off part of the public telephone exchange to act as a customer's office telephone system. The customer then usually pays a regular fixed sum for the exchange equipment used and a variable increment for the calls made, but avoids the need for substantial capital investment. Centrex services have been available in the US since the early 1980s, but have been much slower to develop in Europe. 'Centrex in the US is quite a substantial revenue earner (for the network operators), but in Europe it is only really available in the UK and Sweden,' says Ms Cathy Borrows, an industry analyst with Dataquest. In the UK, Mercury and BT have both begun to offer centrex services. Managed Network Services (MNS), where most or all of the day-to-day running of a corporate voice or data network (Managed Data Network) is undertaken by an outside contractor. These services are offered in the UK by a wide range of companies including the two domestic network operators and international competitors such as AT&amp;T. For example, Mercury offers its Telecommunications Facilities Management Service under which Mercury staff supervise, operate and maintain a corporate network and provide round-the-clock technical support. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), where the features and functionality of a private network based on leased circuits are provided instead on the public telephone network on a national or international basis. At its simplest, a VPN offers businesses a way to link the switchboards on different office sites - even if they are in different countries - without having the expense of installing and running their own private network. VPNs are one of the fastest growth areas in business telecommunications. A recent report by Ovum, the telecommunications consultancy, predicted that VPN 'will revolutionise business communications in the 1990s.' The authors predicted that by 1997 the market for national VPNs in Europe and the US will be worth Dollars 12.5bn for voice and Dollars 1.2bn for data. By the same date they forecast that international VPNs will comprise 21 per cent of telcos' international revenue, amounting to Dollars 2.3bn for voice and Dollars 500m for data. The growing popularity of VPNs reflects the fact that both sides of the communications industry - supplier and customer - stand to gain. 'VPN gives users a better combination of cost and flexibility than any other service, while for the telcos it offers the opportunity to increase market share and reduce networking costs.' From the customer point of view the advantage is not just one of cost, although often there can be substantial savings. One significant advantage offered by a VPN is that it can be reconfigured rapidly to meet the customer's changing requirements. 'Resources can be added to the system very quickly,' says Ms Borrows. Network operators are keen to provide VPN services because they are cheaper to provide than leased lines, they enable network operators to 'capture' the outsourcing revenues of private networks, and they provide a commercial justification for building 'intelligent' network infrastructure. VPNs also offer the chance to increase market share by winning lucrative corporate business and new international business. In the US the three inter-exchange carriers, US Sprint, AT&amp;T and MCI, introduced VPN services for voice in the mid-1980s. Since then, VPNs have become the dominant service offering of the carriers to large corporations and almost all of the top 1,000 companies use the service, as do many smaller organisations. But they are still quite rare in Europe. In Britain, VPN services so far have mainly been aimed at the large national and multinational companies. However, increasing competition between Mercury and BT, particularly for the big business customers, and tariff re-balancing in the late 1980s which changed the economics of private leased circuits in the UK has helped stimulate interest in VPNs. The recession also focused management attention on what Mr David Sexton, customer director for managed network services at Mercury, calls 'sticking to the knitting.' He also suggests that because we are entering a period of 'technology churn' corporate users are more inclined to turn to outside service providers rather than risk investment in rapidly changing technology. 'Customers have been looking very closely at what they want to provide and manage,' he says. 'For some it will remain economic for them to continue to operate their own networks.' But for a substantial proportion he believes Centrex, VPN or full outsourcing will make sense. Both Mercury and BT have invested heavily in recent years in providing both national and global VPN services. Mercury, in conjunction with its parent, Cable &amp; Wireless, and partners such as US Sprint, provides an end-to-end service under the GVPN banner and BT provides a global service called International FeatureNet service which was launched in 1990 and offers on-network connections to the US VPNs and off-network connec tions to a number of other countries. In Britain, BT's VPN service is called FeatureNet 5000. One of its latest customers is Saga, the UK-based international travel and financial services group. Saga's new system includes a VPN and an automatic call distribution (ACD) system providing digital switching technology to handle domestic dial-up calls and most of the voice and data traffic that would normally require dedicated leased lines. Saga can increase or reduce call capacity at two hours' notice, for example to accommodate extra traffic generated by marketing activity. Meanwhile, Mercury is actively pursuing outsourcing business. Early last year it won two big contracts, one from TSB and the other from GEC and, according to Mr Sexton, itis negotiating several others at the moment.</p>

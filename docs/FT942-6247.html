			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / EU verdict on chemical venture expected The European Commission is expected to decide today whether to allow Montedison and Royal Dutch/Shell to create a joint chemicals venture, Montell, in polyethylene and polypropylene. An advisory committee to the Commission had recommended a veto of the Dollars 6.6bn venture last week and Montedison's share price fell almost 9 per cent last Friday on fears that the deal would be abandoned. The shares have since recovered as the companies pointed out they could change details of the proposed deal. A public announcement is expected from the Commission next week, ahead of a June 15 deadline. Yesterday, senior managers from both prospective joint venture partners were in Brussels to present final arguments to the Commission. The Commission will discuss these arguments with its special committtee today. The deal is important to both Montedison, industrial arm of the collapsed Ferruzzi empire, and Anglo-Dutch petrochemicals group Royal Dutch/Shell. In an industry suffering from over capacity in eastern Europe, they are facing cut-price competition from eastern Europe in polypropylene and the Mid-east in polyethylene. The two companies have been careful to stress that their collaboration is over polypropylene technology, not their combined European Union market share which they say would be 24 per cent. Advances in technology are one of the main planks of defence against cut-price commodity imports from eastern Europe. In addition, Montedison's plastics subsidiary Himont has developed a technique for making a type of polyethylene (linear low density polyethylene or LLDPE) which is an improvement over older methods in some respects. Shell has the cash resources and the raw material, ethylene, to accelerate development of Montedison's LLDPE. According to chemicals consultancy Chem Systems, European demand for LLDPE should almost double by 2000, while that for older forms could rise by less than 10 per cent. The application for the venture has been contested by other European manufacturers, led by US-owned Union Carbide, and Belgium's Petrofina. The commission opened an inquiry earlier this year, suspecting that even if limited to a technology joint venture, the combination would prove too powerful. Brussels argued that technology developed by the companies - Spheripol by Montedison and Unipol by Shell and Union Carbide of the US - was used by 70 per cent of the world's polypropylene manufacturers.</p>

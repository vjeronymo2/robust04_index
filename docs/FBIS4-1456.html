			<p>BFN     [Text] We just received a report from one of our  correspondents on the plenary session at the Palais du Peuple  where the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament  [HCR-TP] was supposed to submit a report on its activities since  the expiration of the 19 April deadline. The results were  eagerly awaited by the Zairian people this afternoon. In  accordance with Parliament regulations, the deliberations should  have and could have immediately begun. However, when the  members filled the conference room, and after the bureau was  installed, about 20 members of the Sacred Union of the Radical  Opposition [USOR] moved in to prevent the session from starting  by whistling, booing, chanting and singing.    Up to 1830, the members of the HCR-PT bureau were unable to  utter one word. They could not even announce the points on the  agenda or begin the session. Some HCR-PT members left the room  discouraged but some were there until 1930. The Tele-Zaire team  was prevented from filming because their flashbulbs were broken.  After the bulbs were replaced, the team was able to film some  images which we will show you as soon as possible.</p>

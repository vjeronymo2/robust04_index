			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Irish continue coalition search Further talks are to take place today between Ireland's Fine Gael party, the largest opposition grouping, the Labour party and two smaller opposition parties in an attempt to form a broad coalition and head off an early election. Talks started yesterday amid farcical scenes in the Dail, the Irish parliament, as a special judicial committee failed to win an explanation from the attorney-general, Mr Eoghan Fitzsimons, on the bungled paedophile priest extradition case which precipitated the fall of Mr Albert Reynolds' Fianna-Fail-Labour coalition. If there is no agreement on a fresh coalition in the next few days, Mr Reynolds, as acting prime minister, will have no choice but to seek an early election. Talks on a four-party coalition depend on improving the relationship between Fine Gael's leader, Mr John Bruton, and Labour's Mr Dick Spring, and reconciling differences between the two smaller parties - the right-wing Progressive Democrats and the Democratic Left.</p>

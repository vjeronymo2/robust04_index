			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: ICI suffers downturn in third quarter except regional businesses - fell during the third quarter, according to the results revealed yesterday. And the regional operations' profits remained static at Pounds 1m. Even the theoretically counter-cyclical operations allocated to ICI Bioscience - pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities - suffered a downturn. The pharmaceuticals division endured a 4 per cent fall in sales from Pounds 409m to Pounds 393m, while operating profits also dropped from Pounds 147m to Pounds 146m. Such a result is highly unusual in the pharmaceuticals industry. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said trading was affected by the dollar's weakness and the effects of US generic competition to Tenormin, its best-selling heart drug, whose American patents expired in September last year. Mr Colin Short, finance director, said underlying growth of the pharmaceuticals business was about 3 per cent during the first nine months and about 4 per cent during the last quarter. Tenormin has 54 per cent of the US market, while ICI's generic version of the product commanded 16 per cent, Mr Short said. Tenormin, the world's fifth largest-selling drug last year, was one of the largest US patent expiries in recent years after aggressive targeting by the generics companies. Its sales fell faster than expected. Mr Short said the company was unable to increase prices - a classic strategy to compensate for volume falls when patents expired - because of political hostility to drug price inflation. The generics' rate of penetration was slowing, he added. Tenormin's decline was partly offset by the growth of newer products. Sales of Zestril, a heart drug, increased by 29 per cent to well over Pounds 250m, said Mr Short. Zoladex, a cancer treatment, increased 57 per cent to more than Pounds 100m, while sales of Diprivan, an anaesthetic, grew 28 per cent, to more than Pounds 100m. The pharmaceuticals division benefited from the Pounds 10m disposal of its pre-natal vitamin business. Agrochemical and seed turnover fell from Pounds 243 to Pounds 252m, in what tends to be a slow quarter. The business incurred a loss of Pounds 2m compared with a Pounds 1m profit during the same period last year. Sir Denys said that intense competition in the US herbicide market and concerns about the restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy in Europe contributed to a decline in profitability. Sales of specialities fell from Pounds 311m to Pounds 290m, while profits fell from Pounds 5m to nothing. During the nine months, Sir Denys said benefits from cost reduction programmes in the specialities and materials divisions was offset by reduced volumes and lower prices. In what remains in the new ICI, materials generated turnover of Pounds 419m (Pounds 513m) and a loss of Pounds 27m (Pounds 14m loss). Paints's turnover fell from Pounds 434m to Pounds 394m, while operating profits dropped from Pounds 42m to Pounds 33m. Explosives's revenues sagged from Pounds 141m to Pounds 132m and its trading profits from Pounds 15m to Pounds 9m. The massive industrial chemicals business fell into a loss of Pounds 1m from a Pounds 42m profit during the same period last year. Turnover fell from Pounds 3.07bn to Pounds 2.77bn. Sir Denys said chemicals and polymers continued to suffer falling prices and weak volumes. Tioxide's results for the first nine months remained static compared with last year. Regional business turnover fell from Pounds 315m to Pounds 284m, while profits remained static at Pounds 1m. In the first nine months they made a trading loss of Pounds 18m (Pounds 4m profit).</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Politico-economic bet on Euroconstruction stocks / A look at prospects for the sector As economic recovery across Europe remains limp and equity markets nervous and fragile, the construction sector is attracting politico-economic bets. Typically, governments attempt to boost flagging economies in periods of recession by gearing up infrastructure programmes. The turnround in the industry may not be instantaneous, with several analysts maintaining forecasts of further, albeit slight, slowdowns for 1994. But looking to later this year and early 1995, many of them are positive about better prospects for the sector. In France, housing starts are up by 12.7 per cent in the first two months of this year against the same period last year. Nikko Europe is expecting a bounce of 2 per cent in French construction output this year, after a 2 per cent decline in 1993. Lafarge and Saint-Gobain, the building materials groups, stand out as two of the stronger stocks. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko says that the exposure of Saint-Gobain and Lafarge to the US is becoming less of a concern. 'Saint-Gobain is a very good recovery stock,' he says. 'Its prospects are multifarious with eight or so divisions.' Lafarge, he adds, also had the benefit of having better than expected results for last year, inspiring more confidence over its present and future performance. Spain's construction sector is in bullish mood, having enjoyed a large boost from infrastructure projects, many of which began two years ago. That boost was enhanced by last year's huge increase in public tender awards, which coincided with Spain's general elections. Tenders rose by 80 per cent. The positive sentiment has been seized upon by Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC), which will soon make the largest ever equity placing by a private Spanish company. FCC, one of the top two stocks in the sector, is to place 20 per cent of its shares. The majority will be offered to US and UK institutions in two main tranches. Ms Alexandra Perricone of James Capel believes that FCC, along with Dragados, with which it shares leadership of the industry, has identified that diversification is the key growth area for the sector. 'Urban waste management is one of the expanding areas,' she says, 'and these companies have responded by diversifying more.' Ms Perricone warns, however, that while Spanish construction stocks are enjoying a measure of interest, companies are labouring a little under reduced margins. For the Netherlands, this point is echoed by Mr Marc Slendebrook of Kleinwort Benson, who says that as life is stirring in the industry, 'operating margins are stuck at 2 to 3 per cent in a fairly competitive market'. But he is reasonably upbeat about prospects for stocks in the sector as a significant increase in public spending on construction begins to take effect. Italy, having suffered the triple burden of a cut in the government's public spending, the European recession, and the corruption scandals, saw investment in construction tumble 23 per cent between 1992 and 1994. Hoare Govett, however, is confident that this steep slide will be reversed this year, and that recovery will begin in earnest now that the elections are over. It recently issued a strong buy recommendation for Cogefar, the country's largest private construction company. Although Cogefar is facing full-year figures shortly, likely to record a loss and prove the worst in its history, Hoare Govett predicts a strong recovery next year. The shares have generally outperformed a weak market over the past few months. Germany remains Europe's wild card for the industry, given the country's reunification and the consequent boost for rebuilding projects. In western Germany, business has been lifted by increased activity in residential development, propelled largely by increased tax incentives and the lure of low mortgage rates. James Capel is cautious about Germany, recommending an underweight position with a buy stance only on Dyckerhoff, which has just taken control of Ciments Luxembourgeois from Arbed. On Hochtief, a stock favoured by many analysts following reunification, Capel advocates a sell. Meanwhile, NatWest Securities notes that German construction stocks have tended to outperform in the first quarter of a given year, and wane a little thereafter.</p>

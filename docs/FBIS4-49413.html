			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Beijing has attracted a  steady flow of investment from major trans-national companies  over the past few years, according to the municipal economic  commission.    A commission official said that by the end of 1993 Beijing's  manufacturing industry had launched 40 joint ventures with  trans-national companies, each with an investment of at least 10  million U.S. dollars.    The ventures involve 2.08 billion dollars in total  investment, he added.    Joint ventures have been set up with the Matsushita Company  of Japan, the Chrysler Company of the United States, the Philips  Company of the Netherlands and the ABB Company of Switzerland.    These ventures are all being run at a profit, the official  said.    For example, the Beijing Jeep Company, a joint venture  between the Beijing Motor Vehicle Plant and the Chrysler  Company, has generated four billion yuan in profits and tax  payment since it started operation ten years ago.    The company, the first Sino-foreign joint venture in  Beijing,  has also increased the value of its fixed assets 10 times since  1984.    The Matsushita Company has launched a number of joint  ventures with manufacturers in Beijing, including the  Beijing-Matsushita Color TV Tube Company, the Beijing-Matsushita  Electrical Appliances Company, the Beijing-Matsushita  Electronics Company and the Beijing- Matsushita Control Device  Company.    In addition, the Siemens company of Germany, the Pepsi-Cola  company of the United States and the ABB Company of Switzerland  are expanding their investments in Beijing, the official said.    Gao Zuozhi, director of the commission, said that joint  ventures with a turnover of one billion yuan in 1993 were all  ventures between manufacturers attached to the commission and  overseas businesses.    "This shows that there are bright prospects for  trans-national companies investing in Beijing's manufacturing  industry," he said.    "It alsO indicates that major state-owned enterprises in  Beijing can enter into successful co-operation with  trans-national companies," he added.    He said that in the future Beijing will give priority to the  growth of 12 industries, including automobiles, electronics,  meters and instruments, new chemicals, building materials and  pharmaceuticals.    He pledged more efforts to expanding co-operation with  trans-national companies in order to spur the growth of  Beijing's industry as a whole.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Differences in management style at Tate &amp; Lyle MR NEIL Shaw, who is chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugars and sweeteners group, who is adding 'executive' to his title, and Mr Stephen Brown, chief executive, who yesterday left the group after less than two years following 'differences in management style', writes Maggie Urry. Mr Shaw said he would be easing out of some of his outside interests. Mr Paul Lewis will become deputy chairman as well as finance director. Mr Shaw said he did not expect his role to change. Instead of a single chief executive reporting to him there would be four people. These four, with Mr Shaw and Mr Lewis, will form the group's executive management committee. The four, all in their 40s, are likely to be contenders to succeed Mr Shaw, who is 63. They are: Mr Paul Mirsky, 46, who is joining the board and will add the North American sugar business to his role running the Australian activities. He was described by one analyst as the 'even money favourite', Mr John Walker, 48, also joining the board and becoming managing director of the European sugar business, Mr Stuart Strathdee, 41, not a board member but to become managing director of the international division, Mr Larry Pillard, 45, also not a main board director. He joined the group last year to head the problematic AE Staley corn wet milling business in the US.</p>

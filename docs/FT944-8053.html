			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: GCSE yardstick shows 5% boost - Figures for A-levels reveal 4% improvement / Selective independents continue their dominance For the second year running the Department for Education performance tables of English schools show sharp improvements in GCSE and A-level exams. In the most closely monitored indicators, schools logged a 5.35 per cent improvement in the numbers passing at least five GCSE exams at grade C or better. The performance of pupils taking mainly A-levels in the sixth form improved by 4 per cent. The national average was for 43.3 per cent of a school's pupils to achieve at least five C grades at GCSE, while 85.6 per cent achieved five at the lower grade of G. Candidates for two A-levels or more managed a score of 16.7 Ucas points on average, a 4 per cent improvement from 1993. These figures, following an improvement of 8 per cent in GCSE performance last year, fuelled claims that schools' behaviour had been changed by the tables. The government now seems likely to publish new indicators next year, however. There has been renewed criticism that the tables do not put schools' performance in sufficient context to make sound judgment. That criticism is made on two grounds: that the tables exclude measures of pupils' ability when they started at school, and that they omit social and economic problems in a school's catchment area. The Labour party and Labour-led local authority associations back publication of such measures. They now approve of league tables in principle, although they object to the way the government has chosen to present the information. Independent schools have continued their dominance, accounting for all but four of the top schools in the A-level league and almost three quarters of the 200 judged by their GCSE results. Figures for vocational qualifications taken by 16-year-olds gave support to the government's decision to introduce new, more rigorous General National Vocational Qualifications in schools next year. The national average pass rate in schools which offered vocational qualifications to 16-year-olds was 87.6 per cent. Local authorities, having abandoned their opposition to the tables, said more information rather than less should be published. This was partly because of the continued powerful correlation between social deprivation and poor scores in GCSE exams. As last year the Financial Times has included an indicator of social deprivation to put local authorities' performance into context. This is taken from the Additional Educational Needs index, which until last year was used by the environment department as part of its calculations for distributing grants to councils. This index was calculated using three factors: the proportion of benefit claimants in an area, the proportion of children from single-parent families, and the proportion of immigrants (an indication of the number of children who do not speak English as a first language). It has been discontinued, but local authority associations believe the index as updated last year provides a fair reflection of the social problems faced by different authorities. As happened last year, the authorities with the most additional educational needs had the weakest GCSE results. Southwark in London, bottom for the second year in three, ranked 102nd of the 108 authorities in England which administer secondary schools for social deprivation. All the authorities in the bottom 10 by GCSE performance were in the bottom 20 judged by deprivation. It appears difficult for individual local education authorities to shift more than a few places in the overall tables from year to year. Only 12 authorities moved by more than 10 places compared with last year. The Isles of Scilly's one secondary school has children up to the age of 16 and has negligible truancy. It is top for the third year running and is likely to remain so. The rest of the upper reaches are dominated by outer-London boroughs, whose problems tend to be overstated by the index of additional educational needs, and by counties in the south-east. The Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities, whose members include several of the worst-performing authorities at GCSE, said the government should have included a measure of schools' improvement. It published its own figures, compiled by Keele University, for 75 London schools, mapping their performance since 1990, when the Inner London Education Authority was abolished and control of education was given to the inner London boroughs. This used an index for GCSE performance with the 1990 level taken as 100. On this basis only one school failed to improve since 1990 while five had more than doubled their performance. Ms Sheila Knight, who chairs the association's education committee, said the tables 'can lead to complacency in those schools which are apparently doing well, and demoralisation in those schools which are working desperately hard to improve the results of less able pupils'. She called for a measure of schools' improvement to be included. The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority is expected to publish its proposals for showing the value which schools have added to pupils next week. They are expected to endorse a measure similar to that used by the association. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities, also Labour-controlled, backed publishing more information rather than less, and said the job could be done more cheaply by the authorities themselves.</p>

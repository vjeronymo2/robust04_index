			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DEVICE IS POSSIBLE CLUE TO EARHART'S FATE  </P> <P> The sighting of a makeshift water-collection device on a South Pacific island  could be a clue in the disappearance of U.S. aviator Amelia Earhart during a  1937 globe-circling flight, researchers said.  </P> <P> The World War II-era sighting by a former Coast Guard serviceman was reported  in a letter to Rick Gillespie, executive director of the International Group  for Historic Aircraft Recovery in Wilmington, Del.  </P> <P> "More and more, it looks like we're closing in on learning exactly what  happened," he said recently.  </P> <P> Richard Evans, 64, of Annville, Pa., wrote describing the rainwater collection  apparatus he found while exploring an isolated section of Nikumaroro, about  1,000 miles northeast of Fiji.  </P> <P> Investigators last year found another possible clue to the Earhart  disappearance on the island, a navigator's bookcase that could have come from  Earhart's two-engine Lockheed Electra airplane.  </P> <P> Evans described the water-catching device as a canvas funnel draining into a  5-foot-by-2-foot metal container.  </P> <P> "We didn't build it and the natives didn't build it. If it's Earhart's, who  knows? People are really getting excited about it, though," said Evans, who was  assigned to the now-uninhabited island to help build a Coast Guard navigation  and communications base.  </P> <P> Gillespie said the dimensions of the canvas and container, as described by  Evans, closely match the engine covers and one of the 149-gallon fuel tanks  from Earhart's plane.  </P> <P> It could suggest that Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, survived a  landing there in July, 1937, and waited in vain for rescue, Gillespie said.  Evans said he wrote the letter to Gillespie after reading a news report on the  hunt for Earhart's plane.  </P> <P> "The water-collection structure was on the windward side of the island. The  water's rough and you can't land a boat. But it was a good spot if you were  looking for a rescue plane," said Gillespie.  </P> <P> Researchers theorize that Earhart and Noonan landed on the island's coral reef  flat, but waves and tides carried the plane into the 2,000-foot-deep trench  surrounding the atoll.  </P> <P> The team is scheduled to visit the island next summer and may conduct  deep-water probes for the plane.  </P> <P> "If it's down there, the water is cold enough that it should be well  preserved," Gillespie said.  </P> <P> Earhart's possible route was tracked to the island by two retired military  aviators who used 1930s navigation techniques to plot her likely course.  </P> <P> Tom Willi and Tom Gannon of Ft. Walton Beach, Fla., persuaded the aircraft  recovery group to mount its $250,000 expedition last year.  </P></p>

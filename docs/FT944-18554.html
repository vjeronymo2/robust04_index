			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Markets: The Chinese superlative - Economics Notebook Think of China and you are thinking in superlatives. It is the world's most populous country, with 1.2bn people. Its economy grew at an average annual rate of 9 per cent in the 15 years to 1993. In the past two years alone, it grew by a quarter because of double digit growth in 1992 and 1993. As the chart shows, China attracted well over Dollars 20bn in foreign direct investment last year and, according to the International Monetary Fund, is the largest single recipient of foreign direct investment in the developing world. It was also the biggest single borrower from the World Bank in its past financial year. But when it comes to managing change through economic and financial policy, the Chinese authorities shy away from the big bang approach. A study of the growth of capital markets in China*, produced by an IMF staff team under Morris Goldstein, deputy director of the Fund's research department, has found that the Chinese moved ahead a step at a time. They introduced capital markets on an experimental basis, hoping to learn from experience, and made sure that change came gradually and incrementally. While the development of Chinese capital markets is still in its early stages, the study predicts that their growth 'will rank as one of the important financial events of the 1990s.' The Fund suggests that China's experience could have some lessons for other countries making the difficult transformation from communist state planning to a market economy. More important, the IMF believes China is gaining many advantages from capital market development. More is involved than simply raising finance. China's emerging capital markets are 'best viewed as part of the cutting edge of the reform process,' the Fund says. Securities markets can provide China with a means to absorb international financial techniques and practices. The listing of a company's stock on an exchange helps good corporate governance by creating a system of discipline for companies that is independent of bureaucrats. The development of securities markets can speed deregulation by increasing pressure for de-control in other areas of finance. For example, once savers get used to market-determined yields through equity investment, there will be pressure to boost the rates of return on other assets. The spread of equity in China has been rapid. Although the first recognised stock exchange only opened in Shanghai in December 1990, the IMF reports that the value of equities listed on the Shanghai and Shenzen stock exchanges had reached Dollars 40bn at the end of last year - equivalent in value to the Argentine or Turkish markets. In October last year, a Chinese company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time. More than 4,000 companies are said to have issued unlisted shares that are traded informally in kerb markets in Chinese cities. Equities are only a small part of the China's capital market renaissance, however. The chart shows how new issues of all securities, including bonds, certificates of deposit and shares, have mushroomed in recent years. Issues and issuers have become more varied. Financial futures have been introduced over the past two years. In 1991, the most recent year for which figures are available, issues of bonds by financial institutions and enterprises soared. But the IMF reports that the authorities have followed rather than led this feverish activity. Official approval for the issue of securities by enterprises was only given after many had issued securities on their own initiative. Similarly, securities were traded on the Shanghai and Shenzen stock exchanges long before they were officially opened in 1990 and 1991. It might be thought that the Fund would react with some horror to this state of affairs. But instead, the attitude of the report seems be that 'it may look funny but it works'. The IMF clearly sympathises with recent temporary retrenchments in the process of liberalisation after activity in China's financial markets ran ahead of the authorities' intentions. It even gives qualified approval to the practice of the Chinese authorities of picking which companies will issue shares on regulated exchanges. This looks a funny way to create a market-based economy, but the Fund is willing to tolerate the system so long as the authorities are not motivated by non-economic issues such as the desire to spread listings geographically. Indeed, the Fund's detailed analysis of China's emerging capital markets may tell us as much about the IMF as about China. It shows that the IMF's pin-striped economists can be pragmatists after all.

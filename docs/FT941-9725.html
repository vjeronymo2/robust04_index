			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Motoring: Persecute the real sinners Whatever happened to our sense of proportion? You will be glad to hear that I am not starting another political column. I am appealing for a little rationality and a degree of perspective about the latest shock-horror report on diesel cars, of which more in a moment. For several years experts have agreed about the environmental merits of diesel cars. (No, not just motoring writers but real experts such as Ricardo Consulting Engineers, a world-renowned British automotive industry think-tank and development laboratory). It has pointed out that because diesel cars burn around 30 per cent less fuel than comparable petrol-engined cars in real world conditions, they put less unwanted gases into the atmosphere. No-one disputes the fact that diesels produce less carbon dioxide - alleged to be responsible for global warming - and less poisonous carbon monoxide than a petrol engine without an exhaust catalyser. Of course, all new cars with petrol engines have had to have exhaust catalysers since the beginning of last year. These get rid of the carbon monoxide emissions but do nothing for the carbon dioxide, which is directly related to fuel consumption. And they have to run on unleaded petrol, which contains more benzene than leaded fuel. Benzene is a known carcinogen with no minimum safety level. Some medical opinion believes the inhalation of benzene inside and outside cars could account for childhood leukaemia cases and that leaded petrol, in which there is less benzene, would be a safer fuel. There is no benzene in diesel. Dr Jeremy Vanke, the Royal Automobile Club's environmental manager, has no axe to grind and recently made a strong case for diesel cars. British motorists, he said, would help their finances and the environment by switching to diesel both for long-distance driving and very short trips. Vanke pointed out that on long journeys, diesels reduced pollution by using less fuel. On short runs, the catalyser of a petrol engine that was still warming up did not operate properly. (He could have added that over the years, catalysers also wear out). In these conditions, diesels made far less health-threatening pollutants. (Confirming this, UTAC, a French laboratory, reports that during 2.5 kilometres of urban driving after a cold start, a petrol engine may produce up to 16 times more active pollutants than a diesel). With the diesel car's environmental and economic credentials apparently well established, sales have been soaring. Now QUARG appears to have thrown a spanner in the works. QUARG stands for Quality of Urban Air Review Group, a British government sponsored body which is concerned about emissions of nitrogen oxides and carbon particulates (in other words, smoke) from diesel engines. These have, admittedly, been higher in diesels than in petrol engines. But improved injection technology and the growing use of simple oxidation catalysers on diesel cars is steadily lowering levels of NOx and smoke. According to independent research for the Lucas Automotive equipment group, over the whole life of a car there is little difference in total NOx emissions. As they age, petrol cars put out more, diesels less. And the latest Lucas diesel fuelling system used on the Mercedes C220 virtually eliminates exhaust smoke and particulates in all driving conditions. One could go on because the issues - air pollution and even the private car's place in society - are immensely complicated and increasingly controversial. Instead of seizing upon reports like QUARG's, which seemingly suggests that the growing switch to diesel cars should be halted in its tracks, we should look at the situation in the round. All motor vehicles are mucky and anti-social to some extent. They have debased life in towns and cities and ruined public transport systems that once provided cheap, clean and reliable movement. Pedestrians, picking their way over pavements broken and obstructed by vehicles that have no right to be there, have become an oppressed minority. But there is no going back. In the developed world, our lives are completely dependent upon cars. So, let us try to use them sensibly. I have driven diesel cars from choice for close to 15 years and shall continue to advocate their use. I think the QUARG report will be a nine day wonder. I cannot see why a car burning at least 30 per cent more benzene-rich unleaded petrol than my car does of benzene-free diesel is held (as it is by Professor Roy Harrison, QUARG's chairman) to be preferable in an urban environment. A week or two ago I spoke, in a different context, of Mercedes-Benz being in danger of throwing away the baby with the bathwater through antagonising mature customers by chasing after younger ones. (My thanks to all those readers who told me that in German it was: das kind mit dem bade nicht ausschiffen.) I would say the same of diesel cars, which cause minimal offence through NOx, and smoke only slightly. Instead of saying clamp down on them, let QUARG stimulate action against the real sinners - the clapped-out antique buses and ill-maintained, cowboy-driven lorries which spew out more filth per minute than a modern diesel car does in a month.</p>

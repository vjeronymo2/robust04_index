			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (4): Keyed up for designs - Profile: Graphisoft DON SERRAT, a young but normally hard-headed US investment banker is enthusiastic about Graphisoft, a little Hungarian software company for which Creditanstalt Securities is trying to raise equity finance. Gabor Bojar, Graphisoft's president, has gone from underpaid mathematician at Hungary's Institute of Geophysics to head of a world-beating producer of architectural design software. In 1981 he took advantage of Hungary's early liberalisation of private business to set up Graphisoft and began writing programmes for three-dimensional piping design. 'I discovered that I liked business,' says Mr Bojar. 'No-one had ever indicated that business was fun.' Funding initially came from his wife, a doctor, who subsidised him and his partner with Dollars 100 each a month. Graphisoft's big break came at a trade show in Munich. Apple Computer of the US liked Graphisoft's 3-D design programme, gave the Hungarians Dollars 30,000 and some computers, and pushed the company towards the architectural market. The offspring was ArchiCAD, a user-friendly and powerful tool for architects and builders using Apple Macintosh computers. The programme has won the custom of companies from Disney to Renault. ArchiCAD has expanded to leadership of the segment with a worldwide market share of about 25 per cent. That makes Graphisoft a big fish, albeit in a small pool. Graphisoft's software sales may have grown nearly five times over the past five years but in 1992 they were still only Dollars 6.2m. Still, that is just the start. Graphisoft is poised to diversify from the Apple platform, launch ArchiCAD for Windows and enter the vastly larger market of IBM-compatible machines. The company expects revenues from software sales to grow five times again within three years and that could be a cautious forecast. 'It's like pressing the hyperspace button on a spaceship,' says David Marlatt, general manager for Graphisoft in the US, of the entry into the wider PC software market. 'It's a sure winner, as sure as software can be sure.' Graphisoft has triumphed over adversity. The west's Cocom restrictions prohibited the supply of sophisticated hardware to communist countries. Lack of funds was equally inhibiting. That may have been a blessing in disguise. Eastern European developers had to write software for small computers which could slip through the Cocom fence and which they could afford: then PCs conquered the computing world and Graphisoft followed in their wake. The company's motto is apt: turn obstacles into opportunities. It is hard enough in a PC world dominated by the US for a European software developer to make it, let alone an eastern European one. Yet Mr Bojar's origin has given an edge to his ambition: 'We wanted to prove that from eastern Europe we could beat the Americans.' Graphisoft's origin also gives it an edge on costs: 'I say to programmers that I can pay you more than half as much as in the west; I just expect you to work twice as hard,' says Mr Bojar. Mr Bojar and his colleagues, while technical virtuosos, had no experience of running a business or marketing a product. But that has an upside too. Graphisoft's executives are unfazed by the rapid pace of change in the computer industry. 'New is nothing new for them,' says Mr Marlatt. Graphisoft executives constantly question why things have to be done in the time-honoured way. Western colleagues admit irritation but say the Graphisoft approach can inspire creative solutions. Ignorance can also underpin a naive confidence. David Marlatt says of Graphisoft's entry into the US market: 'They didn't know they couldn't do it.' So they went ahead and did it anyway. Talent and ambition are common enough qualities in Hungary. But Graphisoft has something else which makes it special: good, old-fashioned capitalist virtues. The company has done one thing, but done it well. 'We have a product; we develop what we sell, says Imre Pakozdi, chief operating officer of Graphisoft. 'We avoided the temptation to have a big Mercedes first, revenues afterwards.' Mr Bojar finally bought a Mercedes this spring, after more than a decade in business. The company has no debt beyond a small bank overdraft. The company's manager-owners have skipped dividends and reinvested all profits. Graphisoft's headquarters building is an interior-designed, but modest, villa in a Budapest suburb. 'Everything they've built for themselves and they haven't been greedy along the way,' says an admiring Don Serrat. But, depressingly for Hungary, Graphisoft has inspired few imitators. Craftsmanship and thrift are rare qualities among Hungary's flashy new entrepreneurs, let alone stodgy state enterprise managers. Leave Graphisoft's silicon villa and you return to a different world. Don Serrat says: 'You walk out the door and - boom] - back in Hungary.'</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Funds to consider role over salaries A group of leading institutional investors will meet later this week to consider how to respond to calls from government ministers for shareholders to have a greater say in deciding executive pay packages. The investment committee of the National Association of Pension Funds will meet on Friday to discuss executive pay, Mr Geoff Lindey, the committee chairman said. 'We will be considering whether we should be more involved (in deciding executive pay levels) and if so, how,' he added. Two weeks ago Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said in the Commons that shareholders might be given increased powers to curb excessive pay increases for top company executives. Mr Clarke revealed that the practical issues involved were under examination as the government came under renewed pressure to condemn the rise awarded to the chief executive of British Gas. Some shareholder groups had urged the Cadbury Committee, when it was considering a code of conduct for corporate boards of directors, to allow shareholders final approval over terms of directors' contracts. However, the association did not back that view, saying it would be impossible to persuade senior executives to take key posts if the terms of their contracts could later be vetoed by shareholder groups. Other issues likely to be discussed by the association will be the role of pension benefits in total remuneration.</p>

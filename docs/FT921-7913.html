			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lone bright spot is defence with Pounds 553m DEFENCE CONTINUED to provide the backbone of British Aerospace's operating profits last year in spite of a reduction in military sales. The group's defence activities, regrouped this year into one division, showed trading profits of Pounds 500m, up from Pounds 486m in 1990. Profits before tax and exceptional costs emerged at Pounds 553m (Pounds 504m). Apart from its construction interests - partly defence-related through military infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia - defence was the only sector in the black in 1991. This was despite British government defence spending cutbacks and a tough world market. These combined to reduce BAe's military sales during the year by 8 per cent to Pounds 4.27bn, notwithstanding the rush of extra business during the Gulf conflict. The profit boost came mainly in the first half of the year, with profits of Pounds 281m from defence, including military aircraft, guided weapons and munitions. Exports, principally to Saudi Arabia, made up 70 per cent of defence sales. Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, said he expected contracts under the second phase of Britain's Al Yamamah agreement with Saudi Arabia to be concluded 'in the fairly near future'. The framework agreement for further UK arms exports including more Anglo-German-Italian Tornado fighter-bombers and BAe Hawk jets was signed by the two governments over 3 1/2 years ago. Mr Evans poured cold water on reports that Saudi Arabia might be poised to take a shareholding in BAe. 'It has never been discussed with us. We don't have knowledge of it,' he said. Development of the European Fighter Aircraft with German, Italian and Spanish partners was 'progressing well', he said, predicting that the first two prototypes would be flying soon after mid-year. Mr Evans said he expected a UK government to decide 'very soon' on a close-range air combat missile for the RAF - a decision crucial to the future of the company's guided weapons business.</p>

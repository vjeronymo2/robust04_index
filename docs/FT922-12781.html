			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Leading Article: No soft option for the EBRD MODESTY has not been the hallmark of Mr Jacques Attali's reign as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. For all Mr Attali's high ambitions for the bank, its first year has been at best modestly successful. Yet undaunted by the difficulties it faces in nurturing eastern Europe's private sector, Mr Attali now wants the EBRD to take on the daunting task of restructuring the ex-Soviet union's military-industrial complex. The EBRD has not yet proved it is anything more than an expensive political gesture; but nor have its activities confirmed claims that it would be either a diversion from or an obstacle to reform. Much of the last year has been spent hiring staff and equipping offices. But the EBRD also had some achievements to report to its first annual conference. It has approved about 20 projects, the first within three months of its launch, and committed some Ecu 620m in lending, while sticking to its practice of accepting or rejecting project proposals within 90 days. Yet there has been rather more rejecting than accepting. Disappointingly, the EBRD has so far been able to commit only a small fraction of the limited capital at its disposal, and to dispense even less. It remains constrained by the problem which threatened to plague it from the outset: it was established to fill a niche which does not yet properly exist and for which other private sector institutions may be better suited. Investment catalyst The EBRD was set up to be a catalyst for private sector investment. Its statutes require the majority of its lending to go to the private sector on commercial terms, at market interest rates and only if private sector finance cannot do the job alone. So far there have been few suitable projects, on a large enough scale to interest the EBRD, which meet these criteria. Those that have arisen have been snapped up by private investors. The EBRD, where it has been involved, has tended to be a minority partner with large western multi-nationals, which is not quite what Mr Attali had in mind. It is not that private sector investment opportunities do not exist, given the relatively high levels of education and low real wages in these countries. But they tend to be small-scale, grass roots projects which private banks find too risky. The EBRD was always going to be too remote to fill that gap. Little wonder then that the EBRD's president is trying to wriggle free of the statutes and widen his bank's brief. Already the prohibition on lending to the ex-Soviet republics has gone. Now Mr Attali wants to set up a special restructuring facility which would make 'soft loans'  - that is at below market interest rates  - to finance the conversion of the defence industries to non-military production. Short shrift Predictably, the proposal has received short shrift from the bank's western shareholders, particularly the US. Whether restructuring rather than destroying the defence industries will speed and not impede the transition is in itself debatable. If worthwhile, the World Bank is the only institution with either the capacity or the expertise to assist the process. Such a huge task is well beyond the scope of the Mr Attali's organisation. Indeed, the west, including the EBRD, risks becoming obsessed with trying to stabilise the ex-Soviet republics, which is a huge and long-term undertaking, at the expense of helping the rest of eastern Europe. Mr Attali's considerable skills as a lobbyist, as opposed to a banker, would be better deployed in favour of improving access to western markets for Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, something on which the European Community continues to drag its heels. Before the EBRD can run, it must first learn to walk. It is the only international institution with a specifically eastern European and private sector mission. However limited in scope and difficult, the bank should stick to it. Only when it has developed experience and credibility, and eastern Europe has progressed further towards a market economy, will the bank be able soundly to commit its capital. Until that task is achieved, it should forget about bigger dreams.</p>

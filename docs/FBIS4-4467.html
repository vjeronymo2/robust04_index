			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nanda Utama: Corruption, Collusion and How to </F> Overcome Them]    [Text] Corruption is one of the complex problems which the  government constantly faces. This is understandable because  corruption, manipulation, illegal fees, abuse of office or  whatever you call it, always ends up the same way: the loss of  money that the state uses to fund development.    Ironically, corrupt people are usually educated, have social  status and plenty of power. Given all these advantages, they can  try to protect themselves or at least make their modus operandi  more sophisticated.    Attorney General Singgih, SH [Master of Laws], in a paper  presented by Amran Hamid, SH, a member of his staff, at an  international seminar entitled Urban Crime Trends in Criminal  Policy held some time ago in Yogyakarta, revealed that according  to figures from the Attorney General's office the quantity of  corruption in departments or in nondepartmental government  institutions has actually been declining from year to year.  However, the quality of the corruption has been increasing.    From the 1988-1989 fiscal year to the 1992-1993 fiscal year  the state lost 1,346 trillion rupiahs as a result of various  cases of corruption in Indonesia. In an average year, Operation  Justice was able to recover less than 10 percent of the money  corrupted away from the state. In fact, only 1.28 percent of the  138.2 billion rupiahs that the state lost in corruption in the  1992-1993 fiscal year could be rescued (National News, 3  February 1993).    From these figures we can get an idea of how much money the  state is losing to corruption. It is no exaggeration to say that  corruption is a vicious cancer which has spread throughout the  entire body and has nibbled away at almost every level of social  life from the lowest bureaucrat to the highest.    In this brief analysis, we will try to look at the dominant  factors in corruption and at alternative solutions which might  reduce the amount of future corruption without belittling the  significance of efforts which the government has made up to this  point.    Government Efforts    To overcome the increasing loss of state funds through  corruption, the government has really tried in a number of ways  to "reduce" the amount. This includes Presidential Directive  Number 52 of 1970 concerning the Obligation of State Employees  to List their Assets, opening P.O. Box 5000, creating oversight  institutions, such as the BPK [Financial Control Board], the  BPKP [Development and Financial Oversight Board] and the  Attorney General's office, but the reality is that previous  efforts have still not been very effective in cutting down on  the amount of corruption.    The same is true of the Criminal Corruption Act (UUTPK), Law  Number 3 of 1971, which relates to activities categorized as TPK  [Criminal Corruption]; this can be seen in Article 1 paragraphs  1, b, c of the General Provisions. Just to remind the reader it  would be good for us to look at those provisions.    According to Article 1 of the UUTPK, the following are to be  sentenced for Criminal Corruption:    a. whoever violates the law by taking any action to enrich  himself, another person or group, which directly or indirectly  damages the finances and/or economy of the state, or if the  action either unbeknownst [as published] to him or which he  should think will damage the finances or the economy of the  state.    b. whoever, with the intention of benefitting himself or a  group, misuses the authority, opportunities or means which he  has by virtue of his office or position and which can directly  or indirectly damage the finances or economy of the state.    In addition to enacting strict legal regulations, the  Minister of State for the Reform of the State Apparatus, at that  time Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, also tried to use built-in controls  (WASKAT). But this effort also proved insufficient if we look at  the figures for the loss of government funds again.    It is the practice of collusion or conspiracy between "the  top and the bottom," and also possibly between government  officials and the private sector, which has caused a sharp  increase in losses to the development budget. The pressures of  need, the closeness of relationships, the pleasure taken in  short cuts and in creating mutually beneficial relationships are  indicators of a spurt in corruption.    This is in line with the statement made by the economic  observer Kwik Kian Gie at a one-day session on Increasing the  Role of BEPEKA [Financial Examination Board] in the Era of the  Second PJPT [Long-Term Planning] in Jakarta on 25 January 1994.  He said that if all of the BPK's findings were openly reported  to the DPR [Parliament], as is required by the 1945  Constitution, it is possible that too many respected and highly  placed bureaucrats would be caught and that bureaucratic  stability would be shaken (National News 26 January 1994).    There are many obstacles in the way of authorities trying to  prove collusion between "the high and the low". Efforts to  salvage state losses have often run up against problems of  finding out the facts. When certain figures suspected of  corrupting away billions are checked, they no longer have the  wealth. It turns out that they have transferred their wealth  several times over so that it is no longer officially in their  possession.    Confiscate It    It is really not too hard to find out if someone is being  corrupt if we really want to. All you have to do is look at the  person's monthly salary. For example, if a person makes three  million rupiahs per month, 1.5 million will be used for food,  family needs and other necessities. If the remaining 1.5 million  rupiahs is saved, the savings will amount to 30 million rupiahs  in two years. If he wants to have a fairly good car, he will  have to save for two years. But in fact and people can see this  he has three or four luxury cars. This doesn't even count other  assets such as a house, land, bank deposits, etc.    As was touched on above, in many cases as soon as a corrupt  person suspects that his corruption is about to be discovered,  he tries to transfer his wealth as quickly as possible. In fact,  it is even possible that he will manage by one means or another  to transfer wealth which has already been confiscated to a third  party.    Moreover, if they have not been arrested yet, it is possible  that they will try to move their wealth abroad because the  corrupt know that Article 35 paragraphs 1 and 2 of Law Number 3  of 1971 can be used as an effective weapon in the fight for  keeping the wealth they have gotten from corruption.    According to Article 35 paragraph (1) of Law Number 3 of  1971, "Goods not owned by the person sentenced cannot be seized  if the rights of a third party who has good intentions will be  violated". According to paragraph (2), "If goods to be seized by  a court order also include goods owned by a third party who has  good intentions, within three months of the judgment he can  submit a letter to the court objecting to the seizure of his  goods. The prosecutor will be asked for an explanation but the  explanation of the interested party must also be heard."    Nevertheless, because corrupt people always have so many  tricks, the best option for rescuing state funds is to  confiscate them so as to prevent a transfer to a third party. At  the very least, this option should be chosen as soon as there  are indications that someone is being corrupt.    The Role of Religious Figures    Given the difficulties of overcoming corruption, it would be  interesting to think about the opinion expressed by Sayed  Hussein Alatas in 1986. Alatas said that the role of holy and  charismatic religious figures has been the most important single  factor in taming corruption throughout Asian history, as long as  no other antidote was available.    The government must try to spread the influence of these  religious figures through education and through other  institutions. They must broadcast information about their  opposition to corruption and this must be developed within their  traditional cultures. Efforts of this type should be considered  a force which supplements other ways of fighting against  corruption and it must be made clear that the goal is to achieve  a just and unbiased society.    The facts show that such holy and charismatic figures can  speak directly to the masses using words which are easy to  understand because these words are much more effective than a  dry philosophical speech about justice.    To conclude this short essay, why don't we try apply the  alternatives described above since the corrupt ignore the  regulations. At the very least, it could reduce the financial  loss to the state due to corruption.</p>

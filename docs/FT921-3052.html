			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (8): The scalpels are out - US leaders slash costs to ride the slump THE leading US information technology companies, battered by an unprecedented slump in business over the past two years, have been forced to take drastic cost-cutting action. Now most of them predict a modest recovery in profitability in 1992, after substantially reducing their workforces and other expenses in Europe and at home. Most of the major hardware makers, including the Americans, have either plunged into loss or sustained sharply reduced profits. IBM made a loss of Pounds 124m in the UK last year and reduced its payroll by 2,600. Compaq fell into its first ever loss in the third quarter and laid off 200 at its Scottish factory. Unisys incurred a loss through servicing its debts and cut its European staff by 14 per cent. All of the leading US companies have been forced to slim down, trying to save money on production and distribution while keeping their sales operations intact and protecting their major accounts. Across Europe sales of most types of systems have fallen steeply, both because of the economic recession and because the market is now almost as saturated as in the US. Prices have been depressed by an excess of suppliers and the greater standardisation of products. The US manufacturers which dominate the European market have been troubled by these problems as much as their European rivals. With most of them already making 30 per cent or more of their income in Europe, there is little chance of expanding their European business to make up for slow trading at home. There is no reason to expect any rapid revival in the market. The level of European demand is now mainly determined by Germany, which is still wrestling with the challenges of reunification. Most European countries are beset by political uncertainties and many large IT users are waiting to see what happens before they make any further investment. Suppliers expect little change in the first half of the year with revenue flat or only slightly up over the year as a whole. Although the volume of IT business may recover, with some bright spots in niche sectors, hardware prices are still under severe pressure and revenue will not grow in line with volume. Mr Andreas Earth, Compaq's senior vice-president for Europe, sees no prospect of a return to the old days of 13 per cent profit and says he would regard 8 per cent as acceptable this year. Mr Amit Chaudhuri, senior European research analyst at International Data Corporation, says the IT market has reached a temporary plateau and the investment climate across Europe remains bad, although he adds, 'there is plenty of long-term scope for growth in the European market'. The advent of the Single European Market may help US suppliers to gain sales as well as increase their share of the business. The prospect of the Single Market provided a boost for many IT manufacturers a couple of years ago, as their customers prepared for its arrival with a large capital investment. IT vendors now expect a second phase of growth to follow the lowering of the barriers, as cross-border competition in many industries is becoming much more intense. Mr Dick Nuthall, vice-president of marketing for Unisys in Europe, points out that a big new demand for networking and integration of systems should come from multi-national organisations, especially in the financial services sector. The leading US hardware vendors believe that the Single Market should benefit them to some extent by removing a bias towards locally-based suppliers, particularly for public sector and utilities contracts. Some feel that they have been unfairly discriminated against in the past, although that tendency has been less in recent years. Now the rules are clearer and most US vendors can meet the 50 per cent local content requirement laid down by the European Commission. However, any significant improvement in trading conditions for American organisations in Europe will depend heavily on the outcome of the current round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. Official rules are not the most important reason for the US companies increasing their operations in Europe. They believe their success here against indigenous suppliers is partly due to a policy of moving core research activities as well as manufacturing operations to Europe. Mr Roger Wilson, Hewlett-Packard's European director of communications and public affairs, says the company has steadily built up its research laboratories at Bristol and other European research activities in the past few years. HP's laser printer components factory at Bergamo was set up in 1990 as part of an effort to boost European production. Mr William Bird, NCR's assistant vice-president of product marketing for Europe, says it is simply better to develop locally for local markets. NCR has research and manufacturing sites at Dundee, Augsburg and Utrecht. The Dundee facility is more attuned to developing multi-currency banking systems than any US facility would be, Mr Bird argues. The Single Market is also radically affecting the way IT suppliers do business. Many have been reorganising their distribution operations to take account of faster customs clearance. Compaq and Unisys are both moving from a distribution centre in each country to a single European centre. Unisys believes it will be possible to ship a mainframe anywhere in the continent in three or four days. Several of the leading US suppliers contend that their success in Europe derives from having a more European culture and structure than indigenous companies, which are centred in one country with outposts in the others. They argue that they should therefore be better able to cope with the change to a Single Market. The top US players have adopted notably different strategies for strengthening their European presence. Whereas Digital has sought to grow by acquisition - the Kienzle computer systems division of Mannesmann in 1990 and Philips' information systems division last year - IBM has so far opted for small minority stakes and a number of business partnerships. IBM's recent 5-10 per cent stake in the ailing French government-controlled Bull company will help it enlarge its European customer base while at the same time cutting its development costs. This agreement, and IBM's new relationship with Apple, are intended to address the fundamental problem of cost-cutting, as the industry leader tries to adjust to the much more competitive market. IBM now sits alongside Japan's NEC as a minority shareholder in Bull - a situation which illustrates how Europe has now become a battlefield on which the US and Japan struggle for supremacy.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          TOP 10 US IT COMPANIES IN WESTERN EUROPE                  (M DOLLARS FISCAL 1990)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              REVENUE Company          Europe   World   Europe %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IBM              27,234   69,018   39.5 Digital           5,242   12,942   40.5 Hewlett-Packard   3,534   11,484   30.8 Unisys            3,088   10,111   30.5 NCR (AT&amp;T)        2,212    6,285   35.2 Compaq            1,807    3,598   50.2 Apple             1,545    5,558   27.8 Wang                799    2,461   32.5 Amdahl              756    2,158   35.0 Sun Microsystems    676    2,466   27.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IDC  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

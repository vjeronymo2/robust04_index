			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancur from the Havana Convention </F> Center; from the "Morning Information Review"]    [Text] This morning at 1000, 551 deputies, including Cuban  President Fidel Castro, opened the general assembly of the  National Assembly of the Peoples' Government [ANPP]. The  discussions began with the one single issue on the agenda of  this first special session: cleaning up the country's domestic  finances.    Union delegations from several countries that flew to Havana  to participate in the 1 May International Labor Day celebrations  are present. ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon recalled the wide  and intensive discussion on the main problems of the country's  domestic economy. These discussions took place at each of the  approximately 80,000 so called parliaments in the workplace,  with the participation of 3 million workers and almost 58,000  cooperative farmers at 60,000 general assemblies and thousands  of university students.    [Begin Alarcon recording] The extensive consensus that  clearly rises from those meetings is the will of the  overwhelming majority of Cubans to continue resisting, to  continue struggling to save the fatherland and its revolution.  Within this same framework and in this same spirit we, the  members of this national assembly, must now continue that  process of collective debates and take the needed measures  accordingly. [end recording]    Before studying the document that was distributed among the  deputies, Pedro Ross Leal, general secretary of the Cuban  Workers Federation, took the floor. He told the assembly about  the main issues that surfaced during the workers' discussions.  He said this session is the best way to celebrate 1 May in Cuba  at this specific moment.    The main objective of this parliamentary encounter is to  present the government with specific proposals, to suggest  measures it can gradually implement to try and develop a  systematic economic policy that could clean up the domestic  economy. The proposals and measures are based on company  profitability, work incentives, and preservation of the Cuban  revolution's social achievements.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Le Hoang Quan, party committee secretary of </F> Bien Hoa City in Dong Nai Province; date not given -- recorded]    [Summary] Bien Hoa City is the cultural and economic  center of Dong Nai Province. It is also a major economic  development area of the southeastern region of the country.  With a population of over 400,000 made up by 140,000 Catholics,  30,000 Buddhists, and a number of Cao Daists, the main concern  of the local authorities is to raise the revolutionary vigilance  among the people, while effectively carrying out the party and  state policy toward religions. The authorities should strive to  avoid the situation of the enemy exploiting the extremists  within religions to agitate the public to commit illegal  activities.    To subdue the `peaceful evolution' activities in the  locality, the authorities have to:    - Strengthen educational campaigns to help cadres, members  of  the armed forces, and people of Bien Hoa to realize all  maneuvers that enemy may use in the city.    - The enemy will carry out their scheme in many fields. We  need to consolidate the people's patriotic traditions in  building up more steadfast armed forces that can positively  prevent and break down all sabotage activities.    - Party and state organizations should intensify internal  security task and suppress corruption and ironhandedness.    - Taking advantage of our open door policy, the enemy will  find ways to intrude and cause disorder. Hence, we need to be  careful and flexible while expanding our external relations and  cooperation activities.</p>

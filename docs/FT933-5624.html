			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Observer: On your marks The poor Trabant. Affectionately or otherwise known as the Trabby, it was quickly traded in by east Germans as soon as they could exchange their old marks with the new hard D-Mark. Nobody wanted to be seen spluttering along Unter den Linden with the two-stroke engine. A fast Porsche would do nicely instead. Now it turns out that the Trabby is the most stolen car in Germany. It is true that the locking and security devices in the plastic-carriage Trabby are not what you would call fail-safe. But why should anyone try to steal a Trabby and think they could get away with it by speeding up the autobahn? Cynics have the answer. The Trabby is not an environmentally friendly car. Hence the insurance is set specially high in order to encourage owners to upgrade style and engine. What better way of getting rid of it than by arranging for it to disappear? If not recovered, the owner can claim some DM1,771. Not bad, when you can pick one up second-hand for about DM400 in Berlin.</p>

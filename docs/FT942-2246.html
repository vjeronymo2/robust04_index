			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Infrastructure investments worth Dollars 200bn bypasses poor, report finds The World Bank will report today that Dollars 200bn a year of donor nations' infrastructure investments in the developing world have brought the benefits of water, electricity and transport overwhelmingly to wealthier households and bypassed the poor. 'In developing countries, the poor use kerosene or candles rather than electricity for lighting, they rely on private vendors or public standpipes rather than in-house connections for water supply, and they are infrequently served by sewerage systems,' the bank notes in its annual world development report. In Ivory Coast, the bank found that among the richest 20 per cent of the population, 62 per cent had access to public water supplies, 57 per cent to sewers and 75 per cent to electricity. Among the poorest 20 per cent, only 2 per cent had access to public water, 3 per cent to sewers and 13 per cent to electricity. Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, says that 1bn people in the developing world have no access to clean water and 2bn no access to electricity. Infrastructure investments have often failed to provide needed services, he says, and the emphasis must now move from building more power plants and waterpipes to making sure that existing infrastructure is properly maintained and efficiently operated. 'Basic issues such as efficiency, maintenance and cost recovery have been too often neglected,' he says. The bank found that infrastructure subsidies in Bangladesh were six times as large to the rich as to the poor. Even though the poor usually consume water and use sanitation more than they do electricity or telephone services, the bank found that the richest 20 per cent received 1.3 times as much subsidy for water and sewer services as the poor in Costa Rica, 1.5 times as much in Chile and 2.8 times as much in the Dominican Republic. The report recommends restructuring subsidies so that they reach the poor more effectively: increasing block tariffs, for example, where a particularly low 'lifeline' rate is charged for the first part of consumption, perhaps 25 to 50 litres a person a day in water supply, and higher rates for additional blocks. 'This block tariff links price to volume and it is more efficient at reaching the poor,' the report says. An even more useful approach can be to subsidise access to infrastructure, rather than its price. Heavy initial connection charges are particularly burdensome to the poorest sections of the population, and countries such as Colombia have successfully targeted poorer households with subsidised connection charges for water mains.

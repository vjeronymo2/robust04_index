			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO SECO NUCLEAR PLANT BACK IN ACTION  </P> <P> Rancho Seco nuclear power plant is finally doing what it is supposed to be  doing, producing electricity.  </P> <P> The 913-megawatt plant began transmitting power again at 7 p.m. Friday, 45 days  and $13 million after a generator and pump failure forced the reactor out of  commission. Rancho Seco was closed Jan. 31 after a steam turbine generator sped  out of control and caused an auxiliary feed water pump to over-pressurize a  backup safety system.  </P></p>

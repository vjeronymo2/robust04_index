			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yekaterina Achalova report: "Central Electoral Commission </F> Holds Meeting. Referendum Results in Amur Oblast To Be  Determined One More Time"]    [Text] It became clear after yesterday's meeting of the  Central Electoral Commission that a certain revision of the  December constitutional referendum results in the near future is  inevitable. The meeting, which was chaired by Nikolay Ryabov,  decided to dissolve the district commission in Amur Oblast for  falsifying the referendum protocols.    An investigation has shown that electoral commission  officials in Amur Oblast acted on a large scale. Erasures and  corrections in the "For" and "Against" columns have been found  in 21 protocols, and it has been established for certain that in  11 of them the results of the voting were falsified. Central  Electoral Commission officials refused to tell KOMMERSANT-DAILY  in which columns of the protocols the number of votes was  deliberately increased or reduced. The very fact that it was  passed over in silence, however, tells a lot. Having discussed  the situation in Amur Oblast, the Central Electoral Commission  decided to dissolve the local district commission. A new  commission will be set up in its stead to count once again the  number of votes cast at the referendum.    The Central Electoral Commission meeting also discussed the  judicial practice of considering complaints against  irregularities that occurred in the course of the Federal  Assembly elections. The commission thinks in particular that  the case involving Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's personal seat, which  he won in the Shchelkovskiy district, was "a watershed." It  should be recalled that the district court deemed the elections  to be invalid, but the oblast court revoked the ruling. The  Central Electoral Commission was satisfied with the outcome,  because it alone can declare elections invalid. Having  considered the results of regional elections, which have given  administration officials one-third of regional parliament seats,  the Central Electoral Commission concluded that the separation  of powers is still proceeding poorly in Russia.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia establishes domestic gold market The Russian Government has formally established a domestic gold market through an executive resolution, the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported yesterday. Officials from the State Committee of Precious Metals were caught unaware that gold and silver would soon be freely traded in Russia. A government press officer confirmed the existence of the resolution, but said that it had not yet been distributed to relevant authorities. According to the resolution, the new market will be highly controlled; only a limited number of banks, specially licensed by the central bank, will be permitted to trade a small sliver of Russia's newly minted gold. Most of Russia's freshly produced gold will still be governed by the old state order system and go directly from mining enterprises to the State Committee of Precious Metals for Russia's gold reserve. It was not clear when the new market would open or what kind of quality guarantees would cover the gold bars being traded. Nevertheless, Russian observers saw the plan as a positive step toward establishing 'a civilised market for gold and other precious metals', where none had existed, and 'stimulating foreign investment'. They said they believed the maintenance of a high level of state control was necessary to build up Russia's gold reserves, which have been run down over recent years, to prove the countries credit worthiness to the West. In the newly established market, the licensed banks will act as intermediaries between the real buyers and sellers, from jewellers and industrial buyers to speculators and investors.</p>

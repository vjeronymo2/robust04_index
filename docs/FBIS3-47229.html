"Why do some people in Cambodia always blame it all on  Thailand every time they are defeated on the battlefield by the  Khmer Rouge?" army spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan said at a  press conference. He also criticized western news agencies for  what he described as reports biased against Thailand.    Fresh accusations concerning the Khmer Rouge were  threatening  to sour Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's planned visit to Cambodia  tomorrow.    On Saturday Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom  Sirivut  demanded that Chuan clarify Thailand's stand during his visit.  The following day Cambodian commanders and UN officials  reportedly alleged that the Khmer Rouge launched recent attacks  from inside Thailand.    "The Khmer Rouge being pinned against the ropes is one  thing,  and attacking from Thailand is another," said Phalangkun.    "The Thai army commander in chief has made it clear that the  Thai military is strictly complying with the govemment's policy  of supporting only the legitimate government of Cambodia."    Thailand has never complained internationally about  artillery  shells landing on Thai soil as a result of fighting between  Cambodian troops and the Khmer Rouge, added the army spokesman.    "Since last December, nearly 100 shells caused damage along  the Thai border. Who should be responsible for that? Can Prince  Norodom Sirivut answer that?"    He said the army has invited foreign journalists from two  western news agencies to attend a briefing on Thai policy toward  Cambodia.    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said the government has  recognized and supported the legitimate Cambodian government  since the 1991 Paris accords were signed.    Cambodian officials should be more careful when giving  interviews to foreign journalists, because their reports could  indirectly affect the promising relations between the two  countries.    Prasong said the government wants reconciliation in Cambodia  and he was distressed by allegations by Prince Norodom Sirivut's  demand -- in comments to made to foreign reporters -- that Chuan  again clarify his position.    "If Cambodia cannot settle its internal affairs and bring  about unity, its chances for accelerated development are not  good.    "The Cambodian government's failure to wipe out the Khmer  Rouge rebels has nothing to do with Thailand's involvement.  Cambodia should not try to put the blame on its neighbour," the  foreign minister said.    Prasong said Cambodian military leaders should not claim  that  Khmer Rouge guerrillas have launched attacks from Thai soil. He  said people from both countries sometimes travel across the  border without being properly checked by immigration officials.    "It's too easy to say that Khmer Rouge forces have been  using  Thai soil as a military base. The military would not allow such  activity in Thai territory. The Cambodian government should  back its claims with substantive evidence," he said.    "Relationships between the two countries will be on the  agenda during Prime Minister Chuan's visit to Cambodia beginning  tomorrow."    First Army Region commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo said  the Foreign Ministry and military have always supported the  elected Cambodian government.    He said Cambodia should not rely on foreign press reports,  which sometimes give the wrong impression that Thailand  supported the Khmer Rouge.    "The two countries do not have any serious disagreement. I  think we understand each other very well," Chettha said.    The military is in control along the border and will  continue  efforts to curb weapons smuggling.    Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said Cambodian  leaders should not doubt Thailand's support.    "Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge was a thing of the past  and not applicable to present political circumstances," he said.    He also said economic cooperation will be a top priority at  talks during Chuan's visit.</p>

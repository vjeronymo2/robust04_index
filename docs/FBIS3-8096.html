Wojcik said that if there were a strike staged at a later  date in Wroclaw, the action would be carried out in the most  unconventional manner, "which would cause disruption, especially  to the authorities." Among other things, there will be  disruption in telephone services or cuts in central heating in  municipal offices, as well as in those institutions that provide  services for the government.</p>

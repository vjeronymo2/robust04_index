			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Central bank attacks Shamir on policies ISRAEL'S central bank, in its annual report, has strongly criticised the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, for not generating sustainable growth or jobs for waves of immigrants, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said after delivering the report to Mr Shamir yesterday that priorities must change. Huge state incentives for home building discouraged the private sector from investing in areas of permanent employment. He called for slashing housing, defence and social spending - the three main costs in the budget besides debt servicing - and for reforms to liberalise the state-controlled economy. 'The main three candidates for major cuts are social payments, housing and defence. If we don't bite into one of these, or two of them, or all of them, we simply won't mobilise the amount of money the economy needs today,' Mr Frenkel said. Israel's population has swelled by about 10 per cent with the arrival of 400,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union since 1989. Gross domestic product rose 5.9 per cent in 1991, but about half was generated by a temporary housing boom. Mr Frenkel said the lack of jobs for highly-educated immigrants was a important reason for a sharp fall in new arrivals. Exports fell 2.3 per cent in 1991. Unemployment hit a 20-year high of 10.9 per cent, with the rate 39 per cent among newcomers. Mr Frenkel forecast that GDP in 1992 would rise between 5 and 6 per cent, much less than previously expected. Investment, spurred last year by housing, would dip after soaring 25.8 per cent. 'The investment rate grew very significantly last year. To our regret it will be much more moderate in 1992: 10 per cent which is much lower than the economy needs,' he said. Ahead of the June 23 election, the opposition Labour party, led by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, has seized on rising unemployment in a weakening economy as a reason to oust the ruling Likud party. Mr Rabin has blamed the economic woes on Mr Shamir's building boom in the occupied territories which led the US to turn down a request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in loan guarantees for immigration.</p>

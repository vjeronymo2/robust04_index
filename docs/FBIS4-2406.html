			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (XINHUA) -- A new and large  3,800-container ship, named "Dahe", has made her maiden voyage  for Europe this week.    The service of seven other similar ships and a dozen of  2,500-container ships scheduled for late this year will make the  China Ocean Shipping Group (COSG) own a total of 160,000  containers, ranked among the four biggest ocean fleets in the  world.    The new Japan-built vessel, the fourth generation of  container ship, is 175 meters long and goes at a speed of 25  knots, with a maximum loading of 50,800 tons, or about 3,800  standard containers. Her cruising radius is 19,000 nautical  miles.    According to Li Kelin, president of the COSG container  headquarters, the new container ships are to replace the  existing fifteen 2,000-container ships serving on the  China-Europe route.    Two services have been scheduled to set out from both the  Shanghai and Tianjin ports to Europe by the new ships every  month, and the the cargo delivery time will be reduced by a week  to 24 days.    COSG now has a total of more than 130 container-ships of  various types navigating worldwide.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Maxwell in context The terms of reference of the Mirror Group investigation make it clear that yet another full-blown City scandal is on the horizon. The simple approach would have been to confine the inquiry to the exploits of Mr Maxwell himself. By choosing rather to concentrate on the MGN flotation, the inspectors will also bring on the full cast of bankers, brokers, lawyers and accountants who made it all possible. While the specific grounds for the investigation are not yet clear, three areas suggest themselves. First, the prospectus itself. Did it contain sufficient warning of the threat to the pension fund? It did make clear - if only in the small print - that the fund was controlled and largely managed by Maxwell companies. It also stated that the fund had not been audited for over a year, which presumably covers the advisers against any looting which may have gone on close to the flotation. A further crucial question is whether the balance sheet and profit and loss account presented a true and fair view. Given Mr Maxwell's record, that is perhaps a matter best left to the inspectors. The other two areas concern share price manipulation, not only of Maxwell Communication ahead of the MGN float but also possibly of MGN itself immediately after it. This is a particularly murky area, in which a number of City reputations are at risk. However it all turns out, there is a piquancy in the means of investigation. Up to the last, Mr Maxwell bitterly attacked the system of DTI reporting which led to him being famously damned in 1971. It was, he said, a form of business murder which he was unique in having survived. Yesterday's announcement means the system can now revisit a tireless opponent without fear of contradiction.</p>

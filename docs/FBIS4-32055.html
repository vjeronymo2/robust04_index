			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F> by correspondent Barbara Szczepula; place and date not given]    [Text] [Szczepula] We claim that Poland's membership in  the European Union [EU] will bring advantages not only to Poland  but also to Europe. Is this claim indeed justified?    [Olechowski] The greatest advantage to all will come from a  lasting reconciliation between Poles and Germans, along the  lines of the French-German reconciliation. It will mean the  elimination of a source of potential conflicts at the center of  the European Continent.    The second advantage will stem from the fact that Poland's  accession to the EU will enhance Europe's potential for  competition with other economic centers around the world. This  is because Poland will bring to the EU certain new resources,  such as, for example, the highly qualified but still inexpensive  labor force. This will result in lowering the average production  costs throughout the EU's entire territory and also bringing  down the prices of the goods manufactured there--which, in turn,  will make them more competitive.    Poland's integration into the EU will also enhance the  wealth  of Europe's cultural and civilizational assets. I am referring  here to our particular type of creative sensibility, which is  different from its Mediterranean, English, and German  counterparts. We bring to Europe our own styles and currents in  the literary, musical, and visual arts. In other words, we  simply bring our own identity. This is because we must not view  Europe exclusively in terms of economic achievements and modern  products; after all, it is true that our production record in  these spheres is still comparatively low.    [Szczepula] In your opinion, is the date of Poland's  accession to the EU a distant prospect? We recently saw a  report by a U.S. scientist, Richard Baldwin, who asserts firmly  that we should not entertain any dreams of Poland becoming an EU  member during the next 20-30 years because our country is simply  too poor and its agrarian structure is far too antiquated. On  the other hand, we have been estimating that we might be joining  the EU by the year 2000.    [Olechowski] If the EU membership was restricted  categorically to wealthy countries, neither Greece nor Portugal  nor Spain would have been accepted in the first place--nor, for  that matter, somewhat earlier, would Italy have. I believe that  the most important criterion is that of similarity of the  political and economic situation of the particular aspiring  country and the already existing European Community. That would  entail the requirement for democracy and a market economy.  Well, we know that Poland is moving in these very directions.    What does accession to the EU mean, in fact? It means  opening up our goods and services market, and that is what we  are already doing within the framework of the EU association  agreement; it also means a joint capital market, labor market,  and so on.... If there is one area I am concerned about, it is  Polish agriculture.    Our agriculture is totally incompatible with the Western  agricultural system. It would not be possible today to extend  the European agricultural policy over our own farming system.  In EU countries, some 3-7 percent of the population works in  the agricultural sector, whereas in Poland the corresponding  proportion is 25 percent. Our budget would not withstand an  agrarian policy conducted according to the principles in force  in the Union. In this sphere, we really do need more time.  However, let me remind you that, when Spain was joining the  EEC, its agricultural sector presented the greatest problem,  too. Consequently, a longer period was allowed for adjustment  in the agricultural sector, and somehow or other it managed to  adjust. We will manage, too. In addition, we should remember  that, because of the Maastricht Treaty, the EU not only is an  economic community but also shares a common line in the spheres  of foreign policy, security, and justice and internal affairs.  In these areas, there are no obstacles at all to immediate  integration.    [Szczepula] How do you assess the Polish public's  readiness to accept integration into the EU?    [Olechowski] Polish people are open and ready for  cooperation. The odd instances of xenophobic behavior can be  explained by the present difficult economic situation in our  country and a sense of frustration about the fact that, having  achieved the truly momentous feat of overthrowing communism, we  nevertheless failed to overcome quickly enough the  civilizational recession we are still suffering now. However,  let me repeat that, on the whole, we are open to new  development. Even the popular saying, "A guest in the house  brings God into the house," attests to our attitude. In  addition, we are usually a tolerant people. Please note that  Poland is the only state in this part of Europe that has signed  good-neighbor agreements with all of its neighbors, despite the  fact that we share a very complex historical past with four of  them--namely, Russia, Germany, Lithuania, and Ukraine. This  shows that we are good at arriving at a compromise. In a  community of nations, the ability to give up a proportion of  one's interests in the name of the common good is an extremely  important asset.    [Szczepula] You said recently that the Baltic is now  becoming as important for Europe as the Mediterranean. This  offers a big chance to Poland and, in particular, our littoral  regions.    [Olechowski] This promises to be a fascinating development.  Until recently, the EU was associated exclusively with the  Mediterranean region, but these days the Baltic Sea is becoming  more and more important for Europe. Before long, there will be  four EU countries with a Baltic coast: Germany, Denmark,  Sweden, and Finland. Soon, they will be joined by Poland as  well as Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. This will certainly  create a whole new situation. I believe that we will shortly be  discussing that situation during the approaching forum of the  Baltic States Council.    [Szczepula] Recently, Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski  expressed his concern about the conviction, apparently prevalent  in Poland, that it will be impossible for us to overcome the  crisis without the backing of foreign capital. In his opinion,  the situation is exactly the opposite: It will be Poland's  emergence from the crisis that will attract foreign capital. Do  you agree with this view?    [Olechowski] The thesis that we will not make it without  outside help is incorrect because, with a relatively moderate  influx of capital, we have already begun to emerge from the  crisis. It is true that the eye is attracted more by the healthy  and the rich than the sick and the poor, but, if we are to  increase our wealth, certain conditions must be met. We do need  foreign capital in order to expand our investment. Economists  estimate that we could easily afford 5.8-percent economic growth.    [Szczepula] Beginning on 1 July, the EU will be presided  over by the Germans. As I understand, you classify that  development as advantageous for Polish integration aspirations.  What can we count on with the Germans?    [Olechowski] The Germans favor us not only in their  declarations but also in their actions because they themselves  have an obvious interest in it. Consequently, it is natural  that they should support Poland in its rapprochement with the  EU. As we have already said, this rapprochement need not mean  immediate membership because there is a need for a transition  and adjustment period in the economy. However, the EU itself  can accelerate the process of our conjunction by offering us its  assistance in a more binding declaration. We are especially  interested in hearing the EU member states declare unequivocally  that they want to see Poland become a member of their community.  This would mobilize us to more efforts and, at the same time,  would oblige the EU member states to extend assistance to us in  these efforts.    [Szczepula] As you outlined the main directions and  principles of Poland's foreign policy in your Sejm address, you  said that the one of the most pressing needs is to change the  stereotyped image of Polish people to which foreigners  subscribe. Do you believe that, over the past years, we have  changed so much that these stereotypes are no longer accurate?    [Olechowski] Yes, I believe so. However, the way from  changing a set pattern of behavior to changing people's  stereotyped perception of our behavior is neither simple not  obvious. Let us consider the expression "Polnische Wirtschaft"  ["Polish economy"; used in a derogatory sense]. We might think  that these days the phrase "Polnische Wirtschaft" would begin to  denote an economy that has outstanding results in the field of  market transformation and that recorded the highest growth in  Europe over the course of the past year. But it is not so. The  phrase still carries strong pejorative connotations.  Consequently, we must make an effort to advertise our  achievements more widely and energetically, and to point out how  much we have changed. We must convince Europe that we are  Europeans. We must send it a set of our latest pictures.    [Szczepula] Let us hope that one of these new pictures will  include the Europartenariat conference, which is taking place at  this moment. Thank you for talking to us.</p>

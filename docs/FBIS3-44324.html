The gross agricultural output value is expected to reach 31  billion yuan this year, an increase of 5.8 percent over last  year, and farmers' net income will average 1,142 yuan per  capita, up 16 percent.    The province harvested nine billion kg of grain on two  million ha of farmland, up 105 kg per ha.    Thanks to expansion of the areas under cash crops, Fujian  harvested 1.35 million tons of fruits, 230,000 tons of edible  fungus and 1.8 million tons of aquatic products this year.    The province's 540,000 rural industrial enterprises  generated  a total output value surpassing 100 billion yuan and exported 19  billion yuan-worth of goods this year -- both double last year's  figures.    The governor attributed the good result to the provincial  government's focus on rural development.    According to the governor, the province is striving to make  sure that next year's output of grain, aquatic products, fruit,  meat, poultry, eggs, milk and vegetables will be similar to that  of this year.</p>

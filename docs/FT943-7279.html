			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Observer: Beetling east There seems to be precious little Sprung, let alone Vorsprung, in the German motor industry just at the moment. A rather downbeat Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech was in Paris this week to tell journalists that the second half of the year would see a further drop in orders. Right across western Europe indeed, 1994 sales would be no higher than last year. Less than ideal starting pads for the new Polo range he was unveiling, presumably. But cheer up chaps, there is another new model around the corner. Why, VW is working on an exciting new Skoda. And that's no laughing matter.</p>

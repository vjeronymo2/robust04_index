			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked that we indicate whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 2 weeks specified in &sect;488.310(c) is 2 work or calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks (that is, 10 work days or 14 calendar days). Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter asked that we define ``partial extended survey.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter wondered whether the survey agency would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify facilities that they were going to receive an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are revising &sect;488.310(c) to state that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 2 weeks are computed in calendar days. We are defining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the term ``partial extended survey'' in &sect;488.301  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``Definitions''). The survey agency will not notify a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility when an extended survey will be conducted. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey team will let the facility know at the exit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference when it finds substandard quality of care. Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the finding of substandard quality of care, the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will then know that an extended survey will be conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any time within the next 14 calendar days. In most cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we expect that the survey team will conduct the extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey immediately following the standard survey especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when it would be more cost effective for the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete both the standard and extended survey while on site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than scheduling another visit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.312&blank;Consistency of Survey Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We specifically asked in the preamble of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation for comments or suggestions for enhancing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyor consistency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters support efforts by HCFA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assure consistency of survey results and the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies. However, it was stressed that consistency should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not receive greater emphasis than accuracy and efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increased accuracy of the citation of deficiencies will lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to greater consistency within the survey process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the preamble of the proposed rule, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stressed that surveyors should be trained to ``exercise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency and accuracy.'' We agree that accuracy is as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important as consistency and we are including the term in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the text of the final regulation. Additionally, we believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the recommendations of the studies and analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the regulation should be implemented to enhance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency and be monitored by each HCFA regional office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes are reflected in the final text at &sect;488.312.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

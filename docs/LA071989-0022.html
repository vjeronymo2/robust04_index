			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD;  </P> <P> JOHNNY CASH STILL KNOWS HOW TO REACH JOE'S HEART  </P> <P> As far as much of middle America is concerned, Johnny Cash -- appearing tonight  at Humphrey's on Shelter Island -- ranks right up there on the hero list with  the late John Wayne.  </P> <P> For more than three decades, the legendary country singer with the crumbling  rock of a baritone -- and a face to match -- has consistently managed to find  his way into the heart of the average working-class Joe by singing about  subjects Joe can either relate to or romanticize over.  </P> <P> Among his best are "Folsom Prison Blues," "I Walk the Line," "I Got Stripes,"  "Understand Your Man," "Big River," "Ring of Fire" and "Orange Blossom  Special," the latter a classic "train song" that is said to have inspired Arlo  Guthrie's "City of New Orleans."  </P> <P> Like so many country artists, Cash started out singing rockabilly. In the  middle 1950s, he was part of what has become known as the Million-Dollar  Quartet, an impromptu group of Sun Records label mates including Elvis Presley,  Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins.  </P> <P> Unlike the others, however, Cash soon returned to his country roots and has  since scored almost 130 hits on the Billboard country charts, more than any  other artist except George Jones. He also veered on such album projects as  1964's "Bitter Tears," which bemoans the mistreatment of the American Indian,  and teamed with Bob Dylan at the height of Dylan's anti-Establishment  posturings.  </P> <P> And from Cash's official bio comes the revelation that the Man in Black has  even "fished with Mick Jagger."  </P> <P> Speaking of whom . . .  </P> <P> Just a suburb. Once again, San Diego gets snubbed. The Rolling Stones'  just-announced reunion tour will take them to 31 cities throughout the United  States and Canada. Between now and Sept. 27, the aging English supergroup will  be appearing in virtually every major U. S. city, including New York City, Los  Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Dallas, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh,  Atlanta and New Orleans.  </P> <P> Conspicuously absent from the list is San Diego, despite the Stones having  played to a sold-out crowd at Jack Murphy Stadium on their last tour in 1981. A  call to the Rolling Stones' tour office in New York revealed there's still a  lot of ignorance about our fair burg. A woman who gave her name only as Dawn  said the reason the Stones decided to skip San Diego is really quite simple:  "They're playing Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Yes, but Los Angeles and San Diego are two separate, 120- mile-apart cities.  And big ones at that, respectively ranked second and seventh in terms of U. S.  population.  </P> <P> "Oh," said Dawn.  </P> <P> None of this surprises Ted Edwards, program director for local album-rock radio  station KGB-FM (101.5). "That gives us a rough idea of how San Diego is  perceived by the industry," he said. "Who knows when we'll be rid of the stigma  of being a suburb of Los Angeles?"  </P> <P> Liner notes: Aside from the normal specifications regarding sound, lights,  accommodations, and backstage food, the rider for Rod Stewart's July 28 concert  at the San Diego Sports Arena calls for "a lone bagpiper" to roam through the  crowd before the start of the show. Stewart is partial to Scottish culture. . .  . Traditionally, heavy-metal acts enjoy the biggest concert "walk-up" --  tickets purchased at the door rather than in advance. But, of the 14 acts that  have appeared so far in this year's Concerts by the Bay series at Humphrey's,  the walk-up leader is the most un-metallic, Leo Kottke, who played there last  Friday with fellow acoustic guitarist Michael Hedges. . . .  </P> <P> Local rockabilly-blues trio the Paladins have arrived in England for the final  eight dates in their three-week European tour. They'll be back in town next  week for a July 28 homecoming performance at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana  Beach. . . . Twelve years ago this week, San Diego singer-songwriter Stephen  Bishop's biggest hit reached its highest chart position. "On and On" peaked on  Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 11. . . .  </P> <P> Bob Dylan's upcoming Starlight Bowl concert has been moved back a day to Sept.  6. . . . Tickets go on sale Friday at 3 p.m. for Joe Jackson's Aug. 26  appearance at San Diego State University's Open Air Theater, and Saturday at 10  a.m. for the Aug. 27 Jackson Browne concert, also at the Open Air Theater.  </P></p>

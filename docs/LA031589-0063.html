			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Novelist Kurt Vonnegut and other U.S. writers presented a petition signed by  more than 1,500 writers worldwide urging the U.N. Security Council to protect  Salman Rushdie from a death sentence issued by Iranian leader Ayatollah  Ruhollah Khomeini. Khomeini accuses Rushdie of engaging in blasphemy against  Islam in his book "The Satanic Verses." But it appeared highly unlikely that  the U.N. council would champion Rushdie's cause and antagonize Iran, which has  agreed to U.N.-mediated peace talks after its war with Iraq. In Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia, the issue of whether to support Khomeini's stand was referred to a  committee of the 46-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference despite an  appeal by Iran for "all Muslims to uphold God's judgment in this connection."  </P></p>

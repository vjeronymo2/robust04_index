			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Clearing up tax question Sir, May I help to clear up any uncertainty there may be about the tax treatment of language lessons provided by an employer to an employee (Letters, May 14 and May 18). There is an Inland Revenue extra-statutory concession which can exempt employees and directors from tax on the expenses incurred by employers in providing external training courses. But the training must lead to the acquisition of knowledge of skills which are either necessary for the duties of the employee's current job or directly related to increasing effectiveness in the performance of his or her present or prospective duties. This concession would apply to the majority of training undertaken by employees who are learning languages for business purposes. The full terms of the concession are set out in a free Inland Revenue booklet, IRI, 'Extra-statutory concessions', available from any tax office.

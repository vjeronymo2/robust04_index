			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Conservatives slow to praise central effort TORY candidates are drawing heavily on reserves of determined optimism as the campaign enters its last full week. While looking for a fresh start, there was not much praise for the efforts from Conservative Central Office after the campaign's faltering start and lacklustre continuation. Sir Marcus Fox, a vice-chairman of the party's 1922 backbench committee, acknowledged that people felt Labour had dictated the agenda for the first two weeks. Mr John Bowis, defending a slim majority in Battersea, south London, said that in the first week the impact of the national campaign was 'zilch', though the position improved last week. 'We're fighting a local campaign, the national campaign is entirely outside our control,' was the less-than-enthusiastic message from Mr Tim Devlin, defending a majority of less than 1,000 in Stockton South. Privately, the mood is more outspoken. 'I go out campaigning in the morning, and I have a good time,' says one Tory in a marginal seat. 'I come back in the evening and watch the news and go to bed depressed by the incompetence.' Particular scorn is reserved for the low-key 'Meet John Major' sessions with between 200 and 300 invited supporters. These are seen as wasting the opportunity for a large-scale rally with 'razzmatazz'. But the Tories seem cheered by the impact of Labour's health broadcast. Some said dislike of Labour's tactics had hardened traditional Tory support, and increased the number of volunteers and requests for posters. 'It's done us some good among the elderly C2s in particular,' said one candidate. There were clear signs of relief over the leadership's change of tactics towards positive campaigning signalled over the weekend. 'We've got to turn positive - that's what wins elections,' Mr Jacques Arnold, defending Gravesham, in Kent, commented yesterday. Candidates had different ideas about what the thrust of that positive message should be, though there was some agreement that having found much of the party's core vote holding up, the main effort should now be to win over the floating voters. Mr Bowis said the message should be that lower taxes were the way to stimulate the economy, enabling more to be spent on public services. Mr Arnold said the emphasis should be on 'people power' and the government's education and NHS reforms. Others would like to see the debate turn to Europe, where the Tories could corner the market in Euro-scepticism. Many would like the leadership to concentrate on the impact of Labour's plan for a national minimum wage. 'We must appeal to the nine out of 10 people in jobs,' one Tory pragmatist said.</p>

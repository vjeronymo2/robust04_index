			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N.N. Kondratyeva and A.A. Kondryatyev, </F> candidates of agricultural sciences, Moscow Agriculture Academy  imeni K.A. Timiryazev; UDC 633.111.1''324'':631.526.32]    [Abstract] Zvezda [Star] is the first winter wheat of its  type obtained at the Timiryazev Agriculture Academy by distant  hybridization using graduated crosses F[.sub]1[/]  [Triticum durum (Kharkov 46) x Agropyron  glaucum] x T. aestivum F[.sub]1[/]  (Mironovskaya 808 x Lyutestsens 329). Since 1992, it has been  regionalized in the Moscow Oblast. It is of the variety  lutescens. Its spike is cylindrical and of average length and  compactness. Its glume is oval with weakly pronounced venation.  Its teeth are short and straight, and its grain is oval with a  medium stria. The variety has not yet been studied genetically.  According to unpublished data, it is a hexaploid form. Zvezda is  distinguished by its potentially high productivity. Experiments  performed by researchers at the Timiryazev Agriculture Academy  and state tests have established Zvezda yields of 8.5-8.7 metric  tons/hectare in the Kiev Oblast and Lithuania. In comparative  tests conducted in 1987-1991 in the Moscow Oblast, Zvezda yields  averaged 5.04 metric tons/hectare over the 5-year period as  opposed to an average yield of 4.43 metric tons/hectare for the  standard Zarya wheat. In commercial tests conducted in 1990,  Zvezda again outperformed Zarya (6.16 versus 2.36 metric  tons/hectare). Zvezda's main advantage over standard varieties  is its high (albeit not 100 percent) resistance to damping-off.  Zvezda is also distinguished from standard wheat varieties from  the standpoint of its growth and development rate, which is very  close to that of wheat grass. Under favorable conditions, the  central part of its spike has up to 6-8 caryopses in each  spikelet, which is 35-40 percent higher than in Zarya and  Mironovskaya 808. Given this grain content in each spike, 1,000  grains naturally weigh less than in standard varieties and  amount to 35-37 g. According to data from the All-Russian State  Commission on Agricultural Crop Variety Testing, Zvezda's frost  resistance may be characterized as average. Field observations  in the extreme winters of 1984-85 and 1986-87 indicate that it  possesses higher-than-average frost resistance, however. These  contradictory frost resistance data are due, above all, to the  biological peculiarities of the variety. Tests have shown Zvezda  to be particularly susceptible to diseases when given high doses  of nitrogen fertilizers, especially late in the season.  Herbicides and retardants also appear to reduce Zvezda's  immunity significantly. Its grain possesses good bread-baking  properties. Its gluten quality and a number of other indicators  make it perhaps superior to even Mironovskaya 808. Table 1.</p>

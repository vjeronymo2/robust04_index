			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> GINGRICH'S CORRUPTION ARGUMENT IS SO MUCH MALARKEY  </P> <P> We seem to reserve the accusations of unethical behavior for the simple,  direct, everyday misdeeds. The hand in the till. The body in the wrong bed.  Corruption. Drunkenness. Thou Shalt Not Steal.  </P> <P> We are much slower to discuss, let alone decide, the ethics of governing and  managing. What kind of ethics are behind the decisions to build bombers or  housing? What value judgments can be made about the choice to develop land or  conserve it? How do we decide which governments to back? How do we determine  our Third World friends and enemies?  </P> <P> These are harder and more divisive questions. We prefer to put them in the  utilitarian realm of practical politics, to keep them out of heated atmosphere  in which values are discussed. We risk being accused of naivete for questions  that sound like cliches: How do you make a choice between swords and  plowshares? Yet these are also in the realm of ethics.  </P> <P> I am not suggesting that we turn down the concern over personal ethics,  although at times it can be a distraction, even a cover. I think rather that we  should expand the attention, the circle of light, to a much wider arena. We are  comfortable talking about the ethics of politicians. We should be equally  comfortable discussing the ethics of politics.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> QUARTZ HILL STUNS CANYON, 12-6  </P> <P> The calendar says mid-October.  </P> <P> But a quick glance at the Quartz Hill High football team screaming and hugging  and dancing and just generally going bonkers out on Canyon's field Friday night  showed a playoff-style celebration.  </P> <P> And why not? Let the Rebels yell.  </P> <P> On this night, Quartz Hill made Golden League history by felling league giant  Canyon, 12-6, in a league opener.  </P> <P> The Rebels did it by outhitting the hard-hitting Cowboys. They did it by  executing better than the normally flawless Cowboys. And they did it by making  bigger plays than the traditionally well-prepared Cowboys.  </P> <P> In short, Quartz Hill (4-2) deserved the honor of being the first team to  defeat a Harry Welch-coached team on Canyon's own turf and only the second team  to defeat Canyon in league play in Welch's nine years.  </P> <P> In their wake, the Rebels left some rather stunned Cowboys.  </P> <P> "I'm looking for some hemlock," Welch said, tongue in cheek. "Give me a  cigarette and a mask. But the reason why they won is that they just played  better."  </P> <P> The winning score came on a six-yard pass from Rebel quarterback Jake Haro to  Josh Patterson with just 2 minutes 19 seconds remaining and capped a  seven-minute, 72-yard drive. It was set up on a third-and-seven play-action  pass from Haro to Rob Keller that netted 38 yards to the Cowboy 19 and swung  all momentum to the Rebel sideline.  </P> <P> "To win big games, you gotta gamble some," Quartz Hill Coach John Albee said.  </P> <P> Trailing, 12-6, Canyon (5-1) started a hurry-up drive that moved the Cowboys to  the Rebel 44-yard line with slightly more than a minute left. For a moment, it  appeared as if Canyon might pull off the necessary heroics.  </P> <P> But any heroics were Quartz Hill's. Cornerback David Nelson picked off a Kevin  Bialas bomb intended for Matt Sinnott at the 15-yard line. Bedlam on the Rebel  sideline was starkly contrasted by a glum feeling among Canyon's homecoming  crowd.  </P> <P> "I thought he was gonna beat me, 'cause both my legs were hurt," Nelson said.  "But it was right in my hands and then I dropped it into my legs and closed my  knees."  </P> <P> He also closed out the Cowboys. Canyon had tied the score on a 17-yard  fourth-quarter pass from Bialas to Jason Swan. Matt George missed the  point-after and the score remained tied, 6-6. Quartz Hill then embarked on its  time-consuming and Cowboy-killing drive.  </P> <P> The Canyon loss throws the league race out of whack. Coming into the game,  Welch had said that the loser of this game would have "no chance" of winning  the Golden League championship.  </P> <P> "Yeah, we'll be fighting for second or third," Welch said. "But that's  reality."  </P> <P> Reality also meant that, without injured runners Dave McDivitt and Mark Santos,  Canyon rushed for just 77 yards on the ground. But a rowdy Rebel defense had  much to do with that.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Rebels ran for 186 ground yards (Nelson led with 72) in  controlling the pace for much of the night.  </P></p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Leading Article: City watchdog and the public THE APPOINTMENT of a new chairman to the Securities and Investments Board raises important questions about the role of the UK's chief investment watchdog. Is its main job to protect the public, or to maintain an orderly and prosperous wholesale financial market in the City of London? Can these two tasks be successfully combined within one agency? The SIB's first chairman, Sir Kenneth Berrill, succumbed to a chorus of complaints from the City about heavyweight rule books and excessive bureaucracy, which were seen as a direct threat to London as a competitive international capital market. His successor, Sir David Walker, restructured the regulations into a set of broad principles and a limited body of core rules. As a result, City institutions no longer protest so loudly that the costs of the system are going to drive them out of business. The new chairman, Mr Andrew Large, can be expected to continue this process. An experienced practitioner, he played an important part in shaping a regulatory system which has proved acceptable to international financial firms, and he served as first chairman of the Securities Association, the most important of the self regulatory bodies answerable to the SIB. Irreconcilable needs But the SIB's task is a long way from complete, and its main challenges are in areas where Mr Large - like his predecessor - has no experience. The SIB has yet to show that it can square commercial pressures with investor protection in the crucial area of retail financial services. Throughout his four-year term, Sir David has struggled with investigations into life assurance, goaded at times by the Office of Fair Trading. The SIB has attempted to arrive at a consensus, but the conflict between industry practices and consumer needs has sometimes seemed irreconcilable. Although the main job is to ensure that the public is not swindled, there is a requirement which goes beyond that to protect investors against unscrupulous sales agents and misleading promotions. Recent SIB research showing that well over a fifth of life assurance and pensions policies are cancelled within two years demonstrates how far there is still to go in this respect. Central issues remain to be tackled: about the disclosure of life assurance commissions; about the role of independent financial advisers; about the future of Fimbra, the regulatory organisation responsible for supervising thousands of advisers across the country. Heads will have to be knocked together to provide outcomes that meet the interests of consumers as opposed to those of producers. Broader balance As things stand, industry submissions on controversial topics tend heavily to outgun those from consumer bodies or the public. The SIB has the responsibility to impose its own broader balance over the framework of practitioner-led self regulatory bodies which are responsible for different sections of the investment industry. But in practice this has proved hard to achieve when board members are often working in a political vacuum and without the benefit of a strong and clear tradition as a regulatory agency. Meanwhile, the Financial Services Act, which was passed in 1986 and which empowers the SIB, has failed to prevent a series of financial scandals or to build public esteem for the financial markets and their practitioners. In particular, the looting of the Maxwell pension funds has highlighted weaknesses in the present structures. Different responsibilities for Mr Maxwell's activities were attributable to the Securities and Futures Authority, the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, and even the Department of Trade and Industry. In such circumstances, it seems, a ruthless operator finds it too easy to divide and defraud. A knowledgeable and clear thinking practitioner may be the right person to head the SIB in its existing shape. Whether the present structure can provide the necessary level of consumer protection in the market for retail financial services is another matter.</p>

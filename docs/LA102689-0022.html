			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICANS REMAIN NUTTY OVER FAVORITE PISTACHIOS  </P> <P> Americans have always been fascinated with nuts. Almonds, pecans and walnuts,  macadamia nuts, pine nuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, filberts and peanuts.  </P> <P> One by one they seem to reach a peak in popularity, then become a staple item  while a different one takes the spotlight. Many once relegated to cakes,  candies and tortes are now showing up in new sauces for poultry, game and fish.  </P> <P> Pine nuts and pistachios are two of the latest to be seen in many new recipes.  Neither is new. But the pistachio nut is probably tops as the current favorite,  especially the large variety in the natural color shells that are grown in  California.  </P> <P> Once the product of Assyria and Iran, they're now grown in the United States.  Pistachios are green or ivory, but some Near Eastern varieties are dyed red in  processing to hide blemishes from crude hulling methods.  </P> <P> U.S. importers use a nontoxic, red vegetable dye approved by the Food and Drug  Administration.  </P> <P> Some imported pistachios are also coated with a thin layer of cornstarch and  salt to improve appearance.  </P> <P> Because California nuts are mechanically hulled and dried within 24 hours of  harvesting, they don't need the red coloring.  </P> <P> The pistachio has a characteristically sweet, oily taste that is excellent as a  flavoring for sweets, sauces, cakes and ice cream.  </P> <P> Although pistachio oil is used as a flavoring ingredient, the majority of nuts  in the United States are sold in the shell and eaten out of hand as a snack.  </P> <P> California growers claim their pistachios taste the same as the imported nuts  but are larger, fresher and easier to open, although the question of best  flavor is always debatable among purists and people from Iran.  </P> <P> Under favorable conditions, pistachio trees live and produce for centuries,  producing a heavy crop one year followed by a smaller one the next. In the  Kerman region of Iran, a 700-year-old tree is still standing. The most  important California cultivar is called "Kerman."  </P> <P> The Queen of Sheba was especially fond of pistachio nuts and is said to have  monopolized the limited pistachio output of Assyria. In Syria, pistachio nuts  are an important ingredient at wedding feasts, and following a social call  departing guests often receive a small bag of pistachios as a gesture of  goodwill.  </P> <P> Iran was the top supplier of pistachios to the U.S. market in 1979, with 12  million pounds. After the seizure of the American hostages and the subsequent  cutoff of all Iranian imports, Iranian pistachio imports in 1980 fell to less  than 1 million pounds.  </P> <P> Pistachios vary in size. The Iranian variety has from 18 to 40 nuts per ounce.  California nuts are larger, sometimes as few as 14 per ounce.  </P> <P> Today, about 30 million pounds of in-shell pistachio nuts are consumed annually  in the United States. It is expected to grow to at least 50 million pounds a  year in the next decade.  </P> <P> Pistachios are fine in sauces, pates and stuffings, and Germans and Italians  use the oil in curing pork sausage.  </P> <P> When shopping for nuts, look for freshness. Store both shelled and unshelled  nuts in the refrigerator. For longer storage, seal carefully and freeze. The  nuts will keep well in the freezer for a year or longer and can be used  directly from the package.  </P></p>

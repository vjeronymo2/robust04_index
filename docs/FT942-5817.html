			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers 'lose out' on futures Commodity producers in third world countries are losing out from the roller-coaster ride on the world's futures markets and not seeing much benefit from higher prices, according to Mr Carl Greenidge, deputy secretary general of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries. Mr Greenidge is in London to lobby candidates in the forthcoming European parliamentary elections. 'We hope to press European countries to look more sympathetically at commodity protocols with economic clauses,' he will tell a conference organised to the World Development Movement today. 'The markets that will allow the sort of chaos we've seen over the last five-to-six years are clearly not the sort of markets that will facilitate investment in industry or stable incomes for producers,' he stresses. The WDM, a third-world campaign organisation, has calculated that from a Pounds 1 chocolate bar, a cocoa farmer receives only 8p, whilst the UK Treasury eats up double that amount in taxes. In addition, the movement says that EU tariffs imposed on third world producers discourage them from manufacturing finished products. The Lome Convention, a preferential trading agreement between the European Union and ACP countries is being reviewed this year and Mr Greenidge says there are some clauses that need tightening up. He highlights the problems many African countries experience in repaying debts and calls for better returns for these countries from the basic commodities they sell. 'The unpredictability of the markets makes it impossible for producers to plan ahead in a sensible fashion,' Mr Greenidge emphasises.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Spanish electricity utilities reach agreement to reduce nuclear debt EMPRESA Nacional de Electricidad and Iberdrola, two Spanish electricity utilities, have reached agreement to collaborate, involving steps to reduce the costs of their debts in the nuclear sector, Reuter reports from Madrid. 'The two chairmen have agreed to take measures to guarantee financial stability in the sector,' a statement said. It said the agreement involved proposals to reduce the nuclear debt burden and to study exchanges of assets to rationalise the energy market. The two companies also agreed to collaborate in nuclear power management, research and development, primary energy and marketing. Mr Inigo de Oriola, Iberdrola chairman, said last week the two companies had agreed to transfer their nuclear assets to a new company. The government imposed a moratorium on new nuclear construction in 1984, leaving companies with large debts and unfinished projects. Under the proposal, the transfer of nuclear assets to a new company would reduce their financial costs considerably. He said Iberdrola's financial debt could be reduced by Pta530bn (Dollars 4.7bn) from the present Pta1,700bn as a result. Mr Oriola also said that Iberdrola and Endesa would exchange other assets, mainly allowing Endesa to consolidate its presence in Catalonia. Banco Exterior de Espana, the Spanish commercial bank, has won approval to open a subsidiary in Morocco, which would be the first wholly-owned foreign bank in the North African country since independence, Mark Nicholson adds. The bank, Banco Exterior Maroc, would be capitalised at Dollars 11m and based in Casablanca, BEE executives said.</p>

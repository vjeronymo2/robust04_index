			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (17): Chaos of the modernisation drive - Emerging destinations / Vietnam The fun starts on the way in from the airport. Speeding along in a Toyota taxi, the four-lane highway to the centre of Hanoi that was completed earlier this year looks impressive - until the car screeches to a halt at a junction with no traffic lights, where a farmer is endeavouring to cross accompanied by a gaggle of geese. Such an episode is typical of the chaotic way Vietnam is running headlong for high-tech 20th century modernism and can make business travel there both frustrating and extremely entertaining. In the hotel, you may have a new Japanese television set in your room, complete with remote control, only to find that the establishment has not bought itself a satellite dish and the only programme available on all 20 channels is a Vietnamese soap opera, seen through constant grey electronic haze. However, with investment pouring into the country - foreign pledges for projects in Vietnam recently hit the Dollars 10bn mark, according to the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment - it is clear that business travellers are not being put off by such details. Every flight into Vietnam is packed with foreign executives eager to strike a deal. The creaking infrastructure is sometimes unable to cope. Flights between Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), the commercial capital, and centres such as Hong Kong or Bangkok are often overbooked. Power cuts make using computers a trying affair and the roads are in a pitiful state. Finding a hotel can be a problem, too. Ho Chi Minh City has a good choice of accommodation. Older establishments such as the Continental, Majestic and the Rex will suit those looking for charm and history. The more expensive Omni Saigon, the Saigon Floating Hotel and the Century Saigon provide modern international facilities. In Hanoi, however, the existing accommodation can barely keep up with the rush. The Metropole remains the only western standard hotel and as a result is constantly fully booked. While the mini-hotels springing up all over the city are easing the situation, finding somewhere to stay in the capital can be difficult, so book well in advance. But the Vietnamese are no slouches when it comes to accommodating this influx of business travellers. In the two main cities, taxis can now be called by phone and a variety of consultants and agencies will make travel arrangements and extend visas. Most hotels are busily installing IDD phone and fax lines while in Hanoi the Little Italian restaurant will take telephone orders and even deliver its pizzas to your door. The cyclos - bicycle taxis - have also started to smarten up their act by adding to their vehicles hoods, as protection against the frequent monsoon rainstorms, and cushions. A powerful incentive behind the creation of these services is the dual pricing system, a particularly frustrating element of travel in the country. The system - whereby foreigners are charged substantially more than the local population - operates on both an official and an unofficial level. The government-imposed pricing system ensures that a foreigner pays, for example, Dollars 300 for a return flight to Ho Chi Minh City while a Vietnamese pays Dollars 118 for the same journey. Foreign residents pay higher prices for their electricity and phone bills, too. On the unofficial market, prices can usually be knocked down by about half. Nevertheless, while a cyclo driver can be persuaded to drop his charge considerably, he will never go below a certain price - about Dollars 1 a kilometre (25 cents for Vietnamese). Such frustrations aside, linguists will find the country a delight. The Vietnamese speak a wide range of languages, many of them acquired during periods spent working or studying in China, Cuba or countries of the former Soviet Union. Thus, it is not unusual, for example, to find a Vietnamese who speaks fluent Romanian. Fortunately for those whose Romanian is a little rusty, English is rapidly becoming the most popular foreign language spoken in the country, with French as the runner-up. Foreign investment is increasing the comfort for the business traveller. Cathay Pacific's involvement on the Hong Kong-Hanoi flight, for example, has helped well-trained air hostesses dish out meals that almost resemble something served on British Airways or Lufthansa - a far cry from the dog-eared cardboard box containing shrivelled vegetables in vinegar and a stale bun that used to be the norm on Vietnamese flights a few years ago. Over recent years several foreign firms have been working with the Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications, which runs Vietnam's communications, to upgrade the country's internal and overseas telecommunications. While national phone lines remain unreliable, it is claimed that international direct dialing now reaches 214 countries with efficiency. However, this comes at a price. Vietnam is one of the most expensive countries in the world for IDD calls. Credit cards, unheard of a couple of years ago, are being accepted in more and more places. It is also possible to draw cash from certain banks, such as the ANZ Bank in Hanoi, using a credit card. The easiest method of payment up to now, has been with dollars in cash. Dollars have been interchangeable with dong, the local currency for most transactions, and government economists estimate Dollars 600m is circulating in notes within the country. However, a new foreign exchange regime introduced at the beginning of this month is set to change all this. The new rules mean businesses must channel their hard currency earnings through bank accounts. Everyday transactions must be carried out in dong, although it is uncertain how effectively this rule will be enforced. Airlines, insurance, shipping and telecommunications firms may continue to charge in dollars, but the full consequences of this move remain to be seen.

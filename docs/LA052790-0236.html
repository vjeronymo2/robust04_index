			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SMITH TRIES TO ADD PUNCH TO HEAT ATTACK  </P> <P> Brad Smith, unshaven and wearing a wrinkled T-shirt and shorts, walked into the  newspaper office for an interview in a daze.  </P> <P> Ten days ago the blond, blue-eyed Culver City native had finished playing his  sixth soccer season in Germany, where he obtained all-star status. But a snap  decision brought him back to the United States, and earlier this week he signed  to play with the L.A. Heat of the American Professional Soccer League West.  </P> <P> The APSL West is trying to attract more spectators by rewarding teams in the  standings with extra points based on the number of goals scored. Having  struggled with an ineffective front line, the Heat is touting Smith, an  all-Southern Section selection at Culver City High in 1983, as its offensive  savior.  </P> <P> "I hope he gives us the ability to score more goals," General Manager Jill  Fracisco said. "We want him to fit in with the players and put the ball in the  net, which we desperately need."  </P> <P> Smith, with a wealth of experience behind him, arrived for the interview not  really clear what to expect.  </P> <P> "In Germany, the fans and the press, they make or break you. I knew a coach  that lost back-to-back games at home and he was out like this," he said,  snapping his fingers.  </P> <P> Fracisco couldn't just snap her fingers to help the Heat out of its scoring  doldrums, so she and a coalition of the team's owners have put their hopes on  Smith, whose sudden return to the United States might not be without some  pitfalls. Smith reportedly got a lucrative contract by APSL standards. The Heat  routinely refuses to say what it pays players, but, according to forward Bobby  Bruch, who doubles as director of community affairs: "Everyone has been saying  we needed another forward. Now that we got him, he better produce."  </P> <P> Going into Saturday night's game at San Diego, the fourth-place Heat (2-2) had  scored only seven goals, five less than the league-leading Nomads. Yet Smith  has been so inundated by the rapid changes in his life that he has had little  time to feel pressure. He's been living out of boxes at his mother-in-law's  Culver City home. He arises each morning at 6 and wonders if it is lunchtime.  His English, corrupted by a half-dozen years of speaking German, is slow, yet  diligent.  </P> <P> "But there's no place like Southern California and this is where I wanted to be  with my family," he said.  </P> <P> Later, over an American meal of hamburgers, french fries and onion rings, the  kid who was better known in Culver City as a football star demonstrated a keen  knowledge about futbol.  </P> <P> "Soccer is a lifestyle in Europe," he said. "Training two days a week (like  here) is unheard of in Germany and when you train, it's all serious."  </P> <P> Smith feels he can help the Heat, but said: "I'm not here to change the team. I  need to learn the team's system. I'll score my goals and set up more than I  score, but I really want to get to know the guys on the team."  </P> <P> There are things Smith said he needed to catch up on. He returned to the United  States only twice for short stays since going to Germany in January of 1984.  </P> <P> "This is like starting over," he said.  </P> <P> From his first few workouts with the Heat, he has determined that the level of  soccer in the United States has improved.  </P> <P> "It's not quite the level that I saw in Germany in the past five years, but it  is (competitive)."  </P> <P> He was most surprised to learn about the APSL scoring system, which can be  confusing. The league awards six points to each team for a victory, four points  if a game is won by penalty kicks, two points for a loss by penalty kicks and  one point for each goal scored in regulation up to a maximum of three.  </P> <P> The system is supposed to stimulate more offense, but it has confused a lot of  Americans, who are not accustomed to seeing teams with losing records in first  place, based on points, as was the case earlier when San Diego topped the  Southern Division at 2-4.  </P> <P> In addition, there are no tie games. The league utilizes two, 10-minute  overtime periods followed by penalty kicks to decide a match. And, to save on  travel expenses, road games are usually played back-to-back, a practice foreign  to Europe because the game style is more physical there.  </P> <P> Internationally, ties are an integral part of the game, Smith said. And in  Germany, soccer "is very business-like."  </P> <P> "German people expect double from you, particularly if you are a foreign  player," he said. "You have to prove yourself."  </P> <P> Smith apparently did. In less than a year in Germany, his contract was  purchased by a Third Division team from the amateur club he originally signed  to play with. He played for three other Third Division teams, including two  that went into postseason play. (Germany has three levels of professional  soccer, yet a good showing by a lower division team allows it to challenge for  a position in a higher division.)  </P> <P> In 1987 Smith was voted to the Oberliga Select Team, a German all-star team,  which represented the country against other world-class teams in international  matches. At the time he returned to the United States, Smith was negotiating  with a pair of Division II teams. He stood to greatly increase his salary of  about $1,500 a game, plus bonuses, but both teams wanted him to become a German  citizen to avoid the country's two foreigner per team rule. Smith, who has an  American wife and a 3-year-old son who was born in Germany, made a sudden  decision to move back to the United States.  </P> <P> "It was either another six years in Germany or move back here," he said. "I  wanted to settle down with my family."  </P> <P> At Culver, Smith drew headlines for his accomplishments as a running back on  the football team, not for his play on the soccer field. In his finest  performance, he rushed for 217 yards and two touchdowns, kicked field goals of  22 and 41 yards and added three point-after-touchdown kicks to lead the  Centaurs to a 27-14 title-clinching victory over rival Beverly Hills in the  final game of the 1982 season. Newspaper accounts called the game one of the  best ever played in the Ocean League. Smith was named The Times Westside back  of the year.  </P> <P> But his heart was with soccer, partly because of his size. At a photo session  held by the Times for its annual all-star team, the 5-foot-9, 170-pound Smith  realized he didn't have a future in the NFL.  </P> <P> "I was standing next to this guy, and we were waiting to have our photos  taken," he said. "He was 6-foot-9, 270-pounds. I reached up, shook his hand,  and felt really small."  </P> <P> He played indoor speed soccer in Orange County after high school, where he was  befriended by members of a German amateur team touring Southern California.  Smith, who preferred to play outdoors, was invited to play in Germany.  </P> <P> This spring, UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid, on a trip to Europe, advised Smith that he  might be able to get a job with an APSL team, a new professional soccer league  that hoped to become the recognized professional league of the United States,  as required by FIFA, the world governing body of soccer. The country must have  a professional league in force by 1992, or risk losing its bid to host the  World Cup in 1994. The United States Soccer Federation has yet to certify the  APSL as its professional league, but Smith was encouraged to hear that  professional soccer was on the rise.  </P> <P> Mutual friends, including former Culver City teammate Danny Pena, a defender  with the Heat, persuaded Smith to sign with the Heat.  </P> <P> Smith said that playing soccer for a living has become "routine. It's like  instinct to me." European teams play 11 months a year and the pace of each game  is "about three to four times faster than it is here."  </P> <P> The German season includes more than 40 games, plus playoffs. The Heat will  play about half that many. "It's sad that I can't come to the United States and  play in a full professional outdoor league like I am used to," Smith said.  </P> <P> But he is happy to be home, just the same.  </P></p>

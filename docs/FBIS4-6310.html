			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman  of the Federation of Economic Organizations, Wednesday [20  April] welcomed the prospect of Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  becoming Japan's new prime minister, saying he could provide  stable leadership.    "Agreement has almost been reached on the principal  policies.  The new government will probably have more stability," Hiraiwa  said.    The business leader said it is "not a bad thing" that the  new  government is taking time to form. "The coalition parties are  trying to bring their views together. This implies that a firm  framework will be established," Hiraiwa said.    Some differences in opinion may appear, however, when  important policies are actually put into effect, he warned.    Commenting on fledgling signs of economic pickup, Hiraiwa  noted that although consumer spending is improving, businesses  are still taking time to recover. "But I don't think the  economy will be like last year," he said, pointing to the lack  of economic comeback in 1993.    He said the appreciation of the yen against the dollar will  be central to judging corporate performance in the future.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ TAYLOR'S DOCTORS WON'T BE CHARGED  </P> <P> Elizabeth Taylor's doctors prescribed potentially life-threatening doses of  painkillers to the actress, but their conduct does not warrant criminal  charges, the district attorney's office said today.  </P> <P> However, the office will refer the allegations against the physicians --  William Skinner, Michael Gottlieb and Michael Roth -- to the state medical  board for possible administrative sanctions.  </P> <P> Skinner, identified by investigators as Taylor's primary physician, is medical  director of the chemical dependency center at St. John's Hospital and Health  Center in Santa Monica. Gottlieb is the immunologist who reported the first  AIDS case in the United States. Roth is a former partner of Gottlieb's.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said the physicians displayed poor judgment in prescribing the  massive amounts of drugs to Taylor, who they said was exposed to the  possibility of a fatal overdose. However, the doctors had no criminal intent in  prescribing the narcotics, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Taylor, 58, an Academy Award-winning actress who has frequently admitted her  dependence on pills and alcohol, was not a subject of the 1 1/2-year  investigation and did not face any charges. She was interviewed by  investigators as part of the probe.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Taylor remained in stable condition at St. John's Hospital and  Health Center in Santa Monica, suffering from pneumonia, Taylor spokeswoman  Lisa Del Favaro said. In a statement earlier this week, she denied rumors that  she is suffering from AIDS.  </P> <P> The actress' current illness is not believed to be linked to the earlier  prescriptions.  </P> <P> The physicians were investigated for allegedly prescribing massive amounts of  "Schedule Two" drugs, which include opiates, barbiturates and stimulants, to  Taylor in 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> Taylor in the past has talked openly of her dependence on such drugs as Demerol  and Valium, plus alcohol.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Feldstern said in a written report released today  that Taylor "has suffered from substance abuse for many years, principally  involving pain medication and alcohol," stemming partly from chronic lower back  pain she has suffered since 1957.  </P> <P> "In view of their entire record, it is clear that the prescribing practices of  these physicians fell below the accepted standard of medical practice,"  Feldstern said in his report.  </P></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Letter: True energy efficiency stymied by motor car Sir, Bronwen Maddox reports on the slow progress of the Energy Efficiency Office in setting up the Energy Trust ('Energy Trust slow to gain speed', Business and the Environment, September 23) on the same day that you print a letter from the Economics Editor (Europe) of the Mainichi Newspapers ('Withdrawal from ERM stylish and result unwittingly good, but resignations an issue'). That letter lectures Britain on the virtues of economic efficiency, and contains the quite extraordinarily unimaginative statement: 'If there is no car, the fuel is no good.' There are, of course, many better uses for fuel than using it, with monstrous energy inefficiency, in the motor car. Pumping fuel into motor cars to accelerate the engine of economic development is simply one of the methods whereby the underlying global energy economy tests the monetary economy to breakdown point. In the global energy economy, the laws and limits governing supplies and the efficiency of consumption are more or less fixed and known. Anchoring the system of economic management to those reliable known factors promises a less dangerous ride than trying to anchor it to a currency which is subject to change by German bankers and sundry speculators. It is hardly surprising that the Energy Efficiency Office is having such a job to find an Energy Trust chairman to talk eyeball to eyeball with other 'high-status persons' about improving energy efficiency and evaluation. The system remains locked to the grossly energy-inefficient motor car as its status symbol, and any genuinely energy efficient person must accordingly remain an outsider: an oddball.

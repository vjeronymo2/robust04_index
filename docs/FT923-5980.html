			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Observer: Office romance It's official. Derek Bonham, Hanson's newly promoted group chief executive, has tied the knot with the company's former head of US investor relations, Ms Karen Levy. And how do we know? Under UK disclosure requirements, Ms Levy's Hanson shares and options are now lumped together with Bonham's, and so Topic had to carry the announcement. Hanson's share price may have fallen recently but Bonham's 29,000 extra shares should more than cover next week's secret honeymoon.</p>

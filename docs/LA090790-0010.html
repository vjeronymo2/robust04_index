			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO CITY WORKERS STUDY OPTIONS AS TALKS STALL  </P> <P> Members of the San Fernando city employees' union will consider actions ranging  from a work slowdown to a strike in protest against the city over wages and  benefits.  </P> <P> The council on Tuesday rejected a two-year contract offer from the union as  well as a counteroffer made by city negotiators. Instead, the council voted to  implement a one-year salary and benefit package that gives union members 3.7%  more than the city paid last year. The city had proposed a 13.4% compensation  increase over two years. The union had proposed an 18% increase.  </P> <P> The council also refused to send both sides back to the bargaining table  because they had declared an impasse in negotiations.  </P> <P> The union's contract, which affects 60 employees, expired June 30.  </P> <P> The one-year employment policy, which is not a legally binding agreement,  leaves the contract in limbo until March, 1991, when the next round of contract  talks is scheduled.  </P> <P> City Administrator Mary Strenn said that although city officials are concerned  that employees might stage a work slowdown or strike, "we are fully expecting  that they will serve the public as they have in the past without a beat."  </P> <P> Union officials said employees would limit their work to required tasks.  </P> <P> "They are not going to do what they have always done," said Bill Shawhan,  general manager of the California League of City Employees Local 690. "They are  going to do exactly what they need to do to get their pay. They're not going to  do anything extra."  </P> <P> Shawhan said that at a union meeting on Sept. 12, members would discuss work  slowdowns, demonstrations, political lobbying, public relations efforts and the  possibility of a strike.  </P> <P> Also at Tuesday's meeting, the council approved the appointment of Salvador  Ponce, 52, to replace former Councilman Jess Margarito, who resigned Aug. 10 to  apply for the job of San Fernando Community Services director. Ponce, who will  be sworn in Sept. 17, has served on city committees in the past and is a  prominent community leader, Strenn said.  </P> <P> Margarito was appointed to his new post the same day Ponce was approved as a  council member, Strenn said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 1 (ATA) -- The agreement on the  PHARE-94 [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and  Hungary] project for Albania was signed May 31 at the Ministry  of Finance. "This ceremony left me a very strong impression,"  said Elio Germano, ambassador of the European Union in Tirana.  With the signing of this agreement, he said, we confirmed that  the European Union will stand side by side Albania to help it  with the developing processes and the economic and institutional  reform. The signing of this document implies that Albania  should be increasingly close to a decentralised economy and  programs projected for the Albanian people, Mr. Germano said.  "During our stay in Albania, we have worked to conclude this  program as soon as possible and completely, something which also  serves the strengthening of our relations," he concluded.</p>

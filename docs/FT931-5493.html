			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: MTL Instruments falls 19% to Pounds 3.7m MTL Instruments, a maker of electronic measuring devices, yesterday announced pre-tax profits down 19 per cent from Pounds 4.61m to Pounds 3.72m for the 1992 year. The shares dropped 14p to 258p. The group is proposing a final dividend of 2p bringing the total for the year to 3.6p (3.4p), payable from earnings per share which fell 20 per cent from 16.6p to 13.3p. Group turnover increased 7.6 per cent from Pounds 18m to Pounds 19.4m. There was an extraordinary gain of Pounds 630,000 (Pounds 552,000) because the group received a pension scheme surplus from pension funds established for founder directors. No further refunds are anticipated. The group received interest of Pounds 497,000, compared with Pounds 630,000 and the cash balance grew by Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 7.1m, mainly because of currency fluctuations. Mr Ian Hutcheon chairman and chief executive, blamed the decline in profits on a 10 per cent rise in operating costs largely because of newly-formed overseas sales companies in France and Germany. He said that margins were further reduced by the exceptional costs of developing and introducing the new 4000 series of 'intrinsically safe isolating interface devices' and that the decline in capital spending had increased competition because there are fewer contracts available. The group was disappointed by an 'insufficient flow' of profitable new products from its main subsidiary, Measurement Technology. In an attempt to correct this Measurement's design and marketing departments had been combined under a new managing director, Mr Graeme Philp. Analysts said the results were in line with expectations and that the US recovery should see some bounce in earnings next year.</p>

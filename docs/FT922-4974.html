			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Earth Summit cost estimated at Dollars 37m: Conference seen as chance to improve Brazil's poor environmental image BRAZIL is footing the bill for what promises to be the biggest party on earth. Mr Flavio Perri, the conference organiser, estimates the total cost to the government at Cr105bn (Dollars 37m) - a drain on a bankrupt Treasury and a country where even the presidency no longer serves coffee. The Brazilians have even had to bear the travel expenses of some of their guests and have so far paid out more than Dollars 2m for UN officials. Mr Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's main negotiator, believes the money has been well spent. He sees the Earth Summit as a chance to improve the country's poor image in terms of environment and security. He also hopes it will put Rio de Janeiro back on the map as a key tourist destination and a future international conference centre. But he says Brazil's parlous economic situation means that organisation has had to be done on the cheap. 'Like anyone inviting friends to dinner, we'd like to offer more to impress.' In fact, just three months before the conference, the budget was halved. The main outlay was on extending Rio's communications network and improving security. The conference centre, which had been used only for exhibitions and rock concerts, had to be renovated. Translation services have been installed and an enormous round table for heads of state built. So stretched was the Brazilian purse that its own delegation is housed in a pre-fabricated unit with no roof. Other delegations enjoy air conditioning and carpets. Brazil has accepted donations from the private sector: 285 cars from Volkswagen and 10 buses from Scania. The federal police chipped in, lending 300 cars. The real cost has lain with the Rio state government, which has been hard at work painting and resurfacing roads, restoring parks and installing streetlighting. Mr Roberto D'Avila, the state environment secretary, estimates that the state has spent Dollars 500m but he says this was for already-needed investments. 'Hosting such a big event meant that priorities became super-priorities and things which had waited for 20 years only happened because of the summit'. He gives as examples renovation of the airport and new highway construction. The influx of about 30,000 visitors is stimulating the private sector, causing one Rio shopkeeper to comment yesterday: 'We are starting to like this green movement. To us green means dollars.'</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Lepage catches the blues IF YOU want to see a truly pretentious, self-indulgent bit of theatre, hurry to the Cottesloe where there only 16 performances of Needles and Opium, described as 'a new solo piece written, performed and directed by Robert Lepage'. One line in the text just about sums it up: 'Jean-Paul Sartre doesn't live here any more.' The monologue goes on: 'In other words, he's been dead for about 10 years,' and, here I begin to paraphrase, 'but since the caller didn't believe me, I told him to call back later.' The date is roughly accurate. Sartre, the French playwright and philosopher whose name will be forever coupled with existentialism and Simone de Beauvoir, died in 1980. You can be forgiven for thinking that he disappeared many years earlier. It is remarkable that anyone should wish to bring him back. Also making a comeback is Jean Cocteau, another French writer described in Needles and Opium as 'the prince of French poets'. On the strength of a 20 day visit to New York in 1949, on the aeroplane back to Paris he wrote a 'Letter to the Americans' telling them that the new world was not so bad after all: it had such wonderful jazz. 'I know that bible trumpet, that trumpet dear to black people,' Cocteau explained. 'When Louis Armstrong puts it to his lips the sound rises to an angel's cry. What does this cry mean?' Lepage may be trying to tell us. At the same time as Cocteau went to the US, Miles Davis was making his first visit to Europe. He was even more impressed by the old world than Cocteau was by the new. He met Sartre, Picasso and Juliette Greco and was so miserable about returning to America that on the flight home he was unable to speak. This, one supposes, is the Franco-American synthesis: American jazz and French intellectualism. One day, we are told, a bit of Davis's lip fell off into his trumpet 'like sperm into a womb': It was the birth of the Miles sound. Of the two good things in this production, one is the playing of some of the Davis music in the background. The other is the versatility and charm of Lepage as he leaps about flying the Atlantic and talking on the telephone. The rest is dire. A lot of the action, such as it is, takes place on screen: from behind the scenes come the recurrent sounds of a female orgasm. Lepage is director of French Theatre at Canada's National Arts Centre and has a high international reputation. On the evidence of Needles and Opium he is living in the 1960s, when he might have been thought adventurous. One looks forward with curiosity to his production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Royal National Theatre in July. At least he will have better material. In repertory at the Cottesloe in association with Cultural Industry Ltd. (071) 928 2252</p>

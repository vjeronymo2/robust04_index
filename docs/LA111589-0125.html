			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> PLAYOFF OFFENSIVE GAME PLAN: LITIGATION  </P> <P> Students at Huntington Beach High School should have been in class Monday.  </P> <P> Students at Savanna High School should not have been in tears Tuesday.  </P> <P> Students at Fountain Valley High School should not have been given false hope,  booster clubs should not be holding car washes for legal fees, and  quarterbacks, not judges, should be deciding who wins Southern Section football  championships.  </P> <P> The day the Southern Section office always feared finally happened Tuesday, the  day the adults went wild and turned a game for 17-year-olds into a legislative  football.  </P> <P> Because an ineligible player was found on the football rosters of Huntington  Beach, Savanna and La Puente high schools this week, three teams were forced  out of the playoffs -- promptly, sending two of them into the courtroom.  </P> <P> The scoreboard, so far:  </P> <P> Huntington Beach: 1-0. Tuesday, the Oilers received a temporary restraining  order against the Southern Section, preventing their disqualification from the  Division I tournament and reinstating them as a playoff team.  </P> <P> La Puente: On deck. Encouraged by the Huntington Beach ruling, La Puente is  planning to enter the same legal arena. "This gives us a lot of hope," football  Coach Rick Kunishimi said.  </P> <P> Savanna: Idle. But probably taking notes.  </P> <P> The fallout has been widespread. When 8-2 Huntington Beach was barred from the  playoffs, 5-5 Fountain Valley replaced the Oilers and was matched against the  division's top-seeded team, 10-0 Fontana. Now, Huntington Beach is back in,  Fountain Valley is out and Fontana is none too pleased about the upgraded  quality of competition.  </P> <P> Next, maybe Fontana and Fountain Valley can pursue restraining orders to  restrain the Huntington Beach restraining order.  </P> <P> "There's a joke going around the office," says Dean Crowley, the Southern  Section's beleaguered associate commissioner. "Next year, we'll have a 15-week  season. Ten weeks for the regular season, a week off for litigation and then  four weeks of playoffs."  </P> <P> Funny, but nobody's really laughing.  </P> <P> The situation has spun ludicrously out of control -- What's your record?  Six-and-two and two games pending -- but the blame belongs with neither the  high schools nor the Southern Section.  </P> <P> Of course the high schools are distraught. Huntington Beach is making only its  third playoff appearance in 23 years. Savanna had just won its first league  title since the school opened in 1961. La Puente hadn't qualified for the  playoffs in a decade.  </P> <P> Take those accomplishments away and a fight, rightly, should be expected.  </P> <P> The Southern Section, meanwhile, is only upholding the constitution that was  approved by its administrative council, which is composed of high school  principals. "It's our job to enforce the rules," Crowley said. "If they want to  change the rule, a vote of our administrative council could change it."  </P> <P> So change it.  </P> <P> There's something wrong with a rule that wipes out the efforts of an entire  team because of clerical sloppiness, because all the facts weren't sufficiently  checked. Right now, the punishment does not fit the crime, as Huntington Beach  students sought to underscore by their three-hour boycott of classes on Monday.  </P> <P> "Even my wife was mad about it," said Crowley. "We were watching (the report on  the boycott) on the news and she got irate. She turned to me and said, 'You  shouldn't be penalizing the kids. Fifty-five kids go out for football and you  punish all of them because of one?'  </P> <P> "I said, 'Linda, I agree with you. We have compassion, too."  </P> <P> Compassion, yes.  </P> <P> The right constitution, no.  </P> <P> According to Crowley, the Washington and Nevada high school athletic  federations levy fines against schools found with ineligible players. No games,  championships or playoff berths are forfeited. Just money.  </P> <P> And that means no pre-playoff litigation.  </P> <P> It seems an equitable, workable system. Since high school principals are  responsible for fielding teams of eligible athletes -- that's also in the  Southern Section Blue Book, Rule 302 -- make the principals pay and let the  players play.  </P> <P> Southern Section officials say they like the fine system, with one reservation.  </P> <P> "I was talking with one parent who thought a fine was a good idea until he  started thinking," Crowley said. "He told me, 'Well, suppose you get the  booster club to pay the fine. Then you have a situation where schools are going  out and getting ineligible players and just paying the fine at the end of the  season.' "  </P> <P> In a better world, high school athletic programs would be above such chicanery.  </P> <P> But in this one, it's best to have insurance.  </P> <P> So along with the fine, you:  </P> <P>  -- Declare the guilty player ineligible for the playoffs.  </P> <P>  -- Strip his team of the home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.  </P> <P>  -- Force the school to forfeit all gate receipts from playoff games.  </P> <P>  -- Put the school on probation.  </P> <P> Under terms of probation, the guilty school cannot commit a similar infraction  during the next five years. Since such a violation would indicate a blatant  disregard for the rules, the principal (and/or coach) would be censured by the  Southern Section -- in essence, the section would recommend that he be removed.  </P> <P> In addition, the amount of the initial fine would be doubled and the team, for  that season, would be declared an "independent" -- able to qualify for the  playoffs only as a wild-card entrant, regardless of its won-lost record. And  the Southern Section designates all wild-card entrants.  </P> <P> In any scenario, the players would still have the opportunity to play.  </P> <P> And before we got buried by the petitions and the legal briefs, that was the  bottom line, wasn't it?  </P></p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Appeal launched to aid miners A PUBLIC appeal is to be launched to raise money for Monktonhall Mineworkers, the consortium operating Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh, James Buxton writes. The colliery is in financial difficulties. The appeal is supported by the Rt Rev Richard Holloway, the bishop of Edinburgh. Yesterday Lothian regional council, which has previously refused to help Monktonhall Mineworkers, agreed to pay for a Pounds 25,000 study of the company's viability. Caledonian Mining, based at Newark, Notts, said it was withdrawing from discussions with the mineworkers and their advisers, Price Waterhouse. It had been dismayed by reports that it did not enjoy the support of the miners, and by adverse publicity.</p>

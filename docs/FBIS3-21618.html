			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Daniel Sanchez Chavez, director of the </F> National Directorate for Agricultural Reconversion; place and  date not given; first paragraph is LOS TIEMPOS editorial  introduction]    [Text] The cultivation of coca leaves has cultural value in  the countries of the Andes Mountains and is the source of  livelihood for thousands of Bolivian families. This crop now  faces eradication of its surplus production. However, the budget  for eradication has been cut, and new forms of activity have  been adopted to achieve technical viability and provide  favorable economic prospects, thereby creating a natural way of  changing economic life. FACETAS spoke with Dr. Daniel Sanchez  Chavez, director of the National Directorate of Agricultural  Reconversion (DIRECO), who has been the director of this  organization since April 1992. A specialist in this subject who  has done post-graduate work in Japan, San Jose, Costa Rica, and  Brazil, Daniel Sanchez analyzes and considers the process of  agricultural reconversion in this interview.    [LOS TIEMPOS] Is DIRECO a repressive agency or a technical  organization?    [Sanchez] The National Directorate of Agricultural  Reconversion, or DIRECO, is an institution which has, among  other purposes, the objective of planning, executing, and  supervising plans for reducing the cultivation of coca leaves in  the illegal and surplus transitional production areas, as  provided for by law. All of this is done within the framework of  voluntary cooperation with the farmers producing coca leaves.  Therefore, it can be seen that our work is clearly technical in  character and distinct from any kind of repressive activity.    [LOS TIEMPOS] In view of the changes in DIRECO what kind of  work does it perform?    [Sanchez] In the work program of the National Directorate of  Agricultural Reconversion (DIRECO) the efforts of its officials  to develop goals and objectives are of primary importance.  Consequently, some of their efforts have been devoted to  improving working conditions by providing our employees with  annual vacations; arranging for their reassignment to other  duties, which means higher salaries for better trained and more  efficient, professional workers; and making the 200 employees of  DIRECO eligible for the benefits of social security.  Furthermore, we have restructured the agency to make it function  more efficiently and to integrate the operational, technical  support, and administrative areas. We know that this effort has  still not gone far enough, and some unsatisfied expectations  remain.    In the operational area, beginning in 1992, DIRECO undertook  a new type of activity called "Reduction Programs," which  consist of carrying out public works of a social type, in  exchange for the farmers' reducing a certain number of hectares  of coca leaf cultivation, in a framework of negotiation and  cooperation with the communities benefiting from such work. In  this way, during the 1992 operational year, 17 public works of  different types were undertaken in several communities, at an  overall cost of 224,225 bolivianos. During the 1993 operational  year, 32 public works costing 317,071 bolivianos were completed.  As a result, DIRECO has been turned into an agent of change  which makes it possible for it to achieve credibility and  develop a technical and nonrepressive identity.    [LOS TIEMPOS] What is the framework under which DIRECO  carries on its activities, under the existing, bilateral  agreements?    [Sanchez] The Bilateral Agreement contains an understanding  between the American and Bolivian Governments. In it the  government of the United States of North America commits itself  to provide aid to the Bolivian economic recovery program, and  the Bolivian Government commits itself to implement the Law on  the Production of Coca Leaves and Controlled Substances. This  law provides for crop reduction, substitution, and development,  through the application of an integrated development and  substitution program involving 5,000 to 8,000 hectares planted  to coca each year.    In the framework of this basic document DIRECO must prepare  and execute an Operational Plan aimed at satisfying the  objectives contained in the policy approved by the Bolivian  Government. This policy provides for the cooperation and  voluntary participation of coca leaf producers in the illicit  and surplus coca leaf producing areas of Bolivia.    [LOS TIEMPOS] "Reduction, Substitution, and Development"--is  this the trilogy of alternative development in which DIRECO is  participating?    [Sanchez] I believe that, given the complexity of this  process, it is difficult to identify the actions and  responsibility of each of the organizations implementing this  program. However, the concept and techniques involved in this  activity must be understood, together with the disinterested  contribution of each of these organizations and based on their  full cooperation and understanding.    [LOS TIEMPOS] It was stated in a local publication that  plans  for the eradication of coca fields are far from complete. It has  even been insinuated that there has been a kind of political  boycott of the process. How much of this is true?    [Sanchez] The newspaper OPINION published an article  indicating that plans for the eradication of coca fields are far  from complete, within the approved time framework. It even  insinuated that we are in the midst of a kind of political party  boycott. As of 31 December 1993 DIRECO had completed about 60  percent of its operational plan. During the next three months of  the initial, planning period, the remaining 40 percent of the  preparations can be completed, in accordance with existing  plans, to carry out "Reduction Programs" in several communities.    Although this prospect is not particularly encouraging, we  believe that, thanks to the efforts made by the personnel  involved, we have succeeded in completing the second section of  our plan. This was accomplished despite the serious limitations  which we faced in 1993, such as a sustained and steadily rising  increase in the price of coca leaves, the temporary suspension  of funds earmarked for compensation and agricultural grants, and  the unyielding opposition of the leadership of trade unions and  elite groups in Bolivia which are opposed to the plans for a  reduction in the planting of coca leaves. We believe that,  thanks to the efforts made by our personnel, we have  successfully completed the second segment of our plan.    Regarding the publication to which we referred, I must  assume  that the author of that article is completely ignorant about our  policies and plans for a reduction in coca planting and the  context in which this is taking place. The article in question  gives the impression that we have hidden objectives. This does  not reflect the ethical and moral behavior of a serious and  responsible reporter.    [LOS TIEMPOS] "Reduction Works"--is this a new plan for the  eradication of coca plantings?    [Sanchez] I would say that it is a new way of doing things  which made it possible for us to meet the urgent needs of the  communities involved and to satisfy them to the extent that our  budget allows us and given the predisposition of all members of  the communes concerned to carry on a plan of concerted and  negotiated reduction. In that way we can contribute to change  and to the social and economic development of the region.    [LOS TIEMPOS] Will the limitations be dealt with in the  context of the program of agricultural reconversion?    [Sanchez] Agricultural reconversion is a long-term program  and is a function of the emphasis on agriculture in the  subtropical area of Cochabamba. It should be said that, on the  basis of agricultural and ecological conditions in the region,  the change in the patterns of production is based on permanent  or perennial species of plants which begin to provide their  "harvest" over the medium term. Consequently, this is a slow  process, on the one hand. On the other hand, to be most  effective, it requires very close coordination with all agencies  involved in the agrarian sector.    So far, significant progress has been made in all of the  programs undertaken by the IBTA/Chapare Project [Bolivian  Institute of Agricultural and Livestock Technology at the  Chapare]. A transfer of technology has taken place, involving  systems of production which aim at accomplishing that mission.  We think that what has been done so far is not enough, and there  is a long way to go. We hope to do this in a coordinated and  jointly agreed way, so that we will be able to get the best  results.    [LOS TIEMPOS] How would you summarize the social and  economic  background of coca leaf plantations? The peasant producers have  accepted this program. Has there been any follow up?    [Sanchez] Although coca leaf growing has a cultural value in  the Andean countries and is the means of support for many  families in the subtropical areas of these countries, it is also  used for illicit purposes which attack the morals and proper  behavior of the people living in the countries which produce  coca leaves. Consequently, plans for the reduction of coca  planting have the objective of eradicating surplus production,  while respecting the production of acceptable amounts intended  for traditional, medicinal, and legal usage, related to our  culture.    The farmers who voluntarily accept the plans for a reduction  in the size of their fields planted to coca receive $2,000 in  compensation, through the Agricultural Donation Fund. We believe  that if the money from this fund is reinvested in planting a new  area with a crop having technical viability and good marketing  prospects, a change in the economy will come naturally. DIRECO  does not follow up on changes made by those who own this  agricultural land because there are other institutions working  in this area.    [LOS TIEMPOS] A reduction in North American aid has been  reported. What is the truth about this?    [Sanchez] Any agreement is based on the implementation of  its  various parts, and any digression from this standard may involve  a failure to comply with the goals that have been set. From that  point of view it is necessary for all of the sectors involved in  this problem to sit down to discuss and present our best  considered points of view, while we remain fundamentally  concerned about the best interests of our country and society.    [LOS TIEMPOS] Following the layoff of employees at your  directorate, there has been some discussion that DIRECO will  soon be abolished. What are the facts about this?    [Sanchez] The personnel reduction at DIRECO is the result of  financial problems and in no way was caused by false arguments  which have been spread in the course of discussion of the  problem.    It is a good thing to emphasize that the budgetary reduction  which DIRECO has suffered has confronted us with the painful  need to do without the services of some very capable people. The  instinct of self-preservation demands that we face up to the  lack of understanding and the critical remarks made by the  people concerned.</p>

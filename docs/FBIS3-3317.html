			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata arrived here today for a three-day visit  aimed at further promoting the dialogue launched by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin during his trip to Tokyo last October.    In a statement upon arrival at Moscow airport, Hata said the  aim of his visit was to reaffirm the principles of the "Tokyo  declaration" concluded during Yeltsin's visit to Japan.    He said he will hold talks with his Russian counterpart  Andrey Kozyrev on international issues, including some problems  in regions near Japan and the Far East of Russia, a reference to  the disputed four islands.    The local press expected no significant progress during  Hata's visit on the future of the Kuril Islands, held by the  Russians since the end of World War Two but claimed by Japan.  The territorial dispute is the biggest outstanding bilateral  issue between the two countries.    The Japanese foreign minister will also meet with Ivan  Rybkin, chairman of the lower chamber of parliament.</p>

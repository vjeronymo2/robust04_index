			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 28 (CTK) -- Although the government  coalition has agreed on the mechanism for senatorial elections,  the opposition continues to oppose the filling of the Senate,  the upper house in the Czech Parliament which is defined in the  Constitution but has not yet been filled.    The coalition parties -- the Civic Democratic Party (ODS),  the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), and the Christian  Democratic Party (KDS) -- adopted a compromise proposal on  Friday [25 March], according to which in this year's election 27  large constituencies will each elect three senators. Each  electoral district will be composed of three smaller ones, so  that the total number of districts in the Czech Republic will be  81.    Representatives of the deputies' group of the Left Bloc  (LB),  the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), and the Czech  Social Democratic Party (CSSD) today told CTK they opposed the  decision.    LB deputies' group chairman Jaroslav Ortman said the  proposal  was politically aimed and legally problematic, as it was not  defined in the Constitution. He said the proposal testified  that the coalition parties are pressing for the establishment of  the Senate primarily to safeguard their power, adding that  controversies between the coalition parties were ensuing from  mutual fear.    The LB still holds the view that the provision providing for  the establishment of the Senate should be struck from the  Constitution, Ortman said. He said that the opinions of the  president and the Constitutional Court were a sufficient  safeguard against parliamentary decisions.    The KSCM still considers Senate elections an attempt on the  part of the right to preserve at least part of its power in case  the distribution of forces between the right and left changes  after Chamber of Deputies (lower house) elections, KSCM  spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova told CTK. She said the KSCM rejected  the Senate, but should a senatorial election be held it  considered it more democratic to define the length of senators'  terms of office through the election but not through casting of  lots. The Communists consider the majority electoral system to  be discrimination against opposition parties, she added.    CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman considers the discussion on  different variants for senatorial elections "unrealistic," since  the parliament has not yet decided whether or not it would  exist. Zeman told CTK that the Social Democrats had submitted a  bill on the abolition of the Senate to parliament and they  intended to discuss the coalition's proposal only if their bill  is rejected.</p>

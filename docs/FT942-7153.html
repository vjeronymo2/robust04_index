			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures crashed through the 3,000 barrier to trade at a sharp discount to the cash market as dealers reacted to the strong setback in European bond markets, writes Joel Kibazo. After opening at 3,078, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 briefly moved ahead to touch 3,091. This turned out to be the high of the day. However, the contract soon succumbed to active selling said to have been led by brokers Mantrad and Fimat, with one of them reported to have been a seller of 5,000 lots. The slide was attributed to talk that there would be no further reductions in interest rates. This not only sent led to the decline of the contract but also pulled the underlying cash market lower. The decline of the US dollar was also said to have played a part in the day's fall. At the day's low, June traded at 2,998 but steadied to close at 2,999, a day's fall of 79 points and around 18 points below its fair value premium to cash of about minus 3. Volume improved sharply to reach 25,099. The traded options also saw heavy volume as a total of 53,800 contracts were dealt. The FT-SE 100 option was particularly busy, trading 26,382 lots by the close. Land Securities was the most active stock option with a total of 3,372 contracts.</p>

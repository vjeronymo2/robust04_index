			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORIEGA REAPPEARS TO CHANTS OF 'HIT THE YANKEES HARD'  </P> <P> Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, who has been out of public view since the May 7  elections and resulting violence led to international calls for his ouster,  appeared before about 1,000 chanting supporters Thursday.  </P> <P> But the beaming Defense Forces chief, wearing a white tropical shirt and gray  pants, did not respond to calls by the United States and the Organization of  American States for him to give up control of Panama's government.  </P> <P> He did not address the gathering. When reporters asked how many years he could  continue in power, he laughed and said, "That's a good question."  </P> <P> Noriega appeared at a rally called at the government's Atlapa Convention  Center.  </P> <P> "The people united shall never be defeated!" and "Noriega, for sure, hit the  Yankees hard!" chanted the general's admirers as he waved.  </P> <P> The government nullified the presidential elections, which the opposition and  government candidates both claimed to have won, after Noriega supporters beat  up the opposition candidates.  </P> <P> Official media said Thursday that the Organization of American States has  neither the right nor authority to negotiate a change in Panama's government or  Noriega's departure.  </P></p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: West plays down warning from Russia Russia's opposition to air strikes against Serb positions in Bosnia, repeated yesterday by Mr Anatoly Adamishin, the first deputy foreign minister, is not yet causing much concern to the west. There are two reasons. First, western diplomats believe that, despite their protests yesterday, the Russian leadership will not react dramatically if air strikes go ahead. Second, they believe that Russia, with the US, is being drawn into the negotiating process and understands that no-one in the west wants strikes except as a last resort. However, it is recognised that President Boris Yeltsin and his government are under strong pressure from nationalists. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the ultra-right Liberal Democratic party, said on Wednesday in parliament that he would destroy the countries of those pilots who bombed Serbian positions. Less vividly, Mr Sergei Stankevich, a former presidential adviser, warned that the 'consensus' which had existed with the west on the conflict would be destroyed by air strikes. 'The ability of the Russian government to play the role of loyal partner is limited . . . by public opinion.' One senior diplomat who had held a session with foreign ministry officials on the issue yesterday said that the Russians had questioned whether the UN mandate allowed air strikes. They argued that the effect would be to drive the Serbs and Moslems out of the negotiating process, the former in protest and the latter because they would assume the west was now on their side. Mr Adamishin's comments yesterday - he said that 'making threats and ultimatums is not Nato's business' - were aimed largely at ensuring that the UN was in charge of the process. The US state department said that Russia's objections 'did not differ in some cases from the concerns of some European allies'. Mr James Collins, US ambassador at large for the former Soviet states, has had discussions with Russian officials and was said by one diplomat last night to be satisfied that Moscow was not too alarmed by the prospect of strikes. However, it is clear that the general agreements between the west and Russia on foreign policy have recently been under strain over the expansion of Russian power in the former Soviet states.</p>

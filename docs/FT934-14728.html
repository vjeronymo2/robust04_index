			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Engineering employers hit at Treasury THE ENGINEERING Employ-ers Federation yesterday accused the Treasury of being 'isolated from the real world' of manufacturing, and warned that the recovery in engineering output had halted. The gloomy assessment of the sector's prospects - including a prediction of a further 60,000 job losses - underlined the severity of the recession in continental European export markets, and confirmed the message of falling manufacturing output contained in official figures on Tuesday. The federation said engineering output is not expected to pick up again before next spring. Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser, said there were no prospects of a strong recovery in west European markets until 1995. The forecast prompted an outspoken attack on the Treasury by Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the federation, who was worried not only by the short-term outlook but by the long-term future of the engineering sector. Mr Johnson said the federation still had high hopes for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. 'But I fear the Treasury may be trapping him, as it has trapped so many of his predecessors,' he said. Treasury officials were clever, perhaps too clever, he said. But they were isolated from the real world and 'totally unspoilt by failure'. 'They cannot sail serenely on, seeing what they want to see, understanding what they want to understand, and dismissing we little wealth-creating folk with a gentle, patrician smile,' he added. Underlying Mr Johnson's attack is the federation's belief that the UK does not have a broad enough manufacturing base to satisfy domestic demand and exports - especially when demand in continental markets recovers. He said that if Mr Clarke was serious about boosting the UK's manufacturing base, he should change the UK's system of capital allowances for industry, which is 'biased against investment'. The federation believes UK gross domestic product will grow by little more than 2 per cent next year. This compares with a consensus among City and economic analysts of 3 per cent. European recession and the continuing squeeze on costs because of global competition would cause the 60,000 further job cuts in the next 12 months. Employment in the sector has already fallen by 410,000 to 1.69m since the first half of 1990. Autumn 1993 Engineering Economic Trends.

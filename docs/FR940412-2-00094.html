Cone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date of Filing: November 16, 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Case Number: LEF&hyph;0118  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On November 16, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute funds which J.R. Cone (Cone) remitted to the DOE pursuant to a Consent Order entered into by Cone and the DOE on May 14, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 25, 1983, the OHA issued a Remedial Order (RO) finding that Cone had erroneously classified crude oil produced from two oil bearing properties as crude oil produced from stripper well properties. On May 14, 1993, Cone and the DOE entered into a Consent Order settling all claims arising from the RO. Pursuant to the Consent Order, Cone has remitted $610,000 to the DOE. These funds have been held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the procedural regulations codified at 10 C.F.R. part 205, Subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requested in its petition that the OHA establish special refund procedures to remedy the effects of alleged regulatory violations which were resolved by the Consent Order. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> I. Jurisdiction and Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan for distributing funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;4501&hyph;07 (1988),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 9 DOE &para;82,508 (1981), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Proposed Decision and Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We considered the ERA's petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the Cone Consent Order fund and determined that such a proceeding was appropriate. On December 20, 1993, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) setting forth the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 58 Fed. Reg. 68,903 (December 29, 1993). In the PDO, we stated our intent to adopt the DOE's standard crude oil refund procedures, as set out below, to distribute the funds obtained through the Cone Consent Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PDO provided a period of 30 days from the date of publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  for interested parties to file comments regarding the tentative distribution process. More than 30 days has elapsed and the OHA has received no comments on the proposed distribution process for the Consent Order funds. Consequently, the procedures will be adopted as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> III. The Refund Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> A. Crude Oil Refund Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We adopt the tentative determination of the PDO to distribute the funds obtained with the Cone Consent Order in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4, 1986)(The MSRP). The MSRP was issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement). The MSRP establishes that 40% of the crude oil funds will be remitted to the Federal government, another 40% to the states, and up to 20% may be initially reserved for payment of claims to injured parties. The MSRP also specifies that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid be disbursed to the Federal government and the states in equal amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OHA has utilized the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 Fed. Reg. 29689 (August 20, 1986). This Order provided a period of 30 days for filing of comments or objections to our proposed use of the MSRP as the groundwork for evaluating claims in crude oil refund proceedings. Following this period, the OHA issued a Notice evaluating the numerous comments which it had received pursuant to the Order Implementing the MSRP. This notice was published at 52 Fed. Reg. 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

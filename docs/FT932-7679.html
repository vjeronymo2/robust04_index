			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Falcone murder commemorated ITALIAN authorities, for the first time, have decided to make the commemoration of a Mafia murder a national event. Instructions have gone out to all schools to observe a minute's silence today for Mr Giovanni Falcone, the leading anti-Mafia magistrate who was killed with his wife and their bodyguards on May 23 last year. The commemoration also covers Mr Paolo Borsellino, Mr Falcone's colleague, killed with his escort two months later. In Palermo where both killings occurred, as well as throughout all big Italian cities, ceremonies and demonstrations are planned over the weekend to commemorate these two brutal killings. Magistrates investigating the Falcone murder revealed this week that his secret movements were almost certainly betrayed to the Mafia from inside Italy's security services. Since last December, Mr Bruno Contrada, head of Mafia intelligence in Sisde, the domestic intelligence service, has been in custody on allegations of consorting with the Mafia. Recent tests on cigarette butts - left by those who planted the huge explosive device which killed Mr Falcone as he drove into Palermo from the airport - show three people were involved. But no arrests have been made of those who carried out the bombing. In the case of the Borsellino killing, police have arrested a man for alleged involvement in placing the fatal car bomb. This week also saw the capture of Nitto Santapoala, the number two in the Sicilian Mafia who is believed to have been behind the killings.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of South Africa  has suspended three of its members, including two senior  officials with immediate effect for violating party procedures  by raising party matters with the media.    The announcement of the suspension of the PAC's national  director of publicity, Mr. Waters Toboti, the regional secretary  of central Transkei, Mr. Mfanelo Skwatsh, and a member of the  Azanian National Youth League, Mr. (Chargin Mabaso), was made by  the PAC's secretary general, Mr. Benny Alexander. The decision  to suspend them was taken at the organization's national working  committee in Johannesburg today.    Mr. Alexander said they were suspended for making media  statements challenging the national working committee's position  to place a moratorium on the armed struggle. He said certain  sections of the media strived to project divisions within the  PAC in the run-up to the election, but failed to communicate the  overwhelming support for the moratorium on the armed struggle.</p>

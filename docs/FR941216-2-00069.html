			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Response: EPA concurs that the 1.0 ug/l limit for benzene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is more stringent than Florida's water quality standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The limitation for benzene is based on the best treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology available and happens to be more stringent than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAC 17&hyph;302.530(9)[4/25/94], Class I potable water supplies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is 1.18 ug/l. The 1.0 ug/l limitation is also more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than Florida Class III water quality standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which requires an annual average limitation of 71.28 ug/l  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for benzene. Therefore, since technology has proven capable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of consistently maintaining the 1.0 ug/l limitation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benzene and numerous permittees have consistently designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment systems that meet the requirements of the NPDES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general permit, EPA will retain the benzene limit. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, maintaining the 1.0 ug/l benzene limit complies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Section 402(o)(1) of the Water Quality Act of 1987,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which states that a permit may not be renewed, reissued, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified to contain effluent limitations which are less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than the comparable effluent limitations in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous permit except in compliance with Section 303  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 13: Exxon Company (EC) mentioned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable pH for treated effluent under the previous and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed NPDES general permit is 6.0&hyph;8.5 standard units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SUs), and mentioned that many lakes and streams in Central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and North Florida have a pH range of 5.0&hyph;6.0 SUs. EC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that many influent pH samples for remedial pump and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treat systems are also in this range and recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing the allowed lower limit from 6.0 to 5.5 SUs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: In response to EC comments, the pH language in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current proposed draft permit does allow some variation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for pH depending on natural background of the receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water. However, this natural background data must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished to EPA by the permittee in the initial NOI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request; in order to be considered in determining the pH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range for the facility during the notification of coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request. It should be noted that the pH of the receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream, not the influent or effluent, influences the pH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 14: Exxon Company (EC) commented on Part I.A.3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the screen for metals that would indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination from sources other than petroleum fuels. EC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned that it is unwarranted to require screening for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional metals that are not ordinarily considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents of petroleum fuels as a basis for securing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPDES general permit for petroleum fuel contamination. EC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned that if there is a cause for this additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening at a particular site, the regulatory processes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place will generate the additional site investigation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing needed, instead of testing every site whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justified or not and recommended that the screening for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other metals be removed as a requirement from the NPDES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general permit. EC mentioned that if additional metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing is required, annual testing is much more appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than semi-annual, especially for groundwater remedial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems at underground storage tank cleanup sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: In response to Exxon Company (EC) comments, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifies the misconception that contaminated petroleum fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites must perform the Part I.A.3 testing requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metals; these discharges must comply only with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of Part I.A.1 or I.A.2. EPA refers to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general applicability of Part I.A.3, that allows produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water discharges from any noncontaminated site, which could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include dewatering for tank removals, construction activity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or aquifer pump tests from water wells. Any point source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge of pollutants to waters of the U.S. requires an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPDES permit, regardless of whether the site is contaminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or uncontaminated. EPA, in its approach to covering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dewatering of produced groundwater associated with any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity, placed the burden for verification on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permittee for determining that the site groundwater has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been contaminated with sources other than petroleum fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requiring all permittees to perform this screening allows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities performing dewatering activities to be placed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the general permit, assuming that the screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reveals no contamination from sources other than petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 15: Exxon Company (EC) mentioned that the Discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitoring Report forms should be revised and the reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure should be simplified. Also, mentioned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of forms initially received from EPA tend to become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illegible when photocopied. EC also requested that EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain the current level of bioassay testing instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the frequency as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: EPA will send original Discharge Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reports to the permittee so that more legible photocopies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be produced. EPA recommends that these originals be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained by the permittee for copying purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reference to the bioassay requirements, permittees which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have previously obtained coverage under this general permit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which effluents have not demonstrated unacceptable toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (LC 50 &lt; 100%), may continue to sample 1/year. All sampling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures and test methods must comply with Part V. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be noted that the permit limit identified in Part V  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is applicable to those facilities covered by this general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit under Sections  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> I.A.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> I.A.2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

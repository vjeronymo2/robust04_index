			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN HOUR SAVED  </P> <P> I am writing CBS in addition to you to let everyone know that I will be  boycotting "60 Minutes" for the next three months, along with the rest of my  family, due to its ridiculous suspension of Andy Rooney (the best part of the  show). Should CBS lift its "ban" on Rooney, I'll be glad to tune right back in.  </P> <P> B.L. Isaacs, Whittier  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] President Luis  Arturo Zaldiva has said everything is ready for the 20 March  elections. He added that shortcomings in the issuance of voter  registration cards have been overcome and that the nationwide  distribution of electoral materials is already under way.    [Begin recording] [Zaldivar] As of midnight last night, more  than 800,000 voter registration cards had been issued; in other  words, we exceeded the goal we set for ourselves. This is very  satisfying for the TSE and its staff. We commend those voters  who came to the TSE offices to obtain voter registration cards.    [Unidentified reporter] Could you give us an estimate?    [Zaldivar] Of the cards issued? Remember, registration ended  at midnight last night. We still do not have exact figures, but  I can tell you that we exceeded 800,000 cards.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] take the election materials to  all places in the country?    [Zaldivar] The nationwide delivery of election materials  began yesterday. They will arrive at departmental and municipal  electoral boards, and as the law stipulates, and they will  eventually arrive at the voting table boards. [end recording]    Zaldivar also talked about the role of the international  observers who are already in El Salvador to verify the outcome  of the elections.    [Begin recording] [Zaldivar] There are more than 3,000  observers. We have (?registered) more than 2,000 visiting  observers. Also, there are 900 UN observers and 25 TSE special  guests who are members of the Inter-American Union of Electoral  Organizations.    [Reporter] When will the results be released?    [Zaldivar] The vote count will include two parts -- a  preliminary count and a final count. At the very latest, the  final count should begin 48 hours after the polls close. During  this process, the law requires us to report partial results.  This is why we created the National Vote Counting Center, where  we will hold a [word indistinct] involving the media to allow  them to inform the nation and the world about the election  results as they become available. These results will be based  on data we collect through the logistical plan we devised -- a  plan that involves the counting of votes and the dissemination  of the results. [end recording]    International observers will be assigned throughout the  country to cover all municipalities. The full authority of the  Salvadoran state will be at stake in the 20 March elections.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER: 'BE DIFFERENT'  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner, the shipbuilding magnate and unpredictable owner of the  New York Yankees, told graduating cadets at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy  to dare to be different.  </P> <P> "Be the uncommon man and woman," Steinbrenner urged the 119 cadets Sunday.  </P> <P> "Don't worry too much about what you think society dictates, because it's the  uncommon men of this country that have led it to greatness."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner, who has hired 19 managers in the 17 years since he bought the  Yankees, pressed the graduates to "pursue excellence at all costs."  </P> <P> "There are those who will teach you that to win is a bad word," said the owner  of the last-place ballclub. "It's not a bad word, but if you prefer to say  pursuit of excellence, that's OK."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner was given an honorary doctorate "in recognition of his service in  the American maritime industry."  </P> <P> He is president and chief executive of American Ship Building and Kinsman  Marine Transit.  </P></p>

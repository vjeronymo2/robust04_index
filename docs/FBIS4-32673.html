			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zoran Grgurevic from Doboj] </F>   [Excerpts] Since 1200 Doboj has been targeted by the  Muslim [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] and Croatian [Croatian Defense  Council] artillery. This time, with the support by the Croatian  artillery, a multiple rocket launcher has literally plowed the  center of the city with over 20 destructive missiles. The  shelling is under way as I report. [passage omitted]    There is no point even in mentioning the material damage. As  an illustration of the damage, the water works have been damaged  [otvorio] and one street of Doboj has been completely  annihilated. It is real hell here. [passage omitted]</p>

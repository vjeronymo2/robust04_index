			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Hosokawa meets his own Whitewater: Tokyo's version is more than froth whipped up by the press Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was wrestling yesterday with his equivalent of the Whitewater affair which is currently plaguing US President Bill Clinton. Yet Tokyo's Whitewater is, unlike the Washington version as it so far appears, more than mere froth whipped up by the press. A newly aggressive Liberal Democratic party opposition has seized on allegations that Mr Hosokawa failed to repay a Y100m (Pounds 657,000) loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a disgraced parcel delivery company. The affair is more than a year old, but the LDP has played it up, and unearthed more suspicions about an allegedly shady share purchase, to test how vulnerable Mr Hosokawa is. It could, warn coalition officials, precipitate Mr Hosokawa's resignation or even herald the end of the divided seven-month old government. The LDP has not yet risked calling a vote of no confidence, but instead has blocked, for the past month, Diet (lower house) debate on the annual budget, until Mr Hosokawa disproves the allegations. He has signally failed to produce a robust Clinton-type rebuff. Mr Hosokawa has so far refused LDP demands to ask his former aide, who handled his financial affairs, to testify in parliament and has been unable to produce receipts showing he repaid the Y100m. As a result, Mr Hosokawa's denials of wrongdoing have failed to convince more than four-fifths of the electorate, according to a recent poll by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial newspaper. The plot thickened yesterday when an investment consultant claimed he had received a Y10m 'consulting fee' from the aide to keep quiet about a purchase of shares on Mr Hosokawa's behalf in the privatised NTT telecommunications company. Mr Hosokawa said he did not know about this. Mr Hosokawa's alleged irregularities are venial by the spectacular standards of previous Japanese political scandals. Yet senior members of the seven-party coalition have in the past few days aired the prospect of a cabinet resignation. 'There may be no other choice,' warns a senior member of the Social Democratic party, the largest and most rebellious coalition member. Just how far the LDP wants to go is unclear, but the hunt is said by its own senior officials to be the one project on which its divided factions agree. The LDP knows from its own sore experience how effective holding the budget hostage can be. Only five years ago, its own then prime minister, Mr Noboru Takeshita, was obliged to resign after the opposition of the time, led by the SDP, blocked the 1989-1990 budget to force him to disclose more information about the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal. This battle comes at a time when the Japanese leader's popularity is already waning. Voters' early hopes for a change in style and substance from the first non-LDP government in nearly 40 years have begun to fade. Mr Hosokawa's personal credibility has at the same time run into a barrage of blows, of which Sagawa Kyubin is only the latest. Since the turn of the year Mr Hosokawa, usually inspired by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, his backroom strategist, has failed at least three times to impose his will on the coalition, On each occasion the SDP forced him into a humiliating U-turn. This was true of his failed plans for a rise in consumption tax in February, for a cabinet reshuffle last month and, more recently, for a merger of coalition members into a single party. One political commentator yesterday likened Mr Hosokawa to a becalmed warship taking hit after hit, but unable to turn away from the guns. This latest hit is especially dangerous because it threatens the prime minister's main electoral asset; his image as an honest dealer able to break with the corrupt politics of the LDP era. So it is no surprise that Mr Hosokawa's popularity has plunged, to 47.6 per cent late last month from a record high of 70 per cent when he took power last August, according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun poll. Yet Mr Hosokawa's ability to ride through rough patches has surprised even his own supporters, so he cannot be written off yet. Even now, he is still far more popular than was Mr Takeshita when he faced a similar problem at the end of his administration in 1989, or the LDP now. For the opposition's budget-blocking tactics have aroused enough public distaste to shave one point from its own popularity rating, down to 27 per cent at the end of March. While the LDP is aggressive, it is also painfully aware it is in poor shape to fight another election. That was driven home last week when it lost a gubernatorial election in the eastern prefecture of Ishikawa to the first candidate backed by all coalition parties. Shocked by this setback, 150 LDP politicians agreed three days later to sink their traditional factional differences and form a group to 'revitalise' the party under the leadership of Mr Taro Nakayama, a former foreign minister. Mr Hosokawa, meanwhile, is said to have sunk into gloom, and begun to spend an increasing amount of time on his own. It is anybody's guess when his patience, or that of his supporters, will run out.</p>

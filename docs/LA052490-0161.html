			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUIT FILED OVER PLEDGE IN NEA GRANTS;  </P> <P> FUNDING: A NEW YORK SCHOOL CALLS ANTI-OBSCENITY LANGUAGE A RESTRAINT ON  ARTISTIC FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. LITIGATION ADDS A NEW DIMENSION TO THE  CONTROVERSY.  </P> <P> The New School for Social Research in New York City filed suit against the  National Endowment for the Arts Wednesday -- arguing that a requirement that  NEA grant recipients pledge not to produce obscene work is an illegal restraint  of artistic free expression.  </P> <P> In filing the action in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the New School --  which in recent weeks has retained the prominent New York First Amendment  expert Floyd Abrams as an adviser -- has introduced a new dimension into the  political controversy over the NEA's artistic independence.  </P> <P> The New School filed the lawsuit after concluding, its president said, that  accepting a $45,000 grant from the NEA to redesign a courtyard at its Greenwich  Village campus would require it to pledge to obey disputed anti-obscenity  language in the NEA's 1990 appropriation bill. The NEA's own general counsel,  Julie Davis, has said unequivocally that, in her opinion, the language in the  bill is unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The suit, which was assigned to Dist. Court Judge Louis Stanton, seeks a  declaratory judgment -- a finding that a law is unconstitutional before anyone  has actually been charged with violating it -- and an injunction against an NEA  requirement that grantees receiving 1990 funds sign a form acknowledging that  they will comply with the pornography restrictions.  </P> <P> Under the law in question, the NEA is precluded from providing money to support  art the endowment judges to be "obscene, including but not limited to  depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children  or individuals engaged in sex acts" when the art in question lacks "serious  literary, artistic, political or scientific value."  </P> <P> "We believe the NEA's transformation of an already unconstitutional instruction  given to it by the Congress into an oath required of all grant recipients  greatly amplifies the chilling effect of the underlying law," said a statement  released by the New School.  </P> <P> Jonathan Fanton, an American history scholar who is the New School's president,  conceded that, at first flush, the decision to sue over the grant for a design  project may seem an unlikely forum in which to raise a constitutional challenge  against an already beleaguered federal agency. (The project is slated to engage  internationally known sculptor Martin Puryear, and architect Michael Van  Valkenburgh.)  </P> <P> But in an interview, Fanton said the New School had decided to take on the NEA  largely based on his own reading of 20th-Century American history, which led  him to conclude that political chemistry may be developing in the country today  that is ideologically similar to the early stages of the McCarthy era of the  1950s and the Red Scare after World War I.  </P> <P> "I see the stakes here as much higher than the grant or the NEA," Fanton said.  "It seems to me that there are times in American history when the society seems  less strong (than at others) on First Amendment rights.  </P> <P> "We tend to be prepared to qualify the First Amendment when we are having  confidence problems as a nation. I see some early warning signs. You may think  of McCarthyism as a phenomenon of the 1950s, but it owes its origins to the  1940s. (Developments like) McCarthyism do not just happen, full blown, out of  nowhere."  </P> <P> The decision to sue the NEA came after nearly a month of correspondence between  the New School and NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer in which the New School  raised a series of broad objections to the obscenity language.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer has repeatedly said in public appearances, interviews and private  conversations that the wording is unnecessary and superfluous. He has actively  sought to persuade congressmen and senators to abandon it in future legislation  bearing on the arts agency.  </P> <P> The filing of the court action Wednesday afternoon puts the arts endowment in  the curious position of being the key defendant in a lawsuit in which its own  top officials have said they agree with the legal position taken by the party  suing them. The New School, a respected, progressive university, operates  instructional divisions in the liberal arts, social sciences, art and music --  most in New York City, but including the Otis/Parsons Art Institute in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> In one letter to Frohnmayer, Fanton asked whether the legal effect of signing  the anti-obscenity pledge could cause the New School to be subject to  disciplinary action if ever an art exhibit shown in the courtyard contains work  that is judged to be obscene.  </P> <P> Fanton noted that the wording in the NEA funding bill -- a mixture of passages  from a landmark 1974 U.S. Supreme Court decision, and wording proposed to rein  in the NEA by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) -- may conflict with existing New  School policies guaranteeing academic freedom. The wording, Fanton argued, puts  academic institutions in a difficult position.  </P> <P> "We believe it would be a sad outcome of the NEA obscenity condition if some of  this nation's best arts institutions and individual artists severed  relationships with the National Endowment for the Arts," Fanton wrote  Frohnmayer on April 27. "And yet the present dilemma threatens just such a  result."  </P> <P> Frohnmayer declined to comment on the New School litigation and the arts  endowment declined to say immediately how it would respond to the lawsuit.  </P> <P> The NEA's Davis and other lawyers contend the NEA funding law is  unconstitutional because the obscenity language is vague and constitutes an  unlawful prior restraint on creation of artwork. Lawyers have also asserted the  wording transfers judgment of what is obscene to a federal agency -- the NEA --  when the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that such decisions can only be made  by local communities.  </P> <P> The suit by the New School was the second piece of litigation to come into play  in the NEA controversy this week. On Monday, New York City artist David  Wojnarowicz sued the American Family Assn. and its director, the Rev. Donald  Wildmon, for copyright violation and defamation of character over Wildmon's  distribution of severely cropped versions of Wojnarowicz images, which Wildmon  characterized as obscene and offensive.  </P> <P> In a May 2 letter to Fanton, the NEA chairman -- a former Portland, Ore., trial  lawyer -- said of the controversial law: "I am obligated to uphold it until  such time as it is withdrawn, deemed unconstitutional or otherwise modified."  </P> <P> "I cannot tell you how to proceed either in a legal forum or otherwise,"  Frohnmayer said. But "we too have severe questions about the constitutionality  of this law. I share . . . your concern about the effect of this law; about  increasing constrictions on the ability of artists to speak freely through  their art, and about an increasingly intolerant, but vocal part of our  society."  </P> <P> The lawsuit was filed despite a Tuesday night phone call from NEA counsel Davis  to New School lawyer Abrams, in which she tried to persuade him to drop the  proceedings.  </P> <P> The decision to file the lawsuit came after weeks of consideration at the New  School to reject the NEA money outright, a tactic already embraced by at least  two artists -- New York theater producer Joseph Papp and Venice choreographer  Ferne Ackerman.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with the decision said the choice to sue to effect  constitutional invalidation of the NEA obscenity statute came after New School  officials decided the situation required action with more far-reaching  implications than simply turning down the money.  </P> <P> It was not clear what direct effect the New School lawsuit would have on  pending bills to renew the NEA for another five years and provide funds for it  in 1991. Even if the New School petition is successful in getting an injunction  against enforcement of the law, key congressmen said the legal battle would  likely have little bearing on decisions in Congress on the NEA in the next few  weeks.  </P> <P> "I would guess most members (of Congress) would say, 'Let the Supreme Court  decide it,' " said Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.), a key NEA supporter. "It (the  legal dispute between the NEA and the New School) wouldn't be controlling."  </P></p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Cominco suspends half-year dividend COMINCO, the Canadian base metals group buffetted by a series of setbacks in recent years, has suspended its semi-annual dividend. The Vancouver-based company also said yesterday that it plans to seek financial compensation from Lurgi, the German engineering firm, for a disastrous investment in a CDollars 160m (USDollars 126m) lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia. The smelter, which uses technology supplied by Lurgi, has been idle since shortly after it was commissioned in late-1989. Mr Norman Keevil, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday that Cominco now expects to spend CDollars 100m to modify the smelter. He said the facility will probably be converted from Lurgi's QSL process to the Kivcet technology developed in Kazakhstan. Mr Keevil said that tests have shown that the Kivcet process 'has the reduction capacity and availability that we need at Trail'. Cominco paid a semi-annual dividend of 15 Canadian cents a share last December. It suffered a loss of CDollars 30.2m last year following a CDollars 41.3m setback in 1991. Cominco has also struggled to achieve full production at its new Red Dog zinc mine in Alaska, and has been hit by falling metal prices.</p>

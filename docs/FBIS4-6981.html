			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Newly installed Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata is ready to form a new cabinet without a  Diet majority on Tuesday, following the Social Democratic  Party's [SDP] decision to quit the coalition.    Hata told reporters early Tuesday he will make a last-ditch  appeal to the SDP, the largest component in the coalition, to  drop its decision, which would strip a new coalition government  of a crucial majority of seats in the 511-member House of  Representatives.    Hata added he is ready to meet SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama  at any time over the matter.    Political sources said Hata will appeal to  middle-of-the-road  and right-wing members of the SDP to take part in the coalition  if the party does not reverse the decision.    Hata and the coalition leaders are also likely to maneuver  to  gain support from elements of the largest opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), the sources added.    Non-SDP coalition party leaders are scheduled to discuss the  situation at 10 a.m. [0100 GMT] Tuesday morning in the wake of  the SDP's announcement.    On Tuesday morning Murayama reiterated the party's  determination to leave the coalition in protest at the abrupt  formation of a new 130-member parliamentary group named Kaishin  in the lower house by five groups, including Hata's Shinseito.    The SDP views the formation of Kaishin as a "breach of  trust"  by its coalition partners, because it was not consulted about  the new group.    Murayama stated the SDP's position in an interview on a  Japan  Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) television news program. But he was  very cautious about seeking an early general election in the  middle of an economic slowdown.    The SDP will formally decide to withdraw from the coalition  at an emergency meeting of its central executive committee at  9:30 a.m. Tuesday, SDP officials said.    Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, one of key  coalition strategists, told reporters early Tuesday morning that  Hata will definitely form a new cabinet despite the SDP's  departure from the coalition.    The LDP is also scheduled to have an executive meeting  Tuesday morning on how to cope with the newly emerged situation,  with the focus on maintaining its unity, LDP officials said.    A large-scale reshuffle of cabinet ministers is expected  because the SDP had six cabinet ministers in the coalition  cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Hata's policy speech to the Diet scheduled for Tuesday  afternoon has been postponed because of the delay of forming the  new cabinet, Diet officials said.</p>

Panfilov: "Russians Have Nowhere to Go nor </F> Money to Do It. They May Become Hostages of Diplomacy"]    [Text] A high-ranking diplomat of the Russian Embassy in  Dushanbe indicated to an Interfax correspondent that the flow of  the Russian-speaking population out of Tajikistan decreased  sharply. He believed however, that this is connected not with  stabilization of the situation in the republic, but with the  fact that Russians remaining in Tajikistan have "nowhere and no  one to go to nor money to do it," primarily because the bulk of  the population lacks money for the most essential products, to  say nothing of renting a railway container. At present it is  also difficult to sell an apartment inasmuch as those wishing to  acquire housing have done so long ago or occupied vacant  apartments which cannot be denied even by the authorities.  Robbery is so common that, as the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent was told, people may be robbed in broad daylight  in Dushanbe having their shoes or a suit someone liked taken.    As underscored by the Russian diplomat in his interview with  Interfax, around 368,000 Russian-speaking citizens left  Tajikistan over a four-year period. According to the census  there were 495,000 Russian speakers living in the republic in  1989, of whom 288,600 were ethnic Russians. Thus around 100,000  Russian speakers now remain in Tajikistan 80 percent of whom  reside in the Leninabad Oblast, in the north of the republic,  where combat operations have never taken place. Almost no  Russians at all remain in the south of Tajikistan, for instance  in the Khatlon Oblast, except for those in mixed marriages.  According to the diplomat practically all of the  Russian-speaking population of Tajikistan would like to leave  for permanent residence in Russia, but lack of money "is an  insurmountable obstacle."    The revelations of the Russian diplomat differ sharply from  what was just recently announced by Andrey Kozyrev, the Russian  Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs and General Colonel Boris  Pyankov, former commander of CIS Commonwealth Peacemaking Forces  in Tajikistan. In explaining Russian military presence they  constantly recalled that they are performing a noble mission in  protecting the Russian-speaking people against oppression by  "Islamic fundamentalists." Tajikistan officials usually  exaggerate figures in listing Russian-speaking citizens thereby  gaining the support of both diplomats and the military. But the  admission made by the Russian Embassy representative may evoke  sympathy even among observers since, if the diplomat is to be  believed, only around 20,000 Russian speakers, who are prepared  to leave given the opportunity, remain in the main part of  Tajikistan (beside the northern Leninabad Oblast isolated by two  mountain ranges). This evidently explains the apparent slowness  of Tajik authorities in adopting the law on dual citizenship and  granting Russian the status of a second state language, which  was promised by Emomili Rakhmanov back in the spring of 1993,  when the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual aid  between Tajikistan and Russia was being prepared for signing. It  is true, even then it was clear that the new regime would be  unable to retain the Russian-speaking population, inasmuch as  instead of stability there came crime--robberies, brigandage,  murders. The Russian Embassy did not complain when Russian  citizens--journalists or businessmen, were assaulted. It appears  that the Embassy never did lodge a strong protest concerning the  murder of a Christian Baptist family and a deacon of the Nikolsk  Orthodox Church--at least it was never reported by any of the  news agencies represented in Tajikistan. The Embassy remains  silent as militant people's front members rape Russian girls (on  8 December of last year, for instance, two female friends were  raped and murdered in the basement of House No. 36 on the 6th  Driveway on Gafurov Street in Dushanbe).    If the revelations of the diplomat were disseminated on  purpose then could Russian diplomacy change its attitude to  events in Tajikistan at all? Extending political and military  support to the Dushanbe regime the Russian government most  probably intended preserving the even then considerably thinned  out Russian-speaking colony. The Russian community, which has  externally preserved a position of neutrality for a long time,  is suddenly becoming active, at first declaring that military  presence of the Russian army must be continued as long as  possible and two months ago demanding a quota of Russians in the  Tajik parliament. The first demand is also quite explainable by  the fact that architect Valeriy Yushin, chairman of the Russian  community, is a member of the Russian National Council, whereas  the second one diverges somewhat from what was said by Emomili  Rakhmanov concerning the status of the Russian language and dual  citizenship. Can a citizen of Russia and Tajikistan  simultaneously be a member of the Legislative Assembly of  Tajikistan. The language parity is preserved somewhat by the  fact that three Russian-language republic and one oblast  (Leninabad Oblast) newspapers are still published in Tajikistan  even though with a limited circulation. The amount of television  and radio programming in the Russian language has not increased.  At the same time, as strange as that may appear, the opposition  "Voice of Free Tajikistan" is broadcasting in Russian and Uzbek  (and, of course, in Tajik) from the territory of Afghanistan.  The shortage of Russian teachers in secondary schools and  instructors in the higher educational establishments is already  being felt in Leninabad Oblast as well.    The failure of Russian policy aimed at preserving  Russian-speaking colonies in former Soviet republics is quite  evident. It is likewise clear that resolution of internal civil  strife by military means is not a panacea for the political  impotence of diplomacy. In several months when the number of  Russian-speaking citizens of Tajikistan decreases further, the  presence of Russian troops waging a struggle against "Islamic  fundamentalism," may acquire a different coloration.</p>

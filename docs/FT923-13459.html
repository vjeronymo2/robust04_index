			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Japan 'audio tape dumping margin rises' THE 'dumping' margin between the domestic retail price of Japanese audio cassette tapes and the price in the EC market continued to widen even after protective duties were imposed by the EC, Brussels sources claimed yesterday. EC officials were responding to Tokyo's accusation that duties were unfairly levied on Japanese cassettes in 1990. Last week's attempt by the Gatt anti-dumping committee to reconcile the two trading partners failed. Japan could ask the Gatt disputes panel to rule on the issue. The difference between Japanese and EC prices was between 44 and 64 per cent in the three years up to 1988, according to Brussels. The duties imposed on four Japanese manufacturers ranged from 15 to 25 per cent. The EC says that underpriced cassettes imported into the EC 'literally destroyed' the Community industry - now with only one large cassette manufacturer - BASF, the German chemicals group. EC member states yesterday gave their formal approval to the agreement with the US to limit direct and indirect government support for new commercial airliner projects.</p>

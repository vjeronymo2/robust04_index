Responsibility for the implementation of the  Russian Federation Federal Assembly State Duma Decree "On  Declaring an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of the  Russian Federation Constitution" (hereinafter referred to as the  amnesty decree) is placed:    (a) on the bodies responsible for enforcing punishment --  for convicted persons kept in places of detention.    Implementation of the amnesty decree is effected in  accordance with a decision of the chief of the corrective labor  institution sanctioned by a prosecutor. The following are  attached to this decision: a record of rewards and sanctions,  the convicted person's personal file, and other documents needed  to decide on the application of an act of amnesty;    (b) on inquiry and preliminary investigation bodies -- for  persons whose cases and documents on whose crimes are being  processed by these bodies;    (c) on courts:    for persons whose cases and documents on whose crimes are  being processed by the courts and had not been examined prior to  the entry into force of the amnesty decree, and also for persons  whose criminal cases have been examined but sentences have not  come legally into force;    for convicted persons for whom the enforcement of sentences  has been deferred in instances and under the procedure  stipulated by law and persons who have received a conditional  sentence in accordance with Article 44 of the RSFSR Criminal  Code (the question of the application of an act of amnesty is  decided by a court following a submission by the internal  affairs body monitoring the convicted person's conduct);    for persons sentenced to be fined, if the fine has not been  paid prior to the entry into force of the amnesty decree (the  question of the application of an act of amnesty is decided by  the court which passed sentence);    for persons released on parole and persons who have had the  unserved part of their sentence commuted prior to the coming  into force of the amnesty decree (the question of the  application of an act of amnesty is decided by the court which  made the ruling to allow parole or commute the unserved part of  a sentence);    for persons sentenced by Russian Federation courts who are  serving their sentence on the territory of other states which  were formerly part of the USSR (a ruling on the application of  an act of amnesty is made by the court which passed sentence);    (d) on internal affairs bodies:    for persons whose sentences have come legally into force and  who have been sentenced to imprisonment but who are not in  custody;    for persons serving their sentence in the form of corrective  work not involving custody or disqualification from the holding  of given posts or from given activities;    (e) on the commands of disciplinary battalions -- for  servicemen sentenced to be assigned to a disciplinary battalion.    2. A decision on the application or nonapplication of an act  of amnesty is adopted for each person individually. In the  absence of necessary information on the convicted person  examination of the question of the application of an amnesty is  deferred pending the receipt of additional materials.    Bodies responsible for the implementation of the amnesty  decree are granted the right to demand that the institutions in  question provide court files and other materials needed to  decide questions linked with the application of an amnesty.  Such demands must be met immediately.    3. Decisions on the application of an act of amnesty adopted  by inquiry and preliminary investigation bodies, internal  affairs bodies, and also the commands of disciplinary battalions  are sanctioned by a prosecutor.    When an act of amnesty is applied by courts the  participation  of a prosecutor is mandatory.    4. The amnesty decree applies to persons who committed  crimes prior to the entry into force of the present decree.    5. It is to be explained that when an act of amnesty is  applied:    (a) subparagraph "a" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree  applies to persons who:    served as a serviceman or a civilian in the USSR Armed  Forces  during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945;    participated in the Great Patriotic War as a member of a  partisan detachment, people's volunteer militia, extermination  battalion, or underground organization operating against the  German occupationists;    served as a serviceman or a civilian in the USSR Armed  Forces  which participated in combat operations against Japan in 1945.    Subparagraph "a" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree  applies  to persons awarded the "Victory Over Germany in the Great  Patriotic War of 1941-45" medal or the "Victory Over Japan"  medal and also to persons who participated in combat operations  to defend the interests of the USSR during the period preceding  the Great Patriotic War or after it ended; to persons who  participated in eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl  AES accident and are entitled to special benefits; and also to  persons who have performed military service on the territory of  the Transcaucasus and Baltic states and the Republic of  Tajikistan;    (b) subparagraph "b" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree  also applies to female minors;    (c) subparagraph "c" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree  applies to males born before 1 January 1934;    (d) subparagraph "d" of paragraph 1 of the amnesty decree  applies to persons deemed by the Medical and Labor Expert  Commission of the Russian Federation Ministry for the Social  Protection of the Population to be Group 1 and Group 2 invalids  prior to the coming into force of this decree, and also to  persons deemed by a Medical and Labor Commission of a Russian  Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs medical department to be  Group 1 or Group 2 invalids, following confirmation of the group  by a commission of the Medical and Labor Expert Commission of  the Russian Federation Ministry for the Social Protection of the  Population within six months of the entry into force of the  amnesty decree;    (e) paragraph 2 of the amnesty decree does not apply to  persons who, in addition to a crime committed through  negligence, have also been convicted of a crime committed  deliberately;    (f) paragraph 3 of the amnesty decree applies to males born  after 1 January 1976;    (g) the served part of a sentence stipulated in paragraphs 2  and 5 of the amnesty decree is calculated to the date that the  present decree comes into force.    6. The serving of a sentence in the form of noncustodial  corrective work ends from the day that internal affairs bodies  file a decision on the application of an act of amnesty approved  by a prosecutor.    7. The amnesty decree does not extend to persons subject to  administrative punishment, including persons culpable under  administrative law but freed from criminal liability in  accordance with the procedure stipulated by Articles 50 and 51  of the RSFSR Criminal Code.    8. When applying an act of amnesty to persons whose length  of sentence has been reduced by pardon or amnesty, it is  necessary to proceed from the length of sentence prescribed in  accordance with the acts of pardon or amnesty.    9. Amnestied persons are released from both their basic  punishment and additional punishment if the latter has not been  carried out by the date that the amnesty decree comes into force.    10. In accordance with paragraph 7 of the amnesty decree the  part of the sentence which has not been served on the date that  the said decree comes into forces is eligible for reduction.  This point applies to convicted persons whose sentences have  entered legally into force prior to the entry into force of the  said decree.    11. When applying the amnesty decree convictions which have  been quashed or lifted in accordance with the procedure  stipulated by law and also convictions for crimes which have  been excised from the RSFSR Criminal Code are disregarded.  Furthermore, the convictions of persons previously convicted  for crimes of negligence, irrespective of the form of  punishment, and also of persons sentenced for premediated crimes  to noncustodial punishment are disregarded.    12. Malicious violators of the terms [governing the serving  of their sentence] are to be defined as persons who:    (a) systematically violate established discipline and order  while serving their sentence;    (b) have been convicted, interned in deportation colonies,  or  sent to other types of corrective labor colonies if, after the  court ruling that they be sent to a corrective labor  institution, they have been in custody for less than one year on  the day that the materials relating to the application of an act  of amnesty is examined. The term is calculated from the date  that the convicted person is taken into custody;    (c) persons sentenced to noncustodial corrective work who,  because they have deliberately evaded serving their sentence,  have their unserved term of corrective work replaced by a  custodial sentence, if they have been in custody for less than  six months on the date that the materials relating to the  application of an act of amnesty are examined.    13. In accordance with subparagraph "e" of paragraph 8 of  the amnesty decree an act of amnesty cannot be applied to  persons released early from custody since 1985 (irrespective of  whether their conviction has been quashed or lifted) under the  pardons procedure or on the basis of the USSR Supreme Soviet  Presidium decrees:    "On an Amnesty in Connection With the 40th Anniversary of  the  Soviet People's Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45,"  dated 26 April 1985;    "On the Release From Detention of Certain Categories of  Women," dated 6 November 1986;    "On an Amnesty in Connection With the 70th Anniversary of  the  Great October Socialist Revolution," dated 18 June 1987;    and also on the basis of the USSR Supreme Soviet decree of  28  November 1989 "On an Amnesty for Former Servicemen of the  Contingent of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan Who Have Committed  Crimes," the USSR law of 1 November 1991 "On an Amnesty for  Servicemen Who Have Evaded Military Service," and the Russian  Federation Supreme Soviet decree of 18 June 1992 "On an Amnesty."    Convicted persons who have been released in connection with  the reduction of their sentence under the pardons procedure or  on the basis of the aforementioned acts and persons who have had  the unserved part of a term of detention commuted should also be  regarded as having been granted early release from punishment.    14. Materials relating to persons affected by the amnesty  decree who have had been ordered under the prescribed procedure  to undergo treatment for alcoholism, drug addiction, or venereal  disease are examined after the convicted persons have completed  the complete course of treatment but no later than six months  after the completion of the implementation of the amnesty decree.    The grounds for deeming that a course of treatment for  venereal disease has been completed are a medical ruling or --  in the case of persons for whom a court has prescribed  compulsory treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction -- a court  ruling on terminating the compulsory treatment.    15. The amnesty decree also applies to persons who were  convicted by USSR courts on the territory of another state and  are serving their sentence on the territory of the Russian  Federation.    16. In cases when the question of the application of an act  of amnesty arises after the expiry of a six-month period from  the day that the amnesty decree comes into force, application of  the act is effected in accordance with the procedure stipulated  by paragraph 1 of the said decree.    17. The regulation personnel strength of corrective labor  institutions and remand centers and also of the prisoner escort  service is not to be reduced.    18. Organs of executive power of the components of the  Russian Federation are to ensure monitoring of the  implementation of the amnesty decree.    19. Organs of local self-government in cities and rayons are  to:    (a) organize prompt record-keeping on all persons released  from punishment on the basis of the amnesty decree and make  everyday and job arrangements for them no later that 15 days  after they arrive in their place of residence;    (b) find places in homes for the disabled for invalids and  elderly persons who have been released from punishment and do  not have relatives able to support them.    20. Organs of local self-government in cities and rayons are  to ensure that juveniles released from punishment on the basis  of the amnesty decree are promptly included in their records  when they arrive in their place of residence, passed into the  supervision of parents or guardianship and wardship agencies,  and found places when necessary in children's homes, boarding  schools, or vocational and technical colleges and to coordinate  the work of commissions for juvenile affairs, internal affairs  bodies, and social organizations to reeducate juveniles released  from punishment.

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / People: Unilever shuffles responsibilities Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products manufacturer, has announced a reshuffle of board-level responsibilities involving six directors. On January 1, Morris Tabaksblat will relinquish the chairmanship of the food executive, which co-ordinates Unilever's worldwide food operations, to concentrate on his work with the three-man special committee, the group's most senior decision-making body. He will take over responsibility for central and eastern Europe. He joined the special committee, the other members of which are Unilever's British and Dutch chairmen, in May. Jan Peelen will become chairman of the food executive and will be succeeded as director for east Asia and the Pacific by Alexander Kemner, who is currently responsible for food operations in southern Europe. Charles Miller Smith will succeed Kemner. Hans Eggerstedt, the commercial director, will also take over Miller Smith's responsibilities as financial director. Eggerstedt's responsibilities for Europe will be transferred to Michael Heron, who will continue as director in charge of personnel and external affairs. Though Unilever gave no reason for the changes, it is understood that they are intended mainly to broaden top managers' experience and skills. All the directors except Peelen were appointed to their posts in 1989.</p>

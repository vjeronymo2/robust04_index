			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Business and the Law: One victim to help another - More careful control is needed of methods to trace assets missing in alleged fraud Much has been written about the explosion of fraud in recent years and the dramatic growth of legal methods of locating and recovering the stolen assets. These methods are vital weapons for victims of fraud who need to know, often very quickly, what has become of the money taken from them. Some of these remedies - for example the 'Mareva injunction' by which the defendant's assets are frozen until trial - have worked extremely well and are operated cautiously and fairly. There are, however, grounds for concern over the way others can be misused. Many of the problems arise from the fact that fraud actions frequently involve reliance upon a 'proprietary claim' by the plaintiff. This is a claim by the victim of the fraud that the proceeds of it still belong to him although they have been transferred to third parties. Proprietary claims are particularly important to plaintiffs who believe that the defendant is likely to become insolvent. If the plaintiff has a proprietary claim over the proceeds of the fraud, he will not have to share them with other creditors if the fraudster becomes bankrupt. Proprietary claims are also important where the defendant has 'given the money away' to a spouse, friends or trustees, or passed them on to others who had reason to believe that they were derived from a fraud. Such people, if the plaintiff can identify them and prove that they have received the proceeds of the fraud, can usually be made to repay what they have received. If the plaintiff is able to persuade the court that he has an 'arguable' proprietary claim over the proceeds of an alleged fraud, the court will usually grant orders to help him to find out what has become of them. This is so that he can find out who is holding them and, in appropriate cases, sue those people for their return. It is common sense that all of these people should be sued at the same time. For this reason, the court will assist the plaintiff to ascertain where the money is and who holds it (in the so-called tracing process) before it requires him to prove at a trial that the money belongs to him. In order to enable him to find where the money has gone and what it has been used for, the court will grant a plaintiff who may have a good proprietary claim tracing remedies and investigative powers which rival, and in some respects exceed, those available to the police. As a start to the tracing process the defendant will usually be ordered to serve an affidavit saying what has become of the proceeds of the alleged fraud. Providing this information can be a huge task. The money may have been split up into numerous parts over many years. The ultimate destination of each part will have to be revealed, and any documents relating to the use of the money will have to be collated and disclosed to the plaintiff. While this exercise is often time-consuming for the defendant, it is usually justified if the only alternative is that the plaintiff would be unable to locate money which might ultimately turn out to be his. The problem is that the tracing process may not end with the affidavit. If it is not absolutely clear where the proceeds have gone or what they have been used for, this is frequently only the beginning of a series of further applications made, as one judge put it, in 'the excitement of the chase'. These might, for example, be designed to obtain further documents, to see lawyers' papers (which are not 'privileged' when generated for the purpose of fraud), to appoint a receiver over the proceeds of the fraud to administer 'interrogatories' (written questions which must be answered on oath), to cross-examine the defendant on his affidavit and so on. It is possible for lawyers experienced in fraud claims to keep the tracing process running almost indefinitely with applications of this nature. It is sometimes too tempting to a plaintiff who does not wish to go to the expense (and possibly the risk) of having his action tried to look for an easier route to retrieve the money. The pressure created by these further orders made in the name of the tracing exercise often appear to provide this route. Sometimes, the defendant may find it difficult to believe the plaintiff can be entitled to inflict such inconvenience and expense upon him without the issues having been somehow prejudged, and so he may become demoralised. In other cases, these orders may give the litigation an additional 'nuisance value' in settlement negotiations. In the remainder, the result (whether achieved through settlement or trial) will remain the same - only the cost and the time taken to achieve it will be considerably greater. The problem is not with the tracing process itself - for the victim of a fraud it is frequently vital. It is that the courts are sometimes reluctant to require plaintiffs to show the orders they seek are genuinely needed to assist them. When the court becomes too passive in supervising the tracing process matters can get out of hand. Several large fraud cases have involved months of these sorts of wrangles before trial as the parties become entangled in time-consuming applications and counter-applications ostensibly as part of the tracing process, but in reality seeking to inflict pressure or inconvenience on one's opponent or searching for that elusive knock-out blow. The situation can sometimes resemble Charles Dickens' Jarndyce v Jarndyce, where the parties have become so immersed in litigation that they have all but forgotten its original purpose. Nobody could sensibly object to the need for powerful remedies to assist victims of fraud. So powerful are the remedies which have been developed that control of them is needed to ensure that they do not give rise to victims of their own. The purpose of litigation procedures such as the tracing process should be to ensure a quick and effective trial of the issues in dispute - not to afford a means of imposing unnecessary pressure and expense to prevent one.

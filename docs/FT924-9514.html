			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Arts: Noble savagery - Cinema THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS Michael Mann SIMPLE MEN Hal Hartley LONDON FILM FESITVAL Actor Daniel Day-Lewis has developed a hyphen in his name. This was the first thing to worry me about Michael Mann's frontier epic The Last Of The Mohicans. The second was that it is 'based on the novel by James Fenimore Cooper and the screenplay by Philip Dunne.' For the aesthetically alarmist, 'Cooper-Dunne' spells more trouble than 'Day-Lewis'. Both hyphenations originate in Hollywood's attempt to make life easy for dimwitted audiences. Just as three names are judged de trop for an actor playing a backwoodsman, so Cooper's mazy-majestic novel, full of provocative contraries like pro-British jingoism and hints of miscegenating romance (between white Colonel's daughter Cora and the young Mohican Uncas), must be ironed into a straight-arrow adventure. Philip Dunne wrote the 1936 movie which turned Hawkeye into a sort of frontier Tarzan - Chingachgook's adopted son rather than boon companion - and then WASP-ishly transferred the love affair with Cora from red man to white man. Let us take the film on a line-item basis. It looks magnificent. No hint here of the designer pastels Michael Mann brought to his best-known screen credit Miami Vice, nor of the high-shine futurism he applied to his features Thief and Manhunter. The Adirondacks, circa 1757, are photographed by Dante Spinotti as a green and steaming blur of forest and mountain, mists and waterfalls. Down in the sylvan pathways are Cora and Alice Munro (Madeline Stowe, Jhodi May), being escorted towards Dad's fort by British officer Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington). Camouflaged amid the trees, ready to ravage or rescue, are the heinous Hurons (pro-French) and the nice Mohicans (pro-Brit). As Hawkeye, Day-Lewis sports nipple-length hair, a fetching scowl and an American accent. He is impenetrable, but in this film that is an asset. He stands aloof from the flag-waving political correctness of the first half, where uniformed man is a blot on nature and Chingachgook and Uncas are scripted for silent monologues of noble savagery. And in the second half Day-Lewis's sculpted, glowering impassivity is even more crucial. Anything more fulsome would have spotlighted the silliness of the romance and its visual consummation in a waterfall-curtained cave. Here Hawkeye and Cora hurl vows of love at each other before H hurls himself - the movie's most conspicuous moment of daft bravado - out through the liquid curtain into the exploding cadenza of foam. But the higher it climbs, gesturally and geographically, the grander the film becomes. It is clean out of oxygen, but after the early rightmindedness we cheer the new lightheadedness. No more piety about man versus nature or colonisers versus colonised: just man versus man, in blurring permutations of race and colour, on beetling precipices and giddying crags. Nor is woman lost in the melee. Madeline Stowe, whose tremulous mezzo-voiced beauty had critics marking their cards in Unlawful Entry, lends a sterling terror to Cora, and Jhodi May has an unforgettably poignant moment as she teeters above a suicide fall. By this time, of course, Fenimore Cooper's own story lies smashed and unrecognisable at the bottom of the valley. As a fan, I mourn. Cooper's prose may be famously ponderous, but a film is still to be made that does justice to his darkly winding storytelling and to the ambivalence of Natty Bumppo, that sage and savage once dubbed by Balzac literature's 'moral hermaphrodite.' (Even the name is gentrified for this movie: he is 'Nathaniel Poe"). But Mann's movie, by the time it starts moving, is at least a romp. Already Dollars 50m to the good in America, it joins Clint's Eastwood Unforgiven in suggesting that the long-presumed-dead Western may be clambering out of its coffin even as we speak. Like The Last Of The Mohicans, Hal Hartley's Simple Men is about two siblings seeking their father. Only they are brothers not sisters and they drift south-easterly into Long Island rather than carving up New York State. With tomahawks replaced by Tacitean dialogue, the only red man in sight is the cranky jail-escaped ex-radical their father. I wanted to like the film. Hartley's first two features, The Unbelievable Truth and Trust, were riddling tales of criminal and romantic passion set in Nowhereville, US. Non-sequitur dialogue was played against sweetly vestigial plot suspense, rather as if Samuel Beckett had been brought in to script a small-town soap. But in Simple Men the pretensions have grown large and everything is big with self-admiring mystery. Failed bank robber Bill (Robert Burke) links up with bookish brother Joe (William Sage) as they roam their semi-rural Ultima Thule: a place of strange women (innkeepers, Romanian epileptics, chain-smoking nuns), strange colour co-ordinations (Hartley never travels without a suitcaseful of filters) and strangely irritating mantric proverbs. 'There's nothing but trouble and desire,' says someone. 'There's nothing like a machine to make a man feel insignificant,' says someone else. And there's nothing more tiresome than a movie that asks its own audience to join in its search for a plot and purpose. Simple Men, I suspect, is working out some filial problem of Hartley's that never communicates itself to the filmgoer: except as an obscurantist version of that old chestnut about the love of a good woman (or even a bad one) liberating the child from the tyranny of the parent. With the London Film Festival beginning today, long tentacles of celluloid are reaching towards us from the South Bank. We have already hinted at the event's size. Wrestling with the festival booklet and accompanying literature, one feels like Captain Nemo shortly after his introduction to the giant squid. The strongest focus is on British cinema. As well as flaunting a sponsored Pounds 10,000-pound cash prize for the UK film voted best by audiences, the festival showcases some 20 new British features, even if the names of some directors involved (Susan Seidelman, Krzysztof Zanussi) plant a question mark over the word 'British'. But what price nationality in the age of the co-production? At this year's LFF, medium-hot tickets include a Spanish film starring Terence Stamp and Patsy Kensit (Pilar Miro's Prince Of Shadows), a French film directed by Poland's leading woman film-maker (Agniezska Holland's Olivier Olivier), a Canadian film with a Polish-Australian star (Gosia Dobrowolska in Guy Maddin's Careful), and Italian actress Stefania Sandrelli revealing all, including a talent for fluent Spanish, in Bigas Luna's rampant sex comedy Jamon Jamon. Happily, there are also mono-cultural masterworks: films like Daniel Bergman's Sunday's Children, Zhang Yimou's The Story Of Qiu Ju and Akexandre Rockwell's crackling all-American comedy about film-making In The Soup. And in the festival section called 'Electronic Image' notions of nationhood dissolve almost completely. That divisive thing called dialogue is replaced by the increasingly universal sign-systems of the video and computer age. Work here by, with or about Derek Jarman, Lindsay Kemp, Nam June Paik and Japanese computer maestro Yoichiro Kawaguchi. For the nostalgics among us, there are revivals, restorations and reconstructions. Visconti's The Leopard; Ridley Scott's Blade Runner: The Director's Version; and British cinema at its most Gainsborough-ish in the 1947 Jassy, newly refurbished by the National Film Archive. Margaret Lockwood, gorgeous costumes, hissable villains and all that jassy. They don't make films like that any more, but at least they lovingly restore them.</p>

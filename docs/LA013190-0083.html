			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPA REJECTS WAIVER OF TIGHTER STANDARDS AT CARSON SEWAGE PLANT;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: PLANT PUMPS ESTIMATED 365 MILLION GALLONS OF EFFLUENT INTO OCEAN  DAILY. SANITATION OFFICIALS SAY THEY'LL FIGHT TENTATIVE DECISION.  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday tentatively rejected a  request for a federal waiver to exempt the Los Angeles County Sanitation  Districts' sewage plant in Carson from tighter treatment standards.  </P> <P> The decision concerns an estimated 365 million gallons of effluent that the  Carson plant pumps daily through ocean outfalls about 1 1/2 miles off the Palos  Verdes Peninsula.  </P> <P> Sanitation officials have argued that the waste is clean enough and that  removing more solids from it would be dangerous because they help cap a layer  of bay sediment contaminated in the 1950s and '60s by hundreds of tons of the  pesticide DDT.  </P> <P> Daniel McGovern, the EPA's regional administrator, rejected both arguments in a  statement issued Tuesday. He said the agency could not legally grant a waiver  based on the DDT concerns and added: "EPA has determined that the discharge is  not needed to ensure that the DDT remains buried."  </P> <P> McGovern said the county sanitation districts failed to meet several key  conditions for a waiver.  </P> <P> "Most importantly, the county did not demonstrate that its waste-water  discharge would allow the natural fish and shellfish populations to thrive on  the Palos Verdes Shelf," he said. "EPA found that many native species that are  sensitive to pollution could not tolerate the county's discharge."  </P> <P> Tuesday's tentative ruling is subject to a public comment period and, if it is  made final, to administrative and judicial appeal. But opponents of the waiver  termed the decision a key turning point in the sanitation districts' 11-year  battle to win an exemption from tougher federal treatment standards.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and lawmakers from coastal communities have long argued that  intensified treatment would spare Santa Monica Bay from large amounts of oil,  grease, toxic metals and other pollutants contained in effluent from the Carson  plant.  </P> <P> "This is a very positive and significant decision for Santa Monica Bay," said  U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica). "EPA is showing its muscle by  demonstrating they are not afraid to 'Just say no' to polluters."  </P> <P> But the sanitation districts issued a statement saying they "disagree strongly"  with the EPA decision, and hinting they will fight if it becomes final. The  statement said there is an "exhaustive amount of evidence" showing the  districts qualify for a waiver, and drew attention to the problem of the buried  DDT.  </P> <P> An estimated 1,800 tons of DDT were discharged in sewage pumped through the  Carson outfalls in the 1950s and '60s, and 200 tons of it are believed to still  be embedded in a 13.5-square-mile area of sediment off Palos Verdes Peninsula.  The sanitation districts contend that solids from the plant have played a key  part in keeping the harmful pesticide buried.  </P> <P> "Because we believe EPA made the wrong decision for the environment, we will  continue to pursue the recourse offered to us by law," the districts' statement  said.  </P> <P> Sanitation officials have estimated it would cost ratepayers $350 million to  meet a federal requirement that sewage plants provide full secondary treatment,  a system that makes use of biological processes to remove 85% of solids from  waste water.  </P> <P> Already, secondary treatment is provided for 60% of the effluent from the  Carson plant, which serves cities stretching from Palos Verdes Estates to  Pomona. But the rest receives primary treatment, a less intensive method of  removing solids that involves settling, screening and the use of chemicals.  </P> <P> The EPA believes that if fewer solids flow through the Palos Verdes outfalls,  natural sedimentation in the area would still keep the DDT covered, said  Loretta Barsamian of the agency's wetlands, oceans and estuaries division.  </P></p>

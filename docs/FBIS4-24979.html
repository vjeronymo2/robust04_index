			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 5 (XINHUA) -- The markets for  B-shares are beginning to become bullish as overseas investors  are optimistic about such markets, according to analysts here.    The B-shares index -- shares of companies in China issued to  foreigners to buy -- rose for 11 trading days and fell for eight  trading days on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in May.    Analysts said that the index opened at 63.18 points and  peaked at 76.70 before hitting bottom at 62.57 on May 3, the  first trading day during the last month.    The index closed at 75.55 on may 27, the last trading day  during the month.    Analysts said that a total of 189 million B-shares changed  hands during month, averaging 9.94 million shares daily, up 74.6  percent over April.    One analyst summarized the movement of B-shares throughout  May as a "breakthrough."    The index of B-shares began to climb from the low in  mid-April and rose substantially in mid-May, he said.    However, the index of A-shares -- shares of companies in  China issued to Chinese to buy -- remained sluggish throughout  May.    Most B-share holders are institutional investors, while most  A-share holders are individual investors, another analyst said.    Relatively speaking, B-share holders are more mature because  they usually make long-term investments, while A-share holders  eye short-term investments, with a strong tendency towards  speculation, he explained.    Analysts agreed that one reason for the bullish market for  B-shares is that China's economy is now operating smoothly, with  its industrial production continuing to rise.    The government's macro-economic control measures have begun  to take effect as shown in a stable increase in state revenues,  the withdrawal of large amounts of currency from circulation and  a big rise in savings deposits in both urban and rural areas.    Another reason is that the China Securities Regulatory  Commission has decided to expand the B-share market, formulate  regulations governing the management of B-shares and improve the  system for revealing information concerning the trading of  B-shares, analysts said.    The scope of B-share investors is expanding, they said. For  example, the Japanese Government has decided to permit Japanese  nationals to invest in the Shanghai Stock Exchange.    The third reason is that overseas investors have been  relieved of worries about the Chinese market.    For instance, the U.S. Government has recently announced the  decision to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status.    At the end of May, the Morgan Stanley Company of the United  States proposed in a report that managers of mutual funds should  increase the ratio of their investments in the Chinese mainland  and Hong Kong to 10 percent from eight percent.</p>

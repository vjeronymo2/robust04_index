			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tax can ruin festive fun THE INLAND Revenue will be an uninvited guest at many Christmas festivities this year. But whether it brings tax-free gifts or a harsh assessment depends on careful planning. Brian Friedman, head of employee benefits at accountant Stoy Hayward, highlights three principal areas to consider during the festive season: Christmas parties, employee gifts and travel by taxi. Christmas parties are the most obvious seasonal benefit earmarked for special treatment by the Revenue. A number of companies have been concerned about the amount they can spend without incurring the tax collector's wrath. The basic rule is that, to avoid any tax liability, the company must entertain only 'on a moderate scale' rather than 'lavishly' (in the words of an extra-statutory concession issued by the Revenue in 1988). That means spending no more than Pounds 50 per head, a limit which has been in place ever since. The figure is based on the number of people who actually attend the party, not the number who have been invited, and it includes spouses. To be eligible for tax relief, the party must also be open to all employees. The concession covers entertainment by a company throughout the year. This means that if it has a summer as well as a Christmas party, the amount spent in total on both events must not exceed the limit. If spending exceeds Pounds 50 a head, the entire amount will be viewed as a benefit in kind subject to tax, and may be treated in two ways. Either the employees pay tax on the extra amount at their marginal rate, or their employer pays that sum directly in addition to the direct outlay on the party. But the Revenue stresses that if the employer deducts the tax from the payroll, only those employees who attended the party must pay. A second seasonal tax risk comes in the form of gifts. Presents with a value below Pounds 100 from a third party, which are not from the employer and are not given in recognition of particular services, come free of tax. Any amount above that limit will be taxable on the excess, while those which can be shown to relate directly to labour performed would be taxable fully as income. The status of gifts from an employer to an employee has been clarified by the Pepper vs Hart decision in the House of Lords last month. It ruled that benefits would be assessed for tax at the marginal cost - or extra cost of producing the goods - rather than average cost. There is, however, a distinction between two types of employee: those who earn below Pounds 8,500 a year, and those who earn more than this amount or are a director of the company. The first group limit will be taxed on the second-hand value of the gift. These employees would be better-off receiving goods such as alcohol or cigarettes, because they have no second-hand value since they require a license to be re-sold. For those above the limit, there is no such option. The Revenue will assess tax on the gift at the greater of either the second-hand value of the goods, or any amount below their marginal cost. In the same way as for gifts from a third party, any payments from an employer which are income related directly to particular services performed are taxable. But those individuals working for companies with profit-related pay schemes will be able to share in tax-free income up to Pounds 4,000, if the business has performed well enough to trigger the targets set by the scheme. With the nights drawing in and deadlines to meet, employees may also be able to avoid paying tax on reimbursements from their employer if they are forced to take a trip home by taxi. An extra-statutory concession allows this if they are occasionally required to work late - meaning after 9pm - and public transport has ceased or become unreasonable to use because of lack of frequency.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> &bull;An associates degree should be determined by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional judgment of the Secretary. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should be determined by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's State licensing agency. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should consist of previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training in the same field of study as that for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the eligible program prepares training. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should, for occupations with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apprenticeship programs, require the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five-year apprenticeship programs. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equivalent of two years of successful academic work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a postsecondary environment or a professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license that required a specific period of training and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perhaps work experience. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equivalent of at least two academic years of study,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to compliance with applicable State laws and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 semester hours or the equivalent. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. What are other measures of ``quality'' for programs of less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 600 hours?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An educational program should be considered to satisfy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary's quality measures if a program that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepares students for State licensure in an occupation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a program that prepares students for certification by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally recognized professional or industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association; or a program that is approved by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally recognized accrediting agency or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No additional measures should be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [New York, Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. How should the required job placement and graduation rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be calculated? How often should the rates be calculated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The methodology and timing for the calculations should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be identical to those required under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education Act and the Student Right-to-Know and Campus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Security Act. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Calculation of completion rates should be based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula used under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Security Act, except that the calculation should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include time-specific constraints. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Calculation of placement rates should be based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula used under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Security Act, except that only completers should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counted in the denominator. No time frame should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in the calculation. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Regulations should define completion rate, graduation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate, and full-time employment (which should specify a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time in a job). [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Calculations should be based over a two-three year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period to reflect long-term trends and avert the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse impact of short-term problems such as those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by economic conditions. Institutions that fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below the minimum rates ought to be provided appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Because there are many State regulations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agency standards governing this area,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions should be allowed to follow the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictive ones. Institutions following the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictive regulations and standards should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to maintain multiple sets of documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating compliance with a variety of regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and standards. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The cohort for calculation of placement rates should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include placement in jobs related to the occupation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which students are trained. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In calculating placement rates, students should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counted as employed if they obtain jobs within 180 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of graduation. Students should be counted as employed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if they obtain jobs in the field for which they were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trained or a related field. Students (such as those in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing education or in the military) who are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> looking for a job should be excluded from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation. The calculation should be based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of graduates. Incarcerated or physically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incapacitated students should be excluded from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What documentation is required to support the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion and job placement rates?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Documentation should be identical to that required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technology Education Act and the Student Right-to-Know  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Campus Security Act. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Documentation should be any documentation required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's State or accrediting agency. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates can be verified through required compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calculations should be included in the Fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operations Report and Application to Participate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FISAP) for the campus-based programs. The time-frame  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reporting this data should be relatively short, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the data is relevant. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A student's placement information should be maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in each student's file. Placement information should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be available for the purposes of audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Institutions should maintain employment records on file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to confirm placements. Employment records should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be submitted to the Department of Education.

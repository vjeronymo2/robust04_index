			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Brittan issues cash transfer ultimatum BANKS must cut their fees for transferring money between European Community countries by the end of the year or risk the EC passing laws to make them improve services, European commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said yesterday, Reuters reports from Brussels. 'By the end of this year the standard of service should be improving, with prices coming down and delays being reduced,' said Sir Leon, who is in charge of banking policy at the EC's executive European Commission. 'Double charging for transfers between banks must become a thing of the past,' Sir Leon told the European Banking Federation, which represents all major banks in the Community. 'Otherwise the momentum which has built up behind improving payment systems will lead inexorably towards pressure for Community-wide legislation,' he said. It was one of the clearest ultimatums so far in a campaign by the Commission to cut the time taken to transfer money from one EC country to another and to lower the often prohibitive costs to business and private customers of sending money abroad. Commission officials have said bank charges on around 200m such transactions each year in the Community amount to about Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.4bn). Cross-border transfers can cost up to 20 times more than domestic transfers in some EC states. Brittan issued a policy paper earlier this year stating that banks should cut some charges, reduce the time taken to move money from one country to another and do so without the Commission twisting their arm.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comments received following the second publication of the earlier proposal were similar in many respects to those received in the first round of comments. As of September 19, 1993, the Department received 219 written comments. Of those, 159 comments were received from Department of Justice employees. Of those, 144, mostly from federal prosecutors from around the country, supported promulgation of the earlier proposal; 1 opposed the rule; and 14 others provided miscellaneous comments. The Department also received 21 comments from federal officials outside the Department, 18 of whom supported the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received 39 comments from individuals and organizations outside of the federal government. These writers included private attorneys, public defenders, state court judges, bar associations, disciplinary officials and others. Twenty-eight writers in that group expressed opposition to the rule while 3 supported the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those writing in support of the earlier proposal generally emphasized three major points. First, they stated that a clear rule governing communications by federal attorneys with represented individuals was critical to the vigorous enforcement of federal law. Several writers stated that the lack of clarity on the matter created by a variety of court and bar association opinions has had a chilling effect on federal enforcement efforts. They stated that some federal prosecutors fearful of the uncertain state of the law and unwilling to risk their licenses to practice law have decided not to engage in routine discussions with represented individuals. Second, several writers described the practice of some attorneys to claim representation of all the employees of a corporate client. They argued that this practice, along with the uncertainty of the state of the disciplinary rules, often makes it exceedingly difficult to investigate wrongdoing by corporations or other organizations. Third, several supporters of the previous proposal stated that they did not believe that it was the intention of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 to apply to criminal investigations. Furthermore, they argued that if the prohibitions in those rules apply to all federal criminal and civil investigations the result will be twofold: (1) Federal attorneys will be forced to reverse the trend of the last 20 years and become less involved in investigations; and (2) federal agents will stop consulting with federal attorneys during investigations. Both of these trends will result in less effective law enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received several comments critical of the earlier proposal. Those criticisms fall generally in four categories. First, several individuals stated that they believed the proposal would exempt Department attorneys from ethical requirements that apply to all other attorneys, thus creating a double standard. Furthermore, they argued that the proposal improperly equated constitutional minimums with ethical conduct. Second, several writers argued that the Attorney General did not have the authority to promulgate such a regulation. They argued that the proposal unfairly impinged on the traditional right of state supreme courts to monitor and discipline attorneys admitted to practice before them. They also questioned whether the drafters of the ``authorized by law'' exceptions could have intended that the Attorney General would be empowered to release Department attorneys from the obligations of the rules simply by issuing a regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, several people argued that the proposed regulation was not necessary for the vigorous enforcement of the law. And fourth, several writers commented on various aspects of the proposal itself. The most common objection was to the ``controlling individual'' test that the proposal used to determine whether communications with a particular employee of a represented corporation would be permissible. They argued that the test was much too narrow and would only apply to a corporation's general counsel and a small handful of very senior executives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has reviewed, analyzed and carefully considered all the comments it received and has made substantial revisions to its earlier proposal based on these comments. The Department believes the current proposal, in combination with the proposed additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual, appropriately addresses the concerns of the commenters critical of the earlier proposal, while preserving the Department's ability to enforce federal laws. Due to the significant nature of the changes made, the Department determined that an additional comment period is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Section-by-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 77.1&blank;Purpose and Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section includes no material changes from the rule published earlier. It does, however, include additional discussion regarding the purpose of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Attorney General's authority to establish standards of conduct for Department of Justice attorneys derives from two distinct sources: Section 301 of title 5, United States Code, and title 28 of the United States Code, which, through a variety of provisions, authorizes the Attorney General and the Department of Justice to enforce federal law. Section 301 states that ``[t]he head of an Executive department or military department may prescribe regulations for the government of his department, the conduct of its employees, [and] the distribution and performance of its business.'' Authority to promulgate this rule also is implicit in the Attorney General's statutory power to ``supervise all litigation'' to which the United States is a party and to direct United States Attorneys and other subordinate attorneys in the ``discharge of their respective duties.'' 28 U.S.C. 519. Other specific statutory references are indicated in the text of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 77.2&blank;Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is substantially similar to the definitional section of the previous proposal. Two changes, however, are worthy of attention:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> ``Attorney for the Government''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, the definition of ``attorney for the government'' has been refined explicitly to exclude from the definition those law enforcement agents employed by the Department of Justice who are also members of state bars, if they are employed as, and are performing the function of, agents rather than attorneys. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency and other investigative agencies have long recruited individuals with advanced degrees_including, for example, engineering, business and law degrees_to serve as agents. The Department strongly encourages the recruitment of educated and specially trained individuals for positions as agents. An agent's bar membership should not adversely affect his or her ability to conduct comprehensive investigations and otherwise to fulfill his or her law enforcement functions. Therefore, the proposed rule specifically exempts attorney-agents from its scope if they are employed by the government as investigative agents and not as attorneys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

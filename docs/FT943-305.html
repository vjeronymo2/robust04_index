			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Russian reform plans spark political turmoil The Russian government is planning a radical legislative programme for the forthcoming session of parliament which starts next week. The emphasis will be on overhauling the state apparatus, developing the legal system to protect the rights of the individual, and introducing more effective competition in the economy. But how much of this programme can be pushed through parliament is unclear as the political tension rises as the economy comes under renewed strain. In an extraordinary interview, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, confirmed that fierce political in-fighting had been taking place behind the scenes and hinted that Mr Yeltsin may be tempted to lurch towards a more authoritarian position. Outlining the government plans, Mr Alexander Yakovlev, the presidential representative in the federal assembly, said there would be also be a series of proposals for reforming the electoral process at both presidential and duma level. But he strongly opposed suggestions that there should be an early presidential election before 1996. 'In the constitution there are fixed terms and they must be respected,' he said. Mr Yakovlev said legislation would focus on the relations between the centre and the regions, which he described as a traditional source of tension throughout Russian history. The government also planned fresh initiatives to strengthen the legal system in the country giving citizens greater means of redress against the intrusions of the state and companies. Mr Yakovlev described Russia as 'a democracy without rights' and suggested there would be a review of the criminal code. Mr Yakovlev also confirmed the government's intention to introduce greater competition into the economy, especially in the banking sector, by means of more effective regulation. Mr Yeltsin has won much praise in the press for his performance in the US, but the newspapers have also been full of accounts of swirling political intrigues between his advisers back in Moscow. In an interview with the Interfax news agency, Mr Kostikov said: 'Will he (Yeltsin) remain the democratic-minded president we knew in 1991 and 1993 or will opportunist ways make themselves felt in his political conduct? In other words, will he be faced with the dilemma: power at all costs or power for the sake of reforms and democracy?' he said. Yet Mr Kostikov's position is itself uncertain given that - unusually - he has remained in Moscow while Mr Yeltsin is travelling abroad. Rumours abound that the president is planning a wholesale reshuffle of his closest advisers.</p>

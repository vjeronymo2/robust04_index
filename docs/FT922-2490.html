			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Extradition ruling angers Mexico MEXICO has reacted furiously to a US Supreme Court ruling that the kidnapping of a Mexican murder suspect was legal, and suspended all US Drug Enforcement Agency activity on its territory. It will also seek to re-negotiate its extradition treaty with Washington, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Mexico's Foreign Relations Ministry said the ruling was 'invalid and unacceptable'. It 'transgresses essential principles of international law', it added. The Mexican government called the kidnapping a criminal act. The US Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Dr Humberto Alvarez Machain, indicted for the torture and murder of a DEA agent in 1985, need not be returned to Mexico as his kidnapping and spiriting away to the US did not break any US law. The decision to repatriate Dr Alvarez was a question for the executive branch, the court said. The ruling overturned an appeal court decision that the abduction was illegal. The Supreme Court decision puts the Bush administration in an awkward position. While it supports the right to seize suspects abroad for trial in the US, it has also called for increased international co-operation in the war on drugs.</p>

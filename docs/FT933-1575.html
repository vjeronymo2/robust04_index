			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Half-baked pay policy returns According to a UK Treasury wag, Kenneth Clarke told his top officials at an early meeting that he had three priorities: first to be a member of the cabinet, second to represent his Nottinghamshire constituency and, third, to be chancellor. These words are probably apocryphal, but indicative of the new spirit in the department. What is not apocryphal is that Mr Clarke has declined to seek a 'pair' for divisions. (British MPs still employ an archaic method of voting by tramping many times through division lobbies. Most ministers try to avoid this by an accord with an opposition member who also agrees not to vote). The chancellor's desire to escape from the Treasury is refreshing. But spending a lot of time gossiping in the lobbies with MPs, some of them the worse for wear after dinner, is an odd method of keeping in touch with the mood of the country. This approach might explain the resurrection of a discredited kind of public sector pay policy. Under Labour, public sector pay was governed by a norm, which was also meant to apply to the private sector. The Thatcher government eventually abolished all pay norms. For a time it persisted with a cash limit for public sector pay; but in the mid-1980s this gave way to overall cash limits. For the year to November 1993, Norman Lamont resurrected, as an exceptional measure, a public pay settlement ceiling of 1 1/2 per cent, which has more or less been observed. The correct justification was that it enabled the public sector to discard fewer workers for any given cash limit; but the Treasury saw it more as a way of getting a grip on public expenditure itself. The natural re-entry was to go back to general public sector cash limits. Instead there is to be a freeze on pay budgets alone - which account for a third of General Government Expenditure. Worse still, a ready-made cop-out is provided for pay increases backed by improvements in what is variously called 'productivity', 'efficiency' and 'performance'. As a former chancellor, Nigel Lawson, has explained in The View from Number Eleven, 'the pay-productivity exhortation is so familiar and uncontentious that it is very difficult to do without it, especially at the dispatch box at the House of Commons, where blunter, market-related arguments go down extremely badly, even on the Conservative side'. Nevertheless he considers it invalid for particular sectors, even though broadly true for the economy as a whole. 'If wage increases were literally related to increases in output per person then all sorts of bizarre consequences would follow. Wages in high technology sectors would shoot ahead and people like teachers and doctors, whose productivity is more difficult to measure, would lag badly . . . Bus drivers, whose productivity diminishes as a result of increasing congestion on the roads, would have their pay cut . . . The true principle is the simpler, but less moralistic one, that pay should be re-lated to the state of particular labour markets,' ie, the re-cruitment and retention rates. Private sector employers may talk the same nonsense about productivity. But they know that in practice the benefits of rapidly improving technology must be shared with the public in the form of price reductions - as in home electronics - or their competitors will force these upon them. They also know that if they allow the pay of workers with low measured productivity increases to fall behind, they will find it hard to recruit. The one certain consequence of the new public sector policy, if cash ceilings are held, will be fewer jobs - whether for the same or for a worse level of service. The government's task will be made more difficult because it is not the paymaster in the greater part of the public sector. The nationalised industries are a law unto themselves. Local authorities are outside direct government control. Moreover, review bodies have unfortunately been established to recommend pay for 1.4m staff, including the armed forces, teachers, doctors and nurses. Review body awards have almost always been above average. Even in the civil service, ministers' hands are tied by a guarantee of partial private-sector comparability. Although public and private sector pay diverge a lot from year to year, over a slightly longer period they move in remarkable harmony - drawn together not by bureaucratic procedures but by labour market forces. The dangers of the new pay policy are: too many public sector job losses in order to offset excessive pay settlements, general miseducation and perhaps greater difficulty in keeping to the spending guidelines. Yet, as Adam Smith once remarked, there is an awful lot of ruin in a nation. For the moment, public sector backsliding is likely to be offset by the far more important shift towards pay flexibility in the private sector, which has been summarised in the September issue of Employment Gazette. First, there has been a fall from two-thirds in 1984 to less than a half in the proportion of employees whose pay is determined by collective bargaining. Second, there has been a shift to more decentralised pay setting. Third is an increase in what is unhappily named 'performance-related pay'. In fact, traditional forms of rewarding effort, such as piece work, have declined, but they have been more than offset by financial participation such as employee shares or profit-related pay. So there is a modest but growing element of pay which is linked to corporate profitability and which represents the best hope for employment in the longer run, by inserting an automatic element of flexibility into employment costs. The extent of the collapse in wage inflation has still to be appreciated. It was a frequent complaint in the 1980s that, in spite of high unemployment and moderate inflation, annual earnings increases remained stuck at 7 1/2 per cent. Now they are down to 3 1/2 per cent. It is not surprising that pay increases have failed to drop quite so far in manufacturing, as international competitive pressures have been dampened in that sector by devaluation. (Manufacturing pay increases were also above the whole economy average when sterling was declining in the early and middle 1980s.) Most remarkable of all has been the behaviour of unit labour costs. Thanks to an unexpectedly vigorous rise in productivity, these have fallen by 1 per cent over the whole economy, even when measured in national currencies. Manufacturing costs have fallen even more, putting Britain in the low-cost lead among the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries. The UK is in a remarkably good competitive position; and so will be John Major if world recovery occurs and he can hold on. Of course the improvement reflects recession pressures. It also reflects the benefits of two years inside the exchange rate mechanism. But it would hardly have gone so far without the labour market shakeout of the 1980s, the more competitive culture and the shift towards pay decentralisation. Charts of national wages cannot, however, show the greater dispersion of pay settlements in line with differing market pressures. This change will ultimately price more people into work; it may already account for a jobs trend that is not as bad as in many parts of the overregulated European Community. The new policies have claimed victims among those at the adverse end of market forces. But the victims will not be helped by stopping the clock. Nor will anyone be helped by half-baked pay policies in the public sector.  ------------------------------------------             PUBLIC EMPLOYEES  ------------------------------------------ Group                                Staff  ------------------------------------------ Civ service inc prisons            570,000 Fringe Bodies                      150,000 Review Bodies   Armed forces                     285,000   Teachers (Eng)                   442,000   Doctors/dentists                 106,000   Nurses etc                       537,000   Top Salaries                       2,000   Other NHS                        360,000 Local white collar                 745,000 Local manual                       888,350 Further education                   86,000 Scottish teachers                   57,400 Universities                       105,150 Police                             145,000 Fire                                41,000 Courts, probation                   16,200 Nat. industries etc                469,500  ------------------------------------------ TOTAL (inc misc)                 5,005,600  ------------------------------------------</p>

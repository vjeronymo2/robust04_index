			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures raced ahead as the trading session drew to a close, cruising through the 3,200 level and closing sharply higher writes Steve Thompson. The market's buoyancy, which followed another strong performance from Wall Street, was in sharp contrast to the early part of the session. The September futures contract opened at 3,198, mirroring the strong showing by Wall Street overnight and a steady performance by US bonds, but quickly ran out of steam, slipping back to the day's low point, 3,186. For most of the day the contract moved narrowly before suddenly rushing up through 3,200. At that key level it prompted a welter of buying from the locals, or independent traders, who rushed in to cover short positions. Dealers also noted heavy arbitraging, selling the future and buying the underlying stocks. The contracts ended the day at 3,225, a hefty premium of 22 points over fair value and an indication that dealers are looking for a strong performance from the market in the short term. Turnover was a slightly disappointing 12,045 contracts. Talk that a specially-tailored FT-SE 100 stock option had been struck at 3,200 also helped spur the market on. Eastern Electricity, topped the list of most active stock options, with 3,458 contracts traded.</p>

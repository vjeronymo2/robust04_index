The Japanese side is  represented by Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi,  while his South Korean counterpart is Son Chun-yong, second  deputy vice foreign minister. Each side has about 20  working-level officials altogether from its ministries concerned  with economic affairs attending the meeting. A wide-ranging  exchange of views is being held on bilateral economic  cooperation. The conference is scheduled to be held on 21 and  22 April.    This conference is being held in accordance with an  agreement  reached at the Japanese-ROK summit meeting in Kyongju, South  Korea, in November 1993. The conference was formed by  reorganizing the previously existing Japanese-ROK Trade,  Business, and Technological Cooperation Committee.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Futures sell-off leaves FT-SE 100 below 3,400 - Market Report The UK equity market was hit by another bout of semi-panic yesterday amid fears of renewed weakness across global bond markets. However, London picked up towards the close of business as Wall Street opened on a steady note and US bonds responded to encouraging inflation news. However, the FT-SE future remained under heavy pressure all day, and traded consistently at a discount to the cash market during the session. The FT-SE 100 index ended the last session of the two-week trading account a net 28.1 lower at 3,378.9, a fall of 96.5, or 2.8 per cent on the week. The FT-SE Mid 250 index retreated 38.9 to 4,030.0, also down 2.8 per cent on the week. The bond/gilt market worries and at least two bearish views of the market from leading brokerages triggered a substantial early slide by the UK equity market. Lehman Brothers' US market strategist was said to have been instrumental in prompting a bout of weakness on Wall Street, after predicting that the Dow Jones Average could retreat by between four to seven per cent. The market was also hit by stories that Mr Nick Knight, the controversial but highly successful strategist at Nomura, the Japanese stockbroker, had predicted a steep fall in the UK market as part of a global market slide. Mr Knight said he expected a sharp correction in international markets, possibly as soon as next week, led by Hong Kong and Continental Europe. 'The Fed has provided a seismic shock to markets and you have to be concerned that world markets are about to hit an air pocket; it could be very nasty short-term,' he said. Mr Knight added that the UK chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, should have cut rates by a half percentage point or held them. 'He's generated uncertainty,' said the Nomura analyst. Whilst maintaining his year-end FT-SE 100 forecast at 4,000, Mr Knight, one of the UK market's biggest bulls in recent months, said the 100 index could fall to 3,200 in the interim period. Another bear story was put forward by Strauss Turnbull, the French-owned stockbroker, whose market strategist, Mr Ian Harnett, pointed out to clients that the valuation of equities compared with index-linked gilts had risen to their highest level since mid-1992. Mr Harnett said that on the three occasions this had happened during the 1990's the FT-SE 100 index had fallen by between 250 to 400 points. The FT-SE 100 opened below 3,400 - more than 24 points down following Wall Street's overnight retreat - and continued to lose ground, led by the FT-SE future, to reach a day's low point of 3,349.3 just ahead of Wall Street's opening. With Wall Street coming in easier, but better than expected, after the producer and retail prices data, and US bonds behaving well, the FT-SE embarked on a determined rally which saw it claw back around half of the day's biggest loss. Turnover was a hefty 1,001.4m shares, with non FT-SE 100 issues accounting for 65 per cent of the day's trading. The value of customer business on Thursday dipped below Pounds 2bn to Pounds 1.974bn. Marketmakers remained nervous but not overly perturbed by the day's events. 'At these levels the market is comfortable, certainly not in disarray,' said one dealer. Others remain concerned about New York. One said: 'You don't see Wall Street plunge almost 100 points without some serious worries.'</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Anyone remember when you could do Europe on $10 a day? This was back in the  early '50s. And while it's possible barely to buy a good pizza for $10 these  days, students can still do Corsica on 10 bucks a day. This is the island off  the French mainland (Napoleon's birthplace), and for $10 you get lodging with a  Corsican family and three meals a day. Or if you prefer, you can choose a  dormitory for the same price in Ajaccio, the Corsican capital. The offer from  the Corsican Travel &amp; Trade Commission is aimed at students (all ages),  youngsters or seniors. The season gets under way in July, ends in September.  Another offer involves a weekend cruise from Nice or Marseille to Corsica, with  a return to Nice, for $99.  </P> <P> Telephone the Corsican Travel &amp; Trade Commission in Orange County -- (714)  458-8868.  </P> <P> Scottish Travel: Between now and May 31, Scottish Travelpasses are selling at  discounts (peak season rates are $88/$112). The passes are intended for Yanks  who prefer not to drive on their holidays. Besides trains, the passes are good  on ferries as well as buses, with a one-third discount. With the pass comes a  discount card entitling travelers to 10%/50% reductions at shops, hotels,  restaurants, tourist attractions.  </P> <P> Details by contacting your travel agent or Scots-American Travel Advisors, 26  Rugen Drive, Harrington Park, N.J. 07640.  </P> <P> Canada by Rail: Summer will mark the inauguration of new transcontinental  luxury train service between Vancouver and Toronto. Up to 188 passengers will  be accommodated in 94 bedrooms, each with private bath/shower, bar, telephone,  TV and VCR. The service will be offered four times a month starting July 1.  Dining will be under the supervision of L'Auberge d'Ill, a Michelin three-star  restaurant in France. Rates start at $1,866 (high season), $1,440 (low season)  for the three-day, 2,900-mile journey. Passengers can book space on the same  train between Calgary and Toronto. Start-up of the new service is good news for  rail fans who expressed disappointment over the recent discontinuation of the  Royal Canadian train that traveled between Vancouver and Montreal.  </P> <P> Details from your travel agent or by calling Blythe &amp; Co. toll-free at  (800) 228-7712.  </P> <P> A Letter From Australia: "We would like to exchange our motor home for a  similar one in California with anyone planning a visit to Australia. As seasons  are reversed, traveling here is better between October and May, and if you want  to visit the Outback (Alice Springs, Ayers Rock, Darwin) or the Great Barrier  Reef (Cairns, Townsville), the best time is April/May. In six to eight weeks  there is time to do both. Our motor home is best suited for two people but will  sleep four. Shower, toilet, hot water, stove, TV. It is a Ford, six cylinders,  automatic and runs on LTG and/or petrol. This is important since it doubles  your range for Outback travel."  </P> <P> Write to Roy Spence, 160 Blackwall Road, Woy Woy, New South Wales, Australia.  </P> <P> Hawaii Rental Guide: A handy new 84-page accommodations guide for Hawaii is  being mailed free by the Hawaii Visitors Bureau.

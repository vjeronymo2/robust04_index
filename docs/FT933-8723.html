			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Reserves push down franc THE French franc and Danish krone came under renewed pressure in the reformed exchange rate mechanism yesterday as dealers took the view that the currencies could not be sustained much longer by high interest rates, writes James Blitz. Both countries have kept liquidity tight in their money markets to preserve their currencies' parities with the D-Mark. But the lack of foreign exchange reserves in their central banks highlighted the weakness in the high interest rate policy. In its reserve figures for the week to August 5, the Bank of France revealed that it probably has a large deficit following intervention to support the French franc earlier this month. Mr Robin Marshall of Chase Manhattan Bank has calculated that the Bank of France has a net debt of FFr350bn and that, even if it were to liquidate all its gold and ecu holdings, it would still be FFr30bn 'in the red'. Mr Marshall's assessment is among the more pessimistic. But the news on the reserves forced the French franc down to a low of FFr3.52 yesterday. It later closed at FFr3.514 to the D-Mark, about a third of a centime down on the day. The Danes may also have few reserves in their central bank because they announced a bond issue worth SFr1bn yesterday, in addition to the Pounds 1.2bn in sterling last week. But the krone also fell back yesterday, falling from about DKr3.406 to the D-Mark to a London close of DKr4.1135. It was striking yesterday that the Danish krone was 6.98 percentage points lower than the Dutch guilder in the ERM grid, compared to the 2.25 percentage points of fluctuation permitted before the ERM reform. The ERM aside, the main focus in currency markets was on the Japanese yen, which again thrust upwards to another post-war high of Y103.00 against the dollar. It later closed in London at Y103.15, down from a previous close of Y103.70. The Bank of Japan intervened substantially to support the currency, with some dealers suggesting that several billion dollars were bought in attempts to push the currency down. The Bank also called for concerted G-7 intervention on the dollar/yen exchange rate, but there was no comment at all on the issue from US officials. The dollar, however, was somewhat stronger against the D-Mark, closing at DM1.7200 from a previous DM1.7180. Dealers said that a modest 0.1 percentage point rise in US retail sales in July had little impact on the currency. Sterling weakened by 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday in the wake of poorer than expected figures for manufacturing output and unemployment in the UK. There are expectations that the British government will cut interest rates, but this was not reflected in money markets. The pound closed at DM2.5175.</p>

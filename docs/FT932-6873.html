			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn EMI pleases Results at the top end of market expectations sent Thorn EMI ahead 26 to 856p. There was also an element of relief that the figures dispelled some of the worries overhanging the stock in recent months. These have included concern over the effect of a US inquiry into rental business, and most lately over the official UK inquiry into compact disc prices. Those troubles were largely forgotten yesterday as a welter of upgrades and buy recommendations were disclosed. In particular, the contribution of Virgin Records, bought last year, defied the more cautious expectations. Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett said: 'One of the most attractive aspects is Thorn's continuing ability to increase its margins in its music business.' Analysts upgraded profits forecasts to a range of Pounds 360m to Pounds 385m for 1993-94.</p>

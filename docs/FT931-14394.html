			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Taking the banks to task Business owners who would once have accepted the bank manager's advice without question have become far more critical. They are now aware of the need to manage the banking relationship. Points they should watch include: If you are unhappy with your bank's charges check with the branch how they are calculated. Errors are common and it is not unknown for a 0 to be added to the interest rate or for penalty rates to be levied on the entire overdraft and not just the excess. If the manager cannot say how he has arrived at a particular level of charges press for an explanation. This should be less common now the banks have published customer charters and more details of their rates but it does sometimes occur. Negotiate on fees but do not forget that the bank has to make a profit too. It makes sense to compare what your bank offers with the competition and use this in negotiations. Ultimately it may be worth changing banks but do not underestimate the inconvenience involved. Make sure the bank you would like to move to will be prepared to take on your account. Some managers are reluctant to take on refugees from their competitors on the grounds that they may be troublemakers. Keep your bank manager informed about the progress of your business on a regular and timely basis. This is more than a chore. It is a useful discipline which will keep you more informed about your business. Make sure the quality of your financial information is high and not just a few jottings on the back of an envelope. If you have bad news to impart make sure you have a plan prepared for putting the problems right. Keep a close eye on the terms and renewal dates of bank facilities so you can plan your negotiating position ahead of the next renewal meeting. Make sure you have a facility letter from your bank to cover any financing you have arranged. Check its contents to see that it matches what you have agreed verbally. If you are required to provide personal guarantees make sure the amount corresponds to the sum borrowed and that there is a time limit. Do not sign unlimited, open-ended guarantees, it will restrict your freedom of manoeuvre. Once a guarantee expires make sure the fact is recorded at Companies House or at the Land Registry or you may have problems raising loans in future.</p>

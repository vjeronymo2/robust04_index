			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMAGINATION IS THE BOND IN AN UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD;  </P> <P> BOOKS: THE LATIN AMERICAN STYLE OF 'MAGIC REALISM' MIRRORS A WORLD WHERE THE  INCREDIBLE IS REAL AND REALITY SURREAL.  </P> <P> "Magic realism" is one of the greatest and most influential literary movements  of the 20th Century. Its exponents, such as Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garcia  Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa, have done more than bring an indigenous Latin  American style to the attention and acclaim of the rest of the world; their use  of magic realism also has served to explain Latin America to the world.  </P> <P> In Latin American fiction and cinema, people vanish or materialize, communities  that have remained unchanged for millennia are altered abruptly and  inexplicably. Land crabs flood houses, an old man grows wings, a beautiful  woman goes out to hang up laundry and is swept away by the wind, tangled in her  clean, white sheets.  </P> <P> Such transformations are perfectly credible in the context of Latin American  existence. People disappear, places are carried away by change, children are  born in antiquity and wander unprepared into the Space Age.  </P> <P> I have a Central American friend. The stories she tells do not ring true to the  North American ear. Sometimes she says she is 23 years old, sometimes 25.  Sometimes she insists she has no brothers, only sisters. Sometimes she admits  that her brother is a guerrilla in the mountains. Sometimes she tells tales of  terrible danger and suffering. The next day she cannot face those memories and  denies them.  </P> <P> North Americans assume she is lying. She is not. Her reality differs from North  American reality. She does not know her age because she cannot read her birth  certificate. She rejects her brother because his very existence presents  unimaginable dangers. She denies her suffering because it is the only way she  can survive another day. Her real life is devised in the style of magic  realism.  </P> <P> Undoubtedly, much of the impact of magic realism stems from the grim aspects of  Latin American reality. In "Chronicle of a Death Foretold," Garcia Marquez  narrates the tale of a murder everyone knew would happen. They knew when it  would happen, and where, but they did not stop it.  </P> <P> But magic realism can be gentle and mystical as well as chilling. The magical  side of this realism has been felt by anyone who has entered the rain forest at  dawn, by anyone who has walked alone through the mist in search of dry  firewood. By anyone who has paddled an old dugout canoe through a downpour, or  spent months in the mountains tending livestock, or pulled the weeds from a  corn field hour after hour, day after day, season after season.  </P> <P> Think about camping. Now you have an idea what it feels like to live in rural  Latin America. Comforts are lacking, but the mystery of nature is pervasive.  You cannot escape from yourself or your surroundings. You are afraid of wild  animals and strangers. You believe your own ghost stories.  </P> <P> Garcia Marquez has explained that his work resembles wild imagination only  because Caribbean reality itself is like the wildest imagination.  </P> <P> My mother was born and raised in a small city on the south coast of Cuba. The  tales she tells are strange to North Americans, so she rarely shares them: A  man who lived in a cave and sacrificed children. A spinster who stole the  plaster Infant Jesus from the arms of St. Anthony's statue and refused to give  it back until the saint found her a husband. Fifteen-year-old girls married off  to 60-year-old men. Parrots on the roof echoing the voices below. People  dancing until they fall into a trance. One uncle struck down by lightning,  another taken away by the secret police. A prison in the dungeon of an old  Spanish castle. The leg of a dog chewed off by a moray eel. Families divided by  war. Paradise lost.  </P> <P> "There are no boundaries between reality and dreams," wrote Miguel Angel  Asturias, the great Guatemalan author whose books, such as "Men of Maize," give  equal credence to ancient Maya myths and contemporary political conflicts. "The  magic of our climate and light," Asturias wrote, "gives our stories a double  aspect -- from one side they seem dreams, from the other, they are realities."  </P> <P> When Garcia Marquez accepted the Nobel prize, he credited Latin American  reality as the source of creativity: "All of us creatures of that unbridled  reality have had little to ask from imagination because our biggest challenge  has been the lack of conventional resources to render our lives credible."  </P> <P> Those who experience the incredible write accordingly, and what results is the  world's most wonderful literature.  </P></p>

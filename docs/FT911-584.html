			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Political factors return to the market THE UK stock market continued on its erratic course yesterday, climbing by 18 points on the FT-SE Index scale as interest rate optimism was encouraged by some apparent indications of increased political pressures for an early general election in the UK. Helped also by a firm opening to the new Wall Street session, London closed virtually at the best of the day, although trading volume remained disappointing. The broader background to the equity market remained much the same as for the past fortnight. Hopes for a further cut in UK base rates continued to focus around the April retail price index announcement, due at the end of next week. Uncertainty on the depth and length of the economic recession in the UK was reflected in the market's cautious response to trading statements from several UK companies. The chief corporate hurdle of the day, in the form of a first-quarter trading statement from British Petroleum, passed off well, with the oil group's profits better than anticipated in the City of London. There was not much movement in BP shares, however, and the oil sector settled down to wait for trading figures due next week from Shell. Share prices opened higher yesterday morning behind firm performances in Tokyo and New York and, with many European markets closed yesterday for Ascension Day, made further progress after the FT-SE June futures contract came in strongly again and spurred the blue chip stocks ahead. In the absence of significant buying support from the institutions, the advance in equities slowed down and not until mid-session did the gain on the FT-SE Index extend to around 16 points. The market then paused until Wall Street opened, but pushed ahead again when the Dow average, after a slow start, recorded a gain of nearly 30 points in London trading hours. At its final reading of 2,541.8, the FT-SE Index showed a gain on the day of 18.4. Dealers believe the market is currently trading in a range of FT-SE 2,520 to 2,550 at present, and unlikely to break out of the top end of this bracket until a further half-point cut in base rates is announced, perhaps after the RPI statement at the end of next week. Seaq volume of 409m shares compared with 387.9m on Wednesday and 431.2m on Tuesday, continuing the fall in average daily volumes since the end of the first quarter of the year. The dearth of trading volume again gave the stock index futures market increased leverage on share prices. Both at the beginning of the session and late in the day, activity in the Footsie set the pace for the underlying equity market. The stock market has another week to run before the end of the current trading account. The retail price index (RPI) is not due until the last day of the account and, with the corporate reporting calendar also relatively light, strategists believe that share prices will continue to find difficulty in making progress next week. The possibility that the UK government might choose to hold a general election in June rather than in the autumn or next year surfaced after the Labour opposition party appeared to spell out its election priorities. While the prospect of an early election might increase political pressures for cuts in base rates, the stock market appeared unconvinced yesterday that the political mood had changed significantly.</p>

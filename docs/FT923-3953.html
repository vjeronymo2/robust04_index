			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading RENEWED pressure on sterling caused a retreat in stock index futures after early strength on the back of a squeeze, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened higher at 2,390, the September contract on the FT-SE was squeezed forward, reaching 2,402 within the first half-hour of trading due to demand from a leading US broker. This proved to be the high of the day, the sharp move forward soon runnning out of steam as events in the currency market took centre stage. With sentiment further weakened by the poor performance in the fixed interest markets, September continued to drift lower for the rest of the day, with a poor Wall Street opening only serving to increase the selling of the contract. Some big trades were dealt towards the close. For most of the afternoon the future traded in line with the cash market. September eventually closed at 2,339, just 2 ahead of the underlying cash market, with turnover reaching 9,811 lots. Volume in traded options remained dull, totalling 20,963, only slightly above Monday's level. The FT-SE 100 option traded 7,320 contracts. Hillsdown was the busiest stock option on 1,852 lots, followed by Fisons on 1,766.</p>

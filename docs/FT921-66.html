			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / O&amp;Y's Riverbus Company to expand THE COMPANY running the riverbus service that travels along the Thames in London said yesterday it was pushing ahead with expansion plans in spite of the financial difficulties surrounding its owners, the property developers Olympia &amp; York. Mr William Edgerley, managing director of Riverbus Company, said the business been in discussions with O&amp;Y over the past week and had been 'reassured' about its future. Riverbus refused to specify the nature of this reassurance or the details of the partnership agreement between O&amp;Y, the developer of Canary Wharf in London's Docklands, and the property division of P&amp;O, the developer of Chelsea Harbour. P&amp;O manages Riverbus, but has no liabilities. Riverbus said it was taking delivery over the next two months of two 62-seater catamarans, and planned to extend its services at weekends by mid April. The two catamarans will increase its fleet to nine, plus two private executive launches managed on behalf of O&amp;Y. The riverbus service was started in the mid 1980s by Thames Line as an environmentally friendly service, but ran into financial difficulties when demand, particularly by City employees, failed to meet expectations. It was briefly taken over by a consortium of five property developers, which was then reduced to a partnership involving O&amp;Y and P&amp;O. The service has made continuing losses over the past two years after a capital injection of Pounds 2.5m by members of the consortium and a government grant of Pounds 500,000.</p>

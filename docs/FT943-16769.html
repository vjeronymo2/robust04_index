			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: Restructuring hits profits Richemont has reported a 45 per cent decline in net earnings, to Pounds 115m (Dollars 177.1m), for the year ended March, mainly because of Pounds 87.1m in net restructuring charges, writes Ian Rodger. Pre-tax profit, excluding the restructuring charges, was up 4.3 per cent to Pounds 660.3m. Both the tobacco and luxury goods divisions showed improved operating profits, in spite of what the group describes as difficult markets. Mr Johann Rupert made no comment on the outlook. However, the directors are recommending a 4.5 per cent rise in dividends, to Pounds 6.15 per unit of shares and participation certificates. Mr Rupert said the group aimed to maintain a steady growth in dividends, above the rate of inflation. 'We look at our cashflows and the condition of our underlying businesses when we make the decision,' he said. Although tobacco sales volume was down 8 per cent, sales value rose 3 per cent to Pounds 2.49bn, thanks to currency effects. Tobacco operating profit was up 3.3 per cent at Pounds 424.2m. Jewellery, pen and leather goods sales improved, but watch sales were flat. Among associates, contributions from the US catalogue shopping business soared 69 per cent, to Pounds 11m. However, losses on the FilmNet satellite broadcasting service deepened to Pounds 25.7m from Pounds 7.3m. Mr Rupert recalled that three years ago he predicted a five-year turnround for this business. Of the restructuring charges, some Pounds 75.1m came from costs and capital gains taxes arising from various changes in shareholdings of the tobacco and luxury goods interests last summer. A further Pounds 123.8m in tobacco production rationalisation costs were announced by Rothmans last week. The portion of the restructuring costs attributable to Richemont was Pounds 87.1m.</p>

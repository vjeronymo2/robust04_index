			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: MoF considers licences move JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance may grant investment trust management licences to investment advisory companies, Reuter reports. The idea is expected to be incorporated into the reform proposals made by the Securities and Exchange Council, an advisory panel to the ministry. The proposals will be submitted next month at the regular session of parliament. The investment trust management business has been limited to securities houses so far. If investment advisory firms receive the licences, their holding companies may gain an opportunity to enter the investment trust management field through their subsidiaries. However, sales of investment funds are seen as unlikely to be opened to investment advisory companies, with brokerage houses continuing to monopolise investment funds' sales by also marketing funds formed by investment advisory firms.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Whiteboards and PCs team up A laser scanning system which allows presentations on whiteboards to be simultaneously displayed on a PC has been introduced in the UK by Microfield Graphics, an Oregon-based company. The SoftBoard depends on an infra-red laser system tracking the colour and movement of a marker with a reflective bar-coded sleeve. The data stream is sent to a digital signal processor which presents the graphic image on a computer display. Microfield Graphics: US, tel 503 626 9393; fax 641 9333.</p>

In a statement where he expressed his condolences to the  family of Martinez, Sison also rejected the suggestion by a  rebel faction opposed to him that the current leadership of the  Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) could be behind the  killing. He said the murder was most likely carried out by the  government to sow "bloody intrigue" between the two conflicting  sides within the communist movement. "There are prevalent  indications that this killing is the deed of certain men who  enjoy the authority and protection of the Ramos regime and who  seek to sow intrigue against the national democratic movement,"  Sison said.    He warned that unless the government desists from pitting  one  group within the rebel movement against the other, there would  be "absolutely no basis for any kind of talks between the Manila  government and the NDF." Although Sison denies being the CPP  chairman, he admits to being a consultant to the NDF in its  current peace efforts with the Ramos administration.    In saying that the CPP had no hand in the murder of  Martinez,  Sison said the former rebel commander "was known to have served  well the revolutionary movement and to have distanced himself  from the group of Arturo Tabara." Tabara was one of four former  CPP officers now facing possible trial before a "people's court"  for various charges. The other three are Romulo Kintanar,  Filemon Lagman and Ricardo Reyes. They have been accused of  "serious crimes" such as gangsterism, gross malversation of  party funds and instigation of a bloody witch hunt within the  movement that led to the death of hundreds of suspected  government agents.    Sison said Martinez was never in the list of those accused  by  the CPP of serious crimes. Apart from having distanced himself  from Tabara, Sison said Martinez was subsequently suspected by  the former of turning against his group.    "It is highly probable that a military and police group in  combination with the Tabara group killed Martinez as the  sacrificial lamb in the Ramos regime's scheme," he said. Sison  reiterated that Tabara is known to have been a government agent  since 1988.    Explaining why the CPP could not have been behind the  killing, Sison said, even those facing charges "are not subject  to summary execution." They are guaranteed the right to due  process, the very same principle which they trampled upon in  committing their crimes in torturing and killing suspects in the  course of the anti-informer campaigns," he said.    Martinez was killed in front of his wife and three children  last 2 January by men introducing themselves as government  agents.</p>

Washington has shown concern in recent weeks following the  departure of two prominent officials from the Russian  Government, and the removal of Stanislav Shushkevich as chairman  of the Belarusian parliament.    State Department Spokesman Michael D. McCurry said  Shushkevich's ouster "deprives Belarus of a leadership that has  made a remarkable contribution to peace and stability in Europe  and to the development of U.S.-Belarus relations."    The personnel changes in Russia and Belarus happened just  weeks after President Bill Clinton's visit to the area.    "We continually reassess the policy in terms of changing  events, but I think the overall policy, which has been to  support the reformists, to support democraticization, is the  right policy," said White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers.    "We need to wait and see what their policies are before we  make judgments about whether they've reversed course," Myers  said.    While economic aid in other areas is tied to progress of the  reforms, the fund promised for nuclear weapons removal in  Belarus will go ahead, Myers said.</p>

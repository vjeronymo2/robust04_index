			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 30 May (PANA) -- Burundi's Union for  National Progress, Uprona, former single party, and the Party  for the Reconciliation of the People, PRP, on Sunday [29 May] in  Bujumbura gathered a crowd of supporters to express their  disapproval of the "biased" way the UN representative is  carrying out his duties. Shouting "Abdallah out" and "Burundi is  sovereign and mature enough to dispense easily with your  tutelage", the two main parties of the opposition expressed  their dissatisfaction in front of the hotel where the UN  representative, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, lives. As the OAU  special representative, Senegalese Papa Louis Fall, who was  forced to resign last March, Abdallah, a Mauritanian national,  was also accused by the demonstrators of going beyond his duties  of mere observer and facilitation in the restoration of state  institutions.    The accusations of partiality are not new, but the last  straw  was, according to the protesters, Abdallah's plan to organize in  Nairobi from 1 June a week-long international conference on  democracy and security in Burundi. The meeting, to which all  the members of Burundi's executive, legislative, and judiciary  have been invited, has stirred fears for their safety. They  said plans to "gather at the same time all the members of the  Burundian cabinet in the same plane" were suspicious.    The UN representative came down to the hall of his hotel and  asked to talk to the angry demonstrators. He said the  demonstrators had a democratic right to demonstrate for action  they deem right, but that it was also not right for them to  accuse him without foundation. He said the Nairobi conference  would be convened only if Burundi's main parties deemed it  useful and wanted to attend. "I am not here to force anybody to  act against his own will," he said.    Observers said that the same opposition through similar  demonstrations forced the OAU secretary-general's special  representative to Rwanda to resign.</p>

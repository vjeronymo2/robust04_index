			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by chief editor Ibrahim Sa'dah: "Human Rights at </F> Auction"]    [Text] A motley group of agencies and organizations have  come into being with a vocation, which they swear is sincere and  disinterested, in human rights. Their sole aim, they would have  us believe, is to comfort a persecuted humanity and extract its  rights from the claws of tyrants and despots. They make such  claims undeterred by the fact that in several cases the opposite  has been proved; namely, that those defenders of human rights  tend to lose interest in their cause once their motives  disappear.    U.S. President Bill Clinton has every right to declare  himself the best known, staunchest, and mightiest of all human  rights defenders.    Bill Clinton's story with human rights goes back a long way.  It began with his decision to run in the U.S. presidential  elections, challenging the incumbent President George Bush who  was running for a second term. At the time, Bush was still  basking in the Gulf war victory, a battle which he planned and  directed from A to Z, a triumph that brought happiness to the  U.S. people and went a long way toward healing the Vietnam  trauma.    Clinton, aware that Bush anchored his election campaign on  his foreign policy accomplishments, based his own strategy on  exaggerating Bush's failures in domestic policy. Aiming a swipe  at Bush's foreign policy, he denounced Bush's dealings with  dictatorial regimes that persecute their people and govern them  with iron and fire.    Throughout his campaign, Clinton bemoaned the pitiful human  rights situation in many countries, vowing that, if he were to  become president, he would end U.S. cooperation with dictatorial  governments regardless of how important their countries may be  for U.S. interests.    Clinton accused Bush openly of turning a blind eye to human  rights abuses and of supporting dictatorial regimes and  providing them with assistance. More specifically, Clinton  mentioned China by name and pointed out that President Bush  ignored the massacre of Chinese students at the hands of the  government forces when they demonstrated for freedom and human  rights on 3 June 1989. Clinton said that Bush extended a hand  of cooperation to the Chinese Government and conferred upon it  the most-favored nation [MFN] status instead of imposing  economic sanctions on it until it upholds freedoms and human  rights.    Then Clinton won the White House's Oval Office from George  Bush. Some days after he became President, it was time to renew  or abolish China's MFN status. Clinton could not back down on  his human rights slogan but at the same time could not ignore  U.S. interests which would suffer if the relationship with China  deteriorated. As a compromise, he issued a decision linking  China's continued enjoyment of its MFN status with improvement  in its human rights record. He gave it until June 1994.    Clinton was hoping that a change would occur in Beijing to  give the impression that democracy had begun to knock on China's  Great Wall. In this way he would fulfill his promise to the  U.S. voters with regard to imposing respect for human rights  worldwide, particularly in the People's Republic of China.    Unfortunately for Clinton, the Chinese Government denounced  the U.S. administration's statements and maintained that any  discussion of so-called human rights inside China would be seen  as interference in its domestic affairs. More seriously, the  Chinese Government announced that it would not accept threats  and is not really concerned if the United States continues  granting it MFN status if Clinton's administration links this  status with the right to interfere in matters that do not  concern it.    Clinton could not pick up the gauntlet thrown down by China.  More strangely, the U.S. President felt compelled to announce  that it was in the interest of the American people to seek  rapprochement between the two countries. And so... realism  overcame principle and economic ties between Washington and  Beijing grew closer in a way that astonished everyone who  expected them to deteriorate because China insisted on clinging  to its own method of ruling more than 1.5 billion people.    Last year U.S. exports to China amounted to nearly $8  billion. This was necessary to provide jobs for approximately  150,000 people who would otherwise have been unemployed,  particularly in California and Florida, two states of great  importance in U.S. presidential elections.    To be fair one must point out that many men and women in the  U.S. administration were shocked by the triumph of money over  principle, including adviser Anthony Lake and the U.S.  representative at the United Nations Madeleine Albright. They  declared their rejection of any economic cooperation with China  unless its government showed respect for human rights. These  objections, however, were soon dissipated before the slogan  (U.S. interests first) raised by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown  and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. The immense Chinese market  is capable of enriching any industrial country and, according to  the commerce and treasury secretaries, it would not be fair to  the U.S. people to lose this market to the European nations or  Japan.    The desire to secure the Chinese market for the United  States was not the only reason that President Clinton was  persuaded to ignore the issue of the lack of human rights in  China. There was the additional worry about North Korea's  reported nuclear capability which might threaten that region's  security and stability. The U.S. administration believes that  only China can persuade North Korea to accept what the free  world wants from it.    This confidence in China's abilities carries a high price  for  Clinton. Beijing's government does not object to calming down  North Korea on condition that all talk about events inside China  and all accusations that it violates human rights end. This has  actually happened, represented by the flow of U.S. investments  to this most favored country.    I am not exaggerating when I point out the similarity--with  some differences--between respect for human rights U.S.-style  and the same slogans raised by many human rights organizations  that are established every day in various parts of the world.    We have heard of a human rights organization established by  several people who all their lives have been known as inveterate  enemies of humanity! Not long ago they had high government  posts and no one can forget how they used to suppress liberties,  torture the citizens, and humiliate the innocent while raising  the brazen slogan: Freedom is for the people but there is no  freedom for the people's enemies.    The term "people" in the slogan referred to those who  supported and defended the dictatorship and the "people's  enemies" were millions of wretched citizens who opposed  oppression, injustice, and tyranny and as a result were deprived  of their rights and liberties. It is laughable to the point of  making us want to weep that the individuals who raised this  slogan that divided the public into freemen and slaves are the  same ones who have now renounced the slogan and have become,  after losing their power and influence, defenders of liberty and  martyrs of human rights.    We have likewise heard about the establishment of another  human rights society which is not perturbed by the terrorist  acts of the past few years, designed to undermine Egypt's  security and stability, in which dozens of children, women, old  men, and police officers died. To this society it would appear  that those who died in these terrorist acts had no rights that  must be defended. More appallingly, this same society raises an  outcry whenever it hears that a terrorist has been seized while  committing a crime against the entire Egyptian people. It  issues statements, holds meetings, makes threats and accuses our  government of violating human rights. It asserts--as if it were  an eyewitness--that the arrested terrorist was whipped, tortured  with fire, and subjected to electric shocks to extract untrue  confessions from him!    How astonishing is this distinction between the rights of a  terrorist and the rights of an entire nation. The society in  question believes that the terrorist must be defended and  exonerated regardless of his crime and evidence proving his  guilt and regardless of the innocence of the police of the  charge of torturing him. At the same time, this society  believes that the nation has no right to ask for protection from  the terrorists' grenades, the murderers' assaults, their knife  attacks, their metal chains, and nail-filled bombs. The members  of the society for the defense of the rights of criminal  terrorists believe that because the people do not want to  entrust their future to the princes of terror, the propagators  of religious ignorance, and professional criminals, they  therefore deserve what is happening to them.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / People: Chief postie Kevin Williams has been appointed operations director of the Royal Mail. He will be responsible for the daily collection and delivery of 60m letters in the UK, 140,000 postal workers and a transport fleet of 30,000 vehicles - the biggest in Europe, boasts Royal Mail. Turnover of the letters business is over Pounds 3.4bn. Williams' predecessor, John Mackay, has become director and general manager of letters in Scotland and Northern Ireland. One of Williams' interests is European twinning; he chairs the UK branch of an organisation which promotes links between European postal services. Aged 43, Williams graduated in French from Exeter University and joined the organisation as a trainee in 1971. His European interests will help as Royal Mail and other parts of the Post Office examine EC opportunities.</p>

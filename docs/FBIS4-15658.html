			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Chubays by Sergey Razin; date and </F> place not given: "The Voucher Has Served Its Purpose and May Go"]    [Text] There are less than 100 days to go before voucher  privatization comes to an end. Feelings are running high. The  State Duma intends to hold a hearing on this key problem in the  near future. Will the State Committee for the Management of  State Property be able to defend its approach to distributing  state property?    [Razin] For many, the public conflict between Chubays and  Luzhkov has been like a bolt from the blue, in my opinion. Do  you accept that it could just be a personality clash?    [Chubays] Initially, I too thought that the experienced  economist was irritated by the vigorous actions of the "Chicago  boys in pink trousers." But that illusion was soon shattered.    By attempting to torpedo the voucher, Luzhkov wants to place  the sale of shares under bureaucrats' control and make it so  expensive that, in the end, privatization will drag on for  decades -- to the satisfaction of all who cherish the hope of  returning Russia to the era of "developed socialism."    [Razin] Are you not being too harsh in your judgments?    [Chubays] Why is it then that major investment funds like  "Alfa-Kapital" have invested only 3 percent of their resources  in the privatization of Moscow enterprises?    The reason is simple: Privatization in Moscow and a number  of regions is being blocked by local authorities.  Unfortunately, while he does not have the power to abolish  vouchers, Luzhkov is in a position to slow down the process.  But the State Committee for the Management of State Property  has sufficient levers to enable Muscovites to invest their  checks in the capital's most promising ventures. I think the  State Committee's plans will get massive support from below....    [Razin] In my opinion, the voucher's main purpose is not to  effect nationwide privatization, but to create the conditions  whereby the state sector can be transferred to commercial  structures' private ownership as quickly as possible....    [Chubays] All world experience shows that no more than 10-15  percent of the population may become efficient owners. Where  are we to find these enterprising people capable of transforming  loss-making plants into profitable firms? There is only one way  to solve this problem: Through natural selection.  Consequently, at the start of the voucher marathon we  deliberately placed everyone on equal terms, without dividing  them into partocrats and democrats, conservatives and reformers.  Everyone was given a voucher and told: Do with it what you  will! Sell it, rip it up, buy another 100 or 1,000, get  interested in macroeconomics and investments.... It very soon  became clear that the vouchers were being amassed by people who  can and want to work with them. We estimate that the desired  10-15 percent of efficient owners have been found. They will  probably include former Union ministers, directors of state  enterprises, and young entrepreneurs, who head more than 600  check investment funds, incidentally. Of course, not all these  funds will be able to stand up to the competition: Some of them  may go bankrupt. But, as a whole, it is quite clear that a  market mechanism, which will absorb financial resources and pump  investments into industry, has been created in Russia in just  12-18 months.    [Razin] But where are these fabulous investments going to  come from? There is no sign of them at present....    [Chubays] You should look more closely. The Volga Motor  Vehicle Plant hit upon the idea of collecting colossal amounts  of money to fund the AVVA project. This is one version of the  breakthrough: Citizens' savings are drawn into industry via the  mechanism of expanding joint-stock companies' authorized  capital. Another, no less well-known example is "Olbi-Diplomat."  These are intelligent people who basically collect billions of  rubles for television advertizing alone -- money which, if it  were not invested in the economy, would simply lie idle. These  two examples point to a chain reaction of even more attractive  projects, including some which involve Western capital.  Hundreds of investment funds and thousands of joint-stock  industrial enterprises are destined to engage in this kind of  business; even now, they are finding mutual benefit in  cooperation at check auctions.    [Razin] But check auctions will "die" with the voucher on 1  July, which is less than 100 days away....    [Chubays] Check auctions will be succeeded by money  auctions, which will allow enterprises to attract even more  investments for their development by means of selling shares.    [Razin] Is it not the case that the mafia will simply buy up  the most profitable enterprises with its easy money?    [Chubays] On completion of check privatization, enterprises'  fixed capital will have a much higher value. It goes without  saying that labor collectives which are dragging their heels  over selling shares risk losing many of the current benefits and  waking up one morning to a new owner in the shape of a  commercial bank or fund.    [Razin] Is that why giants like "Gazprom" and a number of  leading petroleum extraction companies have started rushing into  check auctions?    [Chubays] Whatever, it is certainly no accident that  "Gazprom" has collected several million vouchers from all over  the country to take part in its own auction. After 1 July,  shares which can now be bought with these checks will be 10  times more expensive....    [Razin] Suppose voucher privatization ends successfully in  100 days time. Will all its pluses not be concealed by  financial-industrial groups, which officials of all colors have  suddenly begun to discuss? Is this venture not a trick to keep  bankrupt enterprises afloat?    [Chubays] I am skeptical of attempts to unite quite  different enterprises on orders from above. Economic councils  like these will collapse under pressure from internal conflicts.  But this idea could forge a path for itself if shareholders  from various sectors and commercial structures want to combine  their efforts to stabilize financial and industrial ties. I  think we will hear of such examples quite soon.    [Razin] I would very much like to share your optimism. But  I am not convinced by predictions or promises, only by hard  facts. The voucher privatization stage has been completed in the  Czech Republic and Slovakia. What is the situation there with  investments in industry?    [Chubays] The Czech economics minister told me during a  recent meeting that the Czech Republic has been flooded with so  many investments -- both from within the country and from abroad  -- that the government no longer knows what to do with them.  The total capital exceeds all conceivable limits. The  population is also convinced of the success of voucher  privatization, as the dividends from investing coupons (the  Czech equivalent of our vouchers) amount to more than three or  four months' wages, and wages in the Czech Republic are  comparable to those received in the West. I am convinced that  the Czech Republic had the highest industrial growth rate of all  the European countries last year.    Admittedly, this success was made possible not only by  optimum privatization, but also by financial stabilization.  They are two sides of the same coin. In conjunction, these two  factors have an astounding effect.    [Razin] Will we soon see something similar in Russia?    [Chubays] The Czechs began their reforms 18-24 months  earlier than us. So Russia still has everything ahead....  Recently the prime minister publicly lambasted some heads of  laboratory who allegedly confused Russia with a racing car:  They drove it around for a while and then abandoned it.  Something similar can be seen in readers' letters: Surely  Gaydar has not abandoned the reforms? Gaydar has been criticized  with unconcealed hatred on all sides. But many people treat him  with understanding, because he was not cunning and took all the  flak. However hard life may be for Russians, in the past two  years the reforms have reached the "point of no return" and  become irreversible. You must agree that it is nevertheless  better to live in Russia at present than in Ukraine, say, where  they have tried to boost the economy with "other, nonmonetarist  methods"....    Gaydar resigned because he did not like playing the role of  whipping boy in the government. But he did not abandon the  reforms when he resigned: He has remained in politics. Our  main task now is to complete privatization and create a broad  class of owners: The middle class that will serve as a firm  social foundation for the economic reforms. Only on this basis  will it be possible to form a strong political party capable of  shaking the Russian economy out of its comatose state. Strictly  speaking, with no real support from below, even under the  president's wing it will be impossible to contain lobbyist  storms for long....    [Razin] Do you not think that the reformers have gone too  far with their tough financial policy? Is this not the reason  why you recently had to be appointed vice premier over the prime  minister's head? The president has had to show his fist in  order to defend check privatization....    [Chubays] I do not agree that the presidential edict on my  appointment was signed over the prime minister's head. This  document was drawn up with Chernomyrdin's consent. It just  happens that my appointment was passed separately from the  general list....    [Razin] It looks as if Yeltsin has thereby made it clear to  anyone interested that voucher privatization will be taken to  its logical conclusion.    [Chubays] That was probably the intention.    [Razin] Sorry, but are you sure you will be able to complete  voucher privatization? You are rather out on a limb in the  present government, and it is strongly rumored in the State Duma  that you will soon be removed altogether....    [Chubays] A year or 18 months ago, I found these questions  difficult. Virtually every day began with the feeling that I  only had a week left. Breaking through the redoubts of the old  parliament was like crossing a minefield.    The situation has now fundamentally changed. Even fierce  opponents of check privatization -- such as Luzhkov, for example  -- blame the State Committee for the Management of State  Property for the fact that directors have become our allies.  This is absolutely true. First, we have made the process of  selling shares extremely simple by removing the armada of  officials. Second, we have given state enterprises the chance  to use their vouchers to buy a major shareholding without being  robbed by a revaluation of their fixed capital.    That is why Luzhkov's version has not been adopted. The  Moscow mayor has tried to increase the cost of state enterprises  hundreds of times over, abolish check auctions, and hold only  money auctions in their place. If this were to happen, Luzhkov  would have some serious explaining to do with workers at the  Likhachev Plant, the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant, and thousands of  other enterprises: They would want to know why shares had become  400 times more expensive and why they could no longer be bought  with vouchers, but only with cash -- of which there is not  enough even to pay wages. I would like to see the results of  these talks....    Of course, opposition to privatization is still very strong.  But centers of sabotage now only remain in the corridors of  power: The voucher is opposed by the former party-economic  nomenklatura, big lobbies of officials, and a number of  political parties which act as a mouthpiece for their interests.  Some will lose a very great deal from the real redistribution  of property in favor of economic efficiency.    But it is no longer officials who call the shots: It is the  person with the voucher. Try and take it away from him, and you  will be in real trouble! When the affair with the  "Tekhnicheskiy Progress" Joint-Stock Company came to light, its  shareholders became a seething mob prepared to sweep aside  anyone in their path.    That is why I am convinced that no forces or shady  structures  now have the power to stop the process of privatization....</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sharp fall in world stocks may boost sugar prices THE SHORTFALL world sugar production against consumption is expected to reach 1.58m tonnes for 1993-1994 - higher than previous forecasts - which could lead to a run-up in sugar prices next year. Sugar prices moved higher on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange yesterday - in mid-morning's trading the March futures contract was 18 cents higher at 10.36 cents a lb. The deficit in the sugar crop is expected to cause a draw down in world raw stocks of 2.18m tonnes (including a 600,000-tonne allowance for wastage) according to a review of the sugar industry published by C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures, the Londson broker. Czarnikow's previous review, published in August, predicted a stock reduction of 1.8m tonnes. World sugar output is forecast to reach 112.27m tonnes in the 1993 - 1994 season - a slight increase on last year's 111.77m tonnes. But consumption in 1994 is expected to rise to 113.86m tonnes from 112.3m in the previous year. World stocks are still sufficient to meet demand following the record production in 1991-1992. Mr Chris Pack at Czarnikow said: 'stocks are disappearing out of the system. It's not becoming critical yet but it is much closer in balance'. Sugar prices have been buoyed in recent weeks by the prospect of tighter supplies in the first half of next year. But the recovery in the African crop which had been severely depleted by drought in the past two years looks set to depress the market in the second half of next year. Production problems in India are expected to lead to a crop not much above last year's depressed level, according to Czarnikow, which has reduced its production estimate by 270,000 tonnes to 11.69m, compared with 11.53m tonnes in 1992-1993. Mr Pack believes that India will have to be an active buyer of sugar next year as domestic consumption continues to rise, and its demand could support prices.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE THAN 200 FACE LAYOFFS AT AEROJET PLANTS  </P> <P> The Aerojet unit of Gencorp said Thursday that it would lay off several hundred  workers at its Downey and Chino plants because of the loss of a contract  competition.  </P> <P> The Aerojet Ordnance facilities in Chino and Downey employ 600 workers, and a  spokesman said Thursday that the layoffs would affect more than 200 but would  not result in a complete closure of the facilities.  </P> <P> Last August, Sacramento-based Aerojet closed its Tustin facility after it  encountered problems winning new business there. The Tustin operation had  employed as many as 1,000 workers, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> The layoff at Aerojet Ordnance follows the loss to Honeywell of a $124-million  contract to build 13,500 combined-effect munition systems for the Air Force.  Aerojet has made the munition, which consists of 202 small bombs inside a  container, for several years.  </P> <P> The loss "will have a major impact on the future direction of our company and  our level of employment," Edward F. Davidson, the Aerojet executive in charge  of the ordnance unit, said in a statement.  </P> <P> Davidson said the company would have to "phase out" the combined-effect  munitions business quickly "to protect our ammunition contracts," referring  apparently to an effort to trim overhead rates that would affect its  competitive position on other contracts at the operation.  </P> <P> The spokesman said no layoffs are planned at Aerojet's ElectroSystems unit in  Azusa.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus arrived in London  this afternoon for a two-day official visit to the United  Kingdom. This is his third visit to Britain in the office of  Czech prime minister, although this is the first official one.  A few minutes ago we received a video about the talks held  between Prime Minister Klaus and British Prime Minister John  Major.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister Klaus opened his first  official visit to Great Britain since the establishment of the  independent Czech state with a meeting with British Prime  Minister John Major. Before the talks began, Prime Minister  Klaus said that the chief purpose of the meeting was to confirm  views on certain questions of a bilateral and Europe-wide  character. At the same time he said he shares the somewhat less  pro-federal view of British politicians on the future set-up in  Europe.    The talks betweem the prime ministers at 10 Downing Street,  where British prime ministers have had their residence since  1735, lasted about one hour. After the talks ended Prime  Minister Klaus said, among other things:    [Begin Klaus recording] As regards bilateral relations, we  considered that there are no significant problems which the  prime ministers should tackle. Therefore the subject of our  talks was of course Bosnia, Europe, European communities, the  gradual integration of our country in European communities, and  the Partnership for Peace, which the British Goverment really  regards as a mechanism for our entry into NATO. We discussed  the issue of the OECD, an organization which I believe offers a  more realistic way for our country's rapid entry into European  structures than some other organizations. [end recording]    [Correspondent] Prime Minister Klaus has also given a  lecture  at the British Royal Institute for Foreign Affairs on the  subject of the transformation of Czech society and its  Europe-wide context. He repeated his view that of all the  postcommunist countries the Czech Republic has gone the farthest  in its reformist endeavors. At the same time he said that in  this situation the West should not cease to seek an optimal  method for the integration of the postcommunist structures.    At this moment the Czech prime minister is meeting with the  chairman of the British Conservative Party, Sir Norman Fowler.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Archer faces probe into alleged insider dealing Lord Archer, the Conservative peer, is under investigation for alleged insider dealing, the department of trade and industry confirmed last night. The investigation centres on the takeover of Anglia Television by MAI, the television and financial services group, earlier this year. In a rare public statement, the DTI said that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, appointed two inspectors last February 'to investigate possible insider dealing transactions by certain individuals, including Lord Archer'. The statement said Mr Heseltine had decided to initiate the investigation 'following a report from the Stock Exchange over transactions close to the announcement on 18 January 1994 of an agreed bid from MAI for Anglia television group'. Lord Archer was not available for comment last night. But he was quoted in today's Times as saying the allegations were 'completely untrue'. He was reported to have said: 'I did not buy any shares. I am not going to make a statement. That sort of accusation is libellous. Thank you.' The 54-year-old peer, formerly Mr Jeffrey Archer, is a successful novelist and a former Tory MP. He was deputy chairman of the Conservative party when Lady Thatcher was prime minister. He is thought likely to be offered a position by Mr John Major in the prime minister's forthcoming ministerial reshuffle. He has made no secret in recent weeks of his wish to be appointed party chairman in place of Sir Norman Fowler. Lord Archer has also been tipped as a prospective minister for sport, with special responsibilities for promoting Britain's National Lottery scheme. His wife, Mary, has been a non-executive director of Anglia television since 1987. MAI launched an agreed Pounds 292m bid for Anglia television on January 18 of this year. The bid - which sent Anglia's shares up 180p to 664p that day  -was the third for an ITV company after the government first proposed relaxing the rules on ITV ownership in November of last year. The DTI said last night that its investigation was being conducted by an accountant and a lawyer, both of whom were independent of the department. It said that the matter was being conducted 'in accordance with normal practices in such cases'. According to the DTI's statement, Mr Heseltine is waiting to receive a report into the allegations from the two investigators. The DTI added: 'When received, the report will be considered in detail before any decisions are made on whether any further action should be taken.' Department of Trade officials have a long-standing practice of not commenting on the affairs of individual companies or persons while they remain subject to such an investigation. However, the DTI said yesterday that it had decided to make its announcement 'in view of the statement made to the press by a company'.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: US biotech industry heads for maturity BIOTECHNOLOGY companies are accelerating rapidly towards commercial maturity, according to a comprehensive annual survey of the US biotech industry released yesterday. The Ernst &amp; Young report shows that industry's total revenues rose by 28 per cent in 1991-92 to Dollars 8.1bn - product sales accounted for Dollars 5.9bn and the remaining Dollars 2.2bn came from licence fees and collaborative research income. The 1,200 biotech companies covered spent a total of Dollars 4.9bn on research and development (42 per cent more than the previous year) and made a net loss of Dollars 3.4bn. But Mr Steven Burrill, Ernst &amp; Young's US director for high technology services, predicted that the industry's sales would rise quickly enough to bring it to overall profitability within two or three years. 'We see the industry on its way to an enormous revenue base - Dollars 100bn worldwide by the end of the century,' he said. 'In this past remarkable year we have seen both euphoria and disenchantment in the public financial markets for biotechnology stocks,' the report says. Euphoria pushed the total market capitalisation of the biotech industry up from Dollars 35bn in September 1991 to a peak of Dollars 60bn at the end of year; then regulatory setbacks for a few well-publicised biotech drugs, combined with a swing back to cyclical stocks on Wall Street, pulled the sector's capitalisation back down to about Dollars 50bn. Ernst &amp; Young point out the entire biotech industry is valued at slightly less than Merck, the largest US drug company, whose market capitalisation is Dollars 60bn. Twenty biotech-derived drugs and 600 diagnostic products are on the market, including Amgen's Neupogen which had first-year sales of Dollars 230m. The industry has a further 135 drugs in human clinical trials and 21 awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval. Although human drugs dominate the sector, Ernst &amp; Young says 'ag-bio' is set to emerge as an area of rapid growth, led by biological pesticides and genetically engineered crops.</p>

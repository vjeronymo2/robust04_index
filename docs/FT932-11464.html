			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Brighter outlook for Italy's PM THE OUTLOOK for Italy's week-old government led by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, brightened yesterday in spite of growing tensions within the two main parties supporting it. The change came amid signs that Mr Vincenzo Visco and Mr Augusto Barbera, two of the four ministers who resigned from the government last week, might be reconsidering their decisions. Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, the leader of the Socialist party, appealed to the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the former communists, to reconsider its opposition to Mr Ciampi. Mr Visco and Mr Barbera, both PDS politicians, said their decisions would be temporarily 'frozen' pending a decision by their party. Last night, the party decided against supporting Mr Ciampi, but left open the door to abstaining in a vote of confidence later this week. The resignations came after parliament decided on Thursday to turn down the request by Milan magistrates to lift the immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, on several instances of alleged corruption. The vote unleashed demonstrations throughout Italy and calls for immediate parliamentary elections. Separately yesterday, Mr Giulio Andreotti, the seven times prime minister who is facing investigations for alleged links with the Mafia, said he would ask the senate to lift his own immunity. He said he did not want the issue to exacerbate Italy's political tensions. A senate committee last week agreed to the request by Palermo magistrates that Mr Andreotti's immunity be lifted, amid strong opposition from the former premier, now a life senator. Mr Andreotti's move and the mere survival of the government over the weekend helped to lift sentiment in the share and currency markets. Equities rose sharply in Milan, while the lira made up some of the ground lost against other currencies. However, the repercussions of the Craxi vote were still being felt among the Socialists and Christian Democrats, the two main parties supporting the four-party coalition government. A number of leading Socialists, including Mr Giorgio Ruffolo, a former environment minister and member of the senate, left the party at the weekend in protest at the decision over Mr Craxi.

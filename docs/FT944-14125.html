			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Harrods boss puts stress on his patriotism Mr Mohamed Fayed said last night that in disclosing that he has made payments to MPs - disclosures which have sent the government into a state of turmoil - he is acting as a good British patriot. 'I am carrying the flag', he said. 'My fight against sleaze is a fight for the country.' However, for all this patriotic fervour, Mr Fayed is not a British citizen, although he and his brother Ali - both Egyptians by birth - have applied for citizenship. Indeed the story of their applications sheds light on their complicated relationship with the British government. It was two years ago that Mr Ali Fayed first started to consider applying for citizenship. As co-owner of Harrods with his brother he had lived in the UK for well over a decade and has English children. Through his solicitor soundings were taken from a senior cabinet minister. 'We were told there would not be a problem,' said one of Mr Fayed's close friends. The application was made in February 1993. In the following 12 months the nationality division of the Home Office in Liverpool processed it. The friend said: 'We then rang the top banana at Liverpool who told us that 'everything was in order'. We took that as meaning it had gone well.' As a result Mr Mohamed Fayed put in his application for citizenship. The brothers say their references came from 'very distinguished British figures'. One was Lord Bramall, the former chief of the defence staff. This spring, however they discovered that 'the application had stalled at ministerial level'. The Home Office said that there was nothing sinister about that. Although decisions on citizenship were normally taken by officials of the nationality division, more difficult cases were passed to ministers. The Fayed brothers fell into that category automatically because they had been criticised in a DTI report on their takeover of House of Fraser - which owned Harrods and other department stores. The minister responsible for taking the decision was Mr Charles Wardle, a junior Home Office minister responsible for immigration. This was of concern to the Fayeds, because they feared that he faced a potential conflict of interest. They are acutely aware that in March 1990, after the publication of the DTI report into their takeover, Mr Wardle had made a speech which was implicitly critical of them. They were also aware that from 1987 to 1990 he had been an adviser to the leading firm of accountants, Peat Marwick. This firm had for years audited the accounts of their longstanding corporate opponent, Lonrho, which had lobbied for the DTI to investigate their House of Fraser purchase. Mr Jim Butler, the senior partner of Peats at the time, was the 'client partner' of Lonrho, the accounting firm said yesterday, and had a longstanding relationship with the group. As senior partner, the firm said, he was also in theory the man who hired Mr Wardle. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is thought to have suggested that Mr Wardle ask the Bank of England if it had any views on the Fayeds, since the Bank investigated their suitability as owners of Harrods Bank. An official said, however, that the Bank had received no approach from the Home Office and that it would have been futile, because it was a criminal offence to pass on such information. As of yesterday, no decision had been taken on the Fayeds' citizenship.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Anais Chavenet: "Haitian Business Sector's Initial </F> Reaction to Latest U.S. Economic Sanctions Rather Hostile" -- LE  NOUVELLISTE headline]    [Text] Indignation, anger, caustic or furious comment,  vague impulses for reprisal: The business sector in  Port-au-Prince is not stomaching U.S. President Bill Clinton's  latest decision to freeze the assets and property of Haitians  and that of legal Haitian institutions and organizations.  Tension mounts as a list of the names and addresses of about  300 people, including minors in some big families, who are being  targeted circulates throughout the capital.    "My granddaughter is on that list," a well-known attorney  says indignantly.    "It is madness," says one banker. "I have nothing to do with  those friends right now," he adds.    One citizen believes that Clinton has gone too far, while an  attorney denounces the arbitrary nature of the executive order  the U.S. head of state signed late on 21 June. "It is the  strong hand in its greatest splendor." This U.S. measure  reminds him of the practice under the Duvalier regime of a whole  family being punished for the actions of one. It is funny to  hear the international community talking about rights  considering that relations with the international community have  been based on force since 30 September 1991, he said.  <H5>  Boomerang Effect </H5>   It is a cold shower: Many of those who are penalized do not  show any sign of turning on the military authorities, as the  United States expected.    "I will turn on them if they were wrong at 10 percent," says  this banker, who thinks that the protagonists on both sides  should resign. [sentence as published] He deplores the embargo  and does not seem to agree that those who staged the coup d'etat  are responsible for it. "They are wasting their time because we  have not forgotten Aristide's `stones in water' and `give them  what they deserve' statements."    A young professional, furious at being penalized, shouted:  "If it's a matter of money or my life, I prefer my life; if it's  a matter of money or Cedras, I prefer money." He is not ready  for upheaval, however. He rages, jumping on the first foreigner  he meets. More coldly, his father points out that Clinton's  measures "increase the hate for Americans." Reconciliation is  impossible with such measures, measures that only serve to set  Haitians against one another to the point of civil war.  <H5>  American Banks Can Just Pack Up </H5>   To make things worse, the two U.S. banks in Haiti --  Citibank  and Bank of Boston -- closed their doors today, some observers  feel to avoid pressure from their customers. U.S. Marines have  reportedly helped secure Citibank. It has already been rumored  that the Bank of Boston will reopen its doors on 24 June. It is  said that the Bank of Boston has a strong Haitian clientele now  at bay. More than one person wonders: Will the checks be  cashed?    People are preparing to take legal action to force Citibank  and the Bank of Boston, subject to Haitian law, to refund their  assets. This possibility was raised in the 14 November 1980  decree, modified by the 14 July 1984 decree, on commercial  banks. Article 71 authorizes the Bank of Haiti to relinquish  them, especially when they suspend payments. Relinquishment  means the state can assume the bank administrators' authority.  Article 26 allows the finance minister, on the Bank of Haiti's  request, to revoke the authorization under which these banks  operate.    One businessman is pleased that he withdrew his assets from  the Bank of Boston two years ago. "Both banks can just pack up  and leave. Not one lucid Haitian will deposit his money there  anymore."    U.S. financial institutions also take a risk. "The U.S.  banks are certainly going to lose their customers," an attorney  asserts, convinced that the "great fortunes" were safeguarded a  long time ago. One analyst points out: "The United States has  lost its chance to be considered a land of investment."</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Yeltsin in conflict with Russian prime minister: Economic policies cause rift in leadership A serious rift has opened up between Russia's president Boris Yeltsin and his prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, whom he holds partly to blame for the recent steep fall in the value of the rouble. The two leaders differ over a range of economic policy issues. Mr Chernomyrdin's continued absence from Moscow is a sign that he is regarded with deep disfavour by President Yeltsin. Mr Chernomyrdin, who is still officially on holiday at Sochi on the Black Sea, had been scheduled to welcome the Queen in Moscow on Monday. A report carried by independent radio and TV stations that Mr Chernomyrdin had submitted his resignation was quickly denied by government spokesmen yesterday. Mr Chernomyrdin himself told US vice-president Al Gore during a scheduled phone conversation last night that the resignation rumours - which had reached the White House - were untrue. However, the prime minister was said to be preparing a statement to journalists today. A report by the Security Council - the standing commission which oversees security matters - on the fall of the rouble was debated by the council yesterday, but no formal announcement was made afterwards except that it would continue its work for a further two weeks. However the report is believed to put some of the blame for the rouble's fall on the prime minister, as well as on Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank, and on Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister - both of whom have resigned. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister for nationalities policy, said yesterday: 'Any official who had a part to play in the rouble's fall has to take responsibility for whatever area he has under his control.' He said that the resignation of Mr Gerashchenko, a man with many allies in the parliament, could 'create such a critical situation in which a discussion of the budget in the duma (lower house) could have negative results for the government'. Mr Shakhrai, a close ally of Mr Chernomyrdin's in the past, said that he believed that in spite of the blow it had received, 'the Chernomyrdin government will remain in power'. He added, however, that an investigation was continuing and that criminal charges might be brought. The tension between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin has grown in recent months, as the president sought to ease Mr Chernomyrdin's tight credit and monetary policy. Mr Yeltsin has in recent months pointedly preferred to consult Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, who accompanied him on his trip to the US last month. The Russian president yesterday named Ms Tatyana Paramonova, a former deputy chairman in charge of budget and credit policy, as the central bank's acting chairman. Ms Paramonova has a high reputation for her tough views on the need for a tight credit policy and for control of inflation. However, her relative youth - she is 44 - and her sex, as well as her recent accession to a high position in the bank, in 1992, has convinced most observers that she is a temporary leader.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Fall of 1991, as EPA was nearing publication of regulations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 24 Phase V contaminants, it became apparent that the Agency had not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reached a consensus on how to proceed with the sulfate regulation in light of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns raised by the commenters. Given the high cost of the rule, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively low risk, and the need to explore alternative regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches targeted at the transient consumer, EPA decided to seek a deferral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a final regulatory decision on sulfate. The Agency needed more time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolve issues that included: (1) Whether additional research is needed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how long it takes infants to acclimate to water with high sulfate content,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) whether new regulatory approaches were needed for regulating a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminant whose health effect is confined largely to transient populations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (3) whether the Agency should revise its definition of BAT for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems (i.e., what should be considered affordable for the small, transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-community water systems). For the above reasons, the regulation on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate was deferred. A new schedule has been established in connection with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> litigation brought over the schedule for regulating sulfate. This schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires EPA to finalize its regulatory action for sulfate by May 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) for sulfate is 250 mg/L  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is based on aesthetic effects (i.e., taste and odor). EPA is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing changes in the SMCL for sulfate, but is requesting public comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the correlation between sulfate concentrations, palatability, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption of high-sulfate water by the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Sulfate General Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sulfate is the divalent anion (SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). It exists in a variety of inorganic compounds and salts formed with metal cations. Sulfate salts with lower molecular weight alkali metals such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium are very water soluble and are often found in natural waters. Salts of higher molecular weight metals such as barium, iron or lead have very low water solubility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sulfate is found in soil sediments and rocks, and occurs in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment as a result of both natural processes and human activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific data on the total production of all sulfates are not available, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production is expected to be thousands of tons per year; the use of sodium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate alone in 1987 was reported to be 792 tons. Sulfate is used for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variety of commercial purposes, including pickle liquor (sulfuric acid) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steel and metal industries, and as a reagent in manufacturing of products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as copper sulfate (a fungicide/algicide).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sulfate may enter surface and ground water as a result of discharge or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal of sulfate-containing wastes. In addition, sulfur oxides produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the combustion of fossil fuels are transformed to sulfuric acid in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmosphere. Through precipitation (i.e., acid rain), sulfuric acid can enter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface waters, lowering the pH and raising sulfate levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Explanation of Today's Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Establishment of MCLG for Sulfate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MCLG for sulfate is reproposed today at a level of 500 mg/L. In this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice, EPA is responding to the public comments submitted in reference to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MCLG options contained in the July 1990 proposal. EPA's complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responses to the public comments on the previously proposed MCLGs appear in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Comment/Response Document that is included in the docket for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCLGs are set at concentration levels at which no known or anticipated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse health effects occur, allowing for an adequate margin of safety. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process for establishing an MCLG for a contaminant has been described in many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents, including the final Phase V rule issued in July 1992 (57 FR 31781&hyph;31783).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (6): Insatiable investment appetite - The reasons for the rush of investment banks to China Trying to call a corporate financier in Hong Kong just now is like trying to get hold of a sun-worshipping Brit in the middle of December: none of them is at home. Holidaymakers are where the sun is, bankers are where the debt is - and today, with Beijing's huge appetite for capital to fund its emergence into the developed world, China is very much where the debt is. China has brought the US banks (and, to a lesser extent, their European counterparts) flocking to Hong Kong despite the colony's rabid property and wage inflation. Those new to Hong Kong, or beefing up operations there and in China, include Bear Stearns, Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and N. M. Rothschild and Sons. In the past two years Merrill Lynch has raised more than USDollars 4bn for investment in China. Deals last year included the USDollars 342m public offering for Shanghai PetroChemical and a role in China's HKDollars 1bn global bond issue. Mr Will Dennis, director of China business at NM Rothschild &amp; Sons (Hong Kong), says: 'There is any amount of appetite for foreign investment in China, subject to certain industries being restricted by government. In telecommunications, for instance, two separate government ministers have made announcements on foreign investment: one saying it was to be welcomed and one saying it would not be allowed. 'The problem is there are certain industries where the government's desire to restrict foreign access conflicts with requirements for capital inflow.' Confusion - an inevitable facet of business in China, where red tape is exacerbated by the pendulum of power between central and provincial governments - notwithstanding, the opportunities offered on both the debt and equity sides are vast. Moreover, bankers and accountants with regular dealings in China report a slow but steady simplification of processes: from a historical standpoint, the wheels of business have never been so well oiled. On the equity side, underwriting and financial advisory work provide the two key streams of income. Since the first B shares - stock held by foreigners in China companies - were launched in 1991 the number of issues has mushroomed. Foreign ownership has been further swollen since the advent of H shares - China shares sold on the Hong Kong stock exchange - last year. Issue sizes range from around HKDollars 100m for a small company in Shanghai or Shenzhen to the HKDollars 3.93bn raised by Maanshan Iron and Steel last October. Not all issues are fully taken up - although so far this has not happened with the H share issues - and the risk to underwriters of being left with a slug of shares is higher than in Hong Kong. Other key difficulties revolve around accounting and legal practices in China, which lag behind international standards and necessitate hefty reworking before bankers or investors can assess the state of a company. Often they discover that a seemingly profitable enterprise is barely breaking even, or vice versa. The absence of a company law (this will be rectified on July 1) also creates problems for foreign investors: it is common practice, for example, for China companies to put a ban on shareholders whose interests fall below a specified level attending general meetings. (This is for practical rather than sinister reasons: the Chinese love of meetings means that 99 per cent of shareholders are likely to turn up.) On the debt side, the biggest opportunities lie in project financing although, as Mr Dennis points out, virtually every area of business is looking for foreign investment - especially as the government is expected to bring back its austerity drive sometime this year, which will dry up domestic lines of credit. 'We have our hands full trying to cope with the investment opportunities offered to us and foreign companies coming in wanting to do joint ventures. But converting those into completed deals as a percentage is fairly small compared with the number that start off as a twinkle in somebody's eye,' he says. Not all projects bear up to full scrutiny, and investors and their advisers spend vast resources on due diligence - checking out the assumptions made by the China side on areas like availability of raw materials and sales. Projects also require different approvals, and securing the go-ahead at one level does not necessarily mean the local ministry, or State Planning Commission, will endorse it. Further, Mr Dennis reckons up to 70 per cent of the projects put to the bank are ruled out as not being cost effective. Nor do China bosses always see eye to eye with their potential investors from overseas. What the former want is investments that bring in foreign exchange and technology, while the latter want projects that are going to sell into China and make lots of money. Virtually all projects are carried out on a pure non-recourse basis, and guarantees tend to come from institutions such as the Bank of China or the state's own foreign investment companies (the 'Itics'). Among the most high profile infrastructure projects are those being undertaken by Hopewell, the Hong Kong property and construction company which last November spun off its power station interests and is also building the Guangzhou-Shenzhen superhighway. The power station projects are on a Build Operate Transfer (BOT) basis, which is proving popular across China. The growing demand for capital, in itself reflective of a market economy in transition, is also a feature of the stage of development under way in India. In the past six months Indian companies raised some USDollars 1.2bn accessing the international capital markets: the USDollars 1bn Videsh Sanchar Nigam is pending. Between April and December last year, USDollars 3bn was raised from the debt markets. According to Mr Udayan Bose, chairman of Credit Capital, an investment bank set up in association with Lazard Brothers, increasing volumes of capital are flowing into India from overseas, reflecting the country's perceived potential. As in China, infrastructure is regarded as one of the biggest opportunities. India is expected to make great strides in these areas in the coming years, often starting from a low base (for instance, only 5.5 people out of every 1,000 have telephones; demand for electricity is growing at 8 per cent per annum; the national highway is estimated to virtually double by the year 2001), creating huge demand for capital. Mr Bose says the eighth Five Year Plan target to create a capacity of 19,800MW should mean an investment of more than USDollars 20bn on power supply alone. On top of this, road systems work is expected to devour USDollars 13bn and the government plans to spend USDollars 13.5bn on telecommunications over the next five years.</p>

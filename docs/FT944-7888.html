			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Prices inch up in France French consumer prices increased by 0.3 per cent in October, giving a relatively stable annualised inflation rate of 1.7 per cent, according to Insee, the national statistics office. The figures confirmed the weakness of inflationary pressures in the economy, despite stronger than expected growth this year. Consumption, however, has remained fragile, with a weakening expected in October's figures. The prices of manufactured products remained unchanged in October, while the index for energy and public sector services declined slightly compared with September. Upward pressure was provided, however, by food prices, which increased by 0.9 per cent month on month. Germany's output of cars and trucks rose by 5.3 per cent last month from a year earlier despite having one less working day, said the VDA German motor industry association. In October, Germany produced 355,400 cars, 14,000 trucks up to six tons, and 9,900 other trucks. Year-on-year inflation in the European Union was 3 per cent last month, according to Eurostat. The provisional figure was unchanged from September and at its lowest level in seven and a half years. The rate was 3.3 per cent in October 1993. The debts of Russia and the former Soviet Union totalled almost Dollars 113bn at the start of the year, according to official figures obtained by Reuters. Soviet debts are put at Dollars 103,940bn and those of Russia at Dollars 8,840bn.</p>

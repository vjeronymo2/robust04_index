			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland urges early Chinese entry to trade body Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday urged a speedy conclusion to negotiations on China's application to resume its Gatt status. Beijing withdrew in 1950, a year after the communists came to power. Mr Sutherland in Beijing for a business seminar said the international community favoured China's early return to Gatt or its successor body, the World Trade Organisation. 'We are very anxious the negotiating process should be pursued speedily, constructively and with a view to finding solutions to any difficulties that may remain,' he said. 'All parties involved in the negotiations have to co-operate to find solutions and bring China into the World Trade Organisation.' Mr Sutherland's remarks in the Chinese capital were clearly aimed at persuading the Americans and the Europeans that the time is ripe for China to resume its Gatt status. They come just weeks before President Clinton is due to rule on whether to extend China's Most Favoured Nation trading status in the US. Denial of MFN would certainly affect Gatt negotiations. Beijing is due to resume bilateral discussions with the Europeans on the Gatt issue late this month and with the US early in June. A meeting of the Gatt 'working party' on China is scheduled to be held in Geneva next month. Gatt negotiators have narrowed discussions on terms for China's entry to such issues as a transitional period during which Beijing would be expected to make further progress towards liberalising its economy. Talks are also focusing on review arrangements to ensure compliance and a safeguards clause to counter Chinese export surges. Mr Long Yongtu, China's chief Gatt negotiator, said it was time for negotiations to be accelerated. It would make no sense for China, which accounts for one-fifth of the world's population and ranks number 11 among trading nations, to be excluded from the WTO when it is formed next year, he said.</p>

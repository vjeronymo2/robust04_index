			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Airline puff Sir, Your survey of business travel ('When smoke gets in passengers' eyes', December 5) contained a small error concerning smoking on aircraft. While in the Middle East recently, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Gulf Air has a no-smoking policy on all intra-Gulf flights  - a great relief after earlier trips in the region where, as you say, some airlines have smoking on the right, no-smoking on the left.

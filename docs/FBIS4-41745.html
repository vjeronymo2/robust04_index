			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin dispelled fears of major foreign corporations about high  risks of investing into Russia and predicted that stability will  last in the country at least until the next presidential  elections in 1996.    Yeltsin told a meeting with major foreign investors on  Tuesday that their fear to work in Russia is "outdated". "The  recent months were the most quiet in political sense during the  whole period of reforms in Russia", the president said and  expressed conviction that stability will continue to dominate.    Only before the presidential elections in 1996 "a certain  political fuss" can occur, he added.    The president underlined that the wave of strikes has gone  down in Russia of late. "Which of your countries has no strikes  at present? There is no such country, only Russia", he said.    Yeltsin welcomed the arrival of major Western businessmen to  Moscow to participate in the work of the Council on Foreign  Investments.    "You can see for yourselves what the situation in Russia  is",  the president said.    The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and heads of such major companies as ABB, BASF,  Citicorp, Coca-Cola, Ernst and Young and others.</p>

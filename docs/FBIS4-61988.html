			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [AZERTADZH report: "Russian State Duma Delegation Headed by </F> Sergey Baburin Visits Azerbaijan"]    [Text] Republic of Azerbaijan President Aliyev received a  Russian State Duma delegation headed by Sergey Baburin,  coordinator of the Russian Way deputy faction, currently  visiting Baku.    The interlocutors spoke in favor of the restoration,  development, and strengthening of Azerbaijani-Russian ties in  all spheres. As the head of the Azerbaijani state put it, the  two peoples are linked by almost two centuries of history, and  their relations are steeped in rich traditions. It is wrong to  discard such a legacy, especially nowadays, when times are so  difficult for both countries. In his opinion, the difficulties  they are encountering can be overcome only by joint efforts.    Regarding the situation of Russians in Azerbaijan, the  president emphasized that they are a component part of society  and full-fledged citizens of the Republic, which is the way it  has been at all times.    According to the Azerbaijani leader, the formation of an  objective opinion of the situation in the region could be helped  by a visit by President of Russia Boris Yeltsin. In this  connection he mentioned that such a proposal had been put  forward to the head of the Russian state.    In turn, Sergey Baburin noted that one of the tasks this  Duma  delegation has set for itself is to sort out what is currently  happening in the conflict zone. In his opinion, A NEGATIVE POINT  IS THE ABSENCE IN RUSSIA OF COMPLETE INFORMATION ON AZERBAIJAN.  "We are ready to assist," he said, "in ensuring that truthful  information reaches politicians both in Russia and in Europe."</p>

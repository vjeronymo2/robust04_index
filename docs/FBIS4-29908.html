			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the Korean Buddhist Federation issued a statement Sunday  denouncing the Japanese authorities' suppression of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans  in Japan.    Noting that the Japanese police on June 6 raided the office  of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and searched  27 spots including houses of officials of the headquarters under  the pretext of "violation of the national land utilization law,"  the statement bitterly denounced it in the name of the entire  Buddhists of the DPRK as a vicious political suppression of  Chongnyon and an open hostile act against the DPRK.    The statement said:    The Koreans in Japan are those who were drafted to Japan by  the Japanese imperialists and forced to backbreaking toils in  the past and their descendants. So they must enjoy special  protection by the Japanese authorities. Far from apologizing to  and compensating the Korean people for their past crimes, the  Japanese authorities are suppressing them. This is a rash act  that can be done only by villains bereft of reason.    We strongly demand the Japanese authorities immediately stop  the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize  for that and sternly punish the criminals.    We hope all the Buddhists of Japan will denounce the  Japanese  authorities' suppression of Chongnyon and express firm  solidarity with Chongnyon in its righteous activities.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Support for workplace healthcare A large minority of Britons would be prepared to pay for medical centres in the workplace, receive drugs by mail order and pay for advice and services from pharmaceuticals companies, a survey says. A MORI poll of 2,017 adults indicated widespread sympathy for alternative ways of delivering healthcare. Ms Joanne Shaw, a healthcare specialist at Boston Consulting, the management consultancy, said: 'The survey results imply that in spite of commonly perceived public mistrust of pharmaceuticals companies, a significant number of people would be prepared to buy care from them directly. 'It also implies that people are prepared to have the kind of care that has been shown to dramatically cut costs. There are examples where computer-aided education for asthmatics dramatically cut hospital admissions.' Respondents were asked about a healthcare practice that is gaining acceptance in the US, in which a pharmaceuticals company offers a range of services such as telephone help lines, free consultations with doctors and free supplies in return for an annual fee. Forty per cent said they would be interested in such a service and 51 per cent not interested. Forty-five per cent said they would rather stay, undergo operations or receive medical assistance at an employer-based centre than at a hospital. Forty-one per cent said they would not. If both the workplace centre and the local hospital were offered, 71 per cent would choose to be treated at work. Asked what they would choose if the employer-based centre asked for a Pounds 30 payment for a visit, 29 per cent said they would still prefer it and 65 per cent said they would not. Mail order of drugs, rather than collection from a pharmacy, was also popular with 41 per cent, who said they would rather have supplies delivered; 38 per cent said they would not. Mail-order drug delivery is a fast-growing part of the US healthcare system. Previous polls have shown a high level of satisfaction with the National Health Service but had not offered alternatives, said Ms Shaw. She added that if allowed, direct communication between drugs companies and patients could lead to 'a demand-led doctor-patient relationship'.</p>

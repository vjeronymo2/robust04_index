			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: Showtime at Aldeburgh with Britten and Weill - Music Aldeburgh's autumn festival is a much more concentrated affair than its big summer sister, an extended weekend of concerts focused upon Britten and his musical relationship with just one other composer. The chosen partner this year was Kurt Weill: four programmes provided comparisons of their orchestral, vocal and instrumental works - the Sinfonia da Requiem set against Weill's Violin Concerto and Second Symphony, Weill's early string quartet paired with Britten's First, and so on as well as concert performances of Brecht and Weill's Threepenny Opera and Happy End. The two composers met just once, in Maine in August 1940, when Britten was at work with Auden on their ballad opera Paul Bunyan and Weill was completing the score of what would be his first Broadway success, Lady in the Dark. Coincidentally it was the time when their styles reached their closest approach, not through any shared European background (though early Britten and European Weill have much more in common than it might seem at first hearing) or their political radicalism, but because of the effect of the American musical on their music. For Britten it was to be only a passing phase (like the spoiled attempt to study with Berg, another tantalising might-have-been), for Weill it had already become the only way forward. Saturday evening's concert at the Maltings offered the most direct opportunities for comparison. Nine numbers from Weill's Knickerbocker Holiday were followed by a selection from Paul Bunyan, and Britten's cabaret songs were mingled with extracts from Johnny Johnson and Lady in the Dark. It was a fascinating piece of programming, full of charming juxtapositions, and wonderful to hear again the music of Bunyan; the Prologue in particular belongs among Britten's most magical creations, a source he was to plunder on several occasions in his subsequent operas. Knickerbocker Holiday may not be so consistently memorable, the extraordinary 'September Song' excepted; it's easy to see why, though, its thinly disguised parable on the dangers to New Deal liberalism fell foul of the conservative lobby. The shards from 'Johnny Johnson', the first of his New York works, woven into the second half seemed instantly fresher and more effective. Only the orchestral dimension was missing. The show songs were given with an accompaniment of two pianos and percussion, inevitably ironing out the differences between Britten's relatively 'straight' scoring and Weill's more idiomatic Broadway sound. The BBC Singers conducted by Simon Joly were the mainstay of the programme, moving between styles with great aplomb and intelligence. The soloists were Angeline Reaux, totally winning in Britten's 'O Tell me the truth about love' and 'Stop all the Clocks' and HK Gruber. Gruber was a curious choice; however admirable he is as a baritone/speaker in his own music and other pieces written for him, his thick Austrian tones seemed out of place here - almost plausible in Knickerbocker Holiday (set among the Dutch colonists of New Amsterdam in the 17th century) but quite wrong for the ballads of Bunyan and not nimble enough for the show songs. A small cavil, though, in what was a thoroughly entertaining and revealing evening. Snape Maltings; sponsored by Audi A European Arts Festival event</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Povilas Gylys, Lithuanian minister of </F> foreign affairs by Romanas Miliauskas: "Let Us Maintain  Civilized Relations"]    [Text] After your last month's visits to the East and  the signing of a package of agreements with Russia, the  East-West balance seems to have been achieved in Lithuania's  foreign policy. Some politicians fear rapprochement with the  great Eastern neighbour. Does this correspond to reality? Is it  right to use the term "balance of interests" in this case?    As is known, politics involves many different aspects:  foreign affairs, diplomatic, economic, cultural, humanistic,  global, ecological, etc. All these aspects as well as  territorial and geographic ones should be balanced. And that is,  in my opinion, the major goal of the present Lithuanian  government. This is not an easy task for a young diplomacy: even  more experienced diplomacies sometimes fail to do it.    Although the opposition tries to deny it, I think we have  already made some progress in this sphere and, primarily, in  reducing political friction with our Eastern neighbours. I mean  first of all Russia: we signed about ten agreements during Mr.  Chernomyrdin's visit to Lithuania. I also have in mind our  relations with Belarus, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. We hope, the  list will be lengthened in future.    We have serious interests in the West as well. We have  discovered there many new things we didn't know before. But I  should say we are also finding the East anew. Previously, we had  quite different relations with the Eastern countries since all  of us were a part of the Soviet system. At present, we are  partners.    During the first year after the restoration of  Lithuania's independence, political motives predominated in our  sphere of interests. At the moment, economic ones seem to have  come to the fore. Is this so?    That's right. At the beginning of my term in office I was  criticized sharply for my emphasis on economic aspects of  foreign policy. I still adhere to my previous opinion. We cannot  neglect economy in politics. Economy is not a dominating factor  in politics but still it plays an important role. I believe  Lithuania's trade and other relations with all political  partners will further strengthen if nothing happens in future.    What do you mean by your last remark?    Unfortunately, the situation on the continent is unstable.  There are several hotbeds of conflict on it.    Didn't you have in mind the economic catastrophe the  rightist opposition sometimes forecasts for Lithuania?    In my opinion, an economic catastrophe could be caused by a  political one in case we decided to resume confrontational  policy in the region. I think we have already finished this kind  of politics, or, to be more precise, we are out of the era of  confrontation. And God forbid to have it back. We should  continue the development of civilized relations among countries.    Lithuania has large emigre communities scattered all  over the world. Could they be the third force in helping us to  overcome a political and economic instability? How better could  we use their assistance in our foreign affairs and  diplomacy?    Yes, there are many Lithuanians abroad. We can meet several  thousand of them even in Siberia. They found themselves there  brought by different causes: deportation, the wish to elude the  past, the search for happiness or the whims of fortune.  Generally speaking, during the three years of our independence,  all the former governments were ineffective in dealing with the  issue of Lithuanian expatriates. To tell the truth, personally I  was surprised to see unskilled, even adventurously-minded people  sometimes with Lithuanian names coming to our country. We were  blind enough to treat them as experts. Now we are more careful.    On the other hand, Lithuanians abroad and their  organizations  should be more helpful in nominating people who could be most  useful to our state. There are many spheres in which Lithuania  lacks experience,for instance, international business relations.  There are educated and experienced people among emigrants who  could assist us in working more effectively with the World Bank,  GATT, the European Community and other worldwide organizations.  To find such people is one of our most important tasks. We will  use our embassies in solving this problem. We expect Lithuanian  communities abroad to be critical and strict in nominating such  specialists.    The new year of 1994 is approaching. May we hope, that  it will be more successful to Lithuanian's diplomacy?    If we succeed in maintaining stability in Lithuania and if  the international situation is peaceful, Lithuanian diplomacy  will be able to advance in firmer steps. We will be more  secure...    In relations with our neighbours as well?    Of course. In the near future, we shall resume negotiations  with Poland which were broken off because of elections and  formation of the new government there. We are ready to be  active. On the whole, I dare evaluate the current international  situation positively. The Russian Army has left Lithuania and a  psychological atmosphere with our neighbours is friendly. This  creates favourable preconditions for economic and other  relations.    Thank you for your time.</p>

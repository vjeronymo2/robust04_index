			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> No Pre-Fab Here: A Florida lawyer has come across some 50-year-old blueprints  for a never-built home by late architecture giant Frank Lloyd Wright and hopes  to build the cottage in Fort Lauderdale. "It's the only tropical house that  (Wright) ever designed," Jon Krupnick said.  </P> <P> Wright's two-bedroom, one-bath house has a circular, two-story living room and  an upstairs screened-in balcony.  </P> <P> She's Familiar With the Case: Eleven years ago, Sally Frank, then a Princeton  University undergraduate, challenged the males-only policies of some of the Ivy  League college's exclusive eating clubs. The dispute was unresolved when Frank  graduated, and dragged on as she attended law school and passed the bar. Today,  she is scheduled to argue her own case before the New Jersey Supreme Court.  Lawyers for the Tiger and Ivy clubs argue that the groups are purely private.  But Frank argues that "Princeton depends on the clubs to feed its students and  to provide a social life. The clubs depend on Princeton for their members."  </P> <P> Testing the Waters: Convicted Iran Contra figure Oliver L. North is trying to  find funds to support his leadership of a new conservative organization called  the Freedom Alliance. In a letter from Washington, D.C., the former Marine said  he is soliciting funds for "a strong national defense . . . traditional values"  and countering "the left-wing-dominated national media."  </P> <P> Making Ends Meet: Who are the poorest members of Congress? Roll Call, Capitol  Hill's newspaper, is writing about them in the upcoming issue, using the same  financial reports all members must file. Sen. Joe Biden came in as the poorest  lawmaker with a negative worth of $166,500, Roll Call Editor Jim Glassman said  Sunday. The rest of the 10 poorest are Reps. Mike Andrews, Bob Davis, Dick  Armey, Barney Frank, Charles Hatcher, Conrad Burns, Nick Mavroules, Mickey  Edwards and Gus Savage.  </P></p>
